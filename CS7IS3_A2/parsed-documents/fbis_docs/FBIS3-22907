Against all expectations, Nabil Shritah, third secretary of the Syrian Embassy in the German Democratic Republic and resident of one of the Syrian intelligence services, has decided to testify in court, even though his performance can hardly be called that. [see item LD0702161994 in previous Terrorism report for initial reporting on Shritah's testimony] Hidden behind two folding screens and surrounded by bodyguards, he played out a wonderful soap opera: eulogies to his homeland in the Middle East, which has had very good relations with the FRG for more than six years, as he said. Syria is "combatting terrorism" and there are "certain circles" that are again linking Syria with terrorism to disturb relations, the "witness" claimed. Who the "certain circles" are remained in the dark, or more precisely: darkened. Shritah, who stored weapons, passports, and explosives in his embassy room at Otto-Grotewohl Street 3 and in his private apartment for the Carlos group, described his responsible duties as a diplomat very prosaically: He just invited other diplomats for coffee, opened the door, and watched for telexes on Sundays and holidays. After all, he was not "the Embassy chieftain." Carlos, his wife Magdalena from Ulm, and his assistant Johannes Weinrich came to him, because he should buy them some goods in the diplomats' commissary. Shritah's comments on the matter at hand were of a similar quality, insofar as he made any statements at all. When Voigt's lawyers asked about the details of Shritah's sudden appearance in the FRG shortly before the opening of the main trial, he pleaded his privilege to decline to answer questions. Otherwise, he would have had to answer a few unpleasant questions, for instance about a Syrian fighter at the invisible frontline, called Tawas Taham. Taham, who has lived in West Berlin for many years, is considered to be the Syrian intelligence service's liaison with the RAF [Red Army Faction]. He organized a lawyer for Shritah (his own), when the latter came into conflict with FRG law in February 1982. Shritah was in prison in West Berlin for 14 days and had to pay a fine of 5,000 German marks [DM]. Meanwhile, three versions of the diplomat's crime have emerged: smuggling cigarettes (MfS file), tax evasion (Shritah), smuggling arms and explosives (report by an unofficial MfS employee). How Saul Turned Into Paul The latter report contains the interesting piece of information that there was a West German-Syrian deal in connection with the criminal procedure: the release of three Germans in Syria in return for a mild sentence and a cover up of the unfriendly act. Tawas Taham once again altruistically cared for the imprisoned Shritah. During the first interrogation by the State Protection Office on 9 January 1994, Shritah urgently asked that his stay in Bonn not be revealed to the Syrian Embassy, because he would incriminate Syria. Therefore, he also wanted to request political asylum in the FRG. The next day Tawas Taham called Shritah in Moabit prison, visited him, and provided Nicolas Becker as his lawyer. Then Shritah had a telephone conversation in Arabic with his wife in Damascus. On 11 January he even asked for a visit by a Syrian Embassy employee, who quickly appeared on 12 January, and on 13 January Saul had turned into Paul. Shritah had his Damascus experience [sentence as published]. He said that Syria had had nothing at all to do with the bomb attack on the French Consulate General, and he had come voluntarily and privately to Budapest and Berlin. The reward for the successful coup arrived by return mail: Shritah was released from detention pending trial "subject to conditions," despite the pending procedure for aiding and abetting murder and aiding and abetting a dangerous bomb attack. Silence of the Grave Surrounds the Late Abul Hakkam Exactly the same accusations are made against Helmut Voigt, who has been in prison since 6 September 1992 because of them. The unequal treatment goes even further, because, while intelligence service man Voigt is presented as an "MfS perpetrator," Shritah emerges as an "MfS victim." This became clear in connection with Shritah's file at the Gauck office. The MfS knew about the men behind the Syrian and about his contacts and, therefore, it had a file about him; Shritah was a "target for investigation," his "movements" were documented, unofficial employees were asked about him, and there was intensive monitoring. All this now elevates him, because Mr. Ziem of the Gauck Office pointed out that his is a "victim's file" and Shritah must give approval so that others can read it. To make it clear once again: Nabil Shritah is strongly suspected of having been essentially involved in the terrorist attack on the Maison de France! However, there is still another figure in the game, who, strangely enough, is mentioned only by Voigt and his lawyers: Hassan Saleh Ali, who called himself Abul Hakkam. Forty years old at the time of the bomb attack, born in Aden (Yemen), according to his passport, he turned up in the GDR with a diplomatic passport issued by the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Nr. 002 906. In addition, he also had a Syrian diplomatic passport, Nr. 2387/79, for the name Mohamad Bitar, which said that he was born in Homs (Syria). He was in fact the number two after Carlos in the group, not Johannes Weinrich from Brakel, the former pioneer of the Revolutionary Cells in the FRG. Abul Hakkam had influence on the uncontrolled and unpredictable Carlos, and constantly traveled between Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Switzerland, the CSSR, Hungary, and the GDR. After a meeting between Carlos, Hakkam, and other Syrian intelligence agents in Damascus in February 1980, the Carlos group got weapons and passports, and the ambassadors in East Berlin, Prague, Sofia, and Budapest were ordered to help and support the owners of the passports as much as possible. The code phrase was: "I come from Abul Hakkam." On 16 August 1983, nine days before the attack, Abul Hakkam once again entered the GDR, announced by the Hungarian intelligence service. On 20 August, also previously announced, a Lebanese, who called himself Achmed Muhamad el-Sibai, arrived and, naturally, presented a diplomatic passport at Schoenefeld Airport as well as a letter to the Syrian ambassador. On the day of the attack both crossed the Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse border checkpoint on foot without luggage and returned after the attack, one shortly after the other. Who brought the explosives to West Berlin and -- above all -- what kind of explosives? In the Syrian Embassy there were several packages with large amounts of TNT, C4, and plastic explosive. And why is there neither an arrest warrant nor a request for extradition covering Abul Hakkam? Why does the name Hakkam not appear in the "Carlos" biography by Stephan Richard Meyer? No Traces and a Meager Motive Meyer is the son of Dr. Richard Meyer, formerly head of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and an employee of the Federal Intelligence Office, who was still in office at the time of the attack. The book is based on insider knowledge and files, including MfS files. Was Abul Hakkam the agent of FRG services in the Carlos group? No one will be able to ask El-Sibai about his role in the terrorism attack anymore. The Berlin court has received a death certificate from Lebanon, according to which the man was shot dead in the al-Bi'qa Valley in the 1980's because of espionage.... Judges, public prosecutors, the defendant, and his lawyers insist on the "Magdalena Kopp" motive for the attack. I cannot understand that the highly intelligent Helmut Voigt believes in the sentimental story about the attempt to get Carlos's lover, who was in prison in France, released by blackmail. Or is his restraint some sort of protection for his life and health after imprisonment? Why were the Syrians so intensively involved in the bomb attack, which had to hit both the French and the Germans? To which extent is Rifat al-'Asad, the brother of the Syrian president, involved in the surrounding events? Rifat had close contacts with France, he often stayed in Berlin, and he was also involved in the French-Syrian talks about Magdalena Kopp in the Paris Interior Ministry. Colonel Rifat was the head of an independent elite unit (Saraju d-Difah) with its own heavy weapons and its own intelligence service -- a brutal, unscrupulous man, who is responsible for the bloody massacres on the Muslim Brethren in 1980-82. Since Syria suffered from a constant lack of money, because it afforded itself a disproportionately inflated military sector, Rifat solved the financial problem in his own way: by smuggling and with the help of dollars earned through drug dealing. With the millions gained from the sale of the famous "Golden Lebanese" from the hemp fields in the al-Bi'qa Valley he paid his troops and his patrons. Rifat wanted to grab power in Syria, which has been ruled by his brother, Air Force General Hafiz al-'Asad, since 1970. The al-'Asads are members of the Shi'ite 'Alawi sect, whose members were held in contempt as heretics during the 400 years of Turkish rule and have always been considered non-Muslims by the Sunnites. During the period of the Mandate, the French gave the 'Alawi, who had been kept away from public life for centuries, just like the Druze and the "heterodox" Christians, the right to enter the military forces. After Syria became independent on 14 April 1946, the power-hungry 'Alawi quickly rose to leading political and military positions. One must also mention that Syria, with 12 million inhabitants, "affords" itself four intelligence services! When Hafiz al-'Asad fell sick in 1982-83, the power struggle began. Rifat looked for supporters at home and abroad and tried to stage a coup when his brother's health deteriorated dramatically at the end of 1983. Did he make specific offers to the French, which were rejected? Or did General Ali Duba, the head of the Syrian military intelligence service and Carlos's friend, want to warn France against collaboration with the hated usurper? Together with the chief of general staff, the defense minister, and other leading military officers, Duba opposed Rifat, which led even to armed conflicts between the rivaling troop units. When Hafiz al-'Asad recovered, Rifat was temporarily "banned" to Moscow; from there he defected to Paris via Geneva. In November 1984 he was permitted to return "home to Damascus" and became vice president. Too Many Questions Without Answers The struggle for power in Syria could be one of the possible reasons for the Syrian involvement in the attack on the Maison de France. The trial at the 29th Criminal Division of the Berlin Court will not be able to clarify the origins and the motives of the attack. This is not the fault of the judges' honest efforts to clarify the events and to understand the structures of intelligence service work. The requests by the joint plaintiff to summon the then French and Italian embassy councillors in the GDR and ask them who told them about the forthcoming attack, remain just so much wastepaper. It will also not be possible to ask why the Frenchman speaks of two dead, while officially only one death was reported. No representatives of the German and French intelligence services will appear in front of Judge Hueller and Senior Public Prosecutor Mehlis and will have to accept the question of why the FRG and France also acted as a transit and resting area for the Carlos group. And the fact that neither traces of the explosives nor traces of smoke were found at the site of the bomb attack, will probably lead to speculations not just among those who observe the trial, when they think of Nabil Shritah's words: "Relations between Syria and the FRG are characterized by mutual respect and benefit; there is an exchange at all levels." Syria -- this means refuge and care for terrorists, such as Carlos, Weinrich, Abu-Nidal, Abu-Dawud, Abu-Iyad, Abu-Musa, Wadi Haddad, George Habash...
