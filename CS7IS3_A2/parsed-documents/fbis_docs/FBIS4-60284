Nobody was hurt in the incident. The Israeli contractor who drove the car told our correspondent Nisim Qeynan that he did not stop at the Palestinian roadblock because he wanted to be checked only at the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] roadblock. He claims that the soldiers manning the IDF roadblock ordered him to return to the Palestinian roadblock for inspection. The fire was directed at his car as he was driving back toward that roadblock.
