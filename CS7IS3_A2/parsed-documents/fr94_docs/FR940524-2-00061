FR940524-2-00061 FR940524-2-00038 [Investigation No. 332&hyph;354] U.S. Schedule of Services Commitments AGENCY: United States International Trade Commission. ACTION: Institution of investigation. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 13, 1994. SUMMARY: Following receipt of a request on April 18, 1994, from the United States Trade Representative (USTR), the Commission instituted investigation No. 332&hyph;354, U.S. Schedule of Services Commitments, under section 332(g) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332(g)) for the purpose of compiling and maintaining the official U.S. Schedule of Services Commitments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Information specific to the investigation may be obtained from Mr. Norman McLennan (202&hyph;205&hyph;3440) or Mr. Richard Brown (202&hyph;205&hyph;3438). For information on the legal aspects of this investigation, contact Mr. William Gearhart of the Commission's Office of the General Counsel (202&hyph;205&hyph;3091). Hearing impaired individuals are advised that information on this matter can be obtained by contacting the TDD terminal on 202&hyph;205&hyph;1810. BACKGROUND: In his letter the USTR requested that the Commission initiate an ongoing program to compile and maintain the United States Schedule of Services Commitments. As stated in the letter, the establishment of such a schedule is required by the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), negotiated as part of the recently completed GATT Uruguay Round of multilateral trade agreements. The GATS provides for the establishment of national schedules of commitments, wherein signatory countries set forth their respective national commitments pertaining to specific service sectors. These schedules bind countries to maintain a minimum level of market access and to a national treatment obligation. In addition, GATS also provides for a broad most-favored-nation (MFN) obligation, unless nations provide a list of exceptions for MFN treatment. The schedules and MFN exceptions provide the basis for efforts to further liberalize international trade in services. The letter requested that the Commission (1) compile an initial U.S. Schedule reflecting the final services commitments made in the Uruguay Round; and (2) work with USTR to update the U.S. Schedule, as necessary, to reflect all future commitments resulting from the post-Uruguay Round negotiations on financial, telecommunication, and maritime services, and future bilateral and multilateral services negotiations undertaken by USTR. The USTR requested that the Commission compile an initial U.S. Schedule by January 1, 1995. Issued: May 16, 1994. By order of the Commission. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary.
