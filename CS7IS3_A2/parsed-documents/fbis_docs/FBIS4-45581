The demonstrations are being held against the presence of militia forces which have been stationed in the area for the last two years. A large protest rally was held yesterday with hundreds of tribals holding black flags and chanting slogans against the government and the administration. The demonstrators say that the presence of the militia has affected their lives and, therefore, they should leave the area. The demonstrators warned that the situation might become worse if the militia is not called off from the area within two months. The demonstrators claimed that the government promised to give them attractive incentives for alternative crops to poppy cultivation. But it has failed to fulfill that promise so far they claimed and threatened to resume poppy cultivation on a large-scale if incentives are not offered by September 1994.
