According to judicial sources, the witnesses had already testified but their version of the incident is confusing. It was added that Israel Vasquez, a driver, had said the Salvadoran bodyguard's death occurred as a result of an attack by robbers. National Civilian Police sources indicated U.S. Major Ismael Lopez shot his bodyguard and killed him, later abandoning him inside the vehicle. The case has caused a controversy among the various government agencies because the U.S. military officer was illegally taken out of the country to Panama.
