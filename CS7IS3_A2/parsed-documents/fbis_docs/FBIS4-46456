These are replacing those removed from duty earlier in strict conformity with international agreements. The regiment commanded by Colonel Vladimir Kashkin is stationed in Yoshkar-Ola. It entered combat alert duty on April 19. Our correspondents report on this event. Division commander Major-General Musa Tsechoyev relates that this is not the first rearmament in the 30-year history of the formation, which is now armed with RS-12 (SS-13) and RS-12M (SS-25) missiles. But this one is a special event, since it is taking place in difficult times for the country. The new regiment was formed almost two years ago. It was manned partly with servicemen who had come from Belarus and Ukraine. There was much work to do. They had to get set up. The combat position required was a new one, but there were no funds to speak of. "We are working in debt today," said the chief of the UNR [Directorate of the Chief of Operations], Colonel Aleksandr Katyukhin, "we have taken on two billion in debt at the bank." The missile troops themselves took up the shovels, but the main thing was to learn the hardware that they would be receiving. The three-month practice at the proving ground at Mirnyy was a real test. It concluded with a special tactical exercise that was rated as "good." The president and head of the government of the Republic of Mariy El, Vladislav Zotin, and the assistant commander-in-chief of the RVSN for indoctrination, Major-General Nikolay Moroz, visited the formation on the day they went onto combat alert duty. The president answered a question about what the attitude of the strategic missile troops to the republic is by saying, "Most respectful. We have good, businesslike relations." The first to enter combat alert duty along with the commander were Lieutenant-Colonel Anatoliy Nazarov, Majors Aleksandr Dubovik, Aleksandr Bolgarskiy, Captain Aleksandr Rudkin, Senior Lieutenant Igor Bachev, Warrant Officer Elvira Volkova... They possibly did not think that their taking of their combat posts would go down in history. It was no accident that Deputy Regimental Commander Lieutenant-Colonel Vitaliy Lezhanin distributed historic information on the Guards Red Banner Akhtyr-Aleksandriya Orders of Kutuzov and Bogdan Khmelnitskiy Regiment to the correspondents--a large portion of the officers from the reinforcements had served in it. This had been a Hussar regiment at one time under the command of Denis Davydov, in which Lermontov and Alyabev had served... The unit also won honor in the Great Patriotic War. Its battle standard and orders are now in the Central Museum of the Armed Forces. "For some reason," the missile troops puzzled, "we are easily able to part with legendary history, and are creating a new regiment. It is as if we are starting with a clean slate." It would perhaps be fair to preserve the honored name for the new, Topol regiment, for which everything lies ahead.
