In other words, the electronic optical tracing device which was developed in the United States has many problems, including a defective sight adjuster while firing. It was also learned that our Navy's P-3C antisubmarine control aircraft project, too, which is scaled at 620 billion won, had to pay the U.S. manufacturing company $93 million to recover its discontinued production line. The production line was already discontinued when the project was initiated. At that time our authorities failed to confirm if the company had discontinued the production line because they lacked the capability of collecting sufficient information on the U.S. company. These facts were revealed in an "Inspection White Paper" released by the Ministry of National Defense [MND] on 31 May after inspecting eight ongoing projects, including the antisubmarine control aircraft project and the Sangmu project, from January to March this year. It is the first time that the MND released the results of its special inspection of these projects under the Yulgok Project in the form of a white paper. This white paper was released in accordance with the promise that Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae made at the time of the MND's initiation of the special inspection. In the case of the antisubmarine control aircraft project, the white paper indicated that our side had to pay the U.S. Lockheed Company, the P-3C antisubmarine control aircraft's manufacturing company, extra money to recovering its already suspended production line, thereby resulting in wasting our budget. The white paper revealed that the U.S. Lockheed Company had announced the suspension of the production of antisubmarine control aircraft in 1990. Our side had to submit itself to the burden of paying money to recover the suspended production line. This was because our authorities concerned lacked the capability of collecting information.
