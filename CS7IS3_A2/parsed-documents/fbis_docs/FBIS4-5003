There, they met with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata and asked the Foreign Ministry to make efforts for an early return of Naha port facilities (Naha Military Port). Oyadomari said: "To attain the goal, which is included in the third Okinawa development program, of attracting 5 million tourists to Okinawa, it is necessary to improve port facilities." Hata showed his understanding of the purpose of the request. However, referring to the Japan-U.S. security pact, he said: "The government needs to look for an appropriate site where the functions of the port will be moved. While taking this into consideration, we will study measures." Oyadomari said: "The return of Naha Military Port was agreed upon at a Japan-U.S. Joint Committee meeting in 1974 on condition that the Japanese Government provides a site where the functions of the port will be moved. But regrettably, this agreement has not yet been carried out." Noting that Okinawa heavily depends on revenue from tourism, Oyadomari also said: "In the third development program, Okinawa has set the goal of attracting 5 million tourists to Okinawa by enhancing its industrial economy. But this goal will not be attained unless the port facilities are improved. I hope the port will be returned as early as possible." Director General Uehara, who also attended the meeting, said: "The Japan-U.S. Joint Committee needs to discuss specific measures (for the return of the port) at an early date. I think the people in mainland will also welcome the return of military bases on Okinawa, particularly Naha Military Port." Uehara then asked Hata to visit Okinawa.
