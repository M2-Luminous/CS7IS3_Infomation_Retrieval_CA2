FR940303-0-00005 FR940303-0-00002 There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges and 125 handlers of Valencia oranges who are subject to regulation under the respective marketing order and approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges and 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel and Valencia oranges may be classified as small entities. This rule finalizes two changes in the reporting requirements prescribed under the California-Arizona orange marketing orders. This rule suspends language in the orders and in the orders' rules and regulations to discontinue the use of Form 8 (Certificate of Assignment of Allotment) and Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). These changes were unanimously recommended by the committees. An interim final rule on this issue was published in the Federal Register (59 FR 1268, January 10, 1994), with an effective date of January 10, 1994. That rule suspended §§907.58, 907.71, 908.58, and 908.71 of the orders, and §§907.112, 907.141, 908.112, and 908.141 of the rules and regulations in effect under the orders. That rule provided a 30-day comment period which ended February 9, 1994. No comments were received. Sections 907.58 and 908.58 of the navel and Valencia orange marketing orders specify that, for the handling of oranges other than by rail car (primarily truck shipments), handlers issue to the consignee an assignment of allotment certificate covering each quantity of oranges so handled. Sections 907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit such information on Form 8. Handlers are also required to segregate the information on Form 8 by size of oranges shipped and destination (i.e., U.S. and Alaska or Canada). Since the inception of the orders, the committees have utilized Form 8 primarily for tracking and verifying truck shipments of oranges that were subject to volume regulation. However, with the volume regulation features of the orders suspended (58 FR 53,114; October 14, 1993), the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8 creates an additional burden on handlers that is unnecessary. According to the committees, many handlers have long questioned the value of Form 8 (commonly referred to in the industry as ``the daily truck ticket'') during periods of no volume regulation. Shipment information from Form 8 is transferred to Form 4 (Weekly Report). Handlers maintain their own manifest records of these shipments and, without weekly volume regulation, Form 4 provides similar data with the exception of number of cartons shipped by size. The committees plan on requesting size information from handlers as needed on a voluntary basis and anticipate revising the weekly Form 4 at a later time to provide for the collection of size information. Thus, the committees believe that continued submission of Form 8, particularly during periods of no volume regulation, is not necessary. Accordingly, the committees have recommended suspending §§907.58 and 908.58 of the orders and §§907.112 and 908.112 of the orders' rules and regulations so that Form 8 will be discontinued. The second change that the committees recommended concerns Form 3 (Daily Manifest Report of Oranges Subject to Allotment). Currently, §§907.71 and 908.71 of the orange orders provide that handlers furnish to the committees information regarding cartons of oranges handled, segregated by size, within 24 hours of shipment. Handlers must also indicate whether the shipments were destined to points in the U.S. and Alaska or Canada. Sections 907.141 and 908.141 of the orders' rules and regulations require handlers to submit this information for rail car shipments on Form 3.
