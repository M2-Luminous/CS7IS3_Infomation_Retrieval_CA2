FR940613-0-00063 FR940613-0-00015 (4) Subject to subjective factors other than the vehicle or load itself, such as driver knowledge of cargo, (5) Subject to varying interpretation, and (6) In reality, a restatement of the initial economic criterion that was deleted from this latest rulemaking *␣*␣*␣. The members of the Specialized Carriers & Rigging Association (SCRA) often move loads that would qualify as nondivisible by any definition. The SCRA noted that the definition proposed by the SNPRM explained expert knowledge as familiarity with procedures required to dismantle and reassemble a load which are ``beyond the job requirements typically associated with positions in the motor carrier industry.'' The Association argued that because highly specialized skills are typically associated with positions in its segment of the motor carrier industry, the definition would make it impossible for special carriers and riggers to obtain nondivisible load permits. The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities also commented that ``expert knowledge'' means very different things in different parts of the industry. It concluded that ``(s)ome further work needs to be done on this definition.'' The Caltrans commented that, ``(w)hatever definition is finally promulgated, Caltrans is totally opposed to the provisions concerning expert knowledge and specially designed tools.'' FHWA Response: The FHWA agrees that a test based on ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' is too complicated and ambiguous to be effective. It has therefore been replaced with a test based on the time required to divide a load. This general approach was suggested by the Oregon DOT in response to the NPRM. The full definition adopted by this rule is as follows: Nondivisible load or vehicle. (1) As used in this part, ``nondivisible'' means any load or vehicle exceeding applicable length or weight limits which, if separated into smaller loads or vehicles, would: (i) Compromise the intended use of the vehicle, i.e., make it unable to perform the function for which it was intended; (ii) Destroy the value of the load or vehicle, i.e., make it unusable for its intended purpose; or (iii) Require more than 8 workhours to dismantle using appropriate equipment. The applicant for a nondivisible load permit has the burden of proof as to the number of workhours required to dismantle the load. (2) A State may treat emergency response vehicles and casks designed and used for the transport of spent nuclear materials as nondivisible vehicles or loads. The first two tests proposed in the SNPRM, and adopted here as paragraphs (1)(i) and (1)(ii), have elicited little comment and no controversy. These standards are appropriate but very stringent. The FHWA believes there are loads that could be divided without literally destroying their value, but only after unreasonable delay and expense to the shipper and motor carrier; the States should be allowed to issue nondivisible load permits in those cases. As the Pennsylvania DOT recognized, this is essentially an ``economic criterion.'' Our earlier proposals to codify this idea would have allowed nondivisible load permits if dismantling the load imposed ``significant additional costs on the shipper or motor carrier'' (NPRM) or required ``expert knowledge or specially designed tools'' (SNPRM). The final rule uses 8 workhours, i.e., a full working day, as a proxy for nondivisibility. The number of workhours required by the rule is the same no matter how many people are involved; for example, if one person working 8 hours, 2 people working 4 hours each, or 4 people working 2 hours apiece, could not dismantle the load, it would be nondivisible. Most loads that require more than one full workday to dismantle, using appropriate equipment, probably were not designed to be taken apart after leaving the factory. We believe Congress intended to allow the use of nondivisible load permits for cargoes which are theoretically divisible, but so tightly integrated that they cannot be dismantled without excessive cost and delay. On the other hand, the definition sets a standard high enough to keep easily divided overweight machinery and equipment off the highway. The definition adopted today as paragraph (1)(iii) is more objective than that proposed in the NPRM and less confusing than the amended version included in the SNPRM. It remains complex, however, and disagreements between enforcement officers, motor carriers, and shippers are likely. The rule does not specify how State officials are to determine the length of time required to break down a given load. Manufacturers may sometimes provide the necessary information. The motor carrier itself may have reliable data if it has previously dismantled such cargoes. The rule does not require a carrier or shipper to demonstrate that a given load cannot be broken down in less than 8 workhours, but it would not prohibit a State from requiring such a demonstration either. Enforcement officials may be able to work out other reliable methods in cooperation with motor carriers. Paragraph (1)(iii) requires that ``appropriate equipment'' be used in an effort to dismantle a cargo. The number of workers involved and the type of equipment used will depend on the load to be moved. A State is not required to grant a permit in any case, and it would certainly be reasonable to deny a permit to a carrier or shipper which makes a perfunctory or deliberately inadequate effort to dismantle a load within 8 workhours.
