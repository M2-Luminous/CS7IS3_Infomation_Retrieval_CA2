FR941007-0-00051 FR941007-0-00014 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dick Thomas, Region 6 Authorization Coordinator, Grants and Authorization Section (6H-HS), RCRA Programs Branch, USEPA Region 6, First Interstate Bank Tower at Fountain Place, 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202, (214) 665&hyph;8528. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA or the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6926(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR 124, 260 through 268, and 270. B. Oklahoma Oklahoma initially received Final Authorization on January 10, 1985, (see 49 FR 50362) to implement its base hazardous waste management program. Oklahoma received authorization for revisions to its program on June 18, 1990 (see 55 FR 14280), November 27, 1990 (see 55 FR 39274), June 3, 1991 (see 56 FR 13411), and November 19, 1991 (see 56 FR 47675). The authorized Oklahoma RCRA program was incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations effective December 13, 1993. On August 3, 1994, Oklahoma submitted a final complete program revision application for additional program approvals. Today, Oklahoma is seeking approval of its program revision in accordance with §271.21(b)(3). Statutory authority is provided by the Oklahoma Hazardous Waste Management Act, as amended, 27A Oklahoma Statute (O.S.) Supplement 1993, §§2&hyph;7&hyph;101 et seq. The Act was amended May 28, 1993, and is expected to be amended this legislative session by Senate Bills 832 and 997. Pursuant to this Act, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) adopted by reference the Rules and Regulations for Hazardous Waste Management, Oklahoma Department of Health (ODH) Bulletin 0525, as amended on October 5, 1992. The Environmental Quality Board adopted these rules by reference and without amendment, under the emergency rulemaking procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act, 75 O. S. Supp. 1992 §§250 et seq. The Governor signed the emergency rulemaking action with an effective date of July 1, 1993. On November 24, 1993, the Environmental Quality Board adopted permanent rules, Oklahoma Administrative Code (OAC) Title 252 Chapter 200 (Rules) with an effective date of May 26, 1994. The Rules are a slightly modified version of the former rules which were adopted by reference from ODH Bulletin 0525. Modifications include changing references of Oklahoma State Department of Health to the Department of Environmental Quality, Commissioner of Health to Executive Director, 310:270 to 252:200, and references of former statutory authority to present statutory authority. Substantive changes are found in former OAC 310:270&hyph;11&hyph;2 ``County Commissioner Involvement In Permit Issuance'', Tables 1, 2, and 3.B, dealing with fees, and Subchapter 17, which addresses tax credits.
