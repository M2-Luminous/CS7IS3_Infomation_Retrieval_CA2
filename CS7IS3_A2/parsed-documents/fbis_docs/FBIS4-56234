[Reina] I believe that we have been working hard, both in the cabinet and in all institutions. [Bonilla] Eng. Mario Reina, economic and legal adviser to President Reina's government, says that the executive machinery has already taken off even though many disagree. [Reina] I say yes; I cannot understand how anyone can say that it has not taken off. There are many things to deal with and the various commissions at various levels are doing just that. [Bonilla] There is strong criticism of the liberal government's economic cabinet headed by Juan Ferrera at the Finance and Public Credit Ministry, Delmer Urbizo Panting at the Economy and Commerce Ministry, and Hugo Noe Pino at the Central Bank of Honduras, and appointed [as heard] by Eng. Mario Reina. You claim, however, that the economic cabinet is the one that works the hardest. [Reina] I believe that the economic cabinet works the hardest. As you know we were left in a desperate situation, with a large deficit. All previous programs are under review and this has been the economic cabinet's main task up to now. [Bonilla] People say that these officials do not fulfill their job requirements? [Reina] I do not think so. What has happened, as in the case of Juan errera, is that everyone is trying to determine how to stretch funds to pay all the pending debts. This poses a serious problem for him. In fact, because he is a serious person he is trying to do things right. [Bonilla] What about restructuring the economic cabinet? [Reina] Perfection is very difficult, of course, but I do not believe there is reason for a change, and it is working hard. [Bonilla] What about deregulating fuel prices? [Reina] Prices are deregulated so that they reach their market price. If international prices go up then prices in Honduras have to go up as well, otherwise fuel suppliers would have serious problems. This is what has been deregulated, and now some suppliers want the government to regulate prices. This is absurd because they were the first ones to ask that they be allowed to set their own profit levels. [Bonilla] What about the hunger strike declared by members of the Civic-Popular Committee to protest the draft? [Reina] A commission of jurists is making an in-depth study of this case, which is very delicate because it means a change to the Constitution, a constitutional reform. This strike is also in support of the government and the president, because I imagine they want to raise the awareness of the deputies for this change. I believe that this draft bill will be presented to Congress by Tuesday. From what the president has discussed up to now with the deputies and other branches of government, I believe that they are all aware that the Constitution should be reformed. [Bonilla] Does Congress President Carlos Flores agree? [Reina] Up to now he has also agreed. [Bonilla] As economic adviser to the liberal administration you are considered by fellow party members, friends, and relatives as the boss of the Reina Idiaquez clan. You retired from private banking to work full time as adviser to the government of your brother, Carlos Roberto Reina. I understand that once in a while you slap him on the wrist if he fails to coordinate something in the best interests of the Honduran people. Is this true? [Reina] No, I have never had a need to admonish him. We have always worked in agreement. My work with my brother has generally been in an advisory role. [Bonilla] Are you retiring from private banking to give full time advice to your brother? [Reina] No, no. I am already retired, therefore I have the time to be at my brother's side, such as I am doing now.
