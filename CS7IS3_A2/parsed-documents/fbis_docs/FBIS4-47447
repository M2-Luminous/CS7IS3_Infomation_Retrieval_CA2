A Cardio 80 computer (Contron) was used to analyze the neurons' activity and to plot poststimulation histograms. The rats' somatic afferent nerves were stimulated by measured squeezing of the skin on the foot of their rear extremity. Their pelvic afferent nerves were stimulated by blowing into a thin-walled envelope that had been inserted into their rectums and into the distal sections of their sigmoid colons. Both types of stimulation were accomplished by devices permitting digital control of the duration and intensity of stimulation. During the experiments the rats were anesthetized with chloralose, immobilized with Flaxedil, and kept warm (their esophageal temperature was kept at 37�C, and the pCO[.sub]2[/] of their expired air was maintained at 3.5-4 volume percent). When a rat's arterial pressure dropped below 80/50 mm Hg, the experiment was halted. The following drugs were administered to the rats: morphine (10[.sup]-6[/] to 10[.sup]-5[/] M), DAGO [expansion not given] (5 x 10[.sup]-7[/] to 10[.sup]-6[/] M), D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline (10[.sup]-6[/] to 10[.sup]-5[/] M), dalargin (10[.sup]-6[/] to 10[.sup]-5[/] M), U-50488H (10[.sup]-4[/] M), dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] (10[.sup]-4[/] M), and naloxone. The �-opiate receptor agonists morphine and DAGO and the �-opiate receptors D-Pen[.sup]2[/]- and D-Pen[.sup]5[/]-enkephaline and dalargin suppressed the bioelectric activity of the convergent neurons of the dorsal horns of the rats' spines. The suppressive effects of all of the drugs were found to be concentration dependent and sensitive to naloxone. When the aforesaid drugs were locally applied to the spine, they suppressed reactions to somatic nociceptive stimulation more strongly than they suppressed reactions to visceral stimulation. When injected intravenously, morphine had an identical effect on suppression of both types of stimulation. Ligands of the _ch_-opiate receptors U-50488H and dynorphine[.sub]1-17[/] were not found to have any statistically significant effect on the bioelectric activity of the convergent neurons of the rear horn of the spine.
