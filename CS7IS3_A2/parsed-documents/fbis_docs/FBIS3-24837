The peace blueprint is a major joint initiative, planning for which took place in conjunction with African National Congress [ANC] President Nelson Mandela and the Transitional Executive Council. It involves the withdrawal of the SA Police's Internal Stability Division [ISD] and its replacement with a contingent of SA Defence Force [SADF] troops. In a statement, Mr de Klerk said 80 percent of all deaths due to political violence in the country in the past eight months had taken place on the East Rand. Socio-economic conditions were desperate and people lived in daily fear of losing their lives. Mr de Klerk announced the formation of a task group to be headed by the former head of the SA Air Force, Gen Jan van Loggerenberg. The task group would be responsible for initiatives to restore and upgrade community services, to establish stability, to assist persons displaced from their homes and to restore sound administration. "The first task that we all face is the urgent need to re- establish stability in the East Rand. Failure to do so will amount to callous disregard of the misery of almost one million South Africans. It will also have negative consequences for the prospect of a free and fair election in April. I have accordingly instructed the deployment of the SADF in the area with immediate effect. This will correspond with the withdrawal of the ISD from the area as well as creating the conditions necessary for an increased role for the SAP [South African Police] within a framework of community-oriented policing," Mr de Klerk said. "Special efforts will be made to achieve improved relations between the SAP and the community," he said. "There have already been signals from affected communities that the SADF will be recognised for its role and, accordingly, welcomed into the community." However, he warned the initiatives would take some time to bear fruit. "It must be clearly stated that it will not be possible to undertake and implement all the above in the immediate and short-term period. Many of these programmes will require a much longer time frame for their successful implementation. While much can and will be done to immediately improve the daily lives of the residents, there is no quick fix for the East Rand. "At the same time this plan is aimed at rapidly bringing stability, hope and confidence to the people ravaged by violence and instilling confidence in the future." Mr de Klerk said the task group would interact with different socio-economic upliftment forums.
