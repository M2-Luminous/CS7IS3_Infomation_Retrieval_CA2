On the one hand the republics which succeeded from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were recognized, and on the other, the Serbs were not granted the right to self-determination, the leader of the largest opposition party in Russia said at a rally in the center of Vukovar. "The West must be punished for this and Russia will do its utmost to have the war criminals punished," Zhirinovskiy said at a news conference held in the partially rebuilt Danube Hotel after the rally. Amid an ovation from several thousand people of Vukovar, the guest of the Serb Democratic Party of all Serbian lands promised that "the great Russia will be the protector of all Serbs" and spoke about the "creation of a joint Slav state from Vladivostok to Knin." "The era is behind us, once and for all, when the Serbian people, who heroically fought for their own survival and the survival of all [eastern] Orthodox peoples, were punished. If a single bomb falls on a Serb town, that will mean a declaration of war on Russia and that will be the time when we will have all debts paid to us," Zhirinovskiy said. The leader of the party which won the largest number of votes at the elections in Russia on 12 December said that a Russian battalion is already fighting in the RSK and that, "if need be, whole divisions and even a whole army will come." He wished the Serbs the strength to persist in their just struggle for their homes where they have lived for centuries. In reply to a reporter's question, Zhirinovskiy said that his party stands for Russia with the borders of the former USSR, but only by peaceful means. He recalled that Georgia, Azerbaijan, and some other former USSR republics have already expressed a desire to return to the joint state, primarily for economic reasons. The citizens of Vukovar were also addressed by RSK President Milan Martic, who said that the Serbian people "got only disappointment from Russia, while waiting for the great Orthodox spirit to reawaken." "And it is being reawoken in the person of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who is a guarantor for us that in the future we will have a great protector in the world", Martic said, and added that "Vukovar and the RSK will never be Croatian again."
