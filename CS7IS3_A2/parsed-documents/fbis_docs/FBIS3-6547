FBIS3-6547 "dreas053__a94001" FBIS-EAS-94-053-A Document Type:Daily Report 18 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Trade Friction With U.S. Over Markets Analyzed OW1703133194 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1703133194 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese, on page 5 of its 8 March, 9 March, 10 March, 11 March, and 12 March morning editions, carries a five-part series entitled "Is the Japanese Market Open?" with each article averaging approximately 1,000 words. The first article on 8 March, an unattributed piece subtitled "Automobile and Auto Parts -- Reasons American-Built Automobiles Are Not Sold In Japan and the Gap Between Japan and the United States," deals with Japan-U.S. friction over automobiles and auto parts. Noting that the U.S. Government has decided to revive the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act, thus heightening Japan-U.S. trade frictions, the article states it has looked into the actual situation of the "closed Japanese market" pointed out by the United States. The article cites remarks by Harold Poling, chairman of Ford Motor Company: "In the balance of trade between Japan and the United States, the ratio of automobile and auto parts is overwhelmingly great; it is necessary to take decisive and concrete action to address the imbalance in the trade of automobile and auto parts between the two countries." The article adds the "trade imbalance between Japan and the United States in the automobile and auto parts sector is certainly great." Stating that last year Japan exported $23.77 billion worth of automobiles to the United States, accounting for 21.9 percent of its total exports to that country, while importing $1.125 billion worth of American-built automobiles, the article points out that "Japan's imports of American-built cars in 1993 were merely 2.0 percent of the total imports from that country." The article continues by saying that as examples of the closure of the Japanese market, the Big Three cite: "1) the clear existence of dealer keiretsu [interlocking corporate grouping] and traditionally exclusionist business practices; 2) Japan's peculiar stereotyped certification system; and 3) the imposition of various discriminatory taxes on large automobiles as well as the pervasiveness of closed deals, with the importance placed on keiretsu." The article adds "Japanese auto manufacturers also complain about the complexity of Japan's standard for certification." The article states that Japanese auto manufacturers refute their complaints, claiming: "In Japan, they can freely obtain their dealership in principle; it is good if they organize their own sales networks in Japan as we have done in other nations. The standard for certification and the tax system are common in Japan, the United States, and Europe. The share of European-built cars is about 4 percent in Japan and the United States, and that percentage has not changed greatly. This is evidence there is no difference between the openness of the Japanese and American auto markets." As reasons why American-built automobiles are not sold in Japan, the article cites the following: "1) Approximately 80 percent of automobiles are sold for less than 3 million yen on the Japanese market. They are small automobiles with an engine displacement of less than 2,000CC [cubic centimeters], while most American-built cars are highly-priced large automobiles with an engine displacement of 3,000CC; 2) Most European-built automobiles are right-hand drive, but only a few American-built automobiles are right-hand drive; and 3) European auto manufacturers have spent heavily on the construction of their own car inspection centers before exporting their automobiles, but American auto manufacturers have made little efforts to that end." The article also points out: "While the defective rate of Japanese-made auto parts is three or five in one million, that of American-made auto parts is 250 in one million. American auto-parts manufacturers have failed to meet the supply date on many occasions." Noting that efforts on both sides have little by little generated the effect of addressing the imbalance, and that it is certain the imbalance has begun addressing itself, the article states: "Both Japan and the United States are urged to accumulate sober efforts instead of being locked in emotional confrontations." The second article on 9 March, an unattributed piece subtitled "Telecommunications Equipment -- The U.S. Demands Guaranteed Results," discusses Japan-U.S. friction over telecommunications equipment. Stating that final negotiations on the issue of opening the Japanese mobile phone market are being held between Japan and the United States, the article notes the wide differences between the two countries over the interpretation of the term "equal market access" which is incorporated into the preamble of the 1989 Japan-U.S. Telecommunications Agreement. Discussing the differences, the article says while the U.S. trade representative claims "the Motorola-type mobile phone operation is not given the same market access to relay stations as the NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation]-type mobile phone operation enjoys, the Post and Telecommunications Ministry [PTM] contends `equal market access' refers only to a general theory. The Japan Mobile Communications Corporation [known as IDO] has assigned frequencies to the Motorola-type mobile phone operation. What remains to be done regards the question of business, and the government cannot intervene in business." The article also notes that the construction of relay stations for the Motorola-type mobile phone operation lags behind that of relay stations for the NTT-type mobile phone operation. While the NTT-type mobile phone operation have 310,000 subscribers, the Motorola-type mobile phone operation has a little over 10,000 subscribers, triggering fresh friction between Japan and the United States over the share of the Motorola-type mobile phone operation in the Japanese mobile phone market. The article states that in bilateral negotiations on government procurement under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States asked Japan to make NTT subject to the accord on the government procurement, with the "apparent aim of opening the way for a result-based orientation which is aimed at raising the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market to the level of foreign goods in the rest of the G-7 markets." A senior PTM official states: "Moves by the United States are aimed at expanding its access to the Japanese market in the high-tech sector--in which it has the upper hand--by driving a wedge in the Japan telecommunications market which is expected to rapidly grow in the multimedia age." The article adds: "Japan is denying U.S. charges that the Japanese market is closed, citing the growing number of telecommunications companies in which foreign firms hold more than 20 percent of their capital." It goes on to concede: "There are many regulations in the Japanese telecommunications market, and this makes it hard to freely engage in the telecommunications business in Japan. Japanese manufacturers also are complaining about the situation." A major commercial electric appliance manufacturer is quoted as saying: "It is urgent for Japan to relax these regulations in order to avert trade friction with its trade partners and to bolster Japan's international competitiveness." Stressing that if Japan fails to keep its regulations from hindering the development of telecommunications technology, it will be criticized for keeping its telecommunications market closed and for crippling Japan's future high technology. The third article on 10 March, an unattributed piece subtitled "The Government Procurement of Supercomputers -- The United States Still Distrusts Japan's Reform of Tender System," views Japan-U.S. friction over government procurements. After a review by the Information Center at Tsukuba University on the disputes between Japan and the United States over the bidding for supercomputers, the article states: "The Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers has become a symbol of high-tech friction between Japan and the United States." Stating that the government has already decided in this year's supplementary budget to procure 11 supercomputers--six American-built and five Japanese-built supercomputers--through biddings, the article notes that "so far 80 percent of the government's procurement of supercomputers has been Japanese-built." By the government procuring six American-built supercomputers, the United States feels that "given our technological power, it is a matter of course for the Japanese Government to procure our supercomputers." Discussing the dispute between Japan and the United States over the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers, the article states: "While the United States thinks the Japanese Government attaches importance to prices in its procurement of supercomputers and gives Japanese firms information on biddings, Japan contends that American supercomputer manufacturers are unable to gain access to Japan's supercomputer market because of the high competitiveness held by Japanese supercomputer manufacturers." It adds that American supercomputer manufacturers, who control more than 60 percent of the world market, have complained about their inability to display their competitiveness in the Japanese supercomputer market. Michiro Naruto, assistant director of Fujitsu Ltd, is quoted as saying: "Foreign-built supercomputers have been kept out of the U.S. Government procurement market for security reasons. Not a single Japanese-built supercomputer has been sold on the market." The article further states that despite Japan's amendment of procedures for government procurement of supercomputers, as well as its adoption of a comprehensive appraisal system, the United States still complains about the way the Japanese Government procures supercomputers. Pointing out that in testimony before Congress on 8 March, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor cited supercomputers as an item indicative of the closure of the Japanese market, hinting at the possibility of the United States applying the Super 301 provision to supercomputers, the article responds by saying the United States points to the incompleteness of Japanese reform regarding the way the government procures supercomputers; dumping by Japanese supercomputer manufacturers still remains unchanged. It says: "Japanese supercomputer manufacturers acknowledge dumping." Also stressed is the fact that the "Japan-U.S. friction over the Japanese Government's procurement of supercomputers stems not from the lack of transparency of the tender system, but from the differences between Japanese and American management style." It notes that "it has become difficult for the two countries to find clues to defusing their friction." The fourth article on 11 March, an unattributed piece subtitled "Plate Glass Products -- After-Contract Discount Abolished," deals with the friction between Japan and the United States over plate glass products. Noting that "three major Japanese glass manufacturers--Asahi Glass Company, Nippon Sheet Glass Company, and Central Glass Company--control about 90 percent of the Japanese glass market, and that the ratio of imported glass on the market is less than 10 percent," the article says the United States has continued to criticize Japan, claiming that "special agents, the pervasive keiretsu in distribution channels, and the lack of transparency of business practices in Japan have kept foreign-made glass out of the Japan's glass market." Reporting that the three major Japanese glass manufacturers have announced plans not to comply with any demands from construction firms for after-contract discounts [a business practice under which glass manufacturers comply with demands from construction firms for discounting glass prices from their purchase contracts after they complete the construction of their buildings] in a bid to increase the lack of transparency of glass prices, the article stresses that the "three major Japanese glass manufacturers have abolished after-contract discounts so American firms can easily understand competition in Japan." Yasuhiko Furukawa, assistant director of Asahi Glass Company, is quoted as saying: "Japanese glass manufacturers have done what is necessary to open the Japanese glass market. What remains to be done is for American firms to make the effort." A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry shows "three-fourth of glass wholesalers that do not deal in imported glass have never received offers from foreign glass makers." The article adds: "It is true that in Japan importance is placed on long-term, stable deals." Touching on Japan-U.S. friction over paper products, Toru Yoshino, managing director of Shinoshi Paper Company, is quoted as saying: "American corporations have failed to properly deal with port strikes, and poorly respond to the Japanese market as regards aspects of supply." The article notes: "It would be very difficult for both Japan and the United States to find areas of agreement to settle their friction over paper products." The fifth and final article on 12 March, an unattributed piece subtitled "Insurance -- Japan Is In the Red," details Japan-U.S. friction over insurance. Noting that insurance is a sector in which Japan runs a large deficit with the United States, the article cites 1990 U.S. statistics showing that while Japan paid the United States $583 million in insurance transactions, the United States paid Japan $156 million. The question is raised of why the insurance sector became a priority sector for discussion in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. An unnamed official in an insurance firm is quoted as saying: "A major American insurance group, which has a close relationship with President Clinton, has lobbied the U.S. Government. The American Insurance Group is the only American insurance corporation unhappy with the Japanese Government." The article notes that in his testimony before Congress, Josef Molay [name as published], representative of the U.S. Insurance Association, touched on the closure of the Japanese insurance market, stressing: "The American financial service sector is the fastest growing sector. It maintains 77 percent of its workers on the job, and creates 90 percent of new jobs, while generating 70 percent of the gross domestic production (GDP). The sector also accounts for one-third of U.S. exports." Against the backdrop of its competitiveness, the United States stuck to the last to its demand for holding negotiations on the financial service sector in the Uruguay Round. Pointing out that the United States has highly appraised Japan for working for an amendment to the Insurance Business Law and for relaxing regulations, the article states: "It is true the government's full protection and use of keiretsu by Japanese insurance companies for their insurance transactions are major barriers for foreign-affiliated insurance companies in Japan." A government source is quoted as saying: "With the exception of the numerical targets issue, the two nations can strike a deal in the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks." The article adds: "The United States views the Japanese market as closed and not transparent. This is one of reasons for the United States' sticking to its demand for numerical targets." The article concludes by saying Japan is reacting against the U.S. view, asserting that "the Japanese insurance market is open, and there are many problems with the U.S. insurance market."
