Regional wars are being zealously fought. Russia is divided between weak reform forces and revisionism regarding that disastrous end to claims of being a world power. Ukraine, whose concessions on the nuclear weapons issue were triumphantly announced by Clinton, is a victim: It is giving in to Russian pressure in the form of rationing energy supplies. NATO is not assuming any more security guarantees. Partnership for Peace can be viewed as an achievement on the part of the alliance or a Russian success, depending on one's point of view, location, and proximity or distance to the east. The indications are that the Serbs will be victorious in Bosnia. The West is growing weary of the conflict. There is an antipathy toward all the "parties to the conflict"; those who know best say that they are all unreasonable. No one asks who is to blame for the war. Habsburg's resignation is apparent among the Central Europeans that Clinton met in Prague. Bosnia and the West is a warning sign. There was no discussion of expanding NATO to the north at the meeting of the alliance. Yalta is being recalled in Finland, to which Zhirinovskiy has already laid claim. Let us assume that the country wants to become a NATO peace partner and -- U.S. Defense Secretary Aspin talked of "self-selection" [preceding word in English] -- opts for the offer of joint maneuvers. How would the Russians react, like Yeltsin overshadowed by the radicals? Would they protest (Finland has a border with Russia that is 1,300 kilometers long) and what would the West do? The Baltic states remain under pressure, and Poland, for the sake of which Britain declared war in 1939 but did not intervene, is disappointed. Slovakia was not mentioned as an example among the countries to which partnership has been offered. In Moscow, Clinton will be asked what the treaties that could be concluded with NATO would mean in operational terms. Yeltsin cannot -- this is to be assumed -- tolerate what would even be a harmless move closer to NATO, except if Moscow were to join in and could drill on the territory of its former satellites once again. As Russia has had success with its objections, it will shortly seek to obtain further successes with the detailed definition of the new partnership arrangements. The question that arises is to what extent is there sufficient determination and unity not only to "open up" the alliance eastward -- those are just word games -- but also to draw the East into Western security structures. If American policy -- as would seem to be the case -- is geared toward doing "everything possible" for the beleaguered Yeltsin, it must allow itself to be dictated "almost everything" by the patient, who can point to the consequences for his health every time the West becomes agitated. His generals and radicals might recommend a security vacuum in East Central and northern Europe for medical reasons. Can the West -- with its premises -- deal with that? If Clinton has set a course, it does not apply to the European states between the alliance and Russia but to the Russians and the West Europeans. In Brussels, the president provided a first answer to the questions: Will the United States remain a leading power in Europe? Will it continue to be in a position -- politically and militarily -- to provide the resources for such a commitment? After a year as a president preoccupied with domestic matters, Clinton has opted for: Yes, the Americans will remain; they will remain with 100,000 men. They are, as Clinton said, "naturally also" a reserve for the event of crises close to Europe (forward deployment). However, they are in Europe. Moscow will understand that correctly: The Soviet Union had to abandon its forward positions, but the United States does not have to. There has to be a difference in rank. That, of course, does not mean that the U.S. policy on Europe has been thoroughly thought out. Such commitments depend on the internal situation in a country more than ever before. It also depends on the personality of the president himself. Bush wanted to lead, and for that reason he was skeptical about the WEU -- a European organization whose military significance was zero. With Clinton, it was possible to easily reach an agreement: If the WEU wants to do something some day, it can use certain NATO command centers. Please do it, go ahead -- there is something ironic about this consensus. The Americans will remain militarily present in Germany. That is important for the insecure country. At the same time, the result of the NATO conference -- "partnership" -- is not as much a victory as a semi-defeat for the German side. The U.S. concept restricts Germany's room for maneuver in its policy toward the East. EU [European Union] limits are being followed by NATO limits. Perhaps, the German Government does not want to function without such restrictions. Ruehe was quite alone in thinking about a Germany surrounded solely by NATO states ("friends") and in speaking out in favor of expanding the alliance and its security guarantees. As effectively the strongest alliance state in Europe, Germany would have greatly gained in influence. The significance is obvious: The eastern part of Central Europe is a neighboring region and the security vacuum already starts on the territory of the former GDR. The issue is about interests. Ruehe was considered wrong. Ruehe is not Kohl, and Kohl does not necessarily support Ruehe and his bolder concept for Central Europe.
