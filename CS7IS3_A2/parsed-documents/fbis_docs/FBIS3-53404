However, he announced that "for our part, we will continue to fight the occupying invaders under the leadership of our guardian 'Ali Khamene'i." He rejected "any settlement that leads to a peace with the enemy at the expense of our religion, holy places, and land, as we cannot relinquish our pride." He added: "We will fight with all available means the microbe that has penetrated our body. We reject settlement, which abolishes the identity of our Palestinian kinfolk and their right of return." He said that "the blood of our martyrs, the sacrifices of the young men of the Islamic resistance, and our kinfolk's steadfastness in Jabal 'Amil and west al-Biqa' and our unity will enable us to keep the jihad banner high and will help President Hafiz al-Asad in Geneva to confront the leader of world arrogance (U.S. President Bill) Clinton." Concluding, he said "we have no doubt at all that the results (of the Geneva summit) will be in the interests of our glorious nation, because Syria has proved its real commitment to liberating all our usurped land as well as its complete care for the mujahidin defending our territory and scared land."
