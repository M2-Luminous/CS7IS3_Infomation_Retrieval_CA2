They have increased by 20 percent to 15.4 billion schillings. In contrast, U.S. exports to Austria rose by only 6.2 percent to 24.8 billion schillings in 1993. This resulted in a reduction of Austria's deficit in the bilateral trade balance by 1.1 billion schillings to 9.4 billion schillings. Benno Koch, Austria's trade delegate in New York, says this development is largely due to the changes in the exchange rate. As he explained in a discussion with Austrian journalists, the strengthening of the dollar made it easier for Austrian exporters to get access to the market. About half of the increase can be considered to be due to the exchange rate, Koch pointed out. Last year Austrian exports also got more strongly involved in the U.S. market. The recovery of the U.S. economy, while other important sales markets stagnated or suffered from recession, has made the United States once again a tempting target for intensified efforts. For 1993 Koch noted particularly marked export increases in the fields of chemical products (plus 27.8 percent), processed goods (plus 22.8 percent), as well as machinery and vehicles (plus 18 percent). Together, these three fields amounted to almost three-quarters of Austria's overall exports to the United States. [passage omitted] Last year Austrian direct investments in the United States, which had declined by about $100 million to $387 million in 1992, also seem to have recovered. In total, about 340 Austrian companies currently are represented with branch offices in the United States, and 10 to 15 percent of them have their own production facilities. Focal areas are North and South Carolina.
