The agreement will barely affect consumer prices, it claims. According to the BEUC, the future World Trade Organization (WTO) will have urgent work to do regarding international rules on competition and the environment. At a press conference, BEUC President Jim Murray pointed out that his organization has always been in favor of the GATT agreement. "However, some parts of the agreement are not as good as we would have liked," he said. Indeed, he believes that the GATT agreement does not go far enough, especially in the agricultural and textile sectors. Consumers will also continue to pay too much for their food when the agreement has taken effect. After all, the price reductions in which the agreement will result will go no further than the reductions already generated by the reform of the EU's common agricultural policy. In addition, the BEUC claim that subsidized exports of agricultural produce will continue, despite all the damaging consequences this will have for world trade. The BEUC fear that taxes may go up if the pressure on the EU agricultural budget is maintained. Moreover, the GATT provisions regarding clothing and textiles do not meet expectations, according to the BEUC. The Multifiber Arrangement that offers the industrialized nations the possibility of imposing quotas on imports of specific textile products from developing countries, must be abolished within the next 10 years. The BEUC maintain that this will result in trade in sensitive textile products only being liberalized after that period has elapsed. Consequently, 50 percent of the textile trade will continue to be subject to restrictions until 2005. The Consumers' Unions fear that the product standards elaborated in the GATT agreement will lead to less stringent standards being implemented in many countries. The BEUC also assert that the developing countries are receiving precious little in exchange for the agreement on intellectual property. The agreement on services will, the BEUC claim, barely have any repercussions for consumers. The BEUC are satisfied that the WTO is being set up. However, the WTO will have to do everything within its power to ensure that environmental and trade-related concerns are integrated better. International agreements on the environment must be able to compare with GATT rules, the BEUC say. At the same time, the WTO will have to ensure that there is greater transparency in decisionmaking procedures. However, clear rules for international competition are also required. The WTO will have to draw these up and implement them. In this context, the BEUC are thinking of, say, an international approach to dealing with export cartels.
