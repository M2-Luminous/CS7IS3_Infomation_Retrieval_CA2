In the interview, which was held in a Bratislava cafe on 21 June, Svechota responds to an interview given by Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic and chairman of the National Democratic Party, to the 17 June issue of the East Slovak regional daily SLOVENSKY VYCHOD, claiming that a private firm run by Svechota was acting as an "information and intelligence agency" for former Prime Minister Meciar. In the interview, Svechota asserts that he does not know anything about the existence of such a firm. He tells the interviewer that he is a partner in only two private firms, one "dealing with agricultural production on restituted land in the Dunajska Streda district" and the other a building firm, which, however, "does not engage in any activity and does not have even one koruna of turnover or profit." Asked how the suspicion of his involvement in such a firm could arise, Svechota says: "It may have its origin in Czech dailies, where a report appeared that I was behind Vladimir Meciar's intelligence service. It is a fabrication. I am engaged in neither intelligence nor shadowing people." Svechota also denies that he has engaged in any such activity at any time since leaving the Ministry of Interior. Asked about Cernak's possible motives for his assertions in the SLOVENSKY VYCHOD interview, Svechota says: "We could find a reply to this if we analyzed Mr. Cernak's contacts and ascertained from where he might have such findings. But I really do not know what his motives are." Pressed by the interviewer to say what he means by Cernak's "contacts," Svechota then says: "I would not want to go into detail." In conclusion, Svechota announces that he is going to sue both the publisher of SLOVENSKY VYCHOD and Cernak.
