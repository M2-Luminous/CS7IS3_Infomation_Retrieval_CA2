These achievements are: (1) Dual-use (military/civilian) radiation-resistant optical fiber and fiber optic cable; (2) Dual-use wire-guided high-strength/toughness fiber optic cable; (3) Longitudinal hermetically sealed leak-resistant fiber optic cable, with a technical performance approaching late-eighties international standards; (4) Wired optical waveguide connectors for dense-water single-fiber single-mode fiber optic cable, particularly suited to communications with offshore oil and gas fields; (5) Dual-use fiber-optic-sensing high-voltage isolation modules; (6) SD-optical modems, with wavelength-division-multiplexing and frequency-division-multiplexing (FDM) functions, ideal for optical fiber data transmission systems and single-fiber multiplexed video PFM [pulse-frequency modulated] FDM transmission systems.
