At the beginning of the meeting, Weizman said that he chose to pay his first official visit abroad to Turkey and he is very pleased about it. Weizman pointed out that there are many common points between the two countries -- both governed by a parliamentary democracy -- and noted that secularism is one them. He said that there have been occasional ups and downs in the Middle East peace process, adding that we have now reached a hopeful phase. Turkey is a great country which could significantly contribute to this process, Weizman stressed. In his statement, Cindoruk declared that Weizman's positive thoughts reconfirm his peaceful character. Cindoruk welcomed the steps taken for a lasting peace in the region, in response to the desire for peace. Cindoruk expressed the hope that the area, which turned into an illegal entity, will in the future become a region of tranquillity, in which democracy -- the concept of a state -- and border discipline prevail. He said that ending terrorism -- which is an extension of the Cold War -- in this region will constitute a very important step in securing world and regional peace. Like all democratic parliaments in the world, the TGNA is waiting for and supports the implementation of the recent declaration of principles, Cindoruk remarked. He also expressed his conviction that archaic methods, which are difficult to explain or comprehend, will never be utilized in this region again. Later, the talks between the two delegations continued in camera.
