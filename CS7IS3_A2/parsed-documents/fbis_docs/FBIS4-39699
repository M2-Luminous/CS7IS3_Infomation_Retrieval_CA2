Russia, which was granted the status of permanent observer at the OAS in 1992, comes out in favour of "in-depth dialogue with American states sharing common democratic values and the striving for security and peace", the document emphasised. The economic reforms experience gained in Latin American countries can be of much benefit to Russia. There are real prerequisites for broader trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation between Russia and countries in the region. The establishment of contacts in the field of advanced technology, in space research and the uses of nuclear energy, in particular, can be of great importance, the document pointed out. In his speech Mamedov also stressed the importance of cooperative action in combating drug trafficking. The OAS, which brings together the United States, Canada, and 32 Latin American countries, was founded in 1948 and is the most widely-representative and authoritative hemispheric organisation.
