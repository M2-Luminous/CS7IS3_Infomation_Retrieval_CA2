Panov, who was until recently the Russian Ambassador in South Korea and for whom the present post was somewhat a surprise, sees his main task in promoting confidence in the relationships between Russia and Japan. Panov has said that relations with Japan are a key priority of the Russian foreign policy determined by Russian President Yeltsin. During his last year's visit to Tokyo the two sides fixed the top priorities of Russian foreign policies towards Tokyo. I do not see what is to be changed so much to deviate radically from our course, said the diplomat. Speaking about the territorial problem in the Russian- Japanese relations, Panov has said that everyone in Russia seems to know about its existence. The problem does exist but joint forces are needed to search and find the way out, he said.
