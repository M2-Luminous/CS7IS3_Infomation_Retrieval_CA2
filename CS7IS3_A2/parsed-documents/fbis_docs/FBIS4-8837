The E.U. condemns the Bosnian Serbs' continuing attacks on Gorazde, assessing this as a U.N. Security Council resolution violation, and urges an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gorazde and around it, a statement released by the council said, and that Serb forces which are threatening the security of Gorazde withdraw. This will enable the deployment of U.N. troops in the town itself between the two warring sides, said the statement. The Bosnian Serb authorities reported on Monday that Serb forces would remain outside the 3-km zone on the left bank of the Drina near Gorazde and were willing to agree to the immediate deployment of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops there. Bosnian Serb military sources have said that Moslem forces on the front around Gorazde renewed attacks on Serb positions early on Monday morning, firing from mortars placed in the center of the town, and heavy machine-guns located in the high-rise residence of the UNPROFOR. Bosnian Serb Assembly President Momilo Krajisnik on Monday denied claims that Serb forces were shelling Gorazde and trying to take the town, underscoring that the Serb side had ceased all military activities around Gorazde. Gorazde was to have been demilitarized long ago as a U.N. designated "safe haven," but, instead of demilitarization, more than 10,000 Moslem troops concentrated in this enclave and launched a heavy offensive on Serb territories in late March. The Bosnian Serb army strongly answered the attacks. The Ministerial Council statement set out that a ceasefire agreement on Gorazde should be closely followed by a general ceasefire agreement for all of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which would again be an opening to talks on a political solution. The E.U. calls on all those nations which promised additional forces to secure their arrival in Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as possible. The E.U. ministers also called on greater diplomatic efforts by the international community, including the U.N., E.U., U.S. and Russia, to step up diplomatic actions to secure the convergence of their initiatives and lead as soon as possible to talks between the three warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats. The statement said that all captured U.N. staff should be released immediately, and that unlimited and unhindered freedom of movement should be enabled in agreement with U.N. resolutions. Humanitarian efforts and free passage through Serb territory for humanitarian convoys for Gorazde and elswehere in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be renewed, it was underscored. The Bosnian Serb authorities said on Monday that they would guarantee freedom of movement to all humanitarian workers in its entire territory and police units will escort all convoys for their security. The E.U. called on all its members who are also members of the U.N. Security Council, to support the adoption, without delay, of a resolution in support of the listed objectives.
