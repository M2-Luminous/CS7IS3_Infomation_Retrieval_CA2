Set up in the southern side of the lobby are a statistics counter and a legal documents counter manned with 20 workers and equipped with seven computer terminals. When the bell rang for the session to start in the hall's main auditorium, the desks had provided services for more than 100 deputies. The two data service counters were set up by the State Statistical Bureau and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee. The first has a data bank of rural social and economic statistics of China's 2,300 counties (cities), and the latter a data bank of state laws and decrees, international business conventions, and the market practices and norms of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and France. This is the third year that such services have been provided for NPC deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, according to Jin Zhaofeng, an official of the State Statistical Bureau. During last year's session, he said, about 1,000 deputies obtained data from the services. Deputies have become increasingly eager to get information, he said. The service counters are expected to serve more deputies during the current session than before, he said, basing his prediction on his first day's experience. Deputies are more selective about data than before, he said, and their selection reflects their concerns. For example, he said, many deputies asked for statistics concerning economic gaps between China's east and west, income disparities between southern China and northern provinces and such hot issues as China's growing migrating population of rural laborers seeking jobs. Li Yangkai, a deputy from Liaoning Province and a senior engineer of an excavator plant, was satisfied with information he obtained about patent rights. "This is exactly what I want," he said. Tong Meijun, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and a research fellow of the economic and technological center of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, has visited the law-decree counter several times. She said she wanted to collect relevant laws and regulations of developed countries, which will serve as reference when her enterprise is transformed into a joint-stock company. A deputy from Hunan Province said the services are valuable since many bills and suggestions to be raised by deputies involve legal issues. Some journalists covering the session, including reporters from Hong Kong and Macao and foreign correspondents, also collected information from the counters.
