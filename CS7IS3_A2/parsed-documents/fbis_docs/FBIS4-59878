At his press conference in Oslo today, 'Arafat said that the holy war, jihad, is a religious term and that with this word he meant a peaceful campaign. [Begin 'Arafat recording, in English] What I had mentioned exactly, a religious terminology. Jihad, for your information, I will continue my jihad to achieve peace. [end recording] [Correspondent Johan Fredriksson] Well, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is of the opinion that he has been misinterpreted. The Israeli Radio had obtained a tape from a meeting in South Africa two weeks ago. Israeli Radio broadcast this tape and it created concern in peace efforts. Yasir 'Arafat used the Arabic word jihad, a holy war, but the statement was just part of religious terminology and what 'Arafat meant was a sort of peaceful crusade for the Palestinian cause, he said. And thus he and the Norwegian mediators were of the opinion that the new threat against the ongoing peace process was alleviated. As a confirmation of this, Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres appeared quite unexpectedly at the news conference in Oslo and then even 'Arafat was surprised. Shim'on Peres said he was satisfied that Yasir 'Arafat has confirmed his and his organization's commitment to the peace process in the Middle East. This is Johan Fredriksson, Oslo.
