His Royal Highness Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, the foreign minister of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and head of the Ministerial Council's current session, chaired the meeting which was attended by all its members -- His Excellency Rashid Bin-Abdallah al-Na'imi, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates [UAE]; His Excellency Shaykh Khaled Bin-'Abdallah Al Khalifah, Bahrain's housing minister; His Excellency Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al Thani, the foreign minister of the State of Qatar; and His Excellency Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jabir Al Sabah, first deputy prime minister and the foreign minister of the State of Kuwait. The Ministerial Council studied the new regional developments and developments in the Gulf in the light of the Iraqi regime's lack of compliance with all international commitments imposed by Security Council resolutions related to its aggression, continuing procrastination, its pick-and-choose treatment of those resolutions, pursuit of a hostile policy toward the State of Kuwait, its continuing formation of a threat to GCC security and stability, and continuous attempts to split the cohesiveness of international legitimacy. The council also studied the Iraqi nonimplementation of the UN Security Council resolutions related to Kuwait, its attempts to evade its international commitments concerning the Kuwaiti issue, its persistent repetition of expansionist claims on Kuwait, its claims against Kuwaiti sovereignty, its threats to Kuwaiti independence, and its cease-fire violations. In this context, the council recalled the GCC Supreme Council's emphasis, in its 14th session, that respecting the sovereignty and independence of Kuwait, as it came in the second paragraph of Resolution 687, and the international borders of Kuwait, as ratified by UN Security Council resolution No. 833, represent the essence of the commitments specified in Resolution No. 687, and that their nonimplementation represents a violation of the essence of that resolution. As it welcomed the resolution adopted recently by the UN Security Council to continue the international sanctions against Iraq because of its nonimplementation of the UN Security Council resolutions related to its aggression against Kuwait, the GCC Council expresses its satisfaction with the understanding shown by the UN Security Council members of the aggressive policy of the Iraqi regime and their insistence on the necessity for Iraq to respect the sovereignty of Kuwait and sanctity of its territories. The council appeals to the international community to continue its pressures on the Iraqi regime in order to make it stop its aggressive behavior and to submit completely to all the UN Security Council resolutions related to Resolution No. 687, particularly those related to recognizing the international borders between the two countries, releasing the Kuwaiti and other prisoners of war and detainees, the payment of compensations, and a commitment not to commit or support any terrorist or sabotage action. The council emphasizes its complete commitment to Iraqi unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and expresses its sympathy with the fraternal Iraqi people against the human suffering for which the Iraqi regime is fully responsible because of its refusal to implement the UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 that deal with the Iraqi needs of food and medicine. The council also reviewed the new developments in the relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and reiterated its firm stance of supporting the UAE and its sovereignty on the three islands of Abu Musa, the Greater Tunb, and the Lesser Tunb. The council also reiterates its absolute support to all the peaceful measures and means adopted by the UAE to restore its sovereignty over its islands. It expresses hope that Iran would comply with the call of His Highness Shaykh Zayid Bin Sultan al Nuhayyan, president of the UAE, with regard to the holding of a direct dialogue between the UAE and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the latter's occupation of the three islands belonging to the UAE. The Council condemns the noticeable escalation by Iranian media and its media campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during March 1994 and its allegations, according to which the Kingdom is obstructing the Iranian pilgrims. It expresses full support for the measures that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has adopted to enable pilgrims to perform the duty of pilgrimage in comfort and tranquility, in accordance with the teachings of the pure Islamic tradition and the resolution of the foreign ministers of the Islamic states in their meeting in Amman, Jordan, during March 1988. The Ministerial Council followed the developments in the Middle East peace process and in the occupied territories and expresses in this respect its great anxiety about the deterioration of the security situation and living conditions in the occupied Arab territories. It holds Israel fully responsible for the increase in the number of people killed among the sons of the fraternal Palestinian people, in a way that is in contradiction with the spirit of the peace process and represents a violation of the fourth Geneva Agreement. In this respect also, the Council condemns Israel for the massacre carried out by the Israeli settlers against worshipers in Ibrahim's Mosque [Hebron]. It calls on the UN Security Council and the co-sponsors of the peace process, the United States and Russia, to speed up the implementation of the articles of UN Security Council's Resolution 904. This resolution concerns the condemnation of the massacre and the adoption of measures to guarantee the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians in all parts of the occupied Palestinian territories, which includes the provision of an international presence, the disarming of Israeli settlers, and the implementation of the fourth Geneva Agreement to the occupied Arab territories. It stresses in this respect that the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are illegal according to international law and that their continued presence constitutes an obstacle to peace that is liable to rock confidence and will not provide a suitable atmosphere for the achievement of a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli conflict. While welcoming the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement concerning an international presence in al-Khalil, and the resumption of the peace negotiations, the council reaffirms its full support for the peace process on all tracks aimed at reaching a just, permanent, and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian question and the Arab-Israeli conflict on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for peace principle, a full Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab lands, primary among which is holy Jerusalem, and securing the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people, including its right to self-determination. The council reiterates its request to the international community to put pressure on Israel to carry out UN Security Council Resolution 425 to secure an immediate and unconditional withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The Ministerial Council brought back to mind the recommendations of the 8th conference of the Damascus Declaration member states foreign ministers held in Damascus on 9-10 January 1994, and welcomed the graceful invitation made by the State of Kuwait to host the coming meeting of the Damascus declaration foreign ministers' conference, in implementation of Article 1 of the recommendations of the 8th Damascus Declaration member states foreign ministers' conference on the importance of continuing coordination and consultation in the political domain between the 8 countries regarding regional and international issues. The council is following with interest the development of the political and security situation in fraternal Somalia, and it expresses its aspiration to see a reconciliation between the Somali factions. It welcomes the signing of the Nairobi agreement and hopes that this step will contribute to the restoration of security and stability to Somalia so that it will be able to resume the reconstruction and development march. The Ministerial Council also followed the latest developments of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it lauds the international efforts made to force the Serbs to withdraw their artillery from Sarajevo, and it urges the international community to take similar measures in the other security zones. The council welcomes the signing of an agreement on the establishment of a Muslim-Croatian Federation in Bosnia and considers it a step toward restoring peace and security to the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and affirming its sovereignty, independence, and territorial unity. It calls on the Security Council to enable the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to exercise the right of legitimate self-defense in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, to lift the arms embargo imposed on it, and to tighten sanctions and redouble pressure on Serbia and Montenegro. The council expresses its deep concern at the continuing deterioration of the situation in the sisterly Republic of Afghanistan, and calls on all the Afghan factions to put a halt to the fighting, to give priority to the national interest, and to respond to the United Nations efforts for that purpose so that security and stability can be restored throughout that sisterly country. The council also discussed the minutes of a number of ministerial committees and approved them. It reaffirmed to the technical committees the necessity of completing implementation of the rules of the unified economic agreement, in line with decisions taken by the Higher Council. The Ministerial Council also reviewed the situation in the international oil market, expressing the concern of its states over its instability.
