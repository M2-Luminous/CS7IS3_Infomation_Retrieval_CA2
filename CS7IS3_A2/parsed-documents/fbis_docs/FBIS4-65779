FBIS4-65779 "drweu100_f_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 IRELAND Spring Interviewed Spring Interviewed LD2305152494 Dublin RTE Radio One Network in English 1200 GMT 23 May 94 LD2305152494 Dublin RTE Radio One Network English BFN [Excerpt] [Announcer] Well, I'm joined on the line now by the Tanaiste [Deputy Prime Minister] Dick Spring from County Cavan, where he was attending the opening of the Ballyconnel Canal and from Belfast by the Presbyterian minister, the Reverend Roy McGee, who has been meeting loyalist paramilitaries regularly to try to wean them away from violence. First, if I can come to you, Tanaiste. Do you have a sense of heavy irony attending a cross-border project, which is aimed at strengthening cross-border links, in the aftermath of this bombing, or attempted bombing? [Spring] Well, indeed, Shane, it is one of the ironies of the situation that we are here today celebrating a tremendous project, a north-south project, the big investment from the international fund for Ireland from the European Union, indeed both governments, and it's a tremendous opportunity for the locals in Fermanagh, Cavan, and Leitrim, and obviously we had what was, would have been another very serious situation in Dublin over the weekend. I have to say, though, that the Irish Government, with the British Government, would be very concerned about all instances of violence, whether they are in Dublin or in the north or, indeed, in the UK, and we will pursue the policy of cooperation between the security forces at the highest level to ensure that the men of violence will not be able to make any progress. [Announcer] Did you manage to hear what Jim Molyneaux had to say in his interview just before you came on? [Spring] I did. I listened very carefully to what James Molyneaux was saying. In fact, I listen very carefully at all times to what Mr. Molyneaux has been saying. [Announcer] You heard what he said about it being the inevitable outcome of the Downing Street Declaration? How did you respond to that? [Spring] I would dispute that with him, in fact, and I have on many occasions since the Downing Street Declaration attempted to draw the attention of Unionists and Loyalists, indeed, to the Downing Street Declaration and to the benefits for them in the Downing Street Declaration. Unfortunately, this has not been -- we have not been successful in drawing their attention to it, but I would also support Mr. Molyneaux's call over the weekend for the Loyalist paramilitaries to realize that they, too, have an obligation to end their part in the violence, because, obviously, we want violence to end from all quarters. And whereas efforts are being made in terms of the clarification to end the Provisional violence, efforts must also be made by the Unionist community to end the Loyalist violence as well. [Announcer] Well, Jim Molyneaux has appealed for a cease-fire, but it does appear that there is a threat of further attacks. Do you agree with what the minister of justice, Maire Gheoghegan-Quinn, was saying that a ring of steel cannot prevent earnest bombers and those intent on murder getting through? [Spring] Well, that obviously would be, I think, a realistic assessment of the situation. We obviously are going to maintain the highest level of security possible, both north and south, to ensure that we contain any threats of aggression or violence, and also we are going to pursue our political efforts to bring the talks to -- restarting the talks and to make progress. [Announcer] Is there any possibility that efforts to control border security have been, perhaps, too relaxed in recent times, given the knowledge of the possibility of these attacks? [Spring] No, I certainly -- perhaps, obviously it's a matter for the minister of justice to reply, but I can tell you from the government's point of view there has been no letup in our pursuit of the violence, or men of violence, from whatever quarter it comes.
