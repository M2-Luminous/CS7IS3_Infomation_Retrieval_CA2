Kabayev: "This Is Not a Conservatory for You. Everyone Is Monitored Here: Chekists in Kyrgyzia Have Started an Apparatus War"] [Text] Bishkek--"Hello, is this the hospital? No? Then excuse me..." What does this mean? If you are not a statesman, not an important businessman, or, finally, not a "hard-boiled" journalist, the error can be written off to lousy telephone communications. But if you fall into the aforementioned category of people, then you should think twice. A special cable stretches from each of the 16 operating telephone stations in Bishkek to the department with three, now four, initials--GKNB [State Committee for National Security]. The KGB has its own people on each shift at the 16 stations. With some degree of exaggeration, the Ministry of Communications can be safely called a daughter of the KGB firm. A note with a request to monitor one or another subscriber (addressed to the chairman of the KGB) is submitted by the manager of one of the two leading directorates of the office. After an appropriate endorsement, the paper is returned to the executor. Further--it is a matter of equipment. A ring can be heard at the necessary ATC [automated telephone station]: "Masha (Aigul, Sveta, Larisa...), hook us up with this number." Soon a small light shows up on a panel in a special KGB room--"the subscriber is on the line!" In order to determine whether the "object" is in place in the apartment of the person who is "under surveillance," the buzzer rings: "Hello, is this the hospital (hotel, bathhouse, kindergarten, etc.)?" The trustful master of the house replies indignantly that, no, this, he says, is an apartment... As a rule, it is here that the recorder is turned on with each incoming and outgoing telephone call. By the way, the click in the telephone receiver that is described in detective stories cannot be heard. The GB's [state security] apparatus is well balanced. Sometimes conversations are listened to directly. But in both cases in the apartment (or the office), a noticeable deterioration in sound quality occurs. Approval to monitor a telephone is granted for a period of not more than one month; however, this does not mean that the approval cannot be extended. According to the testimony of reliable persons, up to 20 subscribers are monitored in Bishkek each day. However, the situation in an apartment (or office) can also be monitored without lifting the telephone receiver. In this case, the telephone apparatus itself acts as a microphone. Therefore, knowledgeable people either disconnect the apparatus from the system or turn on a source of additional sound (two is better, in different corners of the room)--a radio, a television set. The author of these lines frequently had occasion to be witness to this during conversations with highly placed Kyrgyz officials. Notes containing approval for monitoring are supposed to be kept in a special archive. However, if a note is "lost" for any reason, the loss may not even be noticed. Thus, it has become known that in December of 1980, after the murder of Chairman of the Council of Ministers Sultan Ibraimov, several notes of approval and deciphering of telephone conversations of suspected persons disappeared. With the victory of democracy in Kyrgyzia [Kyrgyzstan], discussions about telephone monitoring have not diminished. Complaints and suspicions are coming both from governmental figures and also from journalists and politicians. There are a lot of examples. When leaving for home Felix Kulov, former vice president of the state, sealed the door of his official office and, while talking with someone, disconnected the telephone apparatus from the system. Topchubek Turgunaliyev, head of the Erk Party, suspecting the "office" of monitoring his telephone, officially appealed to the head of the KGB-GKNB. Alas, the essence of the department did not change with the change of signboard. Just as in the epoch of totalitarianism, the department continues to engage in political investigation, and it actively intervenes in the affairs of the state and the personal life of its citizens. After the downfall of communism in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, the state security organs were the masters of the political Olympus for three or four years. With their assist, parliamentarians divided each other into "clean" and "dirty." The chiefs of committees removed objectionable figures from the political arena without particular problems. Undoubtedly, given all its antiespionage (read anti-state security) orientation, this prolonged action was managed and coordinated by departments that "were being criticized." It is sufficient to mention that after the accusations of "cooperation with the KGB," Kazimiera Prunskiene was forced to resign as prime minister of Lithuania. But who else could have arranged the compromise of the prime minister except the KGB? No one! The axiom says: "Divulgence of agent information is a matter for the hands of the department that put such agent network together." The intelligence services of Czechoslovakia were able to isolate Aleksandr Dubcek, who recently died in an automobile accident under strange circumstances. The state security people of Poland were not satisfied with Lech Walesa, who there and then was accused of cooperation with the organs. Moreover, rather convincing documents were leaked to the press. Kyrgyzia, apparently, is also no exception.. In the opinion of a number of former employees of the Kyrgyz KGB, the firm in one way or another controls up to half of the state employees and members of parliament. Some of them were and are secret agents, others were seen in the organs at one time carrying out delicate instructions of the KGB, and still others were driven at one time "to do the devil's work" by writing a denunciation against a neighbor, and the paper providently settled in the "office." Today (as they believe), the publication of three to five names that are well known in the republic (with a specific demonstration of their agent activity) is capable of causing a profound governmental and parliamentary crisis. Getting ahead of the story, it should be noted that with this, apparently, these state security people have captured parliamentarians who are scared to death. At the last session of the Kyrgyz parliament the people's representatives unanimously passed a law concerning the organs of state security. According to this law, the Chekists acquired the right of unimpeded entry into dwellings "and other premises belonging to citizens" (a reason will always be found!), and the procurator has to be notified of this only after 24 hours. Now state security people can quite informally intervene in the activity of commercial structures, "demand and receive from them necessary information, check the presence of property with registered and current data, and receive information in banks on operations, accounts, and deposits." Where is the guarantee that the commercial information will not be turned over (sold) to competitors afterwards? Where is the guarantee that the Chekists (and today they are graduates of Kyrgyz higher educational institutions who have merely gone through a Bishkek system of personnel selection) will not ruin the firms and organizations they are checking up on? After all, the law does not say a word about the measure of responsibility of the employees of the GKNB in the event of causing moral, physical, or economic damage. The state security people have retained control over governmental special communications, they have retained for themselves the investigative isolation cells that just a year ago were filled with then "foreign money speculators," though as it turns out today--with legal financial brokers. Now the Chekists, suspecting someone (and, as is known, anyone and everyone can be suspected), can quite informally check the contents of your pockets and go through your car and personal things. Moreover, without the approval of a procurator. Incidentally, Kyrgyz Chekists now enjoy the use of all types of public transport (except taxis) free of charge. And more: The services of state security informers will be paid from the republic budget. Thus, in the most democratic Central Asian republic, the parliamentarians not only did not restrict the activity of its monster, but, on the contrary, placed it above all society, having legalized the penetration of all spheres of Kyrgyz state, public, and economic life. Only the president has the last word. After all, whether the law on state security organs passed by the deputies will be confirmed depends only on him. But the president is keeping silent. For the time being.
