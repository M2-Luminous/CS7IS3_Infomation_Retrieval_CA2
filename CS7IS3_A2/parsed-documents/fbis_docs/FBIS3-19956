In a speech to the Austrian parliament in Vienna, Kucan said "two or three Europes" could emerge, including a "para-Europe" of which Russia would be the prime component, which would be distinct from the European Union and those states hoping to join it. Kucan, speaking during a one-day visit, said the Russian presence in parts of former Yugoslavia may signal the creation of two separate "Byzantine" and "West" European civilisations. The divergence between East and West Europe was becoming "more and more dangerous," Kucan warned. The president of the former Yugoslav republic also met Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and his Austrian counterpart Thomas Klestil. Kucan backed Austria's planned admission to the European Union, adding that he expected Slovenia to receive the same support for its own eventual membership.
