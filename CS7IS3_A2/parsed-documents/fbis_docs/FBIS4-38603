FBIS4-38603 "drsov105_a_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-105 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Duma Committeeman, U.S. Senator Interviewed Duma Committeeman, U.S. Senator Interviewed LD3005210194 LD3005210194 BFN [Editorial Report] Moscow Radiostantsiya Ekho Moskvy in Russian at 1815 GMT on 30 May carries a 45-minute live studio interview with Sergey Yushenkov, chairman of the Russian State Duma Defense Committee, and U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, head of the Armed Forces Committee of the U.S. Senate, by an unidentified correspondent. Nunn speaks in English with passage-by-passage translation into Russian. The guests discuss topics related to Russo-American relations and answer a few questions phoned in by listeners. Nunn introduces himself and speaks briefly about his military career. The correspondent reports that, as of today, Russian, British, and U.S. missiles are no longer aimed at each other. Nunn says partnership and trust are growing and adds that today's meeting was a step in the right direction. He says that relations are developing in many areas. Yushenkov then reiterates Nunn's words regarding the end of missile targeting. Nunn says that he, Yushenkov, Lukin, and others discussed the issue of joint maneuvers. He says they are intended to be a small- arms, peacekeeping enterprise and that there is no requirement that the maneuvers be held at the Totskoye proving ground. He asks why the maneuvers could not be held in the United States. Nunn then says that the Defense Department must decide these things, but he hopes other senators will support them on the question of joint maneuvers. Yushenkov says the maneuvers will also help the two sides to train together should a real conflict emerge. Nunn agrees. The guests then discuss the arms embargo against Bosnia. Yushenkov reads a quote from Jean Kirkpatrick that the only successful U.S. military operation since World War II was in the Gulf War. He says that other so-called peacekeeping operations have resulted in great losses and says that intervention should only be accompanied by military action. Nunn says he does not agree that there have been no successful peacekeeping operations. He cites Cambodia and the Sinai as good examples. Yushenkov says he is an opponent of using force as a means toward peace. He says there are many examples of this throughout Russia, and it is impossible to determine who is the aggressor and who is the victim in various hot spots. Nunn agrees and says that the United States must be very careful where it puts peacekeeping forces. The moderator asks the guests if they believe Russia and the United States should compete in arms sales. Nunn says the United States has not chosen to be a competitor; it has happened naturally, due to economic reasons. Yushenkov says Russia has reduced its arms sales drastically compared with the United States. A listener asks whether Russia and the United States are not tired of opposing each other. Nunn says yes, that even friends have differences, but they should be discussed together. He says the aftermath of the Cold War--in the form of thousands of nuclear and chemical weapons in both countries--must be remembered. He adds that biological weapons also need to be eliminated. Yushenkov says he is not only tired of making war but he abhors it. He says that Nunn is coauthor of an amendment on aid to CIS countries for the destruction of nuclear weapons. Another listener asks whether there might be a third force or group of countries that would want to aim its missiles at both the United States and Russia. Nunn says he put this question to the military in the 1980's to find out the potential of both countries to repel an attack by a third country. Yushenkov says both countries' efforts should be aimed at improving the effectiveness of the United Nations, the CSCE, and the Partnership for Peace program. The moderator asks both guests what they would like to be remembered about them. Nunn says he would like to think he made the world a bit safer and more peaceful. Yushenkov says he would like the Duma to pass a law on alternative military service and an effective law on control of the military.
