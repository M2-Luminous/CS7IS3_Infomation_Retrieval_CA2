The HDZ has issued a public statement including the following: First, the political will of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been repeatedly expressed through legitimate and legal representatives, through the political charter as well as the political declaration of the Bosnia-Herzegovina HDZ and through the declaration of the House of Representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. Second, by sacrifice and by struggling hard for its survival and the protection of all its rights, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina has won an inalienable right to equality with the other two peoples in the homeland of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina is willing to accept only such a form of Bosnia-Herzegovina's state organization that will secure the sovereignty of the Croat people in its territorial unit. This original sovereignty is the foundation of all forms of power, including those powers that are vested in bodies of the central authorities of the future Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fourth, the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes into account the authentic features of individual areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to this effect it is willing to work on seeking more suitable solutions in keeping with these features -- but only on the basis of the original sovereignty of the Croat people and reciprocal protection for the rights of members of all three state-building peoples. Fifth, any solution to the state crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina which were to disregard the sovereignty of the Croat people in one part of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be at odds with the hitherto expressed political will, historic rights and interests of the Croat people of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This is all the more so as the historical experiences of sovereignty without a territorial definition were the main factor in the oppression of the Croat people and a cause of its emigration and demise. Sovereignty without territory has been scrapped in multinational communities in modern state policies and legal concepts and civilized countries. Sixth, in seeking a just and lasting peace the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina has always taken into account, and always will, the entirety of Croatian national interests.
