Nonetheless, we have yet to eradicate leaks within public security organs or related to their operations, and problems in other areas remain severe. From the incomplete information available, we can roughly group these problems into five categories. The first involves intentionally giving criminals secret information about public security work, including divulging plans of action, means of gathering intelligence, clues, evidence, and the identities of informants and witnesses. These crimes directly undermine the very purpose of public security organs and some even endanger informants. In July 1990, Li Rujie [2621 3067 4634], secretarial section chief of the Shangli Precinct of Pingxiang, Jiangxi gave a letter sent in by Liu Kun [2692 0981], a driver for a certain company, detailing crimes committed by the head of that company to that same head. The informant was murdered early the following December by someone hired for big money by that very head. This sort of leak typifies the exchange of authority for money and collusion between isolated crooks within public security ranks and criminals in society and is a manifestation of public security corruption. The second category entails leaks resulting from disappearance or loss of secret documents or goods due to improper handling. This leakage occurs most often in leadership organs at various levels, especially in document use and in administrative departments. Failure strictly to follow registration procedures and handling rules causes documents to get lost during transmission, makes it hard to determine the principal perpetrators or nature of leakage, and the ramifications rarely appear in the short term. The operations office of a certain city's public security department discovered during inventory early this year that two sets of fairly highly classified documents had vanished. Since they had gone out long before and the checkout procedures were sloppy, the people responsible could not recall where the documents went, so the case remains unsolved. This kind of leak demonstrates that problems exist in the way public security organs handle their documents. The third category is leaks occurring in radio communications. Because some public security cadres and police lack common sense when it comes to maintaining secrecy or familiarity with communications equipment, confusion of open and secret communications and exchange of unencrypted secret information in wired and wireless communications occur frequently, such that transmissions containing state secrets are sent openly and thus are easy for crooks or external intelligence agencies to intercept, thereby seriously threatening the security of state secrets, including codes. In February 1992, a border guard operator repeatedly transmitted unencrypted the contents of secret documents over shortwave radio, resulting in interception thereof. A certain city's traffic control department openly radioed deployment orders for a vehicle inspection operation that were overheard by a trucking firm, thereby affecting the success of the effort. Fourth are publication leaks. This most often occurs in public reports or news accounts of successful criminal investigations and in instructional, scientific, and technological works. The vast majority of these leaks occur because the people who commit them do not understand what constitutes a state secret in public security work and or stem from absence of strict clearance procedures. Then there is that extremely rare individual who, for fame and fortune, deliberately evades review by appropriate agencies and publishes materials involving secrets without authorization. A public security academy openly issued instructional materials compiled for internal use only that contained data relating to secret party work during the revolutionary war and to public security work after the founding of the PRC. Although remedy was immediately effected, some of the materials had been sold to the public, with some ending up abroad and irretrievable. Publication leaks are serious due to breadth of dissemination, inability to determine where the leaked information destinates, and the frequent tendency of ignorant news media to pass the information on. Therefore, the serious threat posed by this kind of leak cannot be underestimated. The fifth category involves leaks occurring from office automation equipment, including copying machines, typewriters, and personal computers. Owing to a lack of strict control systems or to failure to enforce such, copying machine use is unrestricted in many units, so people reproduce things at will. Some personal computers holding sensitive information lack security measures, diskettes and ribbons are deposited or disposed of indiscriminately, and so on. While public security organs have yet to discover a single instance in which such situations have led to leaks of secrets, potential peril remains, trouble could occur at any time, so careful attention is warranted.
