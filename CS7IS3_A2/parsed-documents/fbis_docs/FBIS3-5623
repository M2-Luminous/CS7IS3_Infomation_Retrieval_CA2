The raids covered more than 30 locations which included the homes of Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Kajima, and Akira Miyazaki, president. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives Steering Committee convened Wednesday to listen to Justice Ministry officials to discuss a request by prosecutors to arrest Nakamura, a member of the house, who quit the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) earlier in the day. Committee Chairman Keiwa Okuda told reporters later that the lower house needs to decide on the request as early as possible. Diet permission is required for the arrest of parliamentarians while the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late January. Investigators from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office will soon ask Ishikawa, 68, to voluntarily submit to questions pertaining to the money allegedly paid in January 1992 to Nakamura, investigative sources said. Ishikawa formerly served as head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of Japan's four top business organizations, and also of the Japan Federation of Construction Contractors Inc., an industry association of general contractors. He resigned as president of the chamber last year as prosecutors promoted probes into the widening scandal involving politicians and contractors. Investigators have already quizzed Miyazaki, 70, the president of Kajima, one of Japan's top contractors. On Tuesday, prosecutors again arrested a former vice president of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, 67, on suspicion of giving the 10 million yen bribe to Nakamura. Nakamura allegedly received the money as a reward for using his influence to help prevent the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) from lodging a criminal complaint against contractors including Kajima, for bid-rigging in Saitama Prefecture. Kiyoyama allegedly asked Nakamura, a senior member of the LDP's construction lobby, to put pressure on the FTC not to file an accusation with prosecutors against a bid-rigging cartel involving Kajima and 65 other construction firms. At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law. The LDP was in power for 38 years until the inauguration of the coalition government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last August. Nakamura later served as construction minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Investigators intend to question fallen LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru, 79, who is being tried in a separate income tax evasion case, the investigative sources said. Prosecutors suspect Kiyoyama first asked Kanemaru to put pressure on the FTC, an antitrust watchdog body. Kanemaru allegedly replied that Nakamura was handling the matter, the sources said. Kiyoyama and three other former Kajima officials were indicted last year in two bribery cases. Prosecutors said the Kajima officials gave 20 million yen to former Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi and 10 million yen to former Sendai Mayor Toru Ishii.
