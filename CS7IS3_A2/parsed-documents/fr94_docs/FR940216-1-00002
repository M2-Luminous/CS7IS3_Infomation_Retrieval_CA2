FR940216-1-00002 FR940216-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 1011 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;07] Milk in the Tennessee Valley Marketing Area; Proposed Temporary Reduction of Supply Plant Shipping Percentage AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed temporary revision of rule. SUMMARY: This document invites comments on a proposal to temporarily reduce the supply plant shipping requirement of the Tennessee Valley Federal milk order (Order 11) for the months of March through July 1994. The proposed action was requested by Armour Foods Ingredients Company (Armour), which operates a proprietary supply plant pooled under Order 11. Armour contends the action is necessary to prevent the uneconomical movement of milk and to ensure that producer milk associated with the market in the fall will continue to be pooled in the spring and summer months. DATES: Comments are due no later than February 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such action would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this proposed action in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed action has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 and the provisions of ยง1011.7(b) of the order, temporary revision of certain provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Tennessee Valley marketing area is being considered for the months of March 1, 1994, through July 31, 1994. All persons who wish to send written data, views or arguments about the proposed revision should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2968, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this document in the Federal Register . The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required procedures before the requested revision is to be effective. All written submissions made pursuant to this document will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during regular business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)). Statement of Consideration The proposed revision would reduce from 40 to 30 percent the supply plant shipping requirement for the period of March through July 1994. The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total quantity of milk physically received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and February, and 40 percent in each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that the 40 percent requirement could jeopardize the continued association of producers who have supplied the Order 11 market in the fall. Armour anticipates that marketing conditions in 1994 will mirror those in 1993, when the shipping percentage was also reduced. It expects milk supplies to be adequate to meet the Class I needs of the market. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1011 Milk marketing orders.
