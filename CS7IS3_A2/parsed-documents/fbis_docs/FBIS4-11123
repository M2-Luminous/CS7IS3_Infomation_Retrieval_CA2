[Robaina] Our visit to Peru is part of a tour of other Latin American countries where we will explain to our American brothers and the entire international community to what extent Cuba is determined to carry out its project, without straying from the historic path it has chosen, in this time of crisis. The idea is to tell everyone what aspects of our revolution are not negotiable and what aspects of our socio-economic program are. Our presence here is also our response to an international campaign against Cuba. It is our duty to break up this negative campaign. [LA REPUBLICA] What are the aspects of socialist Cuba that can be negotiated? How do you think Cuba should adapt to the new international context that surrounds it? [Robaina] This process will, precisely, allow a new type of relationship with the world. We haven't asked anybody for a correlation of political ideologies in order to establish an economic relationship, and this is where we will have to adapt to a completely new situation. In this regard there are national interests that match the interests of foreign investors. What is a need for Cuba might be an investment opportunity for many and, modestly speaking, we also believe Cuba has a lot to offer the world. [LA REPUBLICA] What guarantees and incentives does Cuba currently offer foreign capital? [Robaina] Much is said about what Cuba can offer foreign investors and facts have proven that Cuba, definitely, has a lot to attract foreign investors. This is why we seek meetings, to negotiate and get more acquainted, because only thus will we be able to establish stable new rules. This is why we must point out that Cuba has opened its doors to foreign capital with legal and constitutional backing. This backing is clear and flexible enough to avoid any suspicion. [LA REPUBLICA] What Cuban sectors are more attractive to foreign capital? What products does your country offer the international markets aside from sugar, of course? [Robaina] We are taking very positive steps in the tourism field. There is also great potential in the iron and steel industry, in the construction sector. We also have a wide range of products in which the international market is interested such as nickel, oil, and the production and processing of citrus fruit. [LA REPUBLICA] Is this new open door policy particularly directed to a certain market? [Robaina] The opening to the international market is a priority issue for Cuba, but within this framework, we want to give even greater preference to Latin American investors. [LA REPUBLICA] How can potential foreign investors be certain they will enjoy full guarantees in Cuba? [Robaina] Those investors from various parts of the world who already are investing in Cuba can say that better than us because it is a fact. We have investors from Spain, Canada, Italy, France, and also from Latin American countries such as Colombia, Argentina, Brazil. They are not only looking into the possibilities of investing but already have invested in our country, and our relationship with them is excellent. [LA REPUBLICA] This means that the future of foreign investments in Cuba is quite promising. [Robaina] It should be pointed out that Cuba's relationship with foreign investors is not as smooth and easy as in other countries. It must be taken into account that we are promoting this opening with great opposition. In order to attract foreign investors we have not only had to grant them a legal framework that would give them guarantees, but we also have had to be quite bold and brave. It is no secret that whoever tries to make deals with Cuba is subject to great pressure. If the new investors want legal guarantees, they already have them. Moreover, there is the guarantee of the facts, there is the testimony of those already investing in Cuba. [LA REPUBLICA] What are the expectations regarding Cuba's relationship with Peru in this new phase? [Robaina] In all our commercial relationships, Cuba does not go around the world only saying what it needs. We, modestly, also offer what could be of help to friendly countries. In sum, I believe that in Peru's case we have a lot to offer in the sugar industry; we have a tourism market that may interest many investors; we have significant technological development in the medical and paramedical fields, in the production of medical equipment, important developments in the biotechnology field; we also have important experience in the sports field. We hope to increase our relationship with Peru in the commercial and investments fields, which will, in turn, strengthen our traditional historic and cultural ties. [LA REPUBLICA] Is the U.S. commercial blockade imposed more than 30 years ago the only obstacle to Cuba's new political opening being fully successful in the near future? [Robaina] We have never said that the blockade is the only cause of our problems. The problems Cuba has experienced lately are the combination of a series of factors but, definitely, the blockade is the greatest obstacle. Now, more than ever in this crucial phase, we have to bear a tremendous pressure exerted not only directly against Cuba but also against whoever deals with or invests in Cuba. [LA REPUBLICA] Is tourism the field in which Cuba has attracted the most foreign investment? [Robaina] Let us talk about priorities. Tourism is a market with lots of possibilities for Cuba and important steps in this area have been taken. Cuba's climate is very attractive to any tourist in the world. This is why we have given tourism the same level of development as other very promising fields for foreign investors. However, we should bear in mind that we have resorted to tourism out of need, due to the difficulties Cuba is facing. But it is no secret to anybody that, aside from the capital, tourism in countries such as ours have a very high political and social cost. [LA REPUBLICA] Does this mean that tourism for Cuba represents more problems than solutions? [Robaina] No. That is not so. If we have promoted tourism in Cuba it is because we have no alternatives at this very difficult moment. But, fortunately, tourism has developed at a time when the Cuban people have reached a cultural, technological, scientific, and political level that has allowed us to face the opening to the tourism industry in a suitable way. There is no doubt that tourism today is as important as any of our harvests. [LA REPUBLICA] On the domestic front, how does the Cuban Government intend to face the black market's socio-economic problem? [Robaina] The so-called black market exists; we do not deny nor try to conceal our problems. Everyone is aware that in times of crisis and in the midst of such adverse circumstances as the ones we are enduring, the surfacing of the black market is something "natural" from the economic viewpoint. The black market speculates with the peoples' needs. What we have to do about this and other social problems is to normalize life in Cuba, produce more to meet the peoples' needs. This challenge requires the implementation of very special measures that adjust to the new circumstances under which we live. This is the reason for the great nationwide debate to get everyone to participate in the decisionmaking on these new measures. These measures will be assessed and adopted by the National Assembly of the People's Government convened for 1 May.
