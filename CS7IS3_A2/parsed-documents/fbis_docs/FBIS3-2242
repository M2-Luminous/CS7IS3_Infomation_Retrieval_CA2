The local government's latest assessment of the impact on Hong Kong's economy if China were to lose its MFN trading status in the United States was announced at a press conference held by the Trade Department here this afternoon. Christopher Jackson, deputy director of the Trade Department, said that the removal of China's MFN trading status by the United States would have direct adverse effect on Hong Kong's re-exports of the Chinese Mainland origin to the United States. "A reduction of up to 77 billion H.K. dollars (one billion U.S. dollars) worth of re-exports is double the impact that we estimated in 1990," said Jackson, adding that this is largely a result of the rapid growth in Hong Kong's re-export of goods made in the mainland to the United States over the past few years. The withdrawal would also have significant adverse effect on manufacturing investment ventures and other production arrangements by Hong Kong and foreign companies in the Chinese Mainland, said Jackson. According to Jackson, the local government has stepped its lobbying activities in Washington as President Clinton is required by the U.S. law to indicate by June 3 whether he intends to renew China's MFN status for another year. "We have reinforced our lobbying team and are working with American business allies to impress upon members of the administration and Congress the damage which MFN withdrawal would do to Hong Kong and to American interests in this region," he said.
