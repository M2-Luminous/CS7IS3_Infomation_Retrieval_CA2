By awarding the "European Charles IV Prize," which is not identical with the Charlemagne Prize awarded in Aachen, the Landsmannschaft next Saturday [21 May] wants to pay tribute to Mock's intensive work for "a just order of people and states in Central Europe." On Tuesday, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus expressed surprise about the fact that the prize will be awarded to Mock. He said in a radio interview that he does not believe this is an Austrian initiative. An article by Mock in the latest edition of the weekly SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the organ of the Landsmannschaft, has also caused some excitement recently, since the foreign minister came out in favor of establishing a dialogue between the Landsmannschaft and the Czech Republic. The Social Democratic Party of Austria [SPOe] Distances Itself Mock's "shoulder-to-shoulder stance" with the leadership of the Sudeten German Landsmannschaft is not only an affront to the Czech Republic but also to the coalition's good neighbor policy, SPOe International Secretary Karl Schramek said. Mock reacted to the storm of criticism by saying that he will continue to advocate the safeguarding of human rights and to oppose their violation.
