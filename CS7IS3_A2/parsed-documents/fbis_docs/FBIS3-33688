The Iraqi regime's intelligence forces asked the dealers to be quiet and to remain in their places. However, the dealers, who were aware of the intentions of the intelligence men, tried to escape. The regime's men fired at those who tried to escape, killing and wounding many innocent people. After gaining control over the area, the regime men arrested many people and left the bodies of the slain in the streets. Such criminal acts have exacerbated the miserable situation in Baghdad and increased the citizens' worries.
