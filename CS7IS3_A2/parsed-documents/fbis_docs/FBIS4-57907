Robaina will leave for Cairo, the host city, on Saturday. He will head a Cuban delegation which, according to Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, will present specific proposals aimed at maintaining the island's active participation in the activities of the movement. The meeting will last until 3 June. From Cairo, Robaina will travel to Qatar, where he was invited by the Qatar Government to review bilateral relations and assist in the inauguration of the Cuban Embassy there. After returning to Havana for a few days, the foreign minister will, on 12 June, assist in a foreign ministers meeting that will take place in advance of the Ibero-American Summit, which will be held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, and be attended by the chiefs of state and government of the two regions. Another important trip by Robaina will be one in early July that will take him to the installation ceremony for the Association of Caribbean States in the capital of Barbados. Speaking to a group of domestic and foreign reporters, Alfonso described these trips as part of the "diplomatic offensive" Cuba is waging right now. He pointed to the continuous increase in diplomatic and consular relations between the island and other nations. So far, a total of 147 countries maintain diplomatic relations with the largest of the Antillean islands, a situation that exposes the lie about Cuba's alleged isolation in the world.
