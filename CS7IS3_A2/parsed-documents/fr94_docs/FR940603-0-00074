FR940603-0-00074 FR940603-0-00027 The Council's recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries (30 kg halibut/mt groundfish) is unchanged from 1992 and 1993. The Council recommended a 40 kg halibut/mt of groundfish bycatch rate standard for the GOA ``other trawl'' fishery. This bycatch rate standard was established for the first half of 1994, but is a 20 percent reduction from the standard implemented for this fishery during 1992 and 1993 (50 kg halibut/mt groundfish). The Council's action on the 1994 bycatch rate standard for the GOA ``other trawl'' fishery was intended to continue, to support other management measures implemented under an emergency interim rule (59 FR 6222, February 10, 1994) that was extended through August 9, 1994 (59 FR 24965, May 13, 1994). A proposed rule to implement these measures after the emergency interim rule expires was published May 4, 1994 (59 FR 23044). The interim management measures include: (1) The apportionment of the GOA trawl halibut bycatch limit between ``shallow water'' and ``deep water'' trawl fisheries, and (2) adjustment of directed fishing standards to change the way retainable bycatch amounts of groundfish species are calculated. The bycatch rate standards recommended for the GOA and BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries are based on the Council's intent to simplify the GOA and BSAI incentive program by specifying a single bycatch rate standard for the aggregate trawl fisheries that are not assigned fishery-specific bycatch rate standards under the incentive program, yet maintain the Council's objective of reducing overall halibut bycatch rates in the Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries. Observer data collected from the 1993 GOA ``other trawl'' fishery show third and fourth quarter halibut bycatch rates of 34 and 38 kg halibut/mt of groundfish, respectively. The first quarter rate from 1994 was lower, at 11 kg halibut/mt of groundfish. Observer data collected from the 1993 BSAI ``other trawl'' fishery show third and fourth quarter halibut bycatch rates of 5 and 4 kg halibut/mt of groundfish, respectively. The average first quarter rate from the 1994 BSAI ``other trawl'' fishery was 9 kg halibut/mt groundfish. The average bycatch rates experienced by vessels participating in the GOA and BSAI ``other trawl'' fisheries are lower than the Council's recommended bycatch rate standards for these fisheries. However, the Council determined that its recommended halibut bycatch rate standards for the ``other trawl'' fisheries would continue to provide an incentive to vessel operators to avoid unusually high bycatch rates while participating in these fisheries and contribute towards an overall reduction in halibut bycatch rates experienced in the Alaska trawl fisheries. Bycatch Rate Standards for Red King Crab The Council's recommended red king crab bycatch rate standard for the yellowfin sole and ``other trawl'' fisheries in Zone 1 of the Bering Sea subarea is 2.5 crab/mt of groundfish during the second half of 1994. This standard is the same as that recommended for 1992 and 1993 and for the first half of 1994. The justification for this standard is discussed in the December 15, 1993, publication of bycatch rate standards for the first half of 1994. Vessels are not anticipated to participate in either the yellowfin sole or ``other trawl'' fisheries in Zone 1 during the second half of 1994 because of fishery closures. Directed fishing for yellowfin sole in Zone 1 by vessels using trawl gear is closed for the remainder of 1994 because the Zone 1 C. bairdi Tanner crab bycatch allowance specified for this fishery has been reached (59 FR 26145, May 19, 1994). Directed fishing for groundfish species included in the ``other trawl'' fishery (defined at §675.26(b)(4)) also is prohibited in Zone 1 because of halibut, red king crab, or C. bairdi Tanner crab bycatch restrictions (rockfish, Greenland turbot, sablefish, arrowtooth flounder (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994); rock sole and other flatfish (59 FR 10082, March 3, 1994); and Pacific cod (59 FR 23461, May 11, 1994)). Nonetheless, NMFS is publishing a red king crab bycatch rate standard for the ``other trawl'' fishery in Zone 1 consistent with regulations at §675.26(c). The Regional Director has determined that Council recommendations for bycatch rate standards are appropriately based on the information and considerations necessary for such determinations under §§672.26(c) and 675.26(c). Therefore, the Regional Director concurs with the Council's determinations and recommendations for halibut and red king crab bycatch rate standards for the second half of 1994 as set forth in Table 1. These bycatch rate standards may be revised and published in the Federal Register when deemed appropriate by the Regional Director, pending his consideration of the information set forth at §§672.26(c)(2)(v) and 675.26(c)(2)(v).
