On Saturday [19 March] in Berlin FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], stressed the "friendly special relationship" between Germany and France. French President Francois Mitterrand told the AGENCE FRANCE PRESS (AFP) news agency: "We have cooperated with the chancellor in the best spirit and we shall continue to do so in the interest of both our countries and Europe." In Berlin Kinkel said that this "extremely important" special relationship is and remains "Europe's central axis." The past has proven that in Europe much is possible if Germany and France cooperate, but only little if this relationship is disturbed. "France can rely absolutely on Germany," Kinkel stressed. Solo actions are pointless, the Germans have to remember that. Germany does not want any prerogatives. Only together can the tasks that Europe is facing in the future be mastered. Kinkel noted that he was saying this in Berlin because in this city France defended the freedom of Germany and of the world for years. The FRG foreign minister announced a "long-planned visit to France." At the land party congress of the Thuringian FDP, Kinkel said concerning the alleged statements by French Ambassador Francois Scheer about Kinkel's role in the negotiations for membership in the European Union with Scandinavian countries and Austria: If an ambassador says incorrect things, it must be possible to refute this quite clearly. He has advocated expansion to the north just as expansion to the south. Kinkel also commented on the Bundeswehr. It must get out of the parties' quarrel and needs quiet for planning, financing, and organization. The FDP wants to prepare the Bundeswehr for peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks. This costs money. "This money must be available!"
