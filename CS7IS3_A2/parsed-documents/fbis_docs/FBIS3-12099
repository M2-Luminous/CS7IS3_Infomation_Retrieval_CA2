[Chavez] Some components of the plan are still valid; for example, the national constituent assembly. I repeat, we were carrying in our combat bags all the experience gained from the constituent assembly. One of the first measures that a civilian-military government board was going to adopt was to summon a constituent assembly within a reasonable period of time. Currently, this is more valid than ever. [Fernandez] At times you have indicated that some civilians were going to support you, but we never knew who they were. The purpose of this interview is not to tell us who they were, but do these civilians continue to identify themselves with the Bolivarian Movement in 1994? [Chavez] I believe that some of them no longer support us. I think that some of them had the wrong impression that the Bolivarian military members were somewhat similar to the military members of 1945, who were manipulated by politicians... [Fernandez, interrupting] The politics of opportunity. [Chavez] Exactly, the politics of opportunity. They wanted us to join their political organizations. This was never our intention. I believe that some of them are still following the same direction and ideological strategy. We have kept in contact with them, and we will increase the communication channels now that we are able to do it. [Fernandez] I think that you are going to reinforce debates; that is, the debate of ideas and specific issues that will help the country solve the socioeconomic and, especially, the moral crises that we are currently facing. [Chavez] Yes, I agree. [Fernandez] For instance, without worsening the conflict, you will consult with AD [Democratic Action], Copei [Social Christian Party], MAS [Movement Toward Socialism], Radical Cause Party, National Convergence, and a number of groups that are part of the Venezuelan political arena. [Chavez] I really do not know how many ideas I have proposed so far and how many questions I answered at the lengthy news conference. All these ideas are proposed with discussion in mind. Not long ago, I met with some deputies of the National Congress, and I told them let us talk. Mr. Moron, a church representative of course, I was thinking about calling him. I once told this government that I did not know if he was going to accept. He replied that he refused to be with God and with the devil at the same time. A few weeks ago, however, we met at the Military Hospital and I asked him what the church's opinion was. I said that priests and recently retired military officials should hold talks. I always say that we are still active in the people's rank and file; I cannot talk about retirement because there is no such thing. We are moving forward with the national situation. In short, this is the idea: to reveal our plans to ensure that we can discuss or criticize them and reach a national consensus. [Fernandez] Let us close this interview with a thought. Chavez must have listened, read, and examined a number of assessments that have emerged in the media in the last few weeks. Suddenly, the instability prompted by a coup is returning. Copei President Hilarion Cardozo sparked a controversy surrounding this issue. He said that there were individuals involved in the 27 February or 4 November coups who were probably hitting the streets to promote their insurrectionist movement. He also accused certain parties of performing illegal actions in our country and of being involved with the Bolivarian Movement. What do you think about this? What is this issue that has been manipulated lately that is once more bringing instability to our country? [Chavez] I indeed believe that the country's situation is still unstable. Let us hope that the Caldera government and team will be able to infuse acceptable levels of stability to the national, economic, military, political, and social country. [Fernandez] Are you going to contribute to this? [Chavez] We want to talk and make proposals. In my briefcase, I carry a number of proposals that, as a soldier, I wanted to make to the commander in chief, but it was impossible. [Fernandez] When are you meeting with the commander in chief; that is, with the president? [Chavez] It is unknown for the time being. We were supposed to hold a meeting before my release, but we could not meet. We now have to wait and see how the situation develops. We are indeed willing to meet and we have the channels to recommend to the president and to the Armed Forces, from which we came from, some measures that we believe could contribute to the recovery of the [word indistinct]. [Fernandez] What about Hilarion's coup? [Chavez] Coups d'etat are unannounced in Latin America. It is not that they are justifiable, but they are always the product of a situation. I believe that at this moment -- I was telling Jose Vicente that I cannot predict the future -- there are no conditions to stage a coup. [Fernandez] If I remember well, in [Interior Minister] Ramon Escovar Salom's speech to the National Congress two weeks ago, there was a reference to latent subversive factors that could conspire against democratic stability because we have a very fragile stability. There was much talk about groups linked to the Venezuelan financial sector because the Banco Latino crisis could inspire some people in the military ranks to embrace an insurgency movement. [Chavez] I do not think this is possible. I mean, it is possible that the wish is there. [Fernandez] Of course, some sectors are wishing this. [Chavez] No, these sectors are definitely wishing. I believe the military is currently tasked with finding an internal consolidation to show the political world and the Venezuelan nation how it is willing to defend the Constitution and to grant a waiting period hoping that the country, Mr. Caldera, will embark on a new era and that you will be the steering wheel that will lead the vessel to a safe haven.
