Under the plan, about 7 trillion won of state shares will be sold to the public through the stock market or open bidding, the Economic Planning Board [EPB] said. Of the 7 trillion won, the Korea Development Bank holds 1.5 trillion won worth. Thirty state-owned corporations will be privatized, including the Citizens National Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Korea Housing Bank, Korea Tobacco & Ginseng Corp., Korea Fertilizer, Korea Heavy Industries and Construction or Hanjung and National Textbook Printing Co. The selling of state stocks is planned for the Korea Exchange Bank, Kia Steel, Lucky Metals, Dongbu Chemical, Daewoo Shipbuilding, Asiana Airlines and Samsung General Chemical. In addition, 11 companies including Daehan Coal Corp. and Korea Mining Promotion Corporation will be subject to merges, EPB officials said. The privatization plan came in response to President Kim Yong- sam's call for reforming the state sector late last year. Kim, who has overseen wide-spread economic reforms since taking office a year ago, had ordered "major surgery" for poorly managed state firms. The EPB said it reached a consensus with the Finance Ministry to privatize the Citizens National Bank [CNB] this year by abolishing the law governing the establishment of the CNB. Privatization of the Industrial Bank of Korea and Korea Housing Bank will take place after 1996. The Korea Tobacco & Ginseng Corp. whose annual sales amounted to 2.75 trillion won in 1992 will be privatized in 1998. Its net profit reached about 274 billion won in the same year. Industry analysts said the massive privatization plan will spark cut-throat competition to take over the state corporations among the chaebol or large business conglomerates as seen in the hectic battle for the business license for the nation's second mobile telephone network. Government officials, however, ruled out the possibility of special favors for enterprises, saying companies will be subject to regulations envisaged in the credit control rule and the antitrust law. Analysts fingered such corporations as Korea Heavy Industries and Construction or Hanjung, Korea Tungsten and Korea Fertilizer as those which will draw keen attention from the business community. Hanjung, emerging from its prolonged business downturn, has been posting net profits since 1991 and will be privatized in late 1995. The company, which is engaged in the manufacture of power generation and industrial facilities, recorded sales of 1.4 trillion won in 1992. Also at the center of public attention is the Korea Tobacco & Ginseng Corp. [KT & G] which monopolizes domestic production and distribution of tobacco and ginseng. Analysts say the company taking over KT & G will gain a stable income source. The business community says there also are numerous financial firms which will be profitable for the companies taking them over. Pending privatization and mergers, the government has ordered all public firms to freeze recruitment, cut pay-rolls and drastically reduce various fringe state benefits, such as interest-free loans to purchase apartment houses and scholarships for employees' children.
