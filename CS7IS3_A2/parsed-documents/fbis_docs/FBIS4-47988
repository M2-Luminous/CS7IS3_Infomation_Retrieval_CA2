Keith Kendall asked Marques Rodriques, councillor at the Cuban Foreign Ministry and presently in Pretoria, why the announcement was so late. [Begin recording] [Rodriques] Well, I mean that depends on the schedule of President Castro. You know that Cuba is a very far country and the president of course has a lot of engagements to attend, and that's why it's a normal procedure. [Kendall] This was not for security reasons? [Rodriques] Well, it's part of the procedures for the president. (?They) take into consideration the distance between Cuba and South Africa, and the engagements of the president. [Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South Africa? [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There have been long historical relations between Cuba and the patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy towards President Mandela and his post. [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa following the inauguration of President Mandela? [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our government to keep very close ties with the new Government of South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field, and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view, and many other fields. We feel very optimistic that this kind of relations will become greater. [passage omitted] [end recording]
