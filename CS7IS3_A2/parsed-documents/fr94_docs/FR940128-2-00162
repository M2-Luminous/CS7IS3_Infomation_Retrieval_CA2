ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: On December 13, 15, and 15, Umatilla Deputy Forest Supervisor, John P. Kline, Wallowa-Whitman Forest Supervisor, R.M. Richmond, and Baker Resource Acting Area Manager, Dorothy Mason, respectively, made a joint decision to amend the Land and Resource Management Plans (Forest Plans) for the Umatilla and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests and append the Bureau of Land Management, Baker Resource Area Management Plan, to include the Wallowa/Grande Ronde River Management Plan (including the Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic River). This plan identifies use levels, facility development levels, resource protection measures, and set the general management direction for managing the Wallowa/Grande Ronde River, including the designated Grande Ronde Wild and Scenic segment. This amendment is necessary to implement the Omnibus Oregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which required the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to develop a management plan for the Grande Ronde River. Interim direction was identified in the Forest Plans and Resource Management Plan. The environmental assessment documents the analysis of alternatives for managing the Grande Ronde Wild Scenic River in accordance with the Omnibus Oregon Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. For the Umatilla and Wallwoa-Whitman National Forest, this decision is subject to appeal pursuant to Forest Service regulations 36 CFR part 217. The 45 day appeal period begins February 1, 1994 and ends March 17, 1994. Notices of Appeals must meet the requirements of 36 CFR 217.9.
