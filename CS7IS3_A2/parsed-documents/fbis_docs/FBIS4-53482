FBIS4-53482 "dreas097_d_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea Chongwadae Defines 11 Issues as `Core Tasks' Chongwadae Defines 11 Issues as `Core Tasks' SK1905071994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0628 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905071994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 19 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's office at Chongwadae, which has been embroiled in unexpected political disputes in recent months, is trying to climb out of the rut and forge ahead by tackling major pending issues. Since President Kim returned home from visits to Japan and China in late March, it wouldn't be exaggerating to say that Chongwadae hasn't had a single day of respite beginning with the controversial revision of the Uruguay Round trade accord. This was followed by violent clashes between conservative and reformist monks at the Buddhist Chogye order, a disruption in the wholesale operation of farm and fishery products, the Sangmudae scandal, the problem of resettling North Korean lumberjacks who escaped from logging camps in Siberia and, of course, the seemingly never-ending North Korean nuclear row. But taking Wednesday -- a national holiday -- as a turning point, Chongwadae wants to put the series of events behind it and make a fresh start as most of these issues found resolution and government officials are awakening from their much criticized lethargy. Chongwadae selected 11 "core tasks" on Thursday and proceeded to tackle them. They are: -- Strengthening of the international competitive power of Korean companies through stable labor-management relations and steady push for a new economy, -- International trade and trade policy, -- Measures to spur development of the farm and fishery industries to cope with the effectuation of Uruguay Round accords, -- Expansion of social infrastructure, -- Buildup of an information superhighway network -- Persistent development of advanced technology, -- Steady easing of administrative restrictions, -- Educational reform aimed at boosting national competitive strength, -- Steps to stabilize consumer prices and other aspects related to the people's livelihood, -- Political reform aimed at realizing clean politics, and -- Diplomatic, unification and national security policy. These are the problems on which Chongwadae wants to work and set forth broad outlines before President Kim visits Russia on June 1, according to sources. Presidential aides are being careful, however, not to repeat the past pattern when a string of unforeseen events occurred following the return of President Kim from overseas trips. They hope that Kim's visit to Moscow will not be followed by an another series of thorny events. President Kim spent a quiet holiday Wednesday as five North Korean loggers arrived in Seoul for resettlement in the South and the National Assembly settled down to conduct a parliamentary investigation of the Sangmudae scandal. Kim took the initiative in creating "an atmosphere" in which all government officials can work hard at their given tasks. He has invited freshmen and sophomore lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party to Chongwadae for what his aides called "frank and unassuming" discussions of various problems this week. The president also met with lower-ranking presidential aides at Chongwadae and gave them a pep talk. On Thursday morning, he held a meeting of seven junior presidential secretaries on economic affairs and urged them to take the lead in the government's efforts to increase the nation's competitiveness. "Even if there are some disputes in the political sector, we can tide over any national difficulty as long as the economy moves ahead smoothly," Kim reportedly told the secretaries. Kim is expected to invite another batch of first- and second-term DLP lawmakers to Chongwadae, including Reps. Sin Kyong-sik, Kwon Hae-ok and Yi Myong-pak, for dinner to express his thanks for their parliamentary work and to ask them to continue striving for political reform. Kim's meetings with lower-ranking DLP lawmakers or back-benchers and working-level presidential secretaries are unprecedented. In fact, this is seen by many as part of Kim's efforts to soften his image as "a hard president."
