[Text below title]For Seep Waters and the Electrotechnical Industry -- by Joerg Brandes. Many microorganisms feed off substances which are poisonous to humans. Scientists from the Society for Biotechnical Research (GBF) in Braunschweig have discovered that bacteria can be used to clean up water contaminated with mercury. Mercury gets into the environment from burning trash, industrial waste waters and the sewage system, but also from volcanic eruptions. Since heavy metals are not biologically degradable, they can gradually build up in the food chain and become, finally, a danger to humans and animals. Today there a variety of technological processes available for "fishing out" poisonous heavy metals out of waste water. New in the selection are biological processes in which the heavy metal is taken up by the organisms into their biomass. In looking for possible microbes the GBF scientists in Braunschweig soon struck it lucky. They correctly assumed that mercury-resistant microorganisms would have to be found near sources where a lot of the heavy metal accumulated. Among these, for instance, would be waste waters from the electrotechnical industry or from seed protectant or fungicide plants. Basically, however, mercury is as harmful to bacteria as it is to other living organisms. Microbes which take up very much of it must therefore at least be able to transform it into a biologically "tolerable" form. With the help of a special enzyme, mercury reductase, the bacteria convert the mercury into a metallic form which is much less toxic. More than twenty naturally occurring bacterial strains have since become known which possess this enzyme. Tests are carried out in so-called fixed-bed reactors in which microorganisms are colonized on a medium. The contaminated water is passed over the [bacteria] and loses the greater part of its toxic cargo in the process. The filtered-out metallic mercury is precipitated out in the form of small pellets in the reactor. After completion of the process the bacteria are removed and the remaining heavy metal is distilled off. The medium can then be reused. Since the enzymatic transformation of the heavy metal occurs in a very directed way and is practically non-reversible, it is particularly well suited to the treatment of waste waters with a mercury concentration of less than 5 mg per liter. Prof. Wolf-Dieter Deckwer, head of bioengineering at GBF, considers seep water from trash dumps, for example, to be suitable, as well as seed treatment operations where mercury compounds are heavily used. To widen their scope of application, microbiologists are giving their bacteria a little boost genetically. They have succeeded in joining in one strain of Pseudomonas putida two characteristics which do not occur together in nature: the microbes can split particularly toxic organic mercury compounds as well as convert the resultant--and still toxic--cations of the element.
