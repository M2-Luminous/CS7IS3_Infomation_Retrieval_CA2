The State Duma in a statement called for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss NATO's military involvement in the Bosnian war. The statement also suggested that measures be taken to prevent the escalation of the Bosnian conflict. The UN peacekeeping force should not be used by any bloc to carry out military actions, the statement stressed, adding that Russia was worried by the fact that NATO continued its policy of using force as the means to solve the crisis in former Yugoslavia. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also described as "unreasonable" NATO's air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions around the embattled Gorazde, saying they could only result in the worsening of the situation there.
