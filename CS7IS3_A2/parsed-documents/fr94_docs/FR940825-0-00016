FR940825-0-00016 FR940825-0-00004 Rural Electrification Administration 7 CFR Parts 1744 and 1753 RIN 0572&hyph;AB08 Post-Loan Policies and Procedures Common to Guaranteed and Insured Telephone Loans; Telecommunications System Construction Policies and Procedures AGENCY: Rural Electrification Administration, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Rural Electrification Administration (REA) hereby amends its post-loan regulations for telephone borrowers to ease borrower reporting requirements and further clarify existing REA policy. In addition, REA amends the telecommunications system construction regulations to relax requirements for minor facilities construction procedures, to make technical corrections and clarifications, and to reflect minor technical changes such as moving the definitions section from one subpart to another. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective on September 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Orren E. Cameron III, Director, Telecommunication Standards Division, Rural Electrification Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 14th & Independence Avenue SW., room 2835&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500, telephone number (202) 720&hyph;8663. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Executive Order 12866 This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and therefore has not been reviewed by OMB. Executive Order 12778 This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This final rule will not: (1) Preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Have any retroactive effect; and (3) Require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification REA has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq .). The REA telephone program provides loans to REA borrowers at interest rates and terms that are more favorable than those generally available from the private sector. REA borrowers, as a result of obtaining federal financing, receive economic benefits which exceed any direct economic costs associated with complying with REA regulations and requirements. Moreover, this action liberalizes certain contract requirements by changing contract limits and allowing negotiation of fee schedules which further offsets economic costs. Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements In compliance with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR Part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511) and section 3504 of that Act, the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this final rule have been submitted to OMB for approval. Comments concerning these requirements should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for USDA, room 3201, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. National Environmental Policy Act Certification REA has determined that this final rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq .). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance The program described by this final rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under 10.851, Rural Telephone Loans and Loan Guarantees, and 10.852, Rural Telephone Bank Loans.
