I wish to outline the following: The report briefly referred to the Greek Cypriot side's arms. However, it failed to mention that the Greek Cypriot side has a strike force of nearly 100,000 men -- 80,000 of them in the reserves. The remaining part of that force is made up of Greek Cypriot and Greek military units. Meanwhile, the report said that some 30,000 Turkish troops are based in north Cyprus. In a strange approach, it compared the number of the Turkish troops with the population in north Cyprus and described the situation as the most intense military fortification in the world. That description alone indicates how the esteemed UN secretary general views the problem. The Turkish troops have not arrived to quarrel with the Turkish population. They are there to defend Cyprus, and the Turkish Cypriots, against the Greek Cypriot military forces that wish to eliminate the Turkish Cypriot population. They defend the peace in Cyprus. As I have already mentioned, the Greek Cypriot side is capable of organizing an army of 100,000 men in a short period. The Greek Cypriots are in the process of allocating naval facilities and an air base to Greece. However, the esteemed UN secretary general has ignored all that. Another point, which has drawn my attention, is the UN secretary general's accusation that the Turkish troops have created problems in the efforts to have military units in certain border points withdrawn. He noted in his report that Turkish troops informed the UN officials that they should contact the Turkish Cypriot authorities because the matter is of a political nature. The Turkish troops cannot be blamed. They only explained the situation in north Cyprus. They informed the UN officials that the matter should be discussed with the politicians in the north and that they would comply with the instructions they would receive on the withdrawal of troops. However, the esteemed UN secretary general, who acts on behalf of the UN Security Council, does not wish to recognize the Turkish Cypriot authorities. Consequently, he has not contacted us on the matter. He has done that deliberately. So, he has been unable to pursue the UN Security Council's proposal on the withdrawal of troops from the confrontation line. We ask that they recognize the regime in north Cyprus, agree that we exist, and hold talks with us. They cannot achieve anything without holding talks with us. That is what I wish to say at this point. The TRNC Government will assess the situation and give the necessary reply. Another point is the UN secretary general's complaint that we have converted the St. Barnabas Church into a museum. I have found that very strange because the Greek Cypriots have destroyed 117 mosques in the past. However, no reference has been made to that at all. We have been trying to preserve the unused Greek Cypriot churches as much as we can. Furthermore, we have been trying to use them in an appropriate way. Unfortunately, they have complained even about that. Considering all that, we shall protest against any complaint from the UN secretary general on the question of the churches in north Cyprus if he fails to recall the fate of the 117 mosques. We have lost 117 mosques. In view of that, we want that matter to be continually stressed. We lost many of our cemeteries. We also want that to be stressed. All this indicates the stand of the two communities against each other. [end recording]
