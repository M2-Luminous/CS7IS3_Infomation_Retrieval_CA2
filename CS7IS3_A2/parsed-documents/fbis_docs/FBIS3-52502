There is no immediate solution to the problem of these foreign nationals and the apparent moves initiated by the government from time to time seem a futile exercise. Nothing concrete could be achieved in the past nor are there any chances of success in future. Most of these Arabs, primarily Egyptians, Tunisians and Algerians, are engaged with various non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working for the welfare and rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees across the NWFP [North West Frontier Province]. Their major concentration is in Peshawar. Recently there have been serious allegations against these foreigners for their involvement in a number of terrorist activities in their mother countries. Pakistan it is learnt, has come under quite a lot of pressure from those countries following the increased militant activities, including bomb explosions and armed attacks on the government officials as well as on the foreign visitors by the religious groups. However, the dilemma was that Egyptian, Tunisian and Algerian nationals cannot be extradited even if their respective government formally demand because there is no extradition treaty between Pakistan and these countries. A senior Interior Ministry source explained that these foreign nationals can only be arrested under the Foreigners Act for their illegal entry or over-stay in Pakistan. They can be tried in the court of law and punished for these offences but can't be extradited to their countries forcibly. "The legal process is that we can deport them to the country where these people may wish to go and that for only if that country is willing to accept them. If no other country is ready to welcome them, then they must remain in jails. The process also involves the concerned embassy officials and the Foreign Office", the Interior Ministry official said. He also said that there were hardly 300 to 400 such foreign nationals now working with various Afghan groups and in international NGOs [non-governmental organizations] helping the rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees. He said that the government has no plans to initiate any action against these NGOs because they are working on humanitarian basis to help the displaced Afghans. These NGOs are also a big [word indistinct] factor for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the Afghan refugees, he added. The official said that all the foreign nationals engage with these NGOs are under close watch. However, as they manoevre across the border [word indistinct] freely, it is very difficult to keep track of them. "Still our agencies are keeping an eye on their activities", he said. The officials dispelled all apprehensions about a major action against the NGOs working for the Afghan refuges. It is out of question. They are helping the refugees a great deal and are of great assistance to the Government as such. However, any foreign national found illegally staying in the country will be dealt with appropriately", he warned.
