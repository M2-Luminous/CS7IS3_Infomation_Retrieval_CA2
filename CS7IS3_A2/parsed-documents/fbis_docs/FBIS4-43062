I would like to warmly thank Socialist Party [PS] members and Socialist candidates whose dedication, strength, and courage made this new Socialist victory possible. Please allow me a word of special thanks and admiration for Antonio Vitorino. For me, in all honesty, he is the big winner of these European elections, and I believe that the country and the PS have in him a top political figure who will make a decisive contribution to our democracy in the future. This Socialist victory, I must confess, is particularly welcome. Above all because of the difficult circumstances under which the Socialist Party had to fight this electoral battle. Not long ago it was said that these were the most difficult elections for the PS. Even so, and according to the official forecasts available at the moment, the PS has managed to win. In so doing it has won elections in Portugal for the second consecutive time -- which had not happened since 1976. [passage omitted] This victory strengthens the relation of trust between the country, between the Portuguese and the PS. But it also strengthens our responsibility in preparing a serious alternative government for Portugal. An alternative that we do not want to prepare alone. We want to do it with an intense dialogue with the whole of civil society, with the many independent candidates who are willing to collaborate with us to provide a future for our country that is better than the present. [passage omitted] In our opinion it is not enough to change the government. It is necessary to change the way Portugal is governed. It is necessary to have a better democracy in Portugal. A democracy with more dialogue, with more participation, where power and resources will be more decentralized toward the regions and local government. Also, a democracy with more transparency in order to combat more effectively favoritism and corruption that have disappointed so many with Portuguese political life. It is also necessary that those who govern are more attentive to the need to give an absolute priority to education, or rather to the education-professional training sector. It is through people's qualifications, through a complete backing of society for people's training that the success of our joint building of an European future may depend on. The success of our ability to compete in world markets -- that are increasingly more difficult for a country such as Portugal -- may also depend on this. We want more backing for economic growth, more support for those who produce and work. Above all we want a total nonacceptance of the unemployment figures, with the spread of poverty and with the lack of safety in the streets that poverty helps to nurture in our country. We also want greater justice in our taxes and the social services to which we have access, health, education, housing, and social security. It is the preparation of this alternative that we want to carry out together with Portuguese society, aware that it is today increasingly more needed in the country. [passage omitted] We want to help to nurture a new hope in Portugal, a new confidence in our future as nation, affirmed in Europe, and universally, as always. Allow me a last word on the abstention rate. In our opinion, this has penalized above all the PS. A party whose electoral support comes increasingly from the youth sector and the cities. Therefore, it is natural that there was some discrepancy between the opinion polls, which did not forecast it, and the final result that marks the extent of the Socialist victory. I disagree totally with the prime minister over the meaning of this abstention rate. I believe an important part of this is connected to the disappointment among Portuguese with regard to political life and the way the government is being governed. I am not only talking about the government. I am talking about the institutions and the political parties themselves. Therefore, I would like to reiterate here, as Dr. Antonio Vitorino has already done, our total commitment to a reform of the political system. I would like to call on the leaders of the other parties to collaborate with us, within the framework of the revision of the Constitution, toward obtaining a new balance between the participation of citizens and representative democracy, and that this new balance helps to overcome this relative disappointment, this relative ill at ease, and enables once more to reconcile the Portuguese with the functioning of our democratic political system. [passage omitted] I would like to end by reiterating, once more, that in the same way the Portuguese have placed their trust in the PS, they can do so in the future, and that we will do out utmost to justify the hope that has been placed on us.
