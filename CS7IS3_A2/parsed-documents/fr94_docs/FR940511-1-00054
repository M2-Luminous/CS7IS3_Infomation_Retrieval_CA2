FR940511-1-00054 FR940511-1-00012 To be consistent in our terminology, we propose to amend §255.4(a)(2)(iii) to replace ``type'' with ``category'' when referring to various kinds of providers. We propose the same revision for §§255.1(i) and 255.3(c). Payments for Child Care for Children With Special Needs For the purposes of this section only, in discussing payments for child care, we use the term ``special needs'' to mean children with mental or physical impairments that substantially limit one or more of the major life activities, i.e., ``disabilities'' as the term is used in the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Special needs in this preamble discussion does not mean foster care, protective services, bilingual/cultural needs or other broader considerations sometimes attached to the term, for example, for the purpose of targeting as required by the CCDBG regulations at §98.44(b). Americans With Disabilities Act The Americans with Disabilities Act, enacted on July 26, 1990, provides comprehensive civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the areas of employment, public accommodations, State and local government services, and telecommunications. The ADA is administered by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). However, most States have established a central contact, usually in the office of the Governor or Attorney General, and questions about the ADA should be referred to that contact first. In addition, DOJ has established a technical assistance Information Line for public inquiries. The Information Line is available 24 hours daily at (202) 514&hyph;0301 (voice) or (202) 514&hyph;0381 (TDD). (This number will be replaced with a toll free 800 number in the future.) Lastly, written inquiries about the ADA may be directed to: U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Public Access Section, P.O. Box 66738, Washington, DC 20035&hyph;6738. Of particular consequence in the context of paying for child care is title III of the ADA which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by private entities in places of public accommodation. The ADA defined public accommodations as facilities whose operations affect commerce and fall within twelve specified categories, including social service center establishments. The implementing regulations for the ADA, issued on July 26, 1991, specifically include ``day care centers'' as public accommodations and clarified that places of public accommodation located in a private residence are covered by the ADA. The ADA uses the term ``day care center'' as a generic term for all categories of out-of-home child care providers. In contrast to many other Federal non-discrimination laws, a public accommodation does not have to receive Federal funding to be covered by the requirements of the ADA. Thus, with a few very limited exceptions specified in the ADA, all child care providers who provide services to the public are covered by the ADA. While most provisions of the ADA have been well understood, there has been considerable confusion about its impact on payments for child care, particularly when such payment is subsidized. In light of the ADA, we believe it is important to discuss the payments for child care for children with special needs under ACF-administered child care programs. We are therefore proposing clarifications to the regulations which address payments for child care for children with special needs. The ADA regulation at 28 CFR 36.301(c) states: ``A public accommodation may not impose a surcharge on a particular individual with a disability *␣*␣* to cover the costs of measures, such as the provision of auxiliary aids, barrier removal, alternatives to barrier removal, and reasonable modification in policies, practices or procedures, that are required to provide that individual *␣*␣* with the non-discriminatory treatment required by the Act *␣*␣*.'' In response to ``whether day care centers may charge for extra services provided to individuals with disabilities,'' the preamble noted that §36.301(c) ``is intended only to prohibit charges for measures necessary to achieve compliance with the ADA.'' (56 FR 35564, July 26, 1991.) Thus, the ADA and its implementing regulations do allow caregivers to charge higher rates for special needs, provided those higher charges are for services beyond those required by the ADA and are not for the purpose of recouping the cost of measures required by the ADA. States need the flexibility to determine on an individual basis how best to meet the needs of children with special needs. It is our intent that such children receive quality child care in developmentally appropriate settings so that they may reach their maximum potential and grow into responsive and responsible adults. Providers should be compensated, within the ADA regulations, for those developmentally appropriate child care services provided to children with special needs in order to ensure that these children do not go unserved and the quality of care is not affected. (At the same time, such compensation must be consistent with the cost principles applicable to expenditures under the program.)
