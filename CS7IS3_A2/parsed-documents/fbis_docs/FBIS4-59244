They said negotiations between PLO and Israeli officials in the occupied territories as well as contacts between the Israeli government and the PLO leadership in Tunis had led to an understanding that the deployment could begin Thursday. One of the key preconditions, according to reports from occupied Jerusalem and Tunis, is that PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat announce his autonomy cabinet which will run the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho in the initial phase of the Sept. 13 Israel-PLO agreement signed in Washington. As the first concrete step towards the deployment, several senior officials from the police force, drawn from units of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) based in Jordan and Iraq, entered Jericho on Wednesday to inspect areas designated for the police force to take up positions, the PLO officials said. They returned to the East Bank later in the day. "We expect the deployment to begin in earnest on Friday," said a PLO official. "An advance unit of a few officers and men will enter on Thursday, but the actual entry will formally begin 24 hours later." Brigadier Haj Isma'il Jabr, commander-designate of Jericho, said "a platoon of my forces will be allowed into Jericho at an early hour Thursday morning." A platoon consists of 50 men. "A second batch of approximately 300 men will be allowed into Jericho Thursday afternoon to be followed by nearly 400 men on Friday," Brig. Jabr told the Associated Press. Brig. Isma'il blamed the four-day delay in the entry into Jericho on technical problems--primarily that some of the men did not possess travel documents. "The main problem was because some of the policemen do not have any travel documents, such as passports or identification cards," he said. He refused to disclose their number or how the problem was solved. But a security source,quoted by the AP, estimated the number at 100 and said the Kingdom had agreed to provide them with Jordanian passports. Highly-placed PLO sources described the delay as a tactic by the Israelis. "They want to tell us that nothing has changed by the peace agreement and they are still in control," said one source. "Keeping the force camped out near the bridge under international media limelight is their way of telling us that they still call the shots," said the source. [passage omitted]
