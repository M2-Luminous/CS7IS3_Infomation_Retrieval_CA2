Lloyd Bentsen held that the United States and China should expand cooperation in various fields because it is not only in accord with the basic interests of the people of the two countries but also conducive to peace and development in the Asia-Pacific region and the world. Zou Jiahua pointed out that the current level of relations between China and the United States are the result of joint efforts of the two countries. The two sides should cherish such relations. He said: Since the Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle last November, exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields have made headway. However, the two sides should continue their efforts to further improve and develop relations between the two countries. Zou Jiahua hoped both China and the United States would, based on the fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, gradually overcome their differences at present through negotiations, set their eyes on the future, and promote the healthy development of relations between the two countries.
