During the plenary, Esteban Lazo Hernandez, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba in Santiago de Cuba, made a special intervention in which he pointed out the moment requires all the firmness of the revolutionaries; in that sense, he stated: [Lazo] "That is the reason I say that we are in times of very profound thoughts that reflect the state of mind of revolutionaries, patriots, and Cubans. We must get everyone to join the battle. But let us not forget that during these difficult times we must win the battle with real revolutionaries and with patriots. We will not win this battle with the mediocre, with those who change sides, or with pessimists. This battle must be won by patriots. We must win this battle for the future of our fatherland." In another part of his intervention, before members of the CDR in El Caney, Esteban Lazo said that despite the efforts made by the Revolution there is still ingratitude; he gave an example from the life of Jose Marti: [Lazo] "Marti said to Gomez, when he made him head of the Liberating Army: I make you head of the Liberating Army knowing that you will accept; I can only offer you the sacrifice of your life and the possible ingratitude of men. Today, there is ingratitude, but above it is the honor of Cubans." After talking about these realities, Lazo, who is also a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, pointed out that despite all the difficulties, our economy is beginning to recover. He gave specific examples. [Lazo] "We have our refinery. How long was our refinery out of service? Today it is operating. That is an expression of recovery. Rente, which was producing between 37 and 38 megawatts, is now producing 230 megawatts, and, by the end of the year, should have all its units ready to work. This gas plant that is near here [words indistinct]. How about the textile factory? We have established a plan with the Mexicans for producing approximately 18 million square meters. In other words, we are seeing a recovery in our economy." These were comments made by Politburo member Esteban Lazo Hernandez, vice president of the Council of State, in a special intervention made at the plenary held with CDR members in El Caney, where, in the presence of Sixto Batista Santana, the application of decree-law No. 149 was affirmed.
