The premier made the remarks after his brief meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno, who attended a meeting of top financial officials from the Group of Seven (G-7) economic powers in Washington late last month. "We (Hata and Mieno) discussed economic issues in a wide range. Yen and U.S. dollar rates should reflect both countries' fundamentals," Hata told a group of reporters. The U.S. dollar moved little with fears of dollar-supporting intervention by the Bank of Japan after opening at 101.80 yen in Tokyo on Monday, 0.58 yen lower than Friday's quote.
