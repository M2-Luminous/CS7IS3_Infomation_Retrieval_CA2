According to a report by the Comptroller General's Office, Panama's public debt totaled $7.228 billion on 31 December 1993. The debt is broken down as follows: $1.916 billion, or 27 percent, is internal public debt; $3.795 billion, or 53 percent, is external public debt; and $1.517 billion, or 21 percent, is overdue interest and commissions corresponding to the foreign public debt, mostly international commercial banks. (Percentages are as published.) The document says that the amortization of this debt demands the largest disbursements from the state's budget, with the exception of the government payroll. The country's public debt is 1.1 times larger than the 1993 GNP, which the Office estimates at $6.5619 billion. In an effort to amortize this amount, the government allocated $693 million in the current fiscal year's budget to service the internal and external public debt. This amount is equivalent to 18 percent of this year's allocation for the public sector's operating expenses and to 23 percent of current revenues.

She said that Panama leads with 12,496 registered ships and a gross tonnage that exceeded 77 million as of 15 January 1994. The department expects to collect about $43 million in direct revenues this year. The country received $41.33 million in direct revenues last year. In addition, indirect revenues from ship registrations amount to more $60 million, Garibaldo said. (Panama City ACAN in Spanish 2037 GMT 23 March 94) The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise the daily interbank interest rate to 3.50 percent will particularly affect those who borrow for consumption, amortize mortages, or refinance enterprises. In Panama, the most important effect of this decision is that the country will now be negotiating with private banks a substantial portion of its debt, more than $2 billion in principal and close to $1.3 billion in interest. Since October 1993, the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy has raised the cost of Panama's commercial debt by an estimated $20 million annually. Arturo Tapia, president of Wall Street Securities, has said that the higher interest rates should not harm Panama's economic growth because such rates are taken into consideration by investors.
