A Chinese Embassy spokesman issued a press release on Li Teng-hui's so-called "holiday" visit to Thailand. The press release reads: Regarding the "holiday" visit to Thailand by Taiwan's Li Teng-hui and his delegation, the Chinese side had repeatedly explained its stand and made solemn representations to Thailand in advance. The Chinese side had repeatedly pointed out that Li Teng-hui, in the guise of holiday-making, had attempted to develop "substantive relations" with Thailand, to create "two Chinas" in the world, and to damage and disturb the existing friendly relations between China and Thailand. China hoped that Thailand would have taken into acount its overall interests in the maintenance and development of the Sino-Thai relations and cancel Li Teng-hui's visit to Thailand. We notice that although His Excellency Prime Minister Chuan Likphai did not meet Li Teng-hui, Li Teng-hui did visit Thailand and meet some Thai leaders and senior government officials. Therefore it has violated the commitment made by the Thai Government on the Taiwan issue when China and Thailand established diplomatic relations. This is deeply regrettable.
