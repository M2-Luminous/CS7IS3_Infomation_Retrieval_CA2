Politicians and bureaucrats are not fully aware of this. The Ministry of Finance [MOF] has been trying to revive the idea of raising the consumption tax rate after its idea of instituting the national welfare tax was scrapped. Has the ministry even once asked the general public about what they were thinking in regards to such an idea? Nor will the public distrust of this out-of-the-blue idea of a "7-percent rate" [for the consumption tax] dissolve just because the government Tax Commission has started to review the matter. Everybody knows that the Tax Commission, as all commissions are, is only a puppet. The MOF went out all out to work on Diet members of the ruling and opposition parties. They "sought understanding" from influential businessmen as well. When told that raising public utilities charges would offset the effect of the [income] tax reductions, Tadashi Ogawa, director of the MOF Tax Bureau, countered: "All you have to do is not ride taxis anymore." We were shocked by such dogmatism. Can they not see anything beyond political interests? Let us view politicians and the administration as "intelligence models." Both politicians and the administration are media that reflect the public will on policy matters -- the politicians do so through elections and the administration through services they provide. Gap That Comes by Adopting a Party-Oriented System The parliamentary democracy system cannot but be an incomplete system. That is because it cannot reflect promptly enough the needs of the constantly changing economic society. If the single-seat district system becomes a reality, there will be many more impotent votes [shihyo--votes for the losing candidate] than before, thus further widening the gap [between the parliament's actions and actual needs]. In a two-party system, the parties need to present all of their policies -- ranging from those concerning welfare to national security -- in one package. The voters have no choice but to choose from the given packages, and are given no chance to vote on individual policy issues, such as the consumption tax. But in a complicated and fast-changing economic society, it is close to impossible to simply say yes or no to policy packages presented by political parties. The party-oriented system can catch the public will only in "rough image scanning lines," and frustrations from "impotent votes" are bound to develop. Underneath the existing mood of political distrust represented in the existence of so many parties are the politicians' lack of ability to formulate policies, the structural problem of the politicians scrounging for interests, and the disappointment of the voters, who voted for major parties, about becoming "impotent votes." On the other hand, the administration does not have organizations to absorb private-sector needs other than bureaucrat-elected review councils and public hearings. The inevitable consequence of such a closed system is that the bureaucrats get themselves deeply involved in politics by manipulating to get their own views adopted [by the review councils and public hearings]. Last fall, General Secretary Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] came up with a concept of inaugurating parliamentary deputy minister posts. No doubt, the situation of the politicians' failing to do their homework and having to depend on parliamentary specialists to answer questions in the Diet is regrettable. On the other hand, Ozawa's concept will enable the politicians to get too close to more political interests, while failing to offer any way of minimizing the "impotent votes" issue. It would be too simple-minded if one believed a large number of politicians -- just because they are armed with petitions from their constituencies -- represent the public will in reality. An alternative to that is to create a by-pass that can minimize the "impotent votes" issue not on the political side but on the administrative side. Since the existing Constitution allows national referendums to be conducted only on a Constitutional amendment and on national review of the Supreme Court; it does not allow the referendum to be conducted on individual policy matters, it will not be easy to expect the legislature to go all out for a national referendum on policy matters. But we must recall that, testifying before the House of Representatives Budget Committee on 3 February 1978, Sanada, then Cabinet Legislation Bureau director, said: "I do no think instituting a system whereby the Diet can conduct national referendums to determine the general will of the people on individual matters and to use it in reference to the Diet's deliberations on bills would constitute a violation of the Constitution." (Then) Prime Minister Fukuda, who spoke after him, then stated: "Public opinion surveys conducted under Diet initiative can be useful." We can find a model for the by-pass in this statement. The "green papers" system that made its debut in the United Kingdom in 1967 is worth considering as well. The UK House of Representatives proceedings define the green papers as "written government documents concerning proposals to be presented to the people of the nation in quest of discussions -- except the matters of policy already decided on." In the UK, the government policy outlines are presented to Parliament in the form of white papers, and legislative bills are formulated based on these white papers. But when the bureaucrats decide it is necessary to ask for views of the public, green papers are prepared and issued as reference materials before formulation of the white papers. The people who prepare the green papers are groups of officials concerned from ministries and agencies. Hundreds of organizations concerned, intellectuals, and the general public are asked to comment on the green papers, and then the green papers' contents are revised to reflect these views. Once that is done, the contents are incorporated into the white papers. It will not be easy for Japan to jump to the green papers system that was born in the custom law system of the UK. But Japan should accept and adopt the function of the green papers, which is aimed at having the public will absorbed in new policies of the matters that have much to do with the people's lives -- for instance, those on welfare and tax. Some people are cautious about the national referendum system. They assert it is "a direct democratic system which jumps over the indirect, parliamentary democracy system." But the green papers system is an "indirect democratic system on policies" that supplements Diet efforts for deliberations; nor does it make light of the legislature. Public Opinion System Being Formed Suppose Japan decides to adopt a by-pass system. In what manner should it operate? It is unrealistic to ask the general public on all policy matters. Hence, its application should be limited to those matters that concern the lives of all the people, but over which interests could differ -- such as those on the consumption tax or pensions. Second, the subject matters must be those for which policies are yet in the process of being formulated. If the people are to review draft policy matters already in the parliament as legislative bills, the parliament will lose the reason for its existence. If the system serves the purpose of a "public opinion survey" to collect information necessary in formulating policies, that should be good enough. The administration should make analysis and predictions as detailed as done in formulating the green papers, and should present results of its review, offering a number of specific possible policies to choose from. It should never do such a thing as presenting a proposal to increase a tax, but hiding the increase rate it seeks from the public. The existing government office think tanks, closed as they are, are busy day and night preparing materials to be used in review councils and drawing up answers to be used in Diet interpellations. If the think tanks can use more of their time in coming up with alternative policies that are convincing to the people, the organizations can become more "open organizations" indeed. The surveys need not cover all the eligible voters. If they are of enough scale to eliminate the deviation prone in statistics, that should be good enough, even though a some sort of braking system may be necessary. The results of the surveys may be only for information, but the politicians cannot ignore such results. Distance between policies and the public will is causing the "closed society" to be closed even more. If we cannot expect the politicians to reform themselves, there is no choice but to open up the shell of the administration, and put a pipe of the public will through it.
