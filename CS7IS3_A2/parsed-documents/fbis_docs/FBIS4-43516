Responding to an announcement by SDP Deputy Chairman Thierse that the SPD was ready to form coalitions with the PDS at the municipal level, FDP Bundestag Group Chairman Solms said in Bonn on Wednesday [15 June]: "That would be out of the question for the FDP." The FDP will not cooperate with the PDS at the local or any other level, just as it will not cooperate with the Republikaner. FDP General Secretary Hoyer accused the SPD of evidently wanting to assist the SED [Socialist Unity Party of Germany] successor party to achieve respectability with its "tendency toward expressions of friendship." On Tuesday evening, the FDP Bundestag Group debated for hours about its poor performance in the European elections, but there were no demands for personnel changes or changes of directions. However, like the party's federal board, the group also expressed concern that the FDP's image as "an independent force" is only perceived in a blurred way as a result of numerous compromises with the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU [Christian Social Union] coalition partners in Bonn. The FDP must place more emphasis on its independent character in the election campaign. On Wednesday, Solms justified the agreements within the coalition: "It would have been much worse to reject compromise and thus be unable to make any decisions in German politics." As a result of the "inevitable" Bonn compromise, supporters of the FDP voted for the CDU, said Solms. "The FDP lent votes to the CDU/CSU" and the FDP will get them back. The FDP will make it clear that the coalition cannot be continued if the FDP is not strengthened. The FDP will hold discussions with the Greens and show that the FDP still represents views based on the rule of law state, even if those views are not currently the focus of attention. The Greens cannot pretend to be a modern FDP. Speaking to this newspaper, board member Baum said: "What we, essentially, have once again is a debate about direction." The CDU/CSU has "shifted to the right." That has affected the FDP's politicians specializing in economics. Left-wing liberals have not gone to the CDU/CSU, but to the Greens, and they must be won over again. The FDP must ask itself: "Where are the voters -- are they to the right or left of the center?" The only answer can be to seek lost territory to the left of the center. That is something that economic liberals, out of concern for their seats, have recognized: "Many would most of all like to carry Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger like a monstrance in front of them and immediately drop her after the Bundestag elections."
