"Enterprise collectives are rapidly moving towards an economic abyss", "a deliberate destruction of the industry is underway"--these quotes from the remarks of conference speakers reflect quite precisely the mood that reigned in the conference hall of one of the "secret" research institutes. Directors complained about high electric power rates; about specialists leaving; about the government not paying for the output it had placed orders for. A little more of all this, and the Petersburg VPK will be finished for good. The discussion culminated in a petition to the president, the prime minister, the chairmen of both chambers of the Federation Council, and the Security Council, prepared by the working group of the Association of Industrial Enterprises and adopted unanimously by 138 enterprise directors. Noting that the defense industry is in a critical condition, directors insist on holding, no later than the end of March, a special meeting of the parliament that would discuss the situation in the country, formulate the goals of socioeconomic reforms being conducted by the government, and work out a mechanism of officials' responsibility for carrying out government decisions. Also adopted (and also unanimously) was the text of the draft for a presidential edict on the measures of ensuring availability of finances to pay for state defense orders, which will be sent to Moscow together with the petition. Despite these decisions, however, almost all speakers complained about lack of attention on the part of the government, which until now has not reacted at all to proposals and letters of defense industry captains. Having come to the conclusion that it was useless to rely on Moscow, the directors decided to look for a way out of the crisis on their own through joint efforts, and to prepare and adopt within the next few days a plan of anticrisis measures for Petersburg VPK enterprises. The directors' hopes that they will finally have the opportunity to tell the mayor and government representatives face to face what they think of them, did not get realized. The government was represented at the conference only by Yuriy Kozlov, a deputy chairman of the State Committee for Defense Industry, for whom everything said here was no news. Neither did the originally planned meeting with Anatoliy Sobchak take place. The mayor excused himself on the grounds of an extremely busy schedule, and instead sent his first deputy, Dmitriy Sergeyev.
