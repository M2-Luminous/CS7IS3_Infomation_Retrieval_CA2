Herd blood tests must be conducted or the herd must be confined to the premises under quarantine within 30 days after notification that brucellosis reactors were found on the MCI test, unless a designated epidemiologist determines that: ( 1 ) The brucellosis reactor is located in a herd in a different State than the State where the MCI blood sample was collected. In such cases a State representative or APHIS representative must give written notice of the MCI test results to the State animal health official in the State where the brucellosis reactor is located; or, ( 2 ) Evidence indicates that the brucellosis reactor is from a herd that no longer presents a risk of spreading brucellosis, or is from a herd that is unlikely to be infected with brucellosis. Such evidence could include, but is not limited to, situations where: ( i ) The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that has been sold for slaughter in entirety; ( ii ) The brucellosis reactor is traced back to a herd that is certified brucellosis free and is 100-percent vaccinated; or, ( iii ) The brucellosis reactor showed a low titer in the MCI test and is traced back to a dairy herd that is 100 percent vaccinated and has tested negative to the most recent brucellosis ring test required by this section for herds producing milk for sale. * * * * * Class B State or area. *␣*␣* (a) *␣*␣* (2) *␣*␣* (ii) Brucellosis reactors _(A) Tracebacks.
