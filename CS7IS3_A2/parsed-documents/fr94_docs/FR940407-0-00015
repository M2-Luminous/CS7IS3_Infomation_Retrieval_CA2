FR940407-0-00015 FR940407-0-00003 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 18 CFR Part 284 [Docket No. RM93&hyph;4&hyph;000] Standards for Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations Issued April 1, 1994. AGENCY: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, DOE. ACTION: Final rule; order accepting data sets and implementation guide. SUMMARY: On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a final rule in this proceeding requiring pipelines to implement standards and protocols by June 1, 1994. The Commission is accepting standardized data sets providing information related to released capacity and an implementation guide for downloading this information using Electronic Data Interchange according to standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12. DATES: Pipelines must implement the data sets and implementation guide by June 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michael Goldenberg, Office of the General Counsel, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;2294.

To access CIPS, set your communications software to use 300, 1200, or 2400 bps, full duplex, no parity, 8 data bits, and 1 stop bit. CIPS can also be accessed at 9600 bps by dialing (202) 208&hyph;1781. The full text of this notice will be available on CIPS for 30 days from the date of issuance. The complete text on diskette in WordPerfect format may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, La Dorn Systems Corporation, also located in room 3104, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Order Accepting Data Sets and Implementation Guide Issued April 1, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the Commission issued a final rule in this proceeding requiring pipelines to implement standards and protocols by June 1, 1994. 1 The rule required pipelines to provide information included in standardized data sets on their Electronic Bulletin Boards and to permit users to download this information using Electronic Data Interchange according to standards promulgated by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12. 1 Standards For Electronic Bulletin Boards Required Under part 284 Of The Commission's Regulations, Order No. 563, 59 FR 516 (Jan. 5, 1994), III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles Â¶ 30,988 (Dec. 23, 1993). In the rule, the Commission recognized that as pipelines began the implementation process, they might discover that changes or modifications to the standardized data sets were necessary. The Commission also recognized that an ASC X12 implementation guide would need to be developed to correspond with the final data sets. The revisions to the data sets and the implementation guide were to be developed by the industry Working Groups that had been working on these standards, and the Working Groups were to provide the required documents to the Commission in sufficient time to permit implementation by June 1, 1994. On March 4, 1994, Working Groups 1 & 2 filed revised capacity release data sets and an implementation guide for downloading these data sets using Electronic Data Interchange according to ASC X12 standards. Public notice of this filing was issued on March 7, 1994, with comments due by March 15, 1994. Only one comment was received, from the National Registry of Capacity Rights, Inc., which supported acceptance of the data sets. The Commission is accepting the data sets and implementation guide to be implemented by the pipelines by June 1, 1994, subject to the order on rehearing in this proceeding. Pipelines should not delay implementation of the data sets until the Commission's rehearing order. Should the Commission grant rehearing and eliminate any data elements, those fields simply would be left blank. If the Commission determines to add fields to the data sets, the Commission will not require those fields to be implemented by June 1, 1994. The Working Groups would be given the opportunity to design the new data fields for later implementation. The data sets will be made available at the Commission's Public Reference and Files Maintenance Branch, 941 North Capitol Street as soon as is possible. In the final rule, the Commission required pipelines to provide downloads using a standard ASCII format. On March 10, 1994, public notice was given of an ASCII file structure submitted by Enron Gas Service, with comments due by March 17, 1994. On March 18, 1994, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA) filed a comment to clarify that the ASCII file structure was not a consensus product of the Working Group. INGAA also asserts work is underway on an alternative approach that would make ASCII files available to users without requiring the pipelines to maintain two separate standards, ASC X12 and ASCII. Numerous parties also have sought rehearing of the requirement to provide ASCII downloads. The Commission will determine whether to require an ASCII download, and the implementation date if it is required, in the rehearing order. If the industry or Working Groups formulate an alternative approach, they should inform the Commission of that approach as soon as possible. The Commission Orders The data sets and implementation guide filed on March 4, 1994, in this proceeding are accepted to be implemented by June 1, 1994, subject to the order on rehearing in this docket. By the Commission. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8301 Filed 4&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;P
