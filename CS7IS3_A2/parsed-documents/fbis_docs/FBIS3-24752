A nighttime curfew was imposed on the town after Thursday's incidents, which accompanied a strike by government workers and schoolteachers, whose representatives met Civil Service Minister Henri Rakotovololona. Troublemakers got out of control and began attacking the stores of the traders, known as Karanas, when schoolchildren took to the streets as the negotiations were under way, witnesses said. Police used tear gas and made two arrests as the demonstrators subsequently went to residential districts and set the homes of some Karanas ablaze. The wealth and success of the Indo-Pakistani community is in stark contrast to the poverty of many residents in the industrial town, which saw a similar outbreak of anti-Karana rioting in 1987, observers said. The 28,000 Karana control about 40 percent of the economy of the Indian Ocean island, according to estimates, and the community has not merged with other Malagasy peoples, even if most of its members have lived in the country for four or five generations.
