Upon his arrival here this evening, Qiao said that over the past two years, especially after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China last November, the relations between the two countries have entered a new stage and bilateral economic relations and trade developed rapidly. "I have come to Germany for an official and goodwill visit under such a situation," he added. He was sure that his current visit will achieve good results and help push forward bilateral ties. Hans Klein, vice president of the Federal Assembly of Germany, who greeted Qiao at the airport, said Germany attaches great importance to its relationship with the Asian countries. Germany particularly values its ties with China, a big country with a population of more than one billion, he said. Klein noted the rapid development of the relations between the two governments, saying that Qiao's visit to Germany symbolized the beginning of the high-level contacts between the parliaments of the two countries. Qiao arrived in Berlin on January 16 to start his German visit. He came to Bonn from Hamburg to meet his German counterpart Rita Suessniuth and other Parliament leaders.
