Laszlo Tokes, honorary president of the Council, has sent a letter to the representatives. Our special correspondent Peter Marvanyi reports. [Marvanyi] Only 30 days remain from the six-month period that the Council of Europe gave Romania to fulfill the conditions laid down when Romania was admitted as a Council member. To this day, Romania has not fulfilled one single obligation it undertook, not even those which directly affect the Hungarian minority in Romania, their minority, and human rights. Bishop Laszlo Tokes, HDUR honorary president -- who is not present here in Miercurea Ciuc -- has warned the Council of Representatives about all this in a letter. The parliament, or more precisely one of its committees, is drafting a resolution linked to this. By the way, yesterday, after reading out Bishop Tokes's letter, Csaba Takacs, executive chairman of the Council of Representatives, said the HDUR is constantly collecting documents relating to the Council of Europe's conditions and registering the events, or more precisely the actions which the Romanian Government has mostly failed to carry out. The HDUR will submit the material to international forums.
