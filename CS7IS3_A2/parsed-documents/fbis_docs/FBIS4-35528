Replying to the numerous questions aroused by her participation in the authority council's meetings without being a member of it, 'Ashrawi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: From the outset I have chosen to lead the independent Palestinian committee for human rights. It was my commitment, especially as it is an agency working for the sake of achieving the Palestinian people's public welfare. 'Ashrawi said that "what is more important than holding posts and assuming portfolios is to agree on a foundation and a binding working program from which the National Authority Council's work proceeds." That is what prompted her to participate in its meetings and in drafting its program to ensure that the principles and aims binding on the authority council have been prepared and drafted by numerous people from among the Palestinian people. [passage omitted] Responding to a statement by a Palestinian oppositionist, in which he said that in joining the authority council 'Ashrawi is exercising oneupmanship over the opposition, she said: "It has nothing to do with oneupmanship at all. I am not an oppositionist. Nor am I part of the authority. I am just part of society. And I believe that the language of oneupmanship have gone and been overtaken by events." [passage omitted]
