Abkhaz separatists killed, insulted, and robbed thousands of people. According to the recent information, certain people are still calling on the refugees from the Gali Rayon and other parts of Abkhazia to return to their homes in Abkhazia. The provisional committee is making this authoritative statement urging people not to be guided by such provocations. The committee warns categorically all forcibly displaced persons to stop entering the territory occupied by the separatists until the government adopts a relevant resolution.
