Debski from Moscow: "The Oleksy-Yeltsin Meeting"] [Text] On Friday [1 April] at the Kremlin in Moscow, Jozef Oleksy and Boris Yeltsin discussed Polish-Russian cooperation and European security. The Sejm speaker pointed to the need to prepare new agreements and treaties that would be more specific than the interstate treaty already in place because the state of our cooperation, especially economic cooperation, is poor. Yeltsin agreed with these arguments and promised that he would personally see to it that Minister Andrey Kozyrev responds quickly and specifically to the proposals of cooperation presented in Krakow by Foreign Affairs Minister Andrzej Olechowski. It seems that most important for the Polish members of parliament [MP's] were talks on European security for Poland and Russia. Even though no breakthrough was achieved in this area, the two parties discussed many controversial issues related to this subject. It is worth mentioning that Oleksy met with the Russian president, prime minister, and minister of foreign affairs. He also spoke with the members of three important committees (defense, international affairs, and budget) as well as four factions (on Friday--Yegor Gaydar's "Russia's Choice"). The Russians tried to win the deputies over to the concept of collective European security, based on the CSCE. All forces, including representatives of the reform camp (such as Sergey Stankiewich and Oleg Bogomolov) were rather unenthusiastic about the "Partnership for Peace" initiative. There is still controversy in Moscow over the Partnership plan: Yeltsin's spokesman said on Thursday that the Kremlin still needs six or seven months to hold consultations on this issue; as early as the following day, Minister Kozyrev declared that his country would join Partnership for Peace in April. However, the Russians' reluctance to accept the present concept of Partnership was clearly noticeable. They claim that the West is not treating them as an equal partner, "another architect of the new Europe," as Stankiewich put it. Jozef Oleksy kept saying, politely but firmly, that Poland sees guarantees for its security in NATO membership, and it will strive to achieve this goal, no matter how dissatisfied Moscow may be with such a solution. Summing up the entire visit, the speaker said the following at a press conference: "This is not the Sejm's foreign policy. This is merely the implementation of the main points of the state's foreign policy. The parliamentary platform helps to promote dialogue between various parties and political forces in both states." This exchange of views will be continued, perhaps also at the meetings of MP's from the Weimar triangle (Poland, Germany, and France), with members of the Russian State Duma.
