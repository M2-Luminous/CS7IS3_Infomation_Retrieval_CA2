FR941020-2-00147 FR941020-2-00083 3. Section 57(a)(1) of the Act prohibits certain persons specified in section 57(b) from selling securities to a business development company. Section 57(c) of the Act provides that the SEC may exempt a person from section 57(a)(1) under certain circumstances. The Management Company may be a person specified in section 57(b) and thus, sales of securities on a principal basis by the Management Company to MLVP II are prohibited by section 57(a)(1) and cannot be effected unless an order is obtained pursuant to section 57(c). 4. Applicants believe that the proposed co-investment with DLJ Capital and the acquisition by MLVP II of the Corporate Express securities held by the Management Company on MLVP II's behalf meet the statutory standards set forth in the Act. B. Amendment to the Prior Order 1. Section 6(c) permits the SEC to exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provisions of the Act if and to the extent the exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. 2. The Prior Order does not indicate whether upon the disposition of portfolio securities MLVP II must observe the 45% Limits. The requested amendment would clarify that the 45% Limit does not impact its disposition of portfolio securities. MLVP II believes that the requested amendment would place a limit on the extent that capital of MLVP II can be committed to joint transactions as of the time of an investment while recognizing that the liquidation of investments should occur in a manner so as to maximize returns to investors. MLVP II believes the requested relief meets the section 6(c) standards. The requested amendment would not affect condition 2(b) of the Blanket Order which limits co-investments with ``DLJ Investors'' to 25% of MLVP II's initial capital. Applicants' Conditions Applicants agree that the terms of relief are subject to the following conditions: 1. The Sub-Manager will review the proposed investment by MLVP II. The Sub-Manager will provide a written report to the Independent General Partners setting forth its valuation of the investment and its recommendations as to the acquisition of the investment, based upon its analysis of all factors it considers relevant. 2. Upon issuance of the order requested, MLVP II may acquire the Corporate Express securities held by the Management Company on MLVP II's behalf (the ``Securities'') from the Management Company provided that all of the findings and other actions required in subsections (d)(i) through (iv) of condition one of the Blanket Order 3 are met after receipt of the order and before the purchase of the Securities. The purchase price to be paid by MLVP II for the Securities shall be carrying costs (as described below) plus the lesser of (a) the fair value of the securities on the date acquired by MLVP II (as determined by the Independent General Partners, who may rely for this purpose on information proved by the Sub-Manager), or (b) the cost to the Management Company of purchasing the Securities (``Cost''). To the extent the value of the Securities is determined by the Independent General Partners to be less than Cost plus carrying costs, the Management Company may determine not to sell the Securities to MLVP II. 3 For the purposes of this condition and subsections (d)(iii) and (iv) of condition one of the Blanket Order, DLJ Capital shall be considered a ``DLJ Investor'' as such term is used in the Blanket Order. 3. Carrying costs shall be calculated from the date the Management Company acquired the proposed investment on behalf of MLVP II to the date of the acquisition of the proposed investment by MLVP II from the Management Company and shall consist of interest charges computed at the lower of (a) the prime commercial lending rate charged by Citibank, N.A., during the period for which carrying costs are permitted to be paid until MLVP II acquires the Securities or (b) the effective costs of borrowings by ML & Co. during such period. The effective costs of borrowings by ML & Co. is its actual ``average costs of funds,'' which it calculates on a monthly basis by dividing its consolidated financing expenses by the total amount of borrowings during this period. 4. For the purpose of conditions 2(b), 5, and 6 of the Blanket Order, DLJ Capital shall be considered a DLJ Investor so long as MLVP II and DLJ Capital both hold securities of Corporate Express. 5. MLVP II will maintain at its office written records concerning the purchase of Corporate Express series B convertible preferred stock, including a copy of the written report prepared by the Sub-Manager and written records of the factors considered by the Independent General Partners in approving such investment. 6. MLVP II will not have at the time of acquisition of a joint investment more than 45 percent of its assets invested jointly with all affiliates unless otherwise permitted by an order of the SEC. In addition, MLVP II will not make any new venture capital investments, other than follow-on investment in existing portfolio companies. For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
