FBIS4-57112 "drlat093_f_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-093 Daily Report 12 May 1994 CENTRAL AMERICA El Salvador Villalobos on Removal From Commission Villalobos on Removal From Commission PA1305003194 San Salvador Canal Doce Television in Spanish 0300 GMT 12 May 94 PA1305003194 San Salvador Canal Doce Television Spanish BFN [Report by Gandhi Montoya; from the "Up-to-Date Newscast"] [Text] Joaquin Villalobos, one of the eight FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] leaders separated from their post by the party's national council, said that he will not heed the resolution and that he will continue to work as a leader because he considers the measure applied by three of the five organizations that make up the former guerrilla organization to be illegal. The People's Revitalizing Expression, ERP, secretary general said that the FMLN's internal crisis does not end with the removal of these leaders from the political commission. He even mentioned the possibility of legally appealing against the FPL [Farabundo Marti Peoples Liberation Forces], the Communist Party of El Salvador, and the PRTC [Revolutionary Party of Central American Workers]. [Begin Villalobos recording] I belong to the Front as much as any other person. Just as I said there, with all due respect to our comrades, I am a guerrilla just like most of them or even more so in the case of many of them. [end recording] That is the position of the ERP's Joaquin Villalobos in the face of the FMLN National Council decision to suspend him together with seven deputies who are part of his organization as well as members of the Armed Forces of National Resistance. Villalobos said that both he and his comrades will continue their work as party leaders and said that the problem has not ended with the resolution adopted by the National Council. [Begin Villalobos recording] They cannot apply that measure, which only serves to broaden the framework for the debate. There are going to be legal debates, legal measures will be taken to counter this, there will be more national political debates, and I believe that at the same time arguments within each of the organizations will heighten. [end recording] Joaquin Villalobos said the decision to dismiss them is loaded with a dose of traditional past Leninist hegemony, which to his mind are notions that history is casting aside. The ERP leader said that in the long run the PRTC, the FPL, and the Communist Party of El Salvador will have to change. [Begin Villalobos recording] I believe we will be seeing more changes in the next few months, even the change of forces. I am not talking about of the ERP or the RN [Armed Forces of National Resistance], but the three other organizations; social democratic forces will take up center-left positions and agree with us in this debate. It is too early to try to interpret things. The next thing we will know is that everything is over with. I think this is what the more radical members want. [end recording] Villalobos admitted that this internal FMLN conflict has taken its political toll, but gave assurances that it is only temporary.
