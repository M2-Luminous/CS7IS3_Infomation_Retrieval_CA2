The interview lasted just minutes when the telephone line went dead. [Al-Jundi] The current situation in Yemen--who exactly is responsible for this military conflict? [Al-Ahmar] The situation in Yemen is terrible. The leadership of the Socialist Party is responsible. They created the political crisis and started the military confrontation. [Al-Jundi] Are you, as the leader of the Yemeni Reform Grouping, able to carry out mediation now between the Yemeni president and vice president? [Al-Ahmar] At the start of the crisis we tried very hard to play this role, and did play it, but the Socialist Party is being difficult, and created the crisis from the beginning. It had two demands: constitutional amendments and the election of a new presidential council. When these were granted, the party went on to make new demands, and we acceded out of our desire for unity, and all Yemeni forces tried to meet the demands that were made. All the demands included the pledge and agreement document, and we agreed to them in order to end the crisis and preserve the union. But after all the Yemeni forces, the coalition parties, and our legitimate institutions agreed to the document that had been signed, which granted all their demands, they revolted again and escalated the military situation, and attacked, in order to get what they really wanted: secession. [Al-Jundi] It is clear that you blame the Socialist Party for what is happening now. [Al-Ahmar] Yes. Yes, we blame them for what has happened. First, we blame them for creating the political crisis, and now we blame them for starting the military confrontation. We, the House of Representatives, have tried and are still trying to solve the crisis. We postponed some of the constitutional measures we had the right to take in order to spare the country and please these "mutinous" elements revolting against the legitimate government, and heading for military conflict and the escalation of the situation. Thus they bear the responsibility, and the entire people holds them responsible. [Al-Jundi] Is it possible to say that the dialogue committee has been playing its role in this current phase? [Al-Ahmar] The dialogue committee has carried out its duty to formulate the document and the coalition's agreement upon it. Everyone agrees that the crisis ended with the signature of the document, but the Socialist Party revolted as it had revolted at the outset against democracy--only now it was revolting against the document. [Al-Jundi] Al-Bid lays the blame on President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his speech on 27 April. [Al-Ahmar] The practical facts disprove that. President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih agreed to the document, signed it, and committed himself to it, and so did the others, the [General People's] Congress and Reform [parties]. The Socialist Party did not, especially Presidential Council Member 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salim Salih Muhammad, the Prime Minister, and the Socialist ministers. It has been two and one-half months since it was signed, and everyone is in agreement. The Socialist Party started the military confrontation to get what it wanted--secession. That is why we hold them responsible. [Al-Jundi] Are you able to play a role at present? [Al-Ahmar] There are no solutions beyond what is there in the document. If there is any role I can play as leader of the Yemeni Grouping, I will not hesitate. It was at this point that the phone went dead.
