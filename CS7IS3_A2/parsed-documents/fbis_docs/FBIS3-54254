In a nationwide broadcast, monitored in Islamabad, Rabbani said he would accept the people's choice. The embattled president, whose 18-month tenure ends in June, did not say if he was ready to immediately step down, as demanded by his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar. Hekmatyar is allied with Uzbek warlord and former communist general Abdol Rashid Dostam, who staged a coup attempt on New Year's Day. The bloody power struggle continues to rage in Kabul three weeks after the failed coup. "I am offering the people (the right) to choose a new leadership," Rabbani said, adding that the country's turbulent situation would have to dictate the manner in which this is accomplished. A new leader could be chosen either through a consultative council of elders or through elections, Rabbani added. However, he said if the nation opted for elections, the war-ravaged country would need assistance from the United Nations or the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC). The president did not set a deadline nor did he elaborate the mechanism. Rabbani said the January 1 coup had been orchestrated outside of Afghanistan. "It was an external conspiracy," he said. But he did not identify any foreign power. The president's speech came as Kabul was plunged into one of the fiercest battles since he assumed office. Rabbani said his forces would be ready to stop fighting against the mujahedeen of Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afganistan] faction, "but the battle with Dostam troops would continue until the communist militia surrendered or was crippled." "We can not allow conspirators to seize power by force," he vowed.
