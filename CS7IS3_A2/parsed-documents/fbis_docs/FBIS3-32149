The program hosts introduce Ross for what they label a Radio Assembly of the Cuban People. The hosts stress that the workers' assemblies are not a passing notion but a mass movement that includes over 3 million workers and now students, according to recent statements by Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Young Communists. Ross says: "I believe it is one of the most important, relevant political events of all time because no other country, ever, has conducted a workers' assembly to discuss national problems, particularly when the country is facing such a complex, difficult situation. It is precisely the workers' suggestions, their ideas, that become the basis for decisions. It is not a matter of conducting a parliamentary exercise. The goal is to conduct a true parliamentary operation to make decisions, suggest ideas, and promote action. We are gathering everything being said. There is even a computer program to store all the opinions and suggestions offered." Ross adds that the 1 million retirees in Cuba can join former workplaces to participate in the assemblies. Ross reiterates that management's reports to the assemblies must be clear, concise, and to the point, noting the exemplary report presented by the manager of La Corona Cigar Factory at its ongoing assembly. At this point, Ciego de Avila correspondent Fernando Sanchez states that approximately 120,000 workers will participate in the provincial workers' assemblies which began 1 February. Sanchez says that Ciego de Avila's Central Construction Enterprise workers called for increasing efficiency and cost reduction and discussed excess currency, unjustified sick leaves, confiscation of the money of the so-called macetas, and the need to increase production by increasing efficiency in the commerce and food industries. Santiago de Cuba correspondent Carlos Zanabria praises the concept of the workers' assembly as brilliant. When Ross interjects that it was President Fidel Castro's idea, Zanabria adds: "Brilliant, as is every idea of our commander in chief who has always helped us overcome highly complex national difficulties and thus enjoys such extraordinary admiration and the unlimited trust of the Cuban people." Zanabria stresses the need to make profits by producing with quality and efficiency, following the collapse of the socialist markets. Ross announces that on 10 February he will be at Palma Soriano's Abel Santa Maria Printing Enterprise in Santiago de Cuba Province because it is an outstanding example of how production and workers' efforts can be realigned. This industry has sought ways of employing workers usefully instead of releasing them from their posts; it has also added surplus workers from other workplaces to its personnel roster. Ross tells La Corona workers that he will visit the factory later in the day to discuss their efficiency and the issue of the 1 million cigars not produced. In response of a question by the host, Ross notes that "the workers' main suggestions have to do with increasing efficiency in the workplace" and gives examples of effective implementation of suggestions at the National Hospital, the Regla Fish Distribution Center, cigar factories, and the Finlay Research Institute. Pedro Ross adds that the key is efficiency, citing the sphere of sports, which is contributing to the economy in addition to having become self-financing. He has visited a milk complex that is producing a good quality soy yogurt through its workers' efforts. Those workers discussed at length how to make the most of available resources. Ross notes that the next phase of the process is management's response and stresses that the measures implemented will result from the workers' suggestions. Ross says he has refrained from offering ideas in order not to influence worker opinions, which he wants to come directly from them: "We want the workers to assume their roles as parliamentarians, as leaders of the country, and to determine the solutions to the problems we have." Ross goes on to say that the workers are being highly responsible in pointing the finger at those who hamper efforts, as well as at the bureaucratic tangle in many sectors that is obstructing efforts to move ahead: "I have heard this in all 12 assemblies in which I have participated: Our superstructure inhibits production and service efforts." The host stresses that the workers can trust that whatever economic measures are taken will most benefit the country while least affecting the people. Ross agrees, thanks the hosts, and adds that he may appear on the program again after visiting Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba next week.
