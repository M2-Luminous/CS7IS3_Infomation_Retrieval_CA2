SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FEIS evaluates a proposal to establish the Patoka River National Wetlands Project in Pike and Gibson Counties in southwest Indiana. Four alternatives, including a No Action alternative are being considered. The three action alternatives are aimed at protecting and enhancing the valuable resources of the Patoka River valley. The Project encompasses one of the last remaining stretches of bottomland forest in Indiana and the Midwest. It provides some of the best wood duck production habitat in the State and is used by threatened and endangered species including bald eagles and Indiana bats. Alternative 4 is the Service's preferred alternative. It proposes to acquire 22,083 acres of land from willing sellers. Full acquisition may take 20 years or more. 6,800 acres would be purchased as the Patoka River National Wildlife Refuge and Wildlife Management Areas would be purchased from within an adjacent 15,283-acre selection area. Project lands would be managed to protect and enhance bottomland hardwood forests, other wetland habitats, and complementary uplands. The goal would be to provide essential food, cover and resting areas for migratory birds, threatened and endangered species, and resident fish and wildlife; and to improve outdoor recreation and education opportunities for the American people. Copies of the FEIS have been sent to all landowners within the proposed Project boundaries; to federal, state and local government officials; interested parties; and to all individuals, agencies, and organizations who requested copies.
