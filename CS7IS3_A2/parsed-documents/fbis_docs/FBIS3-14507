Here are more details from Zohra Zemit. [Zemit] At the meeting which brought together the head of state and the FLN party delegation, the latter conveyed to the head of state a letter of proposals on the means for making the national dialogue successful and overcoming the current political crisis. The letter, a copy of which was received by the radio today, has pointed out that the chances, albeit very small, for making the national dialogue a success were still there. The letter hoped that the national dialogue, called for by the head of state, would not be another missed opportunity. Consequently, the letter added, that the FLN political bureau believed that the state, represented in the person of Mr. Lamine Zeroual, was called upon to take firm measures which would create chances for making such a dialogue a success, and would bring about a political relaxation which would allow the people as well as the rest of political and social forces to continue the dialogue, to get involved in it, and to prepare themselves to accept its outcome. The letter pointed out, furthermore, that the people were called upon this year to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1 November revolution and to be loyal to such a great revolution. The latter would require, however, the generation which fought it, including the head of state Lamine Zeroual, to mobilize itself to put an end to the confrontation between the Algerians, which has nearly blown away everything such a revolution has achieved. The letter concluded by asserting that the FLN political bureau was convinced that a serious and a profound dialogue between all Algerians, without any seclusion, would bring back hope to the people and would overcome the serious and complicated problems which have been threatening the country's stability, security, progress and independence. The Ettahaddi movement has issued a statement today, after its Coordinator Mr. Hachemi Cherif was received by the head of state Lamine Zeroual, in which it stressed its known stances towards the situation and the ways to deal with the crisis. With regard to the latter, it considers that redrawing the political map and the emergence of a new political class, on the basis of the project of modernization, were a pressing need for bringing about the rupture with all the methods and practices of the past. The Ettahaddi movement considered that the transition leading to a modern state of law compelled the country to embark upon radical structural reforms. This need goes hand in hand with the complete elimination of terrorism and fighting extremism relentlessly on all fronts, in the society and the institutions of the republic.
