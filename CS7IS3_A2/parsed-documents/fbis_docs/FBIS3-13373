In an editorial written by its chief editor today, Monday, the paper says that the Security Council's failure to pass a resolution of denunciation during the past two weeks is repulsive and indicates that the aim is to contain the revolution of world public opinion against the brutal measures against the Palestinian people. The paper calls on the United States to act as a fair judge, to stop being partial, and adhere to moral and humanitarian principles in its international dealing if it is serious in truly playing the role of superpower in today's world. The paper emphasizes that a clear vision of the flagrant aggression being suffered by the Palestinians will contribute to the resumption of the peace process in an atmosphere of trust until an agreement recovering the legitimate Palestinian Arab rights is reached. Thus, the paper concludes, the hope for a fair world order guaranteeing security and stability for all states and nations can materialize.
