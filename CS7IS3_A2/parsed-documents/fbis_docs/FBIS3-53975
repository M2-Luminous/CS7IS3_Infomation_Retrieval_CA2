This accord, which was signed at the Jordanian Foreign Ministry two days ago, acquires great importance, especially since it touches on one of the most sensitive issues within the framework of relations between countries; that is, the issue of security. The Jordanian and Palestinian sides focused their concern on bolstering cooperation and coordination to serve the distinguished relations between the Jordanians and Palestinians at this historical stage in order to achieve the utmost level of security and stability for the two peoples. AL-DUSTUR publishes the six points contained in the Jordanian-Palestinian agreement on cooperation and coordination--which the committee on security, territories, and borders that stems from the Higher Jordanian-Palestinian Joint Committee reached after two days of continuous meetings. These points form the basis for joint coordination between the two sides. They are: 1. The two sides will exchange information and coordinate on the peace negotiations in order to reinforce and unify their negotiating stands on the bilateral and multilateral tracks. 2. The Jordanians will continue to assist the Palestinians to prepare and train cadres and members of the security forces in various specializations. 3. The two sides will cooperate and exchange information in all fields related to the work of the committee in order to serve their interests for the higher national interest. 4. The two sides will form two subcommittees: one for security and borders and the other for territories. They will also form any other committee necessary for coordination. 5. The two sides will define the appropriate mechanism for coordination between them in all fields and provide suitable means to achieve this at every stage. 6. The two sides will continue efforts to reinforce bilateral bonds of trust, brotherhood, and distinctive ties to serve their joint interests.
