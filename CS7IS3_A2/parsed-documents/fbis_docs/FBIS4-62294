Our faction jointly spoke for passing this decision whereby it decided the outcome of the voting to a considerable extent. We realize that the structure of the submitted draft budget only preserves the position that prevails today in the national economy, and suggests no radical changes in its sorry condition. Clearly insufficient funds are set aside for education and science, the outlays for the maintenance of the state apparatus are too high, and so on. We are convinced that the size of the confirmed maximum level of budget deficit is on the verge of the so-called "controlled" inflation, whereas the amount of fiscal pressure allows for no invigoration of the economy whatever, suppresses private initiative, and prevents the possibility of creating new jobs on a large scale in conditions of growing unemployment. We did realize, however, that all delays in the Duma's discussion of the draft budget would have led only to additional government concessions to various lobby groups and a further bloating of the size of the budget deficit, which would have triggered a sharp deepening of the economic crisis. We realized that we could not have expected a better budget from the current Russian Federation Government (we could have expected a much worse one), and the finally passed draft still considerably limits the appetites of those agencies and sectors in the business of wasting the taxpayers' money, and puts the entire blame for the almost inevitable breaches of the confirmed budgetary indicators on the government. A nonacceptance of the budget would have amounted to raising the question of the government's resignation, something that is politically unrealistic today. We see our decision as a show of political responsibility and we do not share the stance of some of the factions that voted against the passing of the budget for other, purely political reasons.
