The interview begins with a discussion of Zedillo's childhood. When asked what motivates him, Zedillo says serving Mexico. At 0222 GMT Escribano says the country is experiencing some hard times. She asks how can they face the problems. Zedillo says they must remain calm and resort to the values that have given the country strength. Escribano notes the economy is on the right path, but there is still much unemployment. Zedillo responds: "I have pointed out again and again that unemployment is one of Mexico's most serious problems at present. Let me tell you that I have mentioned Mexico's four big problems. The first one, which I mentioned earlier, is insecurity and injustice, followed by unemployment, insufficient wages, and poverty and inequality. From my point of view, we have to attack these four problems on several fronts and simultaneously. We must have greater justice in our country. Why greater justice? What does it have to do with unemployment? We want to have a growing economy, one which creates jobs with plenty of productive investment." He goes on to say that the country must make an effort to train its workers, improve the infrastructure, and work on the social policy. At 0235 GMT Escribano asks whether the economic adjustment measures now need to be relaxed. Zedillo answers: "I believe conditions to stabilize the economy are essential to promote development that will benefit most Mexicans. You are right; I have heard people say that fighting inflation should not be so important. These people seem to forget that inflation affects the poorest Mexicans the most. The largest decrease in real salaries, in terms of purchasing power, occurred at the time when inflation reached the highest levels: the 1970's and 1980's. I believe having a healthy, balanced, and low-inflation economy is essential, but it is insufficient to generate widespread prosperity." The interview then moves on to the topic of education, about which Zedillo says the education system needs to be flexible, the opinions of teachers must be taken into account, and the bureaucracy must be reduced. At 0245 GMT they begin to discuss what type of father he is for his children and how he will balance his role as a father with that of being president. Escribano then asks how Zedillo views the future of Mexico. He says: "I look at Mexico's future with great optimism. As I said before, I look at it with great hope. Our problems are big, but our potential and determination as a country to confront these problems are great. I think there are solutions to our problems. I think that, historically speaking, the Mexican people have proven to possess an enormous capability to meet challenges even bigger than those we face at present. I envision Mexico at the end of this century or at the beginning of the next one as a strong and united nation, with an expanding economy, whose product will be distributed more equitably; a fully sovereign nation with a stronger democracy, as all Mexicans desire, a nation respected in the world." The final question is on whether he will participate in a debate with the other presidential candidates. Zedillo says he wants to debate the other candidates and is convinced the debate must take place. The interview and program end at 0255 GMT.
