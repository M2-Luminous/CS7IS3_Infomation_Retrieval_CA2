After all, who does not know that HAMSHAHRI has come so that His Excellency the Mayor will stay? In its commentary [on the first anniversary of the newspaper], HAMSHAHRI wrote: "We have sincerely tried, contrary to some existing newspapers, not to be the mouthpiece or spokesman for one specific line of political thought, to refrain from making our newspaper an instrument for "settling accounts" or "throwing rivals off the scene," and not to become involved in shallow press disputes." There is no doubt of the fact that HAMSHAHRI can be listed among those who are "indifferent" to the world of politics. However, undoubtedly we cannot agree that HAMSHAHRI is nobody's mouthpiece. It is very clear that analyzing important and basic domestic and foreign issues is not an easy task, and having political thought is a newspaper's strength and not a weakness, as our dear colleagues at HAMSHAHRI believe. But the fact that they have not chosen to enter this field is probably because they are unable to and not because they do not want to. [passage omitted] Finally, despite the remarks by HAMSHAHRI's proprietor that "our initiatives and innovations and our use of new techniques is good for competition" we should say that this competition with the other newspapers is not being carried out in a healthy atmosphere. HAMSHAHRI has acquired the new techniques by making use of the municipality's general budget, which is the money that the municipality gets from the people. And selling a newspaper at one-tenth of the price of other newspapers is press dumping [preceding word in English] and not healthy competition!
