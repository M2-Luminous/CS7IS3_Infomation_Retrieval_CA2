FBIS4-58836 "drnes089_j_94016" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Clashes Spread to Aden, Surrounding Areas Clashes Spread to Aden, Surrounding Areas Sanaa Forces Reportedly Routed EA0805183594 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1500 GMT 8 May 94 EA0805183594 Aden Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Text] A responsible source has denied foreign media reports, which quote the ASSOCIATED PRESS, that the forces of the oppressive gang of al-Ahmar have reached the al-Alam area, 30 km from the outskirts of Aden. The source said these claims were totally untrue. They were the product of the delusory imaginings of the military gang of the [word indistinct] al-Ahmar gang, who had succeeded in feeding these false reports to obfuscate the great defeats inflicted on their forces in Abyan, Qa'tabah, Radfan, and Kirsh. The source said that the remnants of the Amaliqah forces, which had claimed to have been on the outskirts of Aden, are now scattered on the al-Arqub after our heroic armed forces destroyed their main strongholds in Zinjibar and Ja'ar. At dawn today our forces succeeded in destroying the camp of the Amaliqah at Zinjibar completely, burning all stores, supplies, and ammunition. They destroyed a major portion of the Amaliqah vehicles and then pursued the remnants of the force, which fled in the direction of al-Arqub. The forces of the 30th Brigade, now deployed in their new positions along the Lawdar-Mukayras axis, were able to join up with the 20th Brigade in Mukayras this morning. As for the military situation in Lahij, the 2d Armored Brigade, which had been loyal to the bloody and oppressive al-Ahmar gang, was successfully destroyed. The camp at Lahij was captured. Many officers and other ranks were taken prisoner, and some tanks and military vehicles were captured. Most of them had been destroyed during the fighting in al-Rahah in Radfan over the past few days. The defeat of the 2d Armored Brigade made it possible to open the road between al-Dali and Aden, and for our armed forces stationed at Radfan and al-Anad to join up with the Abbud Brigade at al-Dali. The latter was provided with supplies after it firmly withstood, with exceptional heroism, an attack mounted on it by three brigades from the al-Hamzah Camp, central security forces, and Republican Guards from the Qa'tabah-ibb axis, in the heroic town of al-Dali. The inhabitants of al-Dali had been subjected to a mindless and indiscriminate artillery bombardment which lasted an hour a day over three successive days. The ground battles resulted in the destruction of tens of tanks belonging to the security three force -- loyal to the bloody al- Ahmar gang -- which attacked the town of al-Dali, but their tanks and military vehicles were overcome and are lying on the battlefield. The steadfast forces of the Abbud Brigade were able to capture the positions of the attacking forces in the [word indistinct] area of the town of Qa'tabah. The battles on the al- Dali and Radfan fronts resulted in the failure of an attack mounted by the 3d Brigade, from their positions in the town of Taiizz, toward Kirsh. The attacking tank squadron was destroyed, and many officers and other ranks were captured with their arms and equipment by the (Dabuzah) Brigade, which is deployed at Kirsh.
