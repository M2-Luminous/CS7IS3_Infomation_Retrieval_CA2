Larijani said this in talks with representatives of the German Government and parliament in Bonn. He is heading a small delegation of parliamentarians on a two-day visit to Bonn. Larijani is regarded as a close confidant of Iranian President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani. In their talks with him, Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth and Foreign Ministry State Secretary Dieter Kastrup directly raised the issue of the existing plea for pardon and asked for support. According to information available to DPA, the German Government now assumes that Szimkus, who is accused of spying for Iraq, will be pardoned in the spring. "Despite the difficulties, we are quite certain of this," a high-ranking government official told DPA. Under no circumstances is the Szimkus case "a matter for negotiation" in connection with the Mykonos trial in Berlin. [passage omitted] The three members of the Iranian parliamentary delegation did not raise the issue of the Mykonos trial in their talks, which included a meeting late this afternoon with Bernd Schmidtbauer, state minister at the chancellor's office. This was confirmed by Christoph Matschke, chairman of the German-Iranian group of parliamentarians, which invited Larijani and his delegation to Germany. [passage omitted]
