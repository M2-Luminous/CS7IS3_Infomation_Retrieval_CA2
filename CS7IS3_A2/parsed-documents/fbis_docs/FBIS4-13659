In its commentary today, the paper denounces the UN Security Council's insistence on not allowing the Bosnian people to obtain weapons to defend their lives, entity, and future, describing it as an ugly crime. The paper says that the United Nations has left the Serbian gangs to carry out their war against the unarmed Bosnian people without any serious, genuine attempt to put an end to the Serbian aggression, which has been going on for the past two years. The paper appeals to the states that defend justice to raise the issue at the International Court of Justice after the responsible organizations have abandoned the people and failed to fulfill their sacred duty.
