Janos Deak, commander and chief-of-staff of the Hungarian Army, told a press conference in Bucharest today. Deak has been the head of a delegation to Bucharest since Sunday. This is one of the regular official meetings between the two armies, Deak added. Lieut.-Gen. Dumitru Cioflina, Romanian chief- of-staff and Deak's host, led a delegation to Hungary in 1992. Since then several other meetings have taken place at the level of generals and troop officers. The Hungarian delegation held talks with Cioflina and visited an artillery unit in Ploesti. Gheorghe Tinca, inaugurated as defence minister on Tuesday, is to meet the delegation today. The commander of the Hungarian Army said that the change in Romania's defence leadership would not effect the presently fair, unbroken and wide- ranging cooperation between the staffs and units of the two armies, which has been capped by the "Open Skies" agreement. The discussions touched upon possible cooperation within the framework of NATO's Partnership for Peace scheme, which both countries have supported, Deak said. The Romanian partners provided in-depth information concerning the ongoing transformation of Romanian armed forces, including the forthcoming withdrawal of tactical and operational missiles, which the Hungarian delegation welcomed.
