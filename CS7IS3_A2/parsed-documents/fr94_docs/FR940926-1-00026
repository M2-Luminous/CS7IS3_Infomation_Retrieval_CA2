FR940926-1-00026 FR940926-1-00010 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 940958&hyph;4258; I.D. 081894A] RIN: 0648&hyph;AG92 Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes regulations to delay the opening of the first (roe) directed fishing season for the offshore component pollock fishery in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) management area from January 1 to January 26 of each fishing year. This action is necessary to achieve optimum roe quality and increase revenues from the BSAI pollock processed by the offshore component during the roe season. The proposed action also would prohibit vessels used to fish for BSAI or Gulf of Alaska (GOA) groundfish or BSAI king or Tanner crab prior to January 26 from participating in the offshore component pollock fishery until February 5. This 10-day prohibition on entry into the offshore component fishery would not apply to vessels used to participate in the Community Development Quota (CDQ) program prior to January 26 and is necessary to discourage participants in the offshore component pollock fishery from contributing to increased fishing effort in other fisheries prior to the start of the offshore component roe season. This action is intended to promote the fishery management objectives of the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. DATES: Comments must be received by October 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel). Copies of the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review/initial regulatory flexibility analysis (EA/RIR/IRFA) may be obtained from the aforementioned address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Fishing for groundfish by vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act and is implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. Current regulations authorize all BSAI trawl fisheries, including the pollock fisheries, to start on January 20 of each year. Existing regulations at ยง675.20(a)(2)(ii) also authorize the establishment of separate pollock total allowable catch (TAC) amounts for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands subareas and the Bogoslof District. Through 1995, the pollock TACs specified for each subarea and district initially are allocated among the Western Alaska CDQ reserve (7.5 percent), the BSAI operational reserve (7.5 percent), and the open access fisheries (85 percent, of which 35 percent is allocated to the inshore component and 65 percent to the offshore component). The portion of the TACs allocated to the inshore and offshore components is further apportioned into two seasonal allowances. The first allowance (roe season) is available for directed fishing from January 1, until April 15, and the second allowance (non-roe season) is available for directed fishing from August 15, until December 31. The Bering Sea pollock fishery has experienced increased harvesting and processing capacity and increased effort in recent years under the existing open access management regime. While the TAC annually specified for pollock in the last few years has remained fairly stable between 1.2 and 1.3 million metric tons, the increase in harvesting and processing capacity has led to increasing daily catch rates and reduced season lengths for both the inshore and offshore components. Three major factors affect the length of the pollock roe season: Annual TAC, the amount of pollock TAC apportioned to the pollock roe season, and amount of fishing effort. Regulations authorizing the seasonal apportionment of pollock TACs have been effective since 1991. In 1991 and 1992, 40 percent of the Bering Sea pollock initial TAC was apportioned to the roe season, and 45 percent was apportioned in 1993 and 1994. Since 1991, the length of the Bering Sea pollock roe season has decreased each year. The roe season pollock quota was harvested in 52 days in 1991 and 46 days in 1992. Effective June 1, 1992, through December 31, 1995, pollock TACs are apportioned among the offshore component, inshore component, and CDQ pollock fisheries. The 1993 roe season allowance apportioned to the offshore component was harvested in 33 days. The inshore component roe fishery lasted 63 days from January 20, through March 24. However, a strike by vessels delivering onshore delayed fishing until the first week of February. The inshore component's roe season pollock apportionment was harvested in about 48 days. In 1994, the offshore component roe season closed on February 18 (29 days), and the inshore component roe season closed on March 2 (41 days).
