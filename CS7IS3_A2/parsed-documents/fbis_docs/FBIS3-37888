Let me inform you in accordance with yesterday's Supreme Council instruction about the course of implementing two resolutions, of 17th and 23rd December 1993. [passage omitted] Primarily, on the recurrent issue of index-linking the population's deposits in savings banks and insurance contributions to the former GosStrakh [State Insurance] institutions, as well as settling the debt in respect of the former Soviet Union's securities. We realize the urgency and acuteness of this issue in view of the lack of nonemissive sources to cover compensatory payments. As a result of more in-depth work on the proposals put forward by people's deputies, citizens, and scientific establishments, the government has set up an interdepartmental working group of representatives of the Finance Ministry, Economy Ministry, Justice Ministry, Statistics Ministry, State Property Fund, National Bank, and the insurance company Harantor, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Mykola Zhulynskyy. Specific proposals will be made ready by 2 March of this year. The commission has begun working. [passage omitted] The next issue is that of the possibility of providing the population with the minimum selection of food products at fixed prices. Analysis shows fixing prices under the present conditions requires huge subsidizing funds to be set up to the amount of tens of trillions [as heard] karbovantsi. You all very well know our budgetary capabilities in this respect. Apart from that, to perform the functions of supervision and distribution centrally, the recreation of the former system of (?monitoring) and (?funding) will be required, i.e. virtually the recreation of the system of short supply. [passage omitted] Another issue that has lately caused passions to flare is currency regulation. The government's position on this question is univocal: We are for the regulation of [currency exchange] rates, which has to take account of the state of the economy in real terms and, accordingly, the relationship between prices for the main types of products of both ours and those of our principal trade partners, as well as the state of the balance of payments in relations with them. Together with the National Bank, we are constantly at work to improve the mechanism of currency regulation. That said, however, I would once again like to confirm the government's tough stance in that we will not agree to (?increasingly obtrusive) proposals effectively to restore the currency exchange activity. This in practice would legalize the speculative rate of the dollar, which would inevitably lead to prices rising steeply and the state of the economy destabilizing further. I cannot comprehend the position of the Ukrainian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on this issue. Does it really reflect the interests of enterprises and labor collectives? Despite the fact that a lot has been done to implement the Supreme Council December resolutions, the state of the economy remains extremely complex, but at the same time, there is nothing new in it. We have come to it together, the Supreme Council, the government, dependent and independent trade unions, local presidential representatives, and managers of enterprises. One thing I would like to ask you to do, however, is this: Let us finally stop looking for those to blame for the present state of affairs but honestly say that we are all to blame and that the economy has been taken hostage by our policies. What should be done in this situation and how and where should a way out be found? The simplest thing is to take the position of wrathful denunciation, endlessly dramatize the situation, and undermine the remainder of the people's belief that the state of affairs can be rectified. There is, however, another approach, which is doing the heavy work, without gratitude, in search of ways to overcome the crisis and (?making an effort) to increase the creative potential despite all the problems and difficulties. [passage omitted] So have we got any real opportunities to stabilize the situation? Firstly, we have to overcome the acute payments crisis in the national economy. It primarily reflects the state of the economy. Ineffective, high energy and resource consumption structural production, and serious drawbacks in the work of the banking system, as well as unstoppable cost and price rises, have aggravated the financial situation at enterprises, which under the inflation conditions has caused a catastrophic shortage of their working capital, the cessation of mutual settlements, lack of funds to pay wages, and a sharp fall in budget contributions. There are, however, other things that caused the payments crisis. They have to do with the absence of elementary control by local authorities and banks over the timeliness and completeness of settlements. [passage omitted] To solve the payment crisis, the government and the National Bank have found a compromise that makes it possible to begin to disentangle the nonpayment knot that was tied, insure the liquidity of commercial banks, and cause the actual movement of ready products to consumers, which would create conditions for the wages of enterprises's employees to be paid and payments to the budget insured. The issue concerning the allocation of 1.5 trillion [figure as heard] karbovantsi to pay the pensions has been settled, 700 billion to the wages of budgetary sectors' employees, grants, and benefits. Finances have also been provided for expenditure on the Chernobyl program, the Defense, Internal Affairs, and other ministries. One has to bear it mind, however, that financial resources are not unlimited. To improve the health of the financial situation by unsecured financial injections is impossible. This is a path to inflation rocketing higher, prices rising, and production degrading even further. This is why I would like to say frankly, mainly to state enterprises managers, that we have approached the boundary, beyond which ineffective high resource consumption production facilities have to undergo the clearance of their funds [sanatsiya], specialize in another field, or close down. The government, of course, will for some time support and guarantee the social security of the collectives employed at these facilities. Everybody has to realize, however, that the only way for enterprises to earn profit, wages, and funds is by selling their products. Second, the work of the agroindustrial complex and preparation for spring field work. I would like to note that last year's debts of the state [to the farmers] for the grain, sunflower, and sugar beet supplied, have been completely settled. At the same time, due to the payments crisis and insufficient sales of meat and diary products, there has formed a debt to producers from trade and processing enterprises to the amount of 1.5 trillion karbovantsi. This, in its turn, has caused a debt in terms of wages at collective agricultural enterprises to the amount of 1.3 trillion karbovantsi. Alongside of resolving the problem of nonpayments in the national economy, the issue of sale has to be settled. Apart from that, 1 trillion karbovantsi worth of credits have been allocated to subsidized industrial centers and consumer cooperative organizations to purchase food and industry products. Within the framework of a government credit, 2 trillion karbovantsi have been allocated mainly to purchasing petrol, oil and lubricants, fertilizers, spare parts, and other resources with the aim of financially backing the agroindustrial complex. Under the state contract the countryside will again receive around 2 trillion karbovantsi in March. [passage omitted] An additional 2 million tonnes of white petroleum products has been bought, with 400,000 tonnes having already been received by now and sent to farms. It will have been 500,000 tonnes by the end of the month. Fuel prices have been fixed, with farms being supplied with it on average at a price of 4 million karbovantsi per tonne and the strictest control over its storage and use established. Virtually all sowers, cultivators, and harrows have been made ready and the readiness of tractors is higher than last year, at over 80 percent. To purchase spare parts, 14.5 billion rubles and over 5.5 million German marks have been allocated. MinMashProm [Machine-Building Industry Ministry] has determined the volume of additional production to manufacture 1,600 articles of spare parts previously imported. Farms have been fully provided with seeds of grain, sugar beet, sunflower, potatoes, and most varieties of vegetables. To provide mineral fertilizers, MinSelHosProd [Agriculture and Food Industry Ministry] has been granted a government credit of over 400 billion karbovantsi. [passage omitted] Third, concerning the work of the fuel and energy complex: Last year an additional 3.6 million tonnes of coal were supplied by power industry workers than was envisaged by the plan. As regards the coke-oven industry, the plan was achieved. In order to stabilize the work of coal enterprises, measures were taken to increase supplies of timber, rubber belting strips, ropes, personal protection equipment, and other resources. Contracts have been signed for the delivery of 80 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia and Turkmenistan in 1994. Work is also underway on concluding agreements for the supply of oil and oil products. A new clearing system for gas has been introduced for enterprises of the Ministry of Industry and Ministry of Machine-building. It envisages that their enterprises will pay independently for gas supplied to them. A resolution has been adopted on state regulation in order to restrict the increase in prices for oil products. The government has practically established daily control over the work of thermal and nuclear power stations. This has enabled the work of Ukraine's energy system to be preserved and has prevented its collapse, thus avoiding catastrophic consequences in the country's economy. [passage omitted] With the aim of stabilizing the work of sectors in the fuel and energy complex, we are preparing a range of measures to provide assistance particularly to those sectors. The building of new capacities for the production of electricity is being sought. The allocation of hard currency resources to purchase the necessary materials and equipment is envisaged. [passage omitted] Fourth, trading relations with CIS and Baltic countries have a special place in our economic policy. These are the traditional markets for products manufactured by Ukrainian enterprises. As of today, intergovernmental agreements on trade and economic cooperation have been signed with all the former USSR states, apart from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. A list of the most important products and goods that are subject to mutual deliveries has been drawn up. With the aim of overcoming the crisis in mutual clearances, appropriate work is being carried out between the National Bank of Ukraine and the Central Banks of the former USSR republics. As of 1994 there are agreements on mutual clearances with the majority of these countries and work is continuing with banks of Azerbaijan, Belarus, Lithuania, and Moldova. Work is continuing on developing bilateral relations with CIS countries and in other areas where there is mutual interest. Thus, principles of cooperation have been determined with Kazakhstan in the area of heavy industry, with Uzbekistan in the area of elaborating innovations and scientifically intensive production processes, and the processing and exploitation of rare and precious metals, with Belarus on eliminating double taxation, and with three other states on the mutual protection of investments. As before, we are paying particular attention and will continue to do so on the development of relations with the Russian Federation which is our main trading partner. Its share in Ukraine's foreign trade turnover is more than 72 percent. I recently returned from Moscow and would like to inform the Supreme Council of the complete mutual understanding reached during the talks between Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Soskovets, Fuel and Energy Minister Shafranik, and other members of the Russian Federation's Government. Apart from us Russia, is also actively in favor of developing bilateral cooperation. We have found mutually beneficial possibilities for paying off our debts for energy resources. We agreed on a pricing mechanism for oil and oil products depending on its quality and delivery conditions. With the aim of developing mutually advantageous and long-term cooperation regarding exports of Russian natural gas to Ukraine and its transit through our territory, a draft intergovernmental agreement for the years 1994/2005 has been prepared. [passage omitted] By way of conclusion I would like to say that the government is aware of the acuteness and the difficult situation in the country's economy. There are no illusions with regard to the simplicity of the issue and understanding the painfulness of those decisions that have to be taken on the path of overcoming the crisis. In carrying out the duties of acting prime minister and the government, we can see ways of stabilizing the situation and are doing everything possible in order to achieve this. Thank you for your attention.
