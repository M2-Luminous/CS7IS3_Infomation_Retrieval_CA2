Protection Force (UNPROFOR) clearly state which of the sides to the Krajina-Croatia conflict had violated the ceasefire, and specify the time and place of the violations. There is no reason why UNPROFOR should not say this, said General Novakovic, who chairs the Serb Krajina central board for the implementation of the ceasefire agreed between the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) and Croatia. R.S.K. military officials will submit a request to this effect to UNPROFOR Commander for Former Yugoslavia General Bertrand de Lapresle in Topusko on Sunday. General Novakovic stressed that the Serb side was willing to implement in full the ceasefire agreement negotiated by the two sides in Zagreb in March. This is our contribution to peace, in line with our lasting commitment to dealing with the conflict with Croatia only at the conference table, he stressed. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in those parts within the arbitrary Communist-era borders of Croatia were they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their rights. The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the Spring of 1992. General Novakovic indicated that the number of U.N. observers patrolling the line of separation between the belligerents was not adequate, and that UNPROFOR was still not using helicopters in the control and supervision of the ceasefire. These omissions on the part of UNPROFOR have resulted in inadequate control and hence inaccurate estimates of the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, said Novakovic. Representatives of the European Union's observer team conferred with R.S.K. military authorities at the R.S.K. capital of Knin on Saturday about cooperation and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement. The leader of the team, General Mourmouris Panagiotis of Greece, told the press that the talks had been frank, substantive and useful. R.S.K. Army Commander General Milan Celeketic said that common ground had been found on questions of mutual interest.
