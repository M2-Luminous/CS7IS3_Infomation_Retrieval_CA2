Speaking after hearing the deputies' speeches, Li Tieying said: To ensure a smooth implementation of various important reform measures this year, we should first of all make sure that the system is observed, to be followed by gradual adjustment of interests. The two should not go simultaneously. Governments at various levels should meticulously organize, conduct in-depth studies and investigations, and continuously make adjustments. Touching on Zhejiang's reform and economic development, Li Tieying said: Zhejiang's economic development has been quite unique; it depends neither on heavy state investment nor large Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign funds and achieves development with its own special economic potential, reflecting the inner quality of its economic development. Zhejiang is leading the nation in market construction, securing its leading position in China's markets, particularly the commodity market. Li Tieying expressed the hope that Zhejiang will continue to give play to this superiority; conduct bolder reform and exploration; develop intermediary service organizations; and standardize market construction by formulating as soon as possible trading rules, regulations, or interim regulations. In addition, it is necessary to develop markets for production factors. Government departments in charge of resources of production factors should study ways and means to standardize the production factors markets and gradually mature them.
