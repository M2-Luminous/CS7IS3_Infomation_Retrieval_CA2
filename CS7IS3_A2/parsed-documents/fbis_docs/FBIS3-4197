During the panel session, Zou Jiahua joined the Sichuan NPC deputies in discussing state affairs. He said: We should work for common prosperity, attach great importance to the development of western China, step up the development of Sichuan's communications and telecommunications, and successfully and rapidly develop the Sichuan economy. The Sichuan NPC deputies spoke without inhibition, and deliberated on Premier Li Peng's work report in a conscientious manner. While Chen Guanjun, Wang Rongsheng, and other Sichuan NPC deputies were speaking, Zou Jiahua conscientiously listened to their views and jotted down some notes. Zou Jiahua also exchanged views at the panel discussion with Xie Shijie [secretary of the provincial party committee], Xiao Yang [governor], and Yang Xizong [chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee]. Zou Jiahua noted at the panel discussion: We should pay attention to protecting, guiding, and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses, and should develop the economy in accordance with the law of economic operation, as well as in light of the actual local conditions. The construction of the Three Gorges Project is of paramount importance. We should conscientiously study and tackle problems relating to soil, sand, and silt in the project area, as well as the water pollution problem, and strive to make a success of water and soil conservation along the upper reaches of the Changjiang so as to benefit future generations. At the conclusion, Zou Jiahua stressed: In the course of economic development, Sichuan should give top priority to the development of communications and telecommunications, these being key to Sichuan's overall economic growth. Moreover, Sichuan should make full use of the "gold water course" of the Changjiang. To this end, the provincial and central departments concerned should work out overall arrangements for developing Sichuan's communications and should build the relevant facilities more rapidly.
