Pursuant to §§35.15 and 131.53 of the Commission's regulations, NUSCO also included as part of its filing notices of termination of the Service Agreement between CL&P and Wallingford (FERC Rate Schedule No. CL&P 413) dated October 17, 1988 and the Transmission Agreement between CL&P, Western Massachusetts Electric Company, Holyoke Water Power Company and Wallingford Re: Firm Power Purchase from the New York Power Authority (FERC Rate Schedule Nos.
