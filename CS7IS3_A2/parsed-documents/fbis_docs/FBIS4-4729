Igarashi said the purpose of the mission is to study construction costs. According to the ministry, housing construction costs in Japan are 30 percent higher than in the U.S. The ministry hopes to lower the cost by one-third by 2000. Increased imports of housing materials from North America have been cited as a way to lower prices. Officials from the ministry and the Housing and Urban Development Corp. will visit a factory that manufactures housing material and interview U.S. Government and trading company officials, the minister said. Igarashi said the schedule has not been fixed, but indicated that the team will also visit Canada, which also exports housing materials to Japan.
