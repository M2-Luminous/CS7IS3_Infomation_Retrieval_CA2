Responding to a question on the difficulties that the Hebron massacre has created for the peace talks and the fact that the massacre brought to the fore once again the issue of settlements, settlers, and their restraining effect on the peace process, Peres said: [Begin recording] [Peres] "I admit that what happened created many pressures and problems for us. We have to find the suitable solutions. In my opinion, the most important development that should happen now is the implementation of the agreement, not its revision. I believe that the Palestinians and Arabs will feel a dramatic change once they are in control of their lives in Gaza and Jericho. Soon afterward, it will be possible to begin negotiating other matters. But if we scrap the agreement and start on a new one, we will remain suspended in midair for a long time and people will lose patience and eventually confidence in the possibility of achieving peace." [Correspondent Mahir Shalabi] There is talk of a possible meeting between you and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat tomorrow in Cairo. [Peres] "No agreement has been made about this meeting so far." [Shalabi] If this meeting takes place, one of the issues that will be put before you is the deployment of international forces in the occupied territories. [Peres] "If the meeting takes place and this subject is brought up, I will probably have an answer." [end recording]
