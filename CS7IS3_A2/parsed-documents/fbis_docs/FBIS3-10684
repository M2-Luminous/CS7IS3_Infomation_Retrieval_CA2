The FNCD says it stands by its 16 February proposal, which is a realistic compromise that can get the country out of the deadlock. Daly Valet had a talk with Senator Turneb Delpe and filed this report: [Begin recording] [Valet] The FNCD is experiencing a bad moment, a moment when there is so much confusion that FNCD grassroots organizations and deputies who were close to the front want to distance themselves from the FNCD. This confusion has prevailed within the FNCD since the National Congress of Democratic Movements [Conacom] deputies and leader [Victor Benoit, also an FNCD spokesman] decided to support a parliamentary plan for resolving the crisis. Sen. Delpe, an FNCD spokesman, broke silence to say that they [not further identified] will solve all the problems being faced by the FNCD. As for the parliamentary plan, Delpe says it is dangerous. He says it is bad tactics for the parliamentarians to engage in the negotiations so directly as to propose a plan for resolving the crisis. [Delpe] I think that, after the Washington agreement and the Villa d'Accueil agreement, the Haitian parliament should have drawn conclusions, learned a lesson, from the experience and not involved itself again in any direct negotiations. Besides, now there is the Governors Island agreement, which has defined the role the parliament must play in the crisis: that is, pass the laws ensuing from the Governors Island agreement. I believe it would be in the interest of the parliament to set limits for itself so that it does not bear the brunt of this crisis once again. If things are tangled, I believe the only step the parliament should take now is to find a way to prompt the two protagonists to shoulder their responsibilities to disentangle the country. [passage omitted] [Valet] Evans Paul and Turneb Delpe, two of the FNCD's [three] spokesmen, have signed a press release asking the parliament to take President Aristide's position into consideration -- otherwise there will be no compromise, they said. As regards the position of Conacom, which has said it supports the parliamentary plan, Sen. Delpe says Conacom is an autonomous party within the FNCD and has the right to take its own position in an autonomous way. According to FNCD spokesman Delpe then, Conacom's position is not the FNCD's. [passage omitted] Thus, through two of its spokesmen, Evans Paul and Turneb Delpe, the FNCD has reiterated its determination to see President Jean-Bertrand Aristide return to Haiti. [end recording]
