The written message contained assurances that the United States did not seek to undermine the Islamic republic and urged Iran "not to take seriously" anti-Tehran comments made by a US official during a recent Gulf tour, the daily SALAM said. The assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, Robert Pelletreau, said earlier this week in the United Arab Emirates that Iran was a potential threat and he renewed US pledges to defend the region. Tehran and Washington broke diplomatic ties in 1980 after Iranian radical students stormed US embassy here and took its staff hostage. The United States has on several occasion called for direct negotiations to improve ties, but the two sides have yet to make a breakthrough. The latest message also expressed concern over Russia's "future threats" against the region and said Iran was geographically "well-placed to counter such an influence," SALAM said. But the paper said the message also criticised Iran's alleged human rights violations and support for international terrorism.
