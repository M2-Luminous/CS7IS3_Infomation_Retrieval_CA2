Last year, the output value of the capital's service sector increased by 39.5 billion yuan, with a growth rate of 12.9 percent over the previous year, stated a bureau spokesman. Burgeoning of the sector can be largely accredited to persistent efforts and preferential policies of the municipal government during the past several years. Large scale restructuring has been carried out according to the city's overall development strategy and many industrial enterprises incurring losses or causing pollution in downtown areas have been moved to the suburbs to make room for commercial activities. The Beijing Municipal Government has stepped up utilization of foreign investment in infrastructural fields like transportation and telecommunications, creating better conditions for the booming of service businesses. Taking full advantage of its wealth of science and technology, Beijing has put a great number of scientific inventions and achievements into production and gained much commercial success. Increase rates for its finance, insurance, international tourism, foreign trade and public utilities all topped the 11 percent mark last year. An official in the Beijing Municipal Government said, the output value of Beijing's service industry is expected to occupy 60 percent of the city's total by the end of the century, further consolidating its position as China's political and cultural center.
