In the middle of December, respondents were asked to evaluate what are the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government's three most positive and three most negative initiatives: Positive --It is open to a dialogue with social groups: 26.3 percent --It is (for the moment) less bad than the previous government 25.4 percent --It is moderate: 25.3 percent Negative --It is not delivering on its preelectoral promises (for instance, no new taxes): 33.1 percent --It lacks a clear program to face economic problems: 25.3 percent --It adheres to old partisan concepts (for instance, hiring its followers): 23.2 percent The ALKO poll was conducted from 5 to 12 December 1993, and the ALKO-MARTEL poll on 26-27 January [no further information]. Respondents were asked whether they were confident that the measures announced by the government are sufficient to face the economic crisis. In December, 23.6 percent expressed confidence, a figure that increased to 30.3 percent in January. Some 37.8 percent in December and 56.7 percent in January expressed their lack of confidence, while 35.3 percent in December and 9.3 percent in January said it was too early to judge. A total of 3.4 percent in December and 3.7 percent in January did not know. According to Loulis, two contrasting views prevailed following the October 1993 elections that brought PASOK back to power. The first maintained that the new government's grace period would be quite brief, given the public's weariness and increasing impatience. According to the second current of opinion, the grace period would be rather long, for such was the public's anger with the previous administration that the PASOK government would need time to "expunge negative memories." Poll results show that "the truth lies somewhere inbetween," Loulis notes. If the grace period seems to be holding, the first rumblings are being heard. "While the government may not awaken negative feelings, it is instilling increasingly less confidence about its abilities," Loulis comments. Therefore, the reason for the government's reluctance to adopt additional economic measures is the feeling that the public's tolerance is wearing thin. In fact, the December poll revealed that 32 percent of the respondents believe such measures are "necessary," but only 9.7 percent say they are "realistic" and 3.55 percent that they are "justified." According to the January poll, 18.5 percent view the measures as "leading to an impasse," 16.5 percent see them as "harsh," and 14.4 percent as "unfair."
