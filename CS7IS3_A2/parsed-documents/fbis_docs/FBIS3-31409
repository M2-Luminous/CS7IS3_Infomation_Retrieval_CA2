The current crisis in Slovakia broke out last week when the balance of forces between the government and opposition parties reached the ratio of 75-75 votes. "Since the summer 1992 election catastrophe (victory of Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, HZDS), the Slovak parliament has been neither a decisive part of Slovak politics, nor even a relatively respected part," Hrib writes. At present "the government has no support in the parliament, but the parliament is not capable of dismissing it." "In this situation only two existing projects can solve `the crisis'. The project of the Slovak premier and the project of the political remainder of Slovakia," Hrib says. If Meciar succeeds in calling a referendum to strip all deputies who have "betrayed" his movement of their mandates, Slovakia would be faced with one prospect -- "quick adoption of a law protecting the republic, repressive measures against Hungarian fellow-citizens, and the settling of accounts with `anti-Slovak' critics in court," Hrib writes. The deputies whom Meciar would like to dismiss from parliament are one-time Foreign Minister Milan Knazko and seven of his followers who left the HZDS last march, and six deputies from the coalition Slovak National Party (SNS) who have refused to obey Meciar. "The opposition project... offers three alternatives -- first, to call early elections, second, to create a broader coalition without Meciar (this is almost within reach since the Alternative of Political Realism faction was created within the HZDS), and third, to form a union with Meciar (but according to the latest information the (post-communist) Democratic Left Party has refused to cooperate with Meciar)," Hrib says. "Early elections would probably change practically nothing because according to polls, the present deputies would fill the parliament again. Meciar would again be the strongest, though less than now, and Weiss would again be decisive, maybe more than now. Generally speaking, post-election politics would duplicate the present exactly," Hrib stresses. "An SDL coalition with Meciar would civilize the expressions of the new government, but would further deform economic policy towards leftist solutions: budgetary deficit, "controlled" inflation, and subsidies to state enterprises. In a certain way the Weiss-Meciar union would be the worst alternative for Slovakia. It would be a union of vulgar amateurism with the still living socialist illusion." "The broader coalition without Meciar, which is almost certain (since Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy Premier Roman Kovac created the Alternative of Political Realism), will be a coalition between the right and the left, between nationalists and ex-communists, and their ideological opponents. The result will be a shapeless, internally chaotic coalition. Its discords and incapacity will necessarily result in early elections (the future coalition partners themselves do not deny this at all). The likely result of the elections is described above," Hrib points out. "What Slovakia needs is neither a broader coalition without Meciar, nor a Meciar-Weiss union. Slovakia cannot be salvaged by new elections either. The only road towards healing Slovak politics leads paradoxically outside it -- it rests in the appearance of a new voter. Indeed, if there is a crisis in Slovakia, it is neither a crisis of the HZDS nor of the parliament or parties, but a long-lasting crisis of the Slovak voter," Hrib concludes.
