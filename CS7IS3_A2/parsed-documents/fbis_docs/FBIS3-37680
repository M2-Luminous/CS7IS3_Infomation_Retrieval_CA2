Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign minister, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that one of the subjects discussed by A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel was German assistance in the development of contacts with Russia's northern regions, in the first place with Murmansk. Germany, as the future chairman of the Council of the Economic Community, intends to hold a meeting there of the three (the former, the current, and the future chairmen of the Council of the European Community), to see on the spot what can be done for establishing cooperation with Murmansk Oblast. Germany intends to participate most vigorously in the development of this oblast and at the meeting of the ministers some specific decisions in this area were discussed. In particular K. Kinkel intends to propose a German town as a "twin-town" for Murmansk. Germany is ahead of many other countries in terms of fleshing out its political partnership with Russia. If effective cooperation is established with Murmansk, this could serve as a positive example for other regions of Russia, the minister's political adviser pointed out. A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel also discussed the situation in the Baltic region and Russia's attitude to the Baltic states.
