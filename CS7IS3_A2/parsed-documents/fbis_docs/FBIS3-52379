At the Ankara airport the Turkish prime minister and Dr. Habibi enumerated the results of the bilateral talks, and described the prospects for the future of the cooperation between the two countries quite hopeful. After the death of the late Turkish president, Turgut Ozal, in April 1993 many political analysts had expressed the opinion that the period of friendly relations between Iran and Turkey had passed away along with the deceased Turkish president. This group of analysts focussed on a series of parameters which reflected the personal preferences of president Ozal, and arrived at the conclusion that mutual ties between Iran and Turkey were founded on personal factors and decisions. In practice, however, it has been proven that the above conclusion is erroneous, and the reason is quite obvious. Common interests between the two countries are of such depth and range that no political leader in Turkey can escape the conclusion that maintaining and even expanding cordial relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran is a necessity in view of the national interests of Turkey. It cannot be denied of course that there are many influential groups in Turkey that would like to function as the agent of the Western pressures of Iran. These influential groups are mainly scattered in the Turkish press and army. The influence of the Zionists among the Turkish press is quite obvious and even the Turkish statesmen do not try to deny it in their negotiations. But the prevalent conditions in the world and in the region does not allow them to appear as final determining forces on the political arena. The geographical region formed by Turkey-Iran provides the Europeans with the natural access to Asia. In fact political leaders in the two countries could arrive at early solutions for minor differences such as the presence of opposition forces in both countries, as soon as the leaders are able to view bilateral ties between Iran and Turkey within the context of a global perspective of political issues. The propaganda campaign launched by the Western media last year on the supposed rivalry between Iran and Turkey in the Central Asian countries also proved to be a misconception in practice. Once again the realities of political life have shown that no fierce competition is practicable or even advisable. The Central Asian countries are so poor and so much in need of assistance, that there will always be scope for activity no matter how much is done in that region. Furthermore, both Iran and Turkey are facing so many economic problems that they can invest in the Central Asian republics only on a limited scale.
