The importation of the wheat, which is under the control of a pool [preceding word in English] of flour mills, could amount to 1.2 million metric tons at a cost of $15 to $20 per ton, a price much lower than Argentine wheat. "There is no risk of a lack of foodstuffs because the Finance and Agriculture Ministries are carefully supervising the agricultural market and there will be no disruption of the harvest," Cardoso guaranteed. He also believes the estimate of 42-percent inflation in January is pure "speculation. I am going to repeat what I have already said: The number 42 is a shoe size; therefore, there is no room for it." He said there will be no advance implementation of the real value unit (URV), explaining that the government will not begin to think about the URV until Congress approves the budget. Cardoso made these remarks during the morning of 10 January when he was interviewed on the "Business [preceding word in English] Program" broadcast over Manchete Television, which will be aired on 16 January. The minister indicated that on 13 January he will meet with the board of directors of the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) in order to define the new policy for the northeast, which has an estimated $1 billion for the construction of highways, the planning of hydraulic resources, and general infrastructure services. Cardoso also indicated that during January, President Itamar Franco will approve the creation of a permanent working group that will draft an extended administrative reform. The Planning Ministry, the Federal Administrative Secretariat, and the Civilian Household have been charged with this task under the Finance Ministry's supervision. The Social Welfare and Regional Integration Ministries will disappear, but other offices will be transferred to other areas.
