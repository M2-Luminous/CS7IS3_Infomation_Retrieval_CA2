The 3,000 deputies were urged to work to balance the national reforms, development, and stability. Premier Li Peng has warned the United States that China is a sovereign country and will not negotiate or agree to anything in detriment to its self-determination. Li Peng said he expected better results during the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher between 11 and 14 March. That trip was preceded by a broad campaign against alleged Chinese human rights violations, in which Beijing was threatened with withdrawal of most favored nation status in bilateral trade.
