He said that the Meciar government could not concentrate forces on completing its program because, among other things, "Slovak President Michal Kovac complicated the situation by his speech in parliament [on 9 March] when he confused his jurisdiction and started enforcing a tough policy." The NRSR chairman went on to say that, with one or two exceptions such as the law on levying a value-added tax of 26 percent on selected types of goods, which has been prepared by Jozef Moravcik's government, the laws being currently adopted in parliament were mostly prepared by Meciar's cabinet. He stressed that the current parliament is no longer able to make unanimous progressive decisions and that conflicts and disagreements prevail in it.
