Our correspondent Nitzan Hen reports that several dozen settlers demonstrated this afternoon opposite the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, calling on the U.S. Administration to stop pressuring Israel. The demonstrators drove in a slow motorcade on Hayarqon Street, and chanted slogans denouncing Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin's remarks that the settlers may live under Syrian rule in the framework of a peace agreement. We will never agree to live under foreign sovereignty, the settlers said, calling on Rabin to fire Beilin at once. Another protest was held outside Rabin's residence in Jerusalem. Students demonstrated against a withdrawal from the Golan, demanding that the government call an election before making any territorial concession on the Golan. There is nothing new in al-Asad's remarks -- this was the reaction of the Golan settlers to the announcements by Clinton and al-Asad in Geneva. The settlers staged demonstrations today and blocked the main road to the Golan Heights.
