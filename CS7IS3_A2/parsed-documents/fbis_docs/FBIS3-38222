France, Great Britain, and Spain have abused European law to give national branches, namely their banana importers, advantages at the cost of other member states. They fanned the Commission's instinctive inclination toward general regulations with the usual result, namely that markets are not so much regulated but destroyed, which means that the consumer pays higher prices or gets worse goods. There is virtually nothing about the banana market regulation that can be defended, and in Brussels they even use the principles of European integration to justify it. "Whoever advocates Community preference for milk, beef, grain, and sugar," Bavarian Agriculture Minister Reinhold Bocklet says to the point, "cannot refuse it to the banana producers in the Community." Limiting imports and making them more expensive in order to protect domestic producers is one of the most important elements of European agricultural policy, and some European politicians would like to make many other economic branches in the single market happy with that too. No matter how absurd the banana market regulation may be, any agriculture minister will advocate it, because criticizing it means undermining the foundations of agricultural policy. However, do these politicians not realize that they do not serve their cause well? Community preference is not an achievement of European unification, but an exceptional price that the consumer pays because he wants to have agriculture preserved as an integral part of his own society. If Bocklet believes that he has to burden the consumers with the care for banana producers in Martinique just so that they do not get the idea of saving in their payments for the farmers in their own country, he is provoking precisely what he is trying to avoid. Is it so difficult to make it clear to the agricultural politicians that they can preserve what they have all the more certainly the earlier they draw a line? With the banana market regulation, however, they have far overdrawn the bow, in particular since it wastes hundreds of millions of the tax payers' money before it will help the banana producers overseas. It will remain the talk of the day and it will be used as a warning every time when the next step is supposed to be taken in European integration. The opponents of a united Europe could not have thought up anything better.
