At the end of the meeting, [FN President] Jean-Marie Le Pen made a long speech in which, among other things, he asked for the resignation of National Education Minister Francois Bayrou. As for the Falloux Act, he charged the government with yielding to demonstrators' pressure. Stating that his party is nearing "the time of a decisive battle," the extreme-right leader reviewed the various elections scheduled until the end of 1995, starting with the district election in March, for which he was to begin on Monday 17 January a tour which will take him to every department of metropolitan France. Le Pen will not run in this election, but he will head the FN list for the European election in June and will, for the third time, run in the presidential election. "There is still some hope of seeing Francois Mitterrand seek a third term of office", Le Pen said, adding that he suspected the head of state of working toward creating the conditions for him "to die surrounded with the splendor of the republic." Le Pen said he was convinced that Mr. Mitterrand would dissolve the National Assembly before the presidential election. "I would be surprised if the president of the Republic did not use this weapon in order to considerably cut down the current majority," to which he gave the following "warning": "Should government impotence become the norm (...), it is clear that nature, which abhors a vacuum, will bring forth new forms of political action." Le Pen, who has become more strident in his criticisms of Mr. Balladur -- whom he accuses of worsening France's standing on all counts -- considers that "French people must be quite disappointed with the centrist policies of the UDF [Union for French Democracy] and RPR [Rally for the Republic]." We shall do everything we can to take advantage of the historic opportunity we are being given," warned the extreme-right leader, stating that "the solutions advocated by the National Front" are "the sole alternative" leading to "the vast power changeover" he has been waiting for.
