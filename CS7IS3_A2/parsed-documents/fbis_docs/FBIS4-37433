Al-Himsi stressed that the congress discussed a number of important issues on the local, Arab, and international levels and determined its view over these issues in accordance with the party's pan-Arab principles and firm position on the central causes of the Arab nation. The party, he said, emphasized the need for pan-Arab solutions to any regional issue since solutions to any regional political or economic issues will be incomplete if not discussed and addressed within the framework of the comprehensive Arab solution. Al-Himsi said the congress urged all Arab and world organizations and parliaments to act to lift the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq and stop the bloodshed in fraternal Yemen on the basis of preserving its unity and fighting any secessionist trend regardless of any motives and reasons. He added that the congress also reviewed the settlement plans proposed to liquidate the Palestine question, including the Gaza-Jericho First plan, the Majdal Shams First plan, and the Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The congress reaffirmed the party's rejection of the capitulationist trend represented in the Madrid and Oslo process and underlined the Ba'th Party's position, which states that the Palestine question is the Arabs' central cause and no one has the right to a unilateral decision over it. The congress further noted that the proposed liquidationist plans target the Arab identity and serve as an instrument for the attainment of the Zionist dreams. He said the congress also stressed the importance of activating and entrenching the democracy process in Jordan as an irrevocable alternative and the need to allow all political forums -- including parties, organizations, and professional associations -- the opportunity to participate in the decisionmaking in order to activate and entrench popular participation. The congress also stressed the need to provide opportunities for others to express their opinion in order to strengthen the concept of pluralism and freedom. This, the congress says, requires the provision of further freedoms for the party newspapers since they represent the views of the opposition political forces whose presence provides a safety valve in any multi-party democratic march. At the conclusion of his press conference, al-Himsi declared the names of the members of the party's supreme command who were elected by the congress, These are: Taysir al-Himsi, Adam al-'Abdallat, Ahmad al-Mitliq, Jamal al-Rahaminah, 'Abd-al-Majid al-Qarari'ah, Sulayman Abu-'Adilah, 'Ayid 'Amayirah, Ahmad Irshayd, Akram al- Himsi, Muhammad al-Dakhlallah, and Akram al-Nimri. Three reserve members were also elected. These are: Samu'il Fakhuri, Khalid al-'Arif, and Faruq al-Za'n.
