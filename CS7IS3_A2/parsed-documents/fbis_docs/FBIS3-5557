Both a high-ranking U.S. Government official and the U.S. secretary of state remarked on their hopes for the repeal of the NSL and it is a main issue at the UN Human Rights Commission Conference being held in Geneva, Switzerland. Considering that the Human Rights Commission Conference adopted a resolution recommending the phased repeal of the NSL in Vienna in 1992, it is conceivable that a stronger resolution may be adopted this time. It seems that we will not be able to avoid being labeled as a "country with underdeveloped human rights." While not demanding repeal with the help of international opinion, we must reemphasize our opinion regarding the government and ruling party's insistance on disapproving the revision or repeal of the NSL, and their objection to international opinion. First, let us examine if the revision or repeal of the NSL is a domestic issue that should not be discussed by others. The foreign minister called the U.S. ambassador to the ROK to protest the remarks by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Hubbard, and the Democratic Liberal Party issued a statement refuting the confirmation remarks by Secretary of State Christopher. They all asked for a halt in remarks that interfere in internal affairs. Although we would like to positively appraise the government and the ruling party's apparent change in attitude from one of swallowing its anger on unsatisfactory points in relations with the United States, we cannot but criticize their points of refutation. Without mentioning the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, the human rights issue is already a matter of international concern and no one can deny that it is common practice to apply international measures. Moreover, the International Human Rights Conference held in Vienna in July 1993 declared that protection and improvement of human rights is a legal concern for the international community. We have to recognize that insistance on this as a domestic issue is limiting when considering that our country will have increasingly more occasion to comment on the human rights conditions of foreign countries. Next, the problem is whether the NSL should remain an evil law that tramples on human rights now that the civilian government is in office. We would like to hear the government's answer to assertions by human rights groups, including the Kennedy Human Rights Foundation, that "illegal retention under the NSL continues." However, an explanation will not solve the problem. The fact that there is a law condemning "human thoughts that are not provable" is itself a contradiction that needs to be raised. Let us lastly examine why the NSL should be made an issue when related North Korean laws are far more unreasonable and atrocious. While comparison of North Korea's laws with ours in terms of mutuality in North-South relations is not even worth consideration, if we assume that everything the government and related organizations say about North Korea's legal system and human rights situation are true, and strictly apply mutuality here, we would need to enact more evil laws and tolerate more atrocious human rights infringements. Is this justifiable? Recalling the interview with the NEW YORK TIMES in 1979 by Kim Yong-sam, then president of the New Democratic Party, urging the United States to "exercise open and direct pressure to then President Pak Chong-hui," we again ask the government and the ruling party if the NSL remains indispensable when it goes against the trend of today's international community which stresses opening up and internationalization.
