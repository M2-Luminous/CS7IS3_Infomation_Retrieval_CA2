As a Beijing delegation delegate, Li Peng arrived this morning at the Beijing Hall of the Great Hall of the People to participate in a forum with Beijing delegates attending the second session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC], to solicit their opinions and to discuss the major policies on reform, development, and stability. Hardly had Zhang Jianmin, Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee chairman and presiding forum chairman, finished his remarks when Huang Da, Chinese People's University president, said "Premier Li Peng's report is encouraging." He added that the report has embodied scientific and truth-seeking spirit and expounded the relationship between reform, development, and stability, which represent the overall situation for doing a good job on various work. He expressed the belief that as long as we can maintain the mutual coordination of reform, development, and stability, and as long as we can bring about mutual promotion of reform, development, and stability, we will surely and victoriously accomplish various reform tasks and fulfill the economic development plan. Doing a good job on the production and management of state-run large and medium-sized enterprises is extremely important to maintain the sustained development of the national economy. Therefore, Lui Yifeng, deputy director of the Economic and Technological Information Research Institute under the Beijing Chemical Engineering Group, offered his views to Premier Li Peng. He said: "The introduction of a new taxation system will benefit most state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises; but it will pose new problems to some enterprises, particularly poorly run ones. It is hoped that relevant departments will work out effective measures to help solve such problems as chained debts and wage reform at enterprises." Zhang Zhanlin, head of the Liuminying Ecological Farm Ranch in Daxing County, straightforwardly touched on the issue which concerns farmers most: solving the issue of the inadequate reserve force for agriculture. He said: "Premier Li Peng's report has pointed out the farmers' innermost thinking, it proposed strengthening the position of agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, and a number of measures to comprehensively develop the rural economy. It is hoped that these measures will be genuinely implemented." Qinghua University Professor Mei Zuyan said he greatly appreciated the following passage: "Various levels of governments should cut expenditures in other areas and try every possible means to do several concrete things for education." This, he said, reflects the government's plan to raise education to a strategic position and to give education priority development. He, however, hoped that the government would gradually increase investment in education. Also taking the floor to speak at the meeting were Wang Bilin, Beijing Municipal No. 11 Middle School senior teacher; Li Bosheng, special-grade jade sculpture master at the Beijing Jade Workshop; Hu Dapeng, Municipal Individual Laborers' Association deputy director; and Hu Yamei, honorary president of Beijing Children Hospital. They proposed their respective suggestions to Premier Li Peng on such topics as attaching importance to education, promoting folk arts, developing the private economy, and reforming the medical care system. Following the delegates' speeches, Li Peng said: "I thank you for your affirmation and support of the "Government Work Report" and the government's work. And I thank you for expressing your opinions and proposing suggestions." He said he would seriously study those opinions and suggestions and would try his best to meet with the delegates' demands and wishes, adding: "This is our unshirkable responsibility." Li Peng said party and government leaders should not only assume the responsibility for correctly handling well the relationship between reform, development, and stability, but also need to help all to reach a common understanding over the correct handling of the relationship between reform, development, and stability, as they are very important in accomplishing the various tasks that will be set forth at the current NPC session and to bring about a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. He said he is pleased with the delegates' reaching a common understanding and with their approval of and support for this year's basic policy for the whole party and for the nation's work. Li Peng pointed out the tasks of reform and development will be very arduous this year. At present, reform plans for major reform of the economic structure have been introduced, thus representing a big step forward for establishing a socialist market economic system. He called for the resolute implementation of various reform plans. He also called for adopting a cautious attitude, for the timely solving of problems once they surface, and ensuring the smooth progress of reform and development. Li Peng jokingly said: "As I am also one of the Beijing delegation delegates, please allow me to express several opinions." Laughter immediately broke out upon his remark. The first opinion that Li Peng advanced was related to commodity prices. He said prices constitute an important factor in maintaining social stability. Since implementing the reform and opening up policy, we have adopted a step-by-step approach with regard to reforming prices. Practice shows that our approach has been a success. Control over 90 percent of commodity prices have been lifted. Macrocontrol, however, is required over commodity prices that have been decontrolled. I hope more efforts will be exerted and more work will be done in this area so that increases in commodity prices will be controlled within the masses' tolerable limit. Regarding commodity price work, Li Peng pointed out the need to pay particular attention to solving well the "vegetable basket" problem for urban and rural citizens. It is necessary to ensure the supply of a vast variety of vegetables at reasonable prices. Commercial networks should be increased in urban areas. Steps should be taken to improve distribution systems. Urban areas should open their doors wider so as to facilitate vegetable growers to sell their produces and to help stabilize the prices of agricultural sideline products in urban and rural areas. Another of Li Peng's opinion was related to the establishment of a labor market. According to him, labor force flow is an unavoidable phenomenon in the course of economic development. Labor force flow not only meets construction demands in economically developed areas, but also helps the masses in the economically not-so-developed areas to shake off poverty and to become better off. But he urged the creation of a positive guidance for labor force flow and for enhancing management over the labor market, so that the labor force will not flow in a blind and unregulated manner, but in a rational and orderly way. Li Peng also raised the issue of attaching greater importance to improving citizens' housing conditions. He spoke about the great changes in the urban outlook of Beijing. He said everyone knows that Beijing is becoming a modernized metropolis. He expressed the hope that citizens will make new strides in housing reconstruction. He urged adopting the method of pooling funds from the government, work units, and individuals to accelerate the pace of housing construction, particularly in giving priority to building medium- grade residential housing. Li Peng also said that improving housing conditions is a practical issue which the broad masses show the biggest concern and which requires a speedy solution. Li Peng said, as the country's capital, Beijing is the miniature and window of the great socialist motherland. In addition to doing a good job in building material civilization, people in Beijing should set an exemplary role in the building of spiritual civilization. It is necessary to make greater efforts to further do a good job in the comprehensive management of social order; to create a stable working and living environment for the citizens; to encourage healthy trends; to oppose unhealthy trends and bad practices; to adopt diverse ways and use healthy and uplifting spiritual products to enrich the cultural market and satisfy the masses' needs in daily life; and to help shape a healthy social trend. Li Peng's opinions won warm applause from the delegates. The heart strings of the people's delegates drew a little bit closer to that of the Republic's premier...... [ellipses as received].
