SUMMARY: The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is canceling plans to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) on interim regulations to implement the Reclamation Reform Act (RRA) in California's Central Valley Project (CVP). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Terry Lynott, Director, Policy and Programs, Bureau of Reclamation, Denver Office, PO Box 25007, Denver CO 80225. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The notice of intent was published in the Federal Register (57 FR 20288, May 12, 1992) to comply with orders dated July 26, 1991, and March 10, 1992, by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California [ NRDC v. Duvall, No. Civ. S&hyph;88&hyph;375 LKK ] declaring that Reclamation had not complied with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 in preparing an environmental assessment with a ``Finding of no Significant Impact'' in the promulgation of its 1987 regulations for the RRA (43 CFR part 426, Rules and Regulations for Projects Governed by Federal Reclamation Law). A settlement contract between the Departments of Justice and of the Interior and NRDC was entered into on September 16, 1993, concerning NRDC, et al. v. Beard. The settlement contract eliminates the need for a separate EIS and rulemaking for the Central Valley Project, California. Dated: April 5, 1994. J.
