He left for Tbilisi on Friday. "I am leaving with very high mood", declared Grachev. "All military problems we planned, found a positive solution and were approved by the Armenian President". The problem of creating Russian military bases has also been resolved. These will be created by August 1, and displaced in Gyumri and Yerevan. "Armenia lives, I saw people smiling", he continued. Speaking on his impressions, the Russian General said he was amazed by training of internal troops in Armenia, by the attitude to his work and by the stance. Armenian Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan expressed his contentment about Pavel Grachev's visit. "This was very important and serious visit, and its main results will be stationing of Russian military bases in Armenia, improving the potential of republican anti-air defense and Russian troops displaced here." According to the Minister, Russian troops will be reinforced by helicopters and airplanes. Going in details on creating the Russian military bases in Armenia Serzh Sargsyan noted, this problem has been completely resolved. "There are no unclear points left in the agreement about the bases," he said. This agreement will be signed and affirmed in summer, "and then we'll start its implementation." Speaking on leasing land for the Russian bases the minister said, the Armenian side is ready to resolve these problems in a mutually advantageous manner. This can be paid back by training Armenian specialists in Russian military higher education centers, by providing free communal services to Russian troops stationed in Armenia or otherwise, said Serzh Sargsyan. On his opinion, Russian military bases will be created in Armenia by September 1. Concerning the length of the agreement to be signed he said that Armenia would like this agreement to be eternal. In his turn, Russian Ambassador to Armenia Vladimir Stupishin said, Pavel Grachev's visit to Armenia was an important political event, concerning not only military aspects. "This visit was very important for improving our alliance with Armenia both within the framework of the CIS collective security agreement and on bilateral basis," said the Ambassador. According to Russian "Novosti" TV program Grachev visited Baku on June 11 and negotiated with the President Geydar Aliyev about stationing a radio-location station near Gyanja. Speaking on the TV Russian Defense Minister said, "both sides are accumulating forces at the borders, and therefore there is still a long way before introduction of peace-making forces."
