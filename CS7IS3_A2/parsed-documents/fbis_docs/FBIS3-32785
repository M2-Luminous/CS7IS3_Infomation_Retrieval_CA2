Vicendis). Relations between Colombia and Cuba are favorable and are growing satisfactorily, the Colombian ambassador said. [Begin recording] [(Santamaria Salamanca)] One of the first actions of the recently established Colombian Embassy in Cuba is to establish immediate friendly relations between Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena de Indias, in Colombia, to unite those who already are united, de facto, by history and culture. They are two peoples with parallel histories, both capitals of the Caribbean which, thanks to a good initiative of the two governments, will again strengthen their friendly relations. Within this framework, we hope to develop cultural and commercial activities that promote new points of cooperation between Colombia and Cuba, through Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena de Indias. We are going to receive visiting Colombian officials and businessmen for two or three days here in Santiago de Cuba, and we hope to begin talks between those two sectors. I would say that Colombia and Cuba are experiencing good, friendly relations at this moment. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina was visiting Colombia at the end of 1993; Vice President Carlos Lage also met with President Gaviria; and by the end of April, Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin will visit Cuba. We are going to have a number of visits. Our relations are at a good level at this moment. This complies with President Gaviria's policy of tightening relations with the Caribbean, of strengthening an international relationship of friendship; and I am here to begin implementing those guidelines. [Sanabria] Would it be possible to receive a visit by President Cesar Gaviria, as well, during the development of these relations? [(Santamaria Salamanca)] For the time being, we are working on visits by two or three ministers, a delegation of Colombian businessmen, and [Foreign Minister] Noemi Sanin; then will we be able to plan future objectives. So far, we are working with these goals, which surely implies relations at a high level, because for almost 12 years we had no diplomatic relations. [end recording]
