FBIS3-66 "cr00000017694001" 26 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-042--ISRAEL ISRAEL: CHALLENGES OF A PALESTINIAN STATE Summary: Arye Stav, editor of the conservative journal NATIV, has written an article published in the journal's January-February issue strongly opposing any peace settlement that would involve setting up a Palestinian state, which Stav sees as eventually ensuing from the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles (DOP) signed in September; returning the Golan Heights to Syria; and returning Palestinian refugees to the West Bank and Israel. He argued that giving up Israeli control of the West Bank and the Golan would severely weaken Israel's geostrategic position in the face of enemies who are growing stronger, and the return of millions of refugees would greatly over tax water supplies in the region, and within Israel itself. This foreign media note summarizes the views Stav expresses in his article. Geo-Strategy According to Stav, if Israel loses the three strategic strongholds in Western Eretz Israel (the Jordan Valley, the Golan Heights, and the mountains of Judaea and Samaria) the country will be in greater danger than at the time of the Six Day War. Iraq and Syria are now stronger than they were in 1967, Iran is more powerful, and Saudi Arabia is being armed at an unprecedented pace, all of which makes the eastern front more dangerous. Since 1967, said Stav, Israel has built up its defensive infrastructure in the east, including the Jordan Valley proper and the fortified ridges of eastern Samaria, which are its "defensive key." In addition, control of the Jordan Valley is a basic principle of the Alon Plan (post-1967 peace plan calling for the return of the densely populated areas in the West Bank and Gaza, along with most of the Sinai, to Arab sovereignty) for eastern front defense. According to the NATIV editor, Samaria--an Israeli troop concentration point and early warning zone--is the only defensive line that protects the "soft underbelly" of the Israeli coastal plain in which most of the Jewish population and energy sources are concentrated. In addition, said Stav, the trans-Samaria highway is the principal strategic highway in Israel and is intended to facilitate mobilized troop movement from Gush Dan eastward. If the West Bank territory were lost, Israel's mobilization cushion of 72 hours would be reduced to a few hours. Furthermore, Stav wrote, if the coastal plain were hit with non-conventional weapons, Israel's north-south movement axes would be cut. Since no western axis exists, 2 million people would be forced to flee to the mountains of Samaria, an hour's distance away (assuming Samaria was still under Israeli control). According to the NATIV editor, Israeli control of the Golan Heights now deprives Syria of a springboard into northern Israel and is an effective barrier to any Syrian adventurism because Israeli weapons deployed on the Golan can deter Damascus. In addition, said Stav, Israeli control prevents Syria from deploying on the Golan missiles capable Of accurately striking population centers on the Gulf of Haifa with a Scud B or along the coastal plain, where most Israeli reserve forces are mobilized, with a Scud C. Israel is also able to prevent terrorist attacks in the Galil Finger and Jordan Valley which, said Stav, would preclude having "bunkers above and children's homes below." According to Stav, there are over 5 million who call themselves "Palestinians." Although a Palestinian entity will not, in and of itself, threaten Israel, the great numbers of Palestinians on the Jordan will "naturally" remove the Jordanian Hashemites. Palestine would then be an enticing prey for either Iraq or Syria. Syria is a greater threat to Israel, Stav said, because it is pursuing strategy of incorporating Jordan and Israel into "Greater Syria"--a strategy Damascus has followed by its support of the rejectionist "Group of 10" and its involvement, through Iran, with Hizballah and Islamic Jihad. Palestine under Syrian influence or control would not be a small demilitarized entity as currently envisioned, but the "heavy fist of the Arab Ummah (nation)" stretching from Baghdad to the outskirts of Gush Dan. Refugees The combined number of Palestinian refugees from 1967 and 1948 is currently estimated at 2.6 million, says Stav, and their repatriation would place a heavy demographic and economic burden on Israel. Under the terms of UN Resolution 194 on Arab refugess, Israel is faced with the return of millions of refugees to their dwellings inside the 1949 armistice lines. Stav asserts that Israel has apparently agreed to family reunification of around 100,000. The alternative to Palestinian repatriation is monetary compensation, says Stav, which the Israeli Arab community has rejected because it nullifies the right of return. The only compensation the Arab community is willing to discuss, he continues, is awarding post-1967 Jewish settler residences and infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza as partial compensation for 1948 Arab property losses. If Jewish residences in east Jerusalem are added, this would result in some 80,000 housing units being offered as compensation. According to Stav, these 80,000 Jewish families who might be evacuated from their homes in the West Bank, Gaza, and Jerusalem would themselves require some $16 billion in compensation. Since Israel agreed to recognize the right of return for the 1967 refugees, Stav expects plans for dealing with the 1948 refugees to be brought up sometime in 1994. Water According to Stav, a peace settlement that brings the return of refugees would also lead to a major shortage of water in Israel. He said that Israel's per capita water consumption of 250 cubic meters/annually is half of UNESCO's international minimum recommendation of 500 cubic meters. Consumption is expected to continue to decrease despite a natural population increase, the influx of immigrants, and returning refugees. Nonetheless, Israel intends to transfer two-thirds of this water to Arab sovereignty. The three primary water sources are: Kineret Basin: Supplies 610 million cubic meters/year. Two- thirds of its water comes from wadis in the Golan and Jordan river headwaters which will transfer to the Syrians who, according to international law, will be able to draw on a considerable portion of it. The Kineret has a delicate saline balance. If its water level drops below 213 meters, irreversible damage is likely and Israel's sole upper water basin will abe destroyed. Stav notes that the Syrians suffer from a water shortage and will need to use the Golan waters for intensive irrigation. Mountain Aquifers: Supply 500 million cubic meters/year. They are spread over the central mountain range in Judaea and Samaria, where most of the water supply will come under the control of Palestinian state. Since the Palestinians intend to absorb 1.5 million refugees over the next decade, the population of the West Bank will reach 2.5 million by the year 2000. If the population on the coastal plain is to receive almost 50 percent of its water, 2.5 million Palestinians will thus have only 100 cubic meters/person- -one-fifth of the international minimum. Coastal Aquifer: Supplies 400 million cubic meters. This aquifer is under Israeli control, but is contaminated by industrial waste, over salinated from overpumping, and is insufficiently replenished because of the building boom on the coastal plain. The aquifer's concentration of such contaminants as nitrates has reached 90 milligrams/liter, double the international standard. Recycled and saline water can also supplement the coastal aquifer. If Israel gives away the Kineret Basin and the mountain aquifers, concludes Stav, it will be left with brackish water, sewage, and toxic waste to drink.
