(3) A sufficient number of gust gradient distances in the range 30 feet to 350 feet must be investigated to find the critical response for each load quantity. (4) The design gust velocity must be: E:GRAPHICSEP16SE94.014 where_ U ref = the reference gust velocity in equivalent airspeed defined in subparagraph (a)(5) of this paragraph. F g = the flight profile alleviation factor defined in subparagraph (a)(6) of this paragraph. (5) The following reference gust velocities apply: (i) At the airplane design speed V C : Positive and negative gusts with reference gust velocities of 56.0 ft/sec EAS must be considered at sea level. The reference gust velocity may be reduced linearly from 56.0 ft/sec EAS at sea level to 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet. The reference gust velocity may be further reduced linearly from 44.0 ft/sec EAS at 15000 feet to 26.0 ft/sec EAS at 50000 feet. (ii) At the airplane design speed V D : The reference gust velocity must be 0.5 times the value obtained under §25.341(a)(5)(i). (6) The flight profile alleviation factor, F g , must be increased linearly from the sea level value to a value of 1.0 at the maximum operating altitude defined in §25.1527. At sea level, the flight profile alleviation factor is determined by the following equation: E:GRAPHICSEP16SE94.015 Z mo = Maximum operating altitude defined in §25.1527. (7) When a stability augmentation system is included in the analysis, the effect of any significant system nonlinearities should be accounted for when deriving limit loads from limit gust conditions. (b) Continuous Gust Design Criteria. The dynamic response of the airplane to vertical and lateral continuous turbulence must be taken into account. The continuous gust design criteria of Appendix G of this part must be used to establish the dynamic response unless more rational criteria are shown. 8.

(a) If wing flaps are to be used during takeoff, approach, or landing, at the design flap speeds established for these stages of flight under §25.335(e) and with the wing flaps in the corresponding positions, the airplane is assumed to be subjected to symmetrical maneuvers and gusts. The resulting limit loads must correspond to the conditions determined as follows: (1) Maneuvering to a positive limit load factor of 2.0; and (2) Positive and negative gusts of 25 ft/sec EAS acting normal to the flight path in level flight. Gust loads resulting on each part of the structure must be determined by rational analysis. The analysis must take into account the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics and rigid body motions of the aircraft.

The airplane is assumed to be subjected to unsymmetrical vertical gusts in level flight. The resulting limit loads must be determined from either the wing maximum airload derived directly from §25.341(a), or the wing maximum airload derived indirectly from the vertical load factor calculated from §25.341(a). It must be assumed that 100 percent of the wing air load acts on one side of the airplane and 80 percent of the wing air load acts on the other side. 11.
