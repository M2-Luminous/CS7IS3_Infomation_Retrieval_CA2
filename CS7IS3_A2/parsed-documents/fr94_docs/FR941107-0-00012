FR941107-0-00012 FR941107-0-00006 7 CFR Part 929 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;929&hyph;2FIR] Expenses and Assessment Rate for the 1994&hyph;95 Fiscal Year for the Marketing Order Covering Cranberries Grown in States of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of the interim final rule which authorized expenses and established an assessment rate for the Cranberry Marketing Committee (Committee) under Marketing Order No. 929 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. Authorization of this budget enables the Committee to incur expenses that are reasonable and necessary to administer the program. Funds to administer this program are derived from assessments on handlers. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brenda D. Hill or Mark Hessel, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, P.O. Box 96456, Room 2523&hyph;S, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This final rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 929 [7 CFR Part 929], as amended, regulating the handling of cranberries grown in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Long Island in the State of New York, hereinafter referred to as the ``order''. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act''. The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, cranberries grown in 10 States are subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable cranberries during the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year beginning September 1, 1994, through August 31, 1995. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.
