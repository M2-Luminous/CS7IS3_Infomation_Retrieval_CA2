Certainly, the PSM [Socialist Party of Labor] and the PRM [Greater Romania Party] referred in their public statements only to the issue of freezing negotiations with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] on forming a new government. They refrained from commenting on their parliamentary alliance with the PDSR, an alliance that resulted in the Nicolae Vacaroiu cabinet. As far as the government party is concerned, it did not adopt a categorical position regarding an alliance with the PSM and the PRM. The response to the PRM letter is a declaration that, although intended for the entire left wing on our political spectrum, its conclusion merely refers to the issue of negotiations aimed at establishing a government of the so called red pentagon. At a first glance one might say that the current signs that relations between the PDSR and the PSM-PRM have cooled refer only to the plan for a PDSR-PSM-PRM-PUNR-PDAR [Democratic Agrarian Party of Romania] government and will not affect the current discreet alliance, an alliance through which we have today in parliament a left-wing majority coalition. Using a simple metaphor, we might say that the PDSR broke off negotiations for a marriage with the PSM-PRM. However, the engagement is still on. To think in this way strikes me as a little risky. During the quarrel on the issue of negotiations, enough curses were exchanged for not only the marriage but even the engagement to be thrown into doubt. Just as in every dispute, the sides reached a stage when they expressed exactly what they thought about each other. However, in a love affair, any separation starts from the first real quarrel. In that moment, the two sides threw into each other's face everything that they had kept hidden before. And even if they make up later, the memory of that moment of sincerity will seriously affect their relationship. A similar thing will also happen to the government coalition. The controversy on the issue of negotiations aimed at establishing the pentagon gave the partners the opportunity to express what they thought about each other. Not only they but also the public could notice that, beneath the embraces and kisses that have been exchanged so far, serious differences are hidden. At the same time, one should remember something else. The bickering with the PSM-PRM produced an opportunity for certain clarifications within the PDSR. As is known, the PDSR is dominated by disputes between its two groups, namely, the reformist and the conservative ones. As long as the PSM-PRM had cast their eyes at the PDSR, the reformist group did not have a chance firmly to put forward the issue of separation from nationalist-communist forces. Every time the conservative group invoked a reason -- which did not lack common sense -- namely, that it is preferable to have a stable alliance with the left wing than a hypothetical and uncertain alliance with the right wing. The PRM letter gave the opportunity to the reform group to take its revenge. The hooligan and absolutely irresponsible behavior of [PRM leader] Corneliu Vadim Tudor toward President Ion Iliescu was used by the reformist group to demonstrate to the whole party how dangerous an alliance with nationalist-communists is. Faced with such a shattering argument, the conservative group was compelled to give in. This can be seen in the style and content of the PDSR declaration, which indicates the victory of the position adopted by the reformist group. From this viewpoint, there is no doubt that PRM Leader Corneliu Vadim Tudor has made a decisive contribution to the victory of the reformist group in the PDSR. With his stupid articles, he strengthened that group of the ruling party that had been advocating for quite a long time a break with the left-wing allies and an opening toward the CD and the PD(FSN) [Democratic Party(National Salvation Front)]. Even if neither the PDSR nor the PSM-PRM could comment on the current coalition, it is clear that under these circumstances, its days are numbered. Does a possible break of the left-wing coalition endanger the PDSR's government? Although it might seem paradoxical, the answer is no. The PDSR has every chance to form a government with a minority executive and rule for a while. The fall of the government would depend on the success of a censure motion. However, such a situation would mean early elections. And such prospects frighten not only all the parties but all the members of parliament as well. What member would dare, at a secret ballot required by the censure motion, to vote for the fall of the government and early elections? This would mean to make his future status as a member uncertain. Thus, it is not excluded that in the near future we are going to have a minority PDSR government, supported by both the right and the left wing.
