A Kazakh. A graduate of a technical school, institute, and the CPSU Central Committee Academy of Social Sciences. He was a mechanical engineer of a kolkhoz, chief engineer of a fish industry association, first secretary of a rayon party committee, secretary and first secretary of the Atyrau Oblast Party Committee, chairman of the Atyrau Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies, deputy chairman of the Committee of the Supreme Soviet for Economic Reform, Budget, and Finances, and chairman of the Control Chamber. In the present parliament he is a member of the Finance and Budget Committee, leads the Socialist Party of Kazakhstan faction, and is cochairman of the Progress group. [Gryaznov] Gaziz Kamashevich, the first months of work of the new Supreme Council have passed. How may they be evaluated, in your view? [Aldamzharov] We spoke a great deal last year about a professional legislative authority. And a new Supreme Council has been elected and has begun to operate on a permanent basis. What we were dreaming of has come to pass, it would seem: A professional parliament has been formed. But whether it corresponds today to our requirements or not is another matter. And the first stage of its activity could be viewed variously, most likely. The start of the work of the Supreme Council has not been to the liking of many of people, perhaps. To some extent it does not satisfy us either. This situation may be excused, of course, and it could be said that the new parliament is composed of new people that demanded first and foremost the solution of all organizational questions. And only after this, the basic conditions for work having been created, will the Supreme Council begin to consider the laws that society needs. If we evaluate the situation from this viewpoint, everything becomes understandable and acceptable. But it has to be seen from the other side also. [Gryaznov] It is this, other, side that is predominant in society. The life of the majority of the population of the republic is deteriorating by the day, processes that could have unpredictable consequences are maturing.... [Aldamzharov] Yes, whereas earlier we said that the economy was on the edge of the abyss, it may be shown today with figures in hand that it is now falling into this abyss at full tilt. And this is defined not only by the decline in production but also by the appreciable deterioration in the living conditions of the whole population of the republic. The minimum wage here recently was 40 tenge, today it constitutes 100 tenge. At that time the dollar cost 4.5 tenge, today it is 10 times dearer. It should be mentioned immediately that such an increase in the minimum wage is wholly unsubstantiated and has been taken "as a rough guide." In no way does it today reflect the subsistence level and is almost 20 times lower than the rational consumer budget. The socioeconomic situation is further characterized by the fact that the solution of many questions has today simply been put in abeyance. [Gryaznov] To what do you refer? [Aldamzharov] Even the spring field work, say, has been performed in less organized fashion in the present year than in past years. The areas sown to practically all crops have diminished. [Gryaznov] We have somehow stopped talking about the difficulties of the countryside, forgetting that foodstuffs and raw material that is most important for man's life are created here. [Aldamzharov] Yes, we are attempting, as before, to resolve all problems at the expense of the countryside. And are hereby violating all the principles of economics. Agriculture provides us with more than 50 percent of our national income. In destroying it we are depriving ourselves of these resources. But we are continuing this policy, wiping out society's motivation to labor. And if people are, in fact, still working, it is due to habit: Spring is here, the land is calling the master, he needs to go into the field. But such patience is not limitless. In the first quarter of the present year the price of agricultural products increased 17-fold, and of machinery and equipment for the countryside, by a factor of 20.7. Mineral fertilizer has become 23 times more expensive, motor vehicles, 25 times more expensive, and so forth. It is curious, but the cost of agricultural products today is almost twice as high as the selling price. In other words, whatever we produce on the land, everything is unprofitable, nothing justifies itself. And saying under these conditions that our agriculture has some prospects and that the reforms being undertaken in the country are benefiting it is simply immoral. [Gryaznov] It is hard to imagine even to what the collapse of agricultural production would lead. [Aldamzharov] Nonetheless, it continues. From 1 April of this year the price of energy was, as we all know, raised once again. Gasoline has become three times more expensive, diesel fuel, three and one-half times more expensive, and electric power, 10 times more expensive. We have calculated that for the sum total of consumed energy alone the countryside has to give back 11 million tonnes of grain. And the machinery, mineral fertilizer, building materials, and wages, finally? It will be good if the year proves productive. But what if there is a drought? As of this time agriculture is the most aggrieved sphere in our society. We have always said that the countryside is in essence, by nature, and according to the evolved traditions conservative. This is so, and it is not always a bad thing. The countryside represents our common sources. For Kazakhs particularly. After all, our main traditions and language have been preserved thanks to the countryside, the village. And now no one is saying a word in its defense. The intelligentsia should be doing so, it would seem. But it has one foot in the country, the other, in the town, and is incapable of expressing a steady opinion or of defending the interests of some one social stratum. The rural population is today suffering most of all. It has the lowest wages, which, in addition, it does not receive for five or six months at a time, and inadequate treatment and diet. And the countryside is not going on strike, it still has hope--in God, the president, and those who govern it--and believes that concern is being displayed for it and that tomorrow life will be better. But the state and the government have yet to find any solutions to the crisis situation. All eyes are turned as yet in one direction--toward foreign credit. But they are being used other than as intended and are not working for the future. We are simply eating our way through them and once again making shuttle trips to all countries and going with outstretched hand. [Gryaznov] But let us return to agricultural production. Judging by the Socialist Party's program, you also see the development of private farming as a solution of the problem. [Aldamzharov] Yes, the process of the disbandment of the kolkhozes and sovkhozes is being introduced persistently. We believe, however, that it should proceed in evolutionary fashion. The traditions of collective management in our people--both Russians and Kazakhs--go very deep. In tsarist Russia the peasants lived as a commune, the Kazakh people, as one clan. And both peoples always saw the pooling of efforts and mutual support as the salvation from adversities. Today they are being told: Separate and thereby save yourselves from catastrophe. This is a distortion of the truth. And we believe that the kolkhozes and sovkhozes that are producing successfully and providing their people with normal living conditions should be left alone. Our attitude toward the unprofitable farms is different. But if they are producing what society needs, we should, like it or not, subsidize them. As far as private farming is concerned, there are more fine words uttered at podiums here than there are deeds. The state does not today have even a concept of farming. We have to think that peasant and mortgage banks could have been created and that the question of the possibility of the land leased by the farmer being mortgaged and of credit being obtained on the strength of this could have been solved in past years. People who know how to work well on the land could have had title to it transferred to them. Not in wholesale fashion, like much that we are doing here today, but with profound economic calculations. These problems will have to be tackled sooner or later, all the same. Thus in making a general evaluation of today's state of agriculture it has to be affirmed that this sector has no future. But it could have. It is necessary for this that the state know what it wants from the countryside. It is necessary to clearly determine how much in the way of grain, milk, meat, and other products it needs. And give out a government contract on the strength of these quantities and pay the money in stages. Thirty percent of the total amount in spring, say, a further 30 percent in the fall, and all the rest, at the time of the final settlement. The result would be a kind of interest-free loan on the strength of the future harvest. We, however, are forcing the farmer to take out such a loan in a commercial bank at 400 percent annual interest. Further, if the money for the government contract is not paid out in stages, at the end of the year the state must purchase the products from the peasant at the price that has by this time evolved on the market. In addition, having received what was contracted by the government, it should have nothing else to do with the rest of the products: Their producer will himself determine where he should sell them and how. Processing industry requires serious attention on the part of the state. The kolkhozes and sovkhozes themselves are not in a position to create it, earmarked credit is needed for it. And the state must have a precise program--what kind of plants and shops it requires, how many, and where--and attract foreign investors on the strength of it. A similar situation is shaping up in many sectors of industry also. [Gryaznov] What, in your view, should parliament's role be under these conditions? [Aldamzharov] We need once again to proceed from today's realities. At a meeting of the cabinet last fall the president declared that we had made a mess of the anticrisis program. Shortly after this, a national currency was introduced. In any country a strict policy of economic support for the national currency is devised prior to such an action. We lack such a program. Finally, in April, the president, by edict, required the government to draw up a program for the present year. We do not have this either yet. Suppose such a program appears. Adopted at such an unstable time, it will inevitably conflict with current laws. Revisions will have to be made to dozens of them since the program will not work without this, for people would comply with the laws, not the program. But the discussion and revision of legislative instruments takes quite a long time. It has to be observed that the government has had time to prepare such documents. And had it been used rationally, parliament would as of this time have gotten a great deal done. In that case, I believe, the well-known statement of the Supreme Council would not have seen the light of day. But there is still no national program around which all of society could consolidate. Further, we should clearly recognize that formulating a program that would satisfy absolutely everyone is impossible. This has never been the case anywhere in the world. Consequently, we need not only a program but also people devising it and prepared to answer for its realization. They would determine the appropriate tactics also. These are indispensable conditions. They are not being observed here. How do we devise a program? Four or five people are involved in this, usually. Then the document is discussed, amendments are made, and it is approved and begins life. But the people for its fulfillment are chosen not by the person who draws up the program, not the prime minister, but the president, since, according to the constitution, he is both head of state and head of the government. We propose adjustments to this procedure. The president is the head of state, who stands above all three branches of power. The head of the executive is the prime minister devising the program and selecting for it executants that think the same way he does. Here we would know clearly who was responsible for what. And, in addition, the dual control--of both the president and the prime minister--would strengthen executive discipline. Similar changes should affect the administration chiefs also. Today some of them are trying first and foremost to please the president. And if they have done so, that's it, nothing else is of any interest to such a chief. People could write hundreds of complaints about him, the situation will not change. The president himself will not check every such instance, and persuasion is brought to bear on the person doing the checking. Lack of responsibility to the people engenders a general lack of responsibility. We propose, therefore, that all administrators should be elected by the people or the councils. This would strengthen discipline. And provision could be for the preservation of presidential influence on the situation locally for a structure of presidential representatives, as has been done in Russia, for example. Thus the formulation of a national program of a way out of the crisis, the selection of its executants, and the establishment of a legislative base for and the corresponding adjustment to the political structure should, in our view, be effected simultaneously. The Supreme Council would occupy a fitting place in this process also. [Gryaznov] Thank you for the interview.
