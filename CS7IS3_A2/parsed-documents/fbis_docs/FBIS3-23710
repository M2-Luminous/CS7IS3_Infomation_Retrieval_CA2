Regions have broad rights in matters of the attraction of foreign investments. They may conclude agreements on economic cooperation with regions of foreign countries. These are as a rule geographically close territories. According to forecasts, the sectoral structure of foreign investments in the Russian Federation should in the next few years change towards the production sphere (up to 70 percent of foreign investments), the priority sectors being: oil and gas production; conversion of the defence industry; agricultural production and other branches of the agro-industrial complex; material and technical equipment of business infrastructure; industrial application of the results of research and technical development.
