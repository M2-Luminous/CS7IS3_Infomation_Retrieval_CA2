[Begin recording] [Falandysz] The Small Constitution remains in force. A way out must be found. [Unidentified correspondent] Which means? [Falandysz] The president states that the decision is a final one. It is necessary to seek.... [Correspondent, interrupting] Does that mean that the president is waiting for a new candidate on the part of the coalition? [Falandysz] There is no other way out. [end recording] The causes for the rejection of this candidate were presented by Belweder press spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski. [passage omitted] Dariusz Rosati said in the evening that he is amazed at the arguments of the president. [Begin Rosati recording] It is necessary to say that the causes cited by Mr. Drzycimski fill me with the greatest amazement. The first cause--that I have spent the past two and a half years abroad--is incomprehensible to me, if only because of the fact that, altogether, I have been concerned solely with the Polish economy for the past 20 years. And, for the past two years also, working for the United Nations, I have been concerned with the Polish economy and that of the countries of Central-Eastern Europe. I have permanent contact with the country; I read the press; I am in the country six or seven times a year. And, and, I have the impression that--I write, in any case, I have written and published a lot--I have the impression that I am quite well oriented with what is taking place in the Polish economy. [end recording] The Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party [SLD-PSL] coalition and Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak continue to maintain the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati. The prime minister's press office has reported that the prime minister has received reports from the prosecutor general and the head of the State Protection Office that there are no good reasons for Rosati not to assume important state posts. SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski has expressed the view that President Lech Walesa is not concerned that there be stabilization in the country. SLD Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski has suggested that it is appropriate to consider the limitation of the constitutional prerogatives of the president if Lech Walesa maintains his decision on the rejection of the candidacy of Rosati. [Begin Borowski recording] If the president decides on this type of war--and I stress that the war in this case is being called forth by the president, not by the coalition--well, then, it will be necessary to consider whether the prerogatives of the president are not, quite simply, too great in this situation. There are no regulations that cannot be changed, including constitutional ones. Certainly, the Small Constitution says that the president may reject a candidacy, but there must really be exceptionally important reasons. I judge this to be, nonetheless, an attempt to drive a wedge between the coalition partners and, well, a certain propensity of the president to foment. [end recording] Belweder spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski, who is with President Walesa in Gdansk, said yesterday that it is not precluded that on Monday there will be a follow-up meeting between the president and the prime minister. The prime minister will receive written justification for the rejection of the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati for the post of deputy prime minister and minister of finance.
