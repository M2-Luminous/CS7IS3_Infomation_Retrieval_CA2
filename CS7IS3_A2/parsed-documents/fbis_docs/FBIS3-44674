The two countries should foster even closer ties in more fields, he said, adding that the Azerbaijan Government speaks highly of China's policy of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs and of developing friendly ties on the basis of the five principles of co-existence. During the meeting, Rong also briefed the visitors on China's reform and opening to the outside world. He expressed the belief that Azerbaijan's economy would pick up quickly, given a stable domestic situation and a favorable international environment. This morning, Wu Yi, Chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, also met Gasanov. They exchanged views on the expansion of bilateral economic and trade relations.
