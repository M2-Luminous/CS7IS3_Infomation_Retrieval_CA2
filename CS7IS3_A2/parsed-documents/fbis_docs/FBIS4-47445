For this reason, the dynamics of the effects of three nootropic drugs, i.e., piracetam, meclofenoxate, and mexidole, on the brain activity of a total of 32 nonpedigree male rats (weight, 180 to 250 g) was studied. The animals in group 1 received intraperitoneal [IP] injections of piracetam in a dose of 500 mg/kg daily for 2 months, the group 2 animals received IP injections of meclofenoxate in a dose of 70 mg/kg daily for 5 months, and the group 3 animals received IP injections of mexidole in a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 5 months. The control rats received a physiological solution under analogous conditions. The studies of the bioelectric activity of the rats' brains were carried out when the rats were wide awake and unrestrained. Five to 6 days before the neurophysiological experiments, the rats were anesthestetized with nembutal (50 mg/kg IP), and monopolar Nichrome electrodes were implanted into the sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocampus of their brains. Fourier spectral analysis of encephalograms [EEGs] of the rats' brains was performed by using a Berg-Fourier Analyzer (O.T.E. Biomedica, Italy) and an analysis period of 4 minutes 8 seconds. Bioelectric activity was recorded in 5-minute segments before and after (for 2-3 hours) injection of the drugs. The studies established that prolonged injection of piracetam results in an intensification and stabilization of the dominant power peak of the _th_-range (4-8 Hz) and a simultaneous decrease in the power of the _a_-range (8-13 Hz). A statistically significant decrease was noted in the fast-wave _b_[.sub]1[/]-range (13-20 Hz) of the power spectra of the cortex EEGs. In the hippocampus, on the other hand, piracetam induced a decrease in the relative power of the _th_-range, ahthough it still exceeded the values found for intact animals. At the same time there was a decrease in the power of the _a_-range and an increase in the power of the _b_-range (13-32 Hz) of the spectra of the EEGs of the hippocampus when compared with the values obtained for one-time administration of piracetam in intact animals. Discontinuation of piracetam did not cause any drastic changes in bioelectric activity or in the respective power spectra of the EEGs of both brain structures studied. Prolonged administration of meclofenoxate was found to significantly alter the structure of the EEG power spectra, especially in the case of EEGs recorded for the cortex. Not only was the primary peak in the _th_-intensified, but the power of the _a_-range increased significantly as well because of the appearance of a pronounced dominant rhythm with a frequency of 10-12 Hz. High-amplitude fluctuations in bioelectric activity (i.e., fluctuations with the same frequency) developed as well. The appearance of a new peak with a frequency of 10-12 Hz was characteristic for nearly half the animals after one-time administration of meclofenoxate. Discontinuation of meclofenoxate resulted in an intensification of the dominant peak and a lengthening of the period of high-amplitude discharges (frequency, 10-12 Hz) in the bioelectric activity of the rat brains' cortices. Chronic use of mexidole was found to increase the dominant peak in the _th_-range more markedly than in the case of one-time administration of the drug. An increase in the _b_[.sub]1[/]-range of frequencies was another characteristic effect of prolonged mexidole use. Discontinuation of mexidole resulted in significant changes in the bioelectric activity and power spectra of the EEGs recorded for both the cortex and hippocampus. High-amplitude fluctuations that gradually increased and subsided (frequency, 8-12 Hz) appeared in the EEGs recorded for both the cortex and hippocampus but especially for those of the cortex. Prolonged injection enhanced the effect of all three drugs as compared with the effects achieved after one-time administration. The EEG-level effects of the three drugs were confirmed by observations of the rats' behavior: All three drugs increased the rats' levels of wakefulness and excitability.
