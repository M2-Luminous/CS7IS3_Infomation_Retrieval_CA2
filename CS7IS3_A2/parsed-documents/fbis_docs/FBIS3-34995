Of course, the Gaza-Jericho First agreement is not the first imperialist Zionist plan designed to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict, but it certainly is the most dangerous development, not only to the rights of the Palestinian people, but also to the very existence of the Arab nation, its future, rights, and higher interests. The conspiracy against the Arabism of Palestine began with the first organized Zionist emigration in 1882. Its chapters then unfolded one after the other. At the first Zionist conference in Basle, Switzerland, a decision was made to establish "a Jewish state" in Palestine, which Herzel claimed was a land without people, and people without land! The ominous Balfour Declaration followed on 2/11/1917, expressing Britain's symnpathy with "the establishment of a national homeland for the Jewish people." Under the declaration, Britain promised to do all it could to facilitate the achievement of this objective. This promise was reinforced by the agreement establishing the British mandate in Palestine in September 1923. Under the British British mandate, Zionist emigration to Palestine intensified in an organized and militant manner. On 29/11/1947, the UN General Assembly approved under Resolution 181 the "partition of Palestine into two independent states; an Arab state and a Jewish state" and "a special international status for the City of Jerusalem." The Arabs in Palestine and other parts of the Arab World rejected this plan, and so the armed resistance intensified. On 14/5/1948, the Zionist entity was established with the departure of the British high commissioner and the termination of the colonial British mandate in Palestine. However, the Palestinian people's struggle to regain their land, freedom, and honour did not stop. Throughout the past decades, there were uprisings; foremost, was the ['Izz al-Din] al-Qassam Uprising of 1936. There were also upheavals, the latest of which was the Intifada of 7 December 1987 which crowned the Palestinian Arabs' struggle experience and showed their full readiness for struggle and sacrifice, using stones and knives in order to resist the invader Zionists. The aggressions of 1948, 1956, and 1967 resulted in the complete occupation of the Palestinian homeland, the Syrian Golan, southern Lebanon, and the Egyptian Sinai. This honorable Arab struggle was also the target of continuous plots and suspicious plans which were hatched during or after every Arab setback. The most serious conspiratorial plan followed al-Sadat's visit to occupied Jerusalem, when on 17/9/1978 the Egyptian regime and the Zionist entity reached an agreement under U.S. patronage, namely, the treasonous Camp David Accord and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty, which excluded Arab Egypt from the circle of the conflict against Zionism. The initiative of the Iraqi leadership to convene an Arab summit in Baghdad on 1/18/1978 came as an important step toward isolating al-Sadat's regime and circumventing the Camp David Accord in order to prevent its application to the other Arabs. Leader President Saddam Husayn played a significant role in this regard. After the cease-fire in the immortal Mother of Battles against the U.S.-NATO-Zionist coalition, war criminal Bush declared his initiative before the U.S. Congress on 6/3/1991 -- one week after the end of the hostile 30-state aggression against Iraq -- to avoid the mounting Arab and international pressure resulting from the initiative, which leader President Saddam Husayn declared on 12 August 1990 calling for settling all problems of our region on common bases and principles and in accordance with the so-called international legitimacy, whose falsehood, hypocrisy, and bias had been exposed. Thus the Madrid talks took place under a clear disequilibrium in the balance of powers, especially following the treacherous aggression against Iraq and its strategic capabilities, the divisions of official Arab ranks, and the assertion of U.S. monopoly in the absence of an effective Soviet and European role. The timing of the Madrid talks and their terms of reference as well as the failure to seek a comprehensive solution of the Palestine question and the Arab-Israeli conflict are all gross mistakes, into which the official Arab negotiators and the PLO have fallen. Even under this rejected peaceful settlement, the representatives of the Arab parties ceded their best pressure cards in advance. They gave up all the gains which have been achieved by pan-Arab struggle on international levels, including the resolutions issued by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council. Let us now go back to the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which was hatched in the dark and which surprised the legitimate Palestinian leadership and stunned the Arab nation, causing its frustration and indignation. We do not want to judge the Declaration of Principles on administrative self-rule on the basis of a capitulatory settlement, but on the basis of liberating and asserting the Arabism of Palestine, all of Palestine. (With regard to the Palestine question, it is essential in all phases, and under all circumstances, to take into consideration the nature of the conflict with the Zionist enemy. As leader and founder comrade Michel 'Aflaq said: "This is a crucial and cultural conflict." The Ba'th Party has affirmed right from the start that confrontation with the Zionist enemy is inevitable, and that popular struggle is the best method for this inevitable confrontation. It was on this basis that the Ba'th Party rejected the peaceful settlements propagated by some people because they serve the Zionist entity.) Leader President Saddam Husayn has pointed out that "when the conflict is crucial and cultural, then it is a long, continuous conflict, and it must cover all aspects of pan-Arab development." (As stated in the National Command statement issued on 1/10/1978, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party which, throughout its pan-Arab struggle history, has made the question of liberating the usurped land of Palestine the pivot of the entire Arab liberation cause, cannot consider the conflict with Zionism as a geographical one depending on the liberation of a few kilometers here and a few kilometers there. This stand stems from its awareness that Zionism, which has usurped a dear part of the Arab homeland that forms a link between the Arab East and the Arab Maghreb and displaced its people, is also an aggressive racist, sectarian, fanatic, malicious, and expansionist colonial movement. The conflict between Zionism and the Arab revolution movement cannot be settled through negotiation, bargaining, or attempts at compromise solutions, but through full and allout confrontation until the pan-Arab objectives are achieved. (The party has been aware that the Zionist movement does not derive its strength from within itself, but from enormous imperialist support, and the fact that it is a forward imperialist stronghold, which imperialism preserves and provides with the means of strength in order to use it as a bridgehead for achieving its exploitative, monopolist interests in the region, and as a sharp tool for keeping the Arab homeland divided and dominated by reaactionary Arab forces, and the huge monopolist exploitation of its resources and wealth.) (On the basis of this awareness, the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has always believed that confrontation, not surrender and negotiation, is the means to counter the dangers of Zionism. Confrontation of the Zionist enemy cannot also be separated from confrontation of the imperialist enemy.) In light of this firm, principled pan-Arab stand, we find that the signatories of the Gaza-Jericho agreement have acted to the contrary and have given the right, without being authorized by anyone, to put an immediate and unjust end to the Arab conflict with Zionism and imperialism. The agreement's preamble calls for: "an end to decades of confrontations and conflicts, mutual recognition of political and legitimate rights, and achievement of an honorable peaceful coexistence, mutual security, and a historic reconciliation." Just as al-Sadat committed the sin of talking, negotiating, and signing on behalf of the Palestinian people in the second part of the Camp David Accords, the Palestinian side also behaved as a trustee for the Arab nation by signing in Oslo and Washington an agreement prejudicing all its rights, without any approval or authorization from legitimate Palestinian constitutional institutions. In fact, the Oslo-Washington signatories forced the Governments of Jordan and Egypt to participate in establishing closer cooperation and liaison arrangments with the government of Tel Aviv and the representatives of the Palestinian self-rule. (Clause 12 of the agreement) The danger is not just in the provisions of the agreement, but also in the letter recognizing "Israel." This recognition has been the most important objective sought by the Zionists since the first Zionist congress. It means accepting the historical Zionist plan regarding the establishment of "Greater Israel" from the Euphrates to the Nile. Thus, the signatories of the agreement have abandoned the liberation of all of Palestine as stipulated in the PLO charter. They also conceded the rights of their people in exchange for mere administrative responsibilities within the framework of the usurper Zionist state. This is because the Oslo-Washington agreement does not at all entail any concept of national sovereignty or right of self- determination. Therefore, this agreement cannot lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, as the signatories and their supporters are trying to delude us. Their delusions are refuted by the clear provisions of the agreement and the rejection of the racist Zionist enemy and its strategic ally the United States of America, the leader of terrorism and evil in the world. Someone tried to justify the signing of the agreement by saying: "True, the agreement has not achieved all our aspirations, but it is the best available in the present Arab circumstances and the new world order." Palestinian opposition to the agreement is based on the following considerations: 1. It is a recognition of the legitimacy of the Zionist entity in Palestine. It also means that the rightful owners have conceded their rights and acknowledged the legitimacy of the vicious aggressions, crimes, and violations which have been committed against them. 2. It is an abandonment of Jerusalem, including al-Aqsa Mosque and the other holy places, although UN Security Council Resolution 552 considers them occupied territory. That resolution neither recognizes the annexation of Jerusalem to the Zionist enity, nor does it consider it the eternal capital of this entity. The current population of Jerusalem shows that 55 percent are Zionists and 45 percent Palestinian Arabs. The Jewish percentage will increase with the building of more settlements in the so-called Greater Jerusalem. 3. It does not include withdrawal of the Zionist occupation forces, but only speaks about redeployment and relocation of these forces. The Zionist negotiators held firmly to this concept in the Cairo and Taba talks, saying their security comes first. 4. It is a shaky self-rule under the hegemony of Zionist occupation. It does not at all mean the creation of a sovereign national authority. There is no reference to a Palestinian state in the agreement, which also keeps the crossings and the borders under enemy control. 5. It entrenches the existence of the settlements which have swallowed up more than 50 percent of the lands of the West Bank and Gaza. The enemy refuses to dismantle any of these settlements. In fact, it encourages settlers to hold on to these settlements, expand them, and build more. It also places the security of the settlements under the control of the Zionist forces. The enemy has confiscated 46,000 donums since the signing of the agreement. 6. It does not guarantee repatriation under Resolution 194; neither to the refugees of 1948, nor to the deportees of 1967. The PLO chairman has acknowledged that. 7. Its price is stopping the blessed intifadah and any kind of resistance despite the continuation of the occupation. Armed struggle is described terrorism and violence despite the rivers of pure Arab and Palestinian blood which the righteous martyrs have shed for the sake of liberating Arab Palestine. 8. It makes the self-rule authority a tool of oppression in the hand of the Palestinian police, which has pledged to maintain security, law, and public order under Clause (9) of the agreement. Therefore, they will be sparing the Zionist occupation authority any further burdens and sacrifices. 9. It deepens differences within the one people, exacerbates internal conflict, and weakens the resistance against the occupiers by turning Palestinians against each another despite the talk about democracy and respecting the right of those opposing the agreement. The implementation of the agreement necessitates the suppression of any opposition voice by every method, including physical and moral pressure. As for the dangers resulting from the Gaza-Jericho agreement on the Arab level, they can be summed up as follows: 1. The agreement is a basic contradiction to the cultural pan- Arab plan to achieve the unified socialist democratic Arab society. It is also a deviation from the Arab League Charter, the Arab summit resolutions, and all pan-Arab principles. 2. The agreement torpedoes the idea of greater Arab unity by reecognizing the expansionist Zionist enemy and entrenching the existing regional divisions in accordance with the map of the Sykes- Picot Agreement of 1916 which divided the Arab homneland and the one nation into weak small states; in fact, the Gaza-Jericho agreement wwould lead to further imperialist-Zionist disintegration of the Arab states into ethnic and sectarian cantons and regions. 3. The agreement replaces the existing official Arab order represented by the Arab League by a new Middle East order, which would include Israel in security and political arrangements as well as economic agreements, in addition to other non-Arab states. Thus, the pan-Arab bond would be replaced by regional economic and development interests of mixed nationalities, in favor of Zionism, imperialism and their agents. This is referred to in Annex No. 4 which is attached to the agreement. 4. The formation of a Palestinian-"Israeli" liaison committee referred to in Clause (10) of the agreement which will deal with issues of cooperation and common interest, constitutes a threat to Arab national security. It is also considered a blatant violation of the Pact of Collective Arab Defense and Economic Cooperation signed by the Arab states and attached to the League Charter. 5. The agreement is a Zionist "Trojan Horse" which is openly and directly infiltrating Arab society through a new Palestinian channel without the need for maneuvering. It paves the way for full normalization with the Zionist enemy on the political, economic, and cultural level. 6. The agreement torpedoes the institutions of joint Arab action, especially economic ones, such as the Economic Unity Council. It disrupts the implementation of the economic instruments approved at the 1980 summit in Amman which are concerned with achieving Arab development and separating economic cooperation from political differences. 7. The agreement ends the Zionist entity's isolation and cancels the Arab economic boycott of the enemy that has gravely affected an economy burdened with problems and dependent on U.S. and Western aid and international loans and the provision of investment opportunities, raw materials, cheap labor, and large markets for its prosperity. 8. The agreement lifts all Arab, Islamic, and international barriers to cooperation with the Zionist enemy and recognition of its usurper entity after the rightful Palestinian owners have themselves recognized the enemy. The collapse is already evident in the new attitudes of several Arab regimes, as well as China, the Vatican, African states, and others. 9. The agreement will lead to giving up all positive gains and the resolutions issued in the interests of the Palestinian people and the Arab nation by the Islamic Congress Organization, the Nonaligned Movement, the OAU, the UN General Assembly and the Security Council and other specialized agencies and organizations. 10. The agreement has led and will lead to a further split in the Arab ranks by dividing these ranks into those supporting and those opposing the agreement, after the Palestine question had been a rallying factor and a source of strength and unification for the nation throughout the great Arab homeland. 11. The split will spread to the Arab masses, where the popular organizations and federations as well as the professional unions will be in a real dilemma about how to deal with the Palestinian organizations supporting the agreement, especially since the resolutions of the popular Arab federations have previously blacklisted whoever called for the support of the Camp David Accords or recognition of and normalization with the Zionist enemy and its institutions. And now, three months after Gaza-Jericho First, and last, stumbling and failure are still pervading the negotiation situation due to Zionist procrastination and exploitation of every weak point in the opposite party. So the Palestinian negotiator has no choice but to retreat further and make more concessions. U.S. imperialism and its ally world Zionism are now seeking to liquidate the Palestine question and the Arab nation's rights as rapidly as possible by using the pressure of blackmail on the PLO and the broken-down agent Arab regimes. At the same time, however, the numbers of those supporting this humiliating agreement is receding, the brave Palestinian intifadah operations are escalating, and the objectives of the enemies of Palestine and Arabism are being exposed more and more. Our party has already declared its rejection of this capitulatory settlement which is being led by Washington, and affirmed the nation's rejection of these conspiratorial formulas and its insistence on regaining its usurped rights, especially the Palestinian people's right to their homeland. Awakening the Arab nation's forces through struggle sacrifices, escalating the Palestinian intifadah, adhering to the spirit and message of the Mother of Battles epic, and strengthening the cause of common struggle, aim, and national destiny is the correct way to preserve the Arabism of Palestine and guarantee its liberation from the yoke of imperialist-Zionist occupation. The Gaza-Jericho agreement is bound to fail despite all the foreign support and protection. Finally, victory shall be for Arabism and Palestine under the flag of the faithful, courageous leader Saddam Husayn, may God preserve and protect him.
