Grigoriy Bondarev, a "Yabloko" faction deputy and one of those who first formed the idea for the future law, has said the possibility of compensation in stocks, enterprises, apartments, and even service facilities up for privatization, rather than in money, is being considered. Well-known jurists from the Moscow Private Law Center have been asked to draft the law. Bondarev said, however, that the 70 million affected depositors "should not celebrate victory yet." According to him, the idea for such compensation is being worked on at the State Committee for the Management of State Property but "with no special enthusiasm."
