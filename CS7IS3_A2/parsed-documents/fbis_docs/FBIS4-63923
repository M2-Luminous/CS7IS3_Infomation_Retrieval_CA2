While carefully fulfilling state orders and retaining the mobilization capacity required for them, the Novosibirsk defense sector has still not received payments of 41 billion rubles due to it from the budget. According to Anatoliy Yakovlev, chief of the Novosibirsk Oblast Administration's Machine Building and Defense Sectors of Industry Department, around 70 appeals have been sent to top organs of power. So far they have met with silence. Enterprise trade unions are planning a protest for 9 June.
