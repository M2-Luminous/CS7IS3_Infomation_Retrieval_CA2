Moshchinskiy, Ya. Idzyak, Technical University, Lodz, Poland; UDC 542.938] [Abstract] Protein hydrolysates with low phenylalanine content represent the principal component of the protein diet of children suffering from phenylketonuria, a disease associated with a congenital disorder of the phenylalanine metabolism and the result of genetic blocking of the oxidation of that amino acid into tyrosine. Devising low-phenylalanine diets that use proteins of plant or animal origin capable of countering that problem is difficult because phenylalanine shows up in all nutritional proteins in rather large quantities. The primary raw material for producing low-phenylalanine hydrolysates is casein, which is easily assimilated by a child's body and is readily available. Casein undergoes specific enzymatic hydrolysis for what is possibly the most complete release of phenylalanine from the polypeptide chain, the phenylalanine then being removed from the hydrolysate with a number of techniques. The researchers here developed optimum parameters for the targeted enzymatic hydrolysis of casein. Much of the phenylalanine was removed from the hydrolysate via adsorption on activated charcoal, ion-exchange resins, or molecular sieves. After adsorption on activated charcoal, the phenylalanine content was 0.3 mg/ml or less, which makes possible the production of dry preparations with a phenylalanine content of about 1 mg/ml.
