FR940622-0-00053 FR940622-0-00011 Comment: Two commenters recommended that the OIG seek the maximum civil monetary penalty for every violation of the statute. One commenter believes that there should be a presumption in favor of imposing the statutory maximum and that a lack of prior offenses should not be considered a mitigating circumstance unless the hospital can produce a log of prior transfers showing its history of compliance. Response: Congress did not specify a fixed monetary penalty for every violation. Instead, it provided for hospitals and responsible physicians to be subject to a civil monetary penalty ``of not more than'' $25,000 for violations occurring before December 22, 1987 and ``of not more than'' $50,000 for violations occurring on or after that date. The civil monetary penalty section was amended in OBRA 90 to provide a maximum penalty of $25,000 for hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed, Medicare-certified beds. By setting a maximum amount, Congress implied that the Secretary was to exercise her discretion in selecting an appropriate amount up to that maximum. The OIG will not consider the lack of a prior history of offenses to be a mitigating circumstance, but it may consider a history of inappropriate transfers to be a factor that would warrant imposition of a penalty at or near the statutory maximum. Only if a hospital or physician could offer positive evidence of a history of statutory compliance (for example, by producing logs of its disposition of individuals who had come to the emergency department) would the OIG be inclined to regard the violation as an isolated aberration. Comment: One commenter suggested that if the hospital has identified, evaluated, and taken action or determined that action need not be taken to correct a transfer or emergency care problem, a penalty should not be imposed against the hospital or responsible physician. Response: We disagree. To deter future violations of the statute, Congress intended that violations be sanctioned regardless of whether a violating hospital took remedial action. Such remedial action may prevent the hospital from suffering the consequences of a termination of its provider agreement and the resulting loss of Medicare payment, but it does not shield it from liability for civil monetary penalties if the violations were negligent. Congress enacted section 1867 of the Act because it perceived that hospitals were not policing themselves sufficiently to prevent inappropriate transfers. Comment: One commenter questioned how the regulations can impose a civil monetary penalty of up to $50,000 when the statute only allows a penalty of up to $25,000. Response: Section 4009(a)(1) of OBRA 87 amended section 1867(d) of the Act to increase the maximum civil monetary penalty from $25,000 to $50,000, effective December 22, 1987. Any violation occurring after December 22, 1987 is therefore subject to a maximum fine of up to $50,000 while violations occurring prior to December 22, 1987 are only subject to a maximum fine of up to $25,000. We are amending 42 CFR 1003.103 accordingly. However, section 4008(b)(2) of OBRA 90 again amended the statute by reducing the maximum penalty against hospitals with fewer than 100 state-licensed, Medicare-certified beds of $25,000. Comment: One commenter stated that civil monetary penalties of up to $50,000 constituted a criminal sanction that will place physicians in the position of balancing responsible medical judgment against the fear of fines for an unanticipated event that may occur during transfer; this will have negative effect on emergency care. Response: The maximum amount of the penalty is determined by the statute and cannot be changed in these regulations. The statute expressly provides for a civil monetary penalty of not more than $50,000 if a hospital or physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual in a participating hospital violates a provision of section 1867 of the Act. This penalty is civil in nature and does not constitute a criminal sanction. Civil Enforcement Comment: One commenter stated that there is no statutory authority or Congressional intent allowing citizens to bring suit in the Federal courts for personal harm. Response: Section 1867(d)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a hospital's violation may bring a civil action against the participating hospital, thus creating a Federal private right of action by such an individual. See Bryant v. Riddle Memorial Hospital, 689 F. Supp. 490 (E.D. Pa. 1988). Preemption of State and Local Laws Comment: Three commenters expressed concerns about the statutory provision that states that section 1867 of the Act does not preempt State or local law except where they conflict. One of these commenters thought that Federal law should not supersede State and local law except where the State is not fulfilling its obligation under the law; another commenter believed we should grant immunity to hospitals following Federal statute in conflict with State law. The third commenter said this provision would result in more State regulation where States have similar laws. Response: Section 1867(f) of the Act explicitly states that the provisions of section 1867 do not preempt any State or local law requirement except in cases of a direct conflict. This statutory statement cannot be removed based on negative public comment. We believe, however, that the second commenter misunderstood the provision: when Federal law conflicts with State law, Federal law prevails.
