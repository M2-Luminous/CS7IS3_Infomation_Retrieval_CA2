Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta today announced that the U.S. Government will contribute $100,000 to the fight against drug trafficking. He also announced that the Nicaraguan Government will present a formal request to the United States to open a DEA office in the country. [Sandinist] Deputy Doris Tijerino, chairperson of the Legislative Assembly drug committee, recently warned of the danger that such a move would represent, saying that opening a DEA office in Nicaragua would be an affront to national sovereignty. Minister Alfredo Mendieta rejected drug trafficking charges against members of the National Police [PN], calling the incidents a campaign to discredit the institution. Today he denied that any high-ranking PN officer was involved in drug trafficking and affirmed that there are political motives behind the accusations. [Mendieta] "I strongly deny that the PN, as an institution, could be involved in any way. I strongly reject any implication of involvement by PN Brigade Commander Fernando Caldera. I think it is all politically motivated. Although this may surprise the media, I think there are some politicians behind all this, as I have said from the beginning." Commander Roger Ramirez said that he has done nothing illegal, much less behind the backs of the PN commanders. He was referring to his 25-percent partnership in a hotel on Corn Island, which represents a $55,000 investment. He said he received the money as compensation from the Government Ministry. Mendieta confirmed Ramirez' statements. [Mendieta] "We have no evidence indicating that Commander Ramirez was ever involved in drug trafficking or any other drug-related crime. We are aware of Mr. Ramirez' investments, and he has told us that these funds came from payments made by the Government Ministry during his transition and in compensation for injuries sustained in the line of duty." The government minister today strongly criticized those who want to discredit the PN. [Mendieta] "You cannot implicate an institution such as the PN, which has demonstrated a high degree of efficiency in the fight against drug trafficking. Furthermore, we believe it is even more dangerous to implicate certain individuals who are in fact involved in drug trafficking." [sentence as heard] Commander Roger Ramirez stated that he has the full support of Brigade Commander Augusto Fernando Caldera as well as of his commanding officer, Lionel Espinosa, both of whom are well aware of the fact that he requested his discharge for family and health reasons. Ramirez said he has no enemies in the PN ranks. [Ramirez] "If there is any kind of ill will over this whole matter, as some newspaper reports indicate, I do not think it is coming from the PN. Then again, I cannot say that for a fact, because one minute you think you have friends, and the next they stab you in the back." Ramirez said his conscience is clean. [Ramirez] "I think there are some people interested in discrediting me simply because I tried to maintain a professional image within the institution in accordance with the ground rules the government set forth for the institutions that make up the Armed Forces. In the end, I have a clean and peaceful conscience." Commander Roger Ramirez presented documentation for his partnership in the Corn Island hotel and for his bank accounts and bank deposits, which total less than $12,000. [Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish on 2 May publishes a 475-word report on pages 1 and 8 stating that "EL NUEVO DIARIO has learned that PN Brigade Commander Caldera forced Commander Roger Ramirez to resign." The report goes on to say that "our sources assured us that Ramirez was found to have a checking account with a $240,000 balance, which he could not explain," adding that the "DEA advised Caldera that the funds were from drug trafficking activities." The report warns that "the entangling nets of drug trafficking are gaining ground in Nicaragua," pointing out that "one high-ranking officer has become addicted to cocaine" and the identity of another, "known as the `narco-policeman', will soon be released."]
