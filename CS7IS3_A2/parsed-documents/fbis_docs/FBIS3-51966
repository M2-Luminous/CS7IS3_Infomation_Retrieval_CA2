Growth was based on sectors not affected by international trade: construction, transportation, commerce, finance, and other public and private services. Sectors involved in international trade, essentially manufacturing and agriculture, are becoming less profitable as a result of the trade liberalization and revaluation of the last two years, plus the low international prices of basic commodities. The economy is actually operating on two different tracks. Sectors not involved in international trade are growing at over five percent a year, with prices increasing at about 28 percent, and with high profits. Sectors involved in international trade, on the contrary, are growing much more slowly; prices are rising at less than 15 percent a year, while their average costs, especially wages, are rising more rapidly, driving profits down. It seems rather unlikely that in 1994 the world economy will experience an expansion strong enough to significantly improve international prices of the basic commodities we export or that compete with our domestic production. So the only hope of slowing down the gradual deterioration of businesses affected by international trade lies in modifying the devaluation policy of the board of directors of the Bank of the Republic, and achieving more effective control of contraband and dumping. Without such changes, the growth of the economy and jobs will remain dependent, as they are now, on a boom in construction and services, especially public services because of the surge in government spending. Personally, I do not believe in the long-term solidity of an economy where the vitality of its industry and agriculture is gradually decreasing. Construction, financed partly by foreign capital drawn by attractive dollar profits generated by revaluation, has demonstrated over and over its cyclical character, and it continues to do. Nor is it possible to indefinitely continue increasing public spending or the tax burden to finance this spending.
