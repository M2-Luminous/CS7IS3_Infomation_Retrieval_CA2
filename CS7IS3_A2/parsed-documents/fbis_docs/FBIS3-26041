The meeting's main topic was to review and sum up Shanghai's work in 1993 and to set guidelines for the current primary tasks. Mayor Huang Ju delivered an important speech at the meeting. He said: The past year was one in which Shanghai thoroughly carried out the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and of the Sixth Shanghai Municipal CPC Congress, and in which Shanghai began to seriously implement the municipality's long-term development strategy to develop it into the locomotive for the development of the areas along Chang Jiang, and into an international economic, financial, and trade center. Last year was also an important one in which Shanghai strived to push its economic development to a new level, sought new breakthroughs in its reform and opening up, and strived to bring new changes in its urban construction, in order to score new achievements in building spiritual civilization and to lay a foundation for the municipality to change its face every year and to have a complete face-lift every three years. With the common efforts of all Shanghai people, we have fulfilled Comrade Deng Xiaoping's exhortation made early last year: "Let us work hard for another year; and let us brave the wind and waves, work in a down-to-earth manner, and overcome all difficulties to scale new heights." Huang Ju reviewed Shanghai's work in 1993 from eight aspects: First, Shanghai's economic development was raised to a new level -- its annual total output value amounted to 150 billion yuan, an increase of 14.9 percent, which was higher than the previous year. Since the beginning of 1993, Shanghai's financial revenues increased steadily, resulting in an annual increase of 30.6 percent. Also, Shanghai's economic structure continued to improve, as did the quality of its economic functioning. Second, we made new progress in Shanghai's urban construction; a total of 13 billion yuan, which was a record amount, was used to improve the city's infrastructural facilities. A number of key projects that constitute the framework of the city's three-dimensional traffic network were completed and breakthroughs were made in constructing elevated highways, bringing about quite a change in the city's skyline. Third, new steps were made in deepening Shanghai's reform. The framework for developing a large market system was initially completed, and work in this area rapidly became more law-based and regularized. The market's fundamental role of budgeting resources was further strengthened. Fourth, new progress was made in opening Shanghai to the outside world. Last year the city attracted more than twice as much foreign funds as it did the year before; in addition, the percentages of large foreign projects and of well-known multi-national companies' investment were comparatively high, and the percentage of their investment success was also high. Fifth, new breakthroughs were made in Pudong's development. Pudong's export-oriented economic function focusing on international financial services, foreign trade, and export processing, began to work. Sixth, new development was made in all social sectors of the city. A giant stride was made in the city's educational reform, and the process of industrializing Shanghai's new and high technologies accelerated noticeably. Seventh, we continued to improve the people's livelihood, people's income increased, and all projects of practical benefit to the people were completed. Housing construction was raised to a new height -- new houses with a total floor space of more than 6 million square meters were completed; the quality of city residents' living conditions further improved. Eighth, the building of spiritual civilization reached a new level. Simultaneous soft and hard construction formed a powerful force for driving Shanghai's reform, opening up, and modernization forward. Huang Ju stressed: We must not be dazzled by our achievements; we should realize that many contradictions, difficulties, and problems still lay ahead. It is relatively difficult to handle the relationship between reform, development, and maintaining stability properly, and it is quite an arduous task to maintain the good trend of economic development. We need to double our efforts to overcome these difficulties and to solve these problems. While reviewing and summing up Shanghai's work in 1993, Huang Ju emphatically pointed out: Under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, State Council, and Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee; and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, we must unswervingly adhere to the central task of economic construction, insist on constantly emancipating our minds, and insist on continuing to make explorations with Chinese characteristics, the characteristics of our time, and the characteristics of Shanghai -- this is the foothold for Shanghai's constant efforts to create a new situation in reform and opening up, and to quicken the pace of Shanghai's modernization drive. We pursued the following five principles in carrying out our work in 1993: First, we adhered to the principle "development is the last word," seized the opportunity, quickened the pace of development, and did everything possible to speed up our economic construction. Second, we strived to maintain an edge in reform and in opening up, and quickened the step of building the socialist market economic system framework. Third, we insisted on using high standards for our urban construction work in order to lay a foundation for developing Shanghai into a modern international city. Fourth, we insisted on correctly handling the relationship between reform, development, and maintaining stability, to create a good social environment for accelerating reform and development. Fifth, we insisted on rallying the enthusiasm of the municipal government and the district and county governments to actively explore new ways for administering a super-size city. Huang Ju continued: As to this year's work, an initial plan was set forth at the Second Plenary Session of the Sixth Municipal CPC Committee. We need to rely on the common efforts of all the people of Shanghai in carrying out the work ahead of us. We need to start from the beginning of the new year and to attend to everything we must do; we must ensure a good beginning, add a new dimension to our work, and maintain a good trend, in order to lay a solid foundation for completely achieving all the targets set for this year. While discussing Shanghai's current tasks, Huang Ju pointed out: First, we should ensure a prosperous market, maintain economic stability, and attach great importance to price issues. Concerned departments of the municipal government should fully cooperate with each other, keep a close eye on the market situation, tighten market controls, and strengthen price supervision. They should resolutely crack down on any attempt to drive up prices and to manipulate the market, and on other illegal practices; and should sternly punish those involved. We should do everything we can to secure commodity supplies, ensure abundant stocks, and ensure commodity supplies during the coming Spring Festival season. Commercial establishments and the service sector should launch emulation campaigns on providing civilized and good services; all sectors should work hand in hand to enable Shanghai residents to enjoy a peaceful and happy Spring Festival. We should conscientiously carry out the state's major policies and ensure that all reform measures are instituted in due time. The municipal government, and all district and county governments should continue to enhance their ability to deal with new situations and problems; they should strive to ensure that things proceed steadily and endeavor to maintain economic and social stability. Second, we should ensure social stability; we should continue to sternly and swiftly crack down on crimes, resolvedly wipe out all kinds of social evils, and manage the population from other localities properly. We should further improve traffic control and conditions, and step up publicizing traffic regulations. Public transportation departments should take positive measures to solve commuting problems. We should take effective measures to improve safety work and to prevent major accidents from occurring. We should correctly handle the internal contradictions among the people and remove all destabilizing factors. Following the municipal government's guidelines, departments concerned should launch extensive activities to help the less fortunate; we should ensure that living allowances for retired workers and people with special difficulties are delivered to individuals. Third, we should ensure that rural areas' year-end distribution work is properly carried out; we should do our best to raise sufficient distribution funds to ensure that the peasants' burdens that have been removed by order are not reinstituted at year-end distribution. All county and township (town) governments should provide better guidance for conducting distribution work, step up coordination and inspection work, and endeavor to complete the work by the end of January. Fourth, we should step up work on preventing contagious diseases prevailing in winter and spring; we should strengthen inspection and supervision of food production work and food hygiene in all food stores; we should continue to ban the sale of blood clams. The news media should feature health education programs to enhance residents' health-care consciousness. The meeting also decided the further division of work concerning preparatory tasks for holding the next municipal people's congress; the municipal government's efforts to restore and improve the Waitan financial district's functions; the establishment of new enterprise systems; the building of a central commercial district; and concerning the co-investment of large projects. Attending the meeting were vice mayors of Shanghai; responsible persons of all commissions, offices, and bureaus of the municipal government; and responsible individuals of all district and county governments.
