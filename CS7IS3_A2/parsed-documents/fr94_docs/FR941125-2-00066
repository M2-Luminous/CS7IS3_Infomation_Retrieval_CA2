FR941125-2-00066 FR941125-2-00051 On November 8, 1991, the Governor of Michigan issued Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Executive Order 1991&hyph;31, which became effective on September 2, 1993, provides that: All the statutory authority, power, duties, functions and responsibilities of the Commission of Natural Resources and the Department of Natural Resources *␣*␣* and of the director of the Department of Natural Resources and of the agencies, boards and commissions contained therein *␣*␣* are hereby transferred to the director of a new Michigan Department of Natural Resources, by a Type II transfer, as defined by Section 3 of Act No. 380 of the Public Acts of 1965, being Section 16.103 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 also provided that the responsibilties and authorities of the MWRC were transferred, via a Type III transfer, from the Water Resources Commission to the director of a new MDNR. Pursuant to EPA's request, Michigan submitted numerous documents to EPA that were necessary for EPA to determine whether the revisions to Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program resulting from Executive Order 1991&hyph;93 would comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations and whether such revisions were substantial. According to Michigan, there had been no substantive changes in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Instead, according to Michigan, Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 merely resulted in some reorganization within MDNR. Michigan certified in an Attorney General's Statement that all of the state authorities included in Michigan's original October 26, 1983 program description remained in full force and effect after issuance of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. Based upon its review of the documents submitted by Michigan, EPA made a preliminary determination that there had been no substantial revisions in Michigan's Section 404 wetlands program as a result of Executive Order 1991&hyph;31. However, because there appeared to be a significant amount of public interest in this matter, EPA chose to seek public comment on its determination. Consequently, on April 21, 1994, EPA published a notice in the Federal Register of EPA's preliminary determination and stated that ``EPA is seeking public comment concerning whether any substantial revisions to the State wetlands program were effected by the MDNR reorganization, and comment on Agency approval or disapproval of any revisions to Michigan's wetlands program as outlined in Executive Order 1991&hyph;93 and MDNR's December 15, 1993 submittal.'' The notice further emphasized that ``EPA is not seeking at this time, public comment on unrelated issues regarding Michigan's wetland program.'' Finally, the notice stated that copies of Michigan's description of the wetlands program, related correspondence and EPA's findings of no substantial revisions would be available for public inspection at two locations in Michigan. II. Comments In response to the April 21, 1994 notice, EPA received comments from nine commenters who disagreed with EPA's preliminary determination that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetlands program. In addition, the United States Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service, stated that it agreed with EPA's preliminary determination that Executive Order 1991&hyph;31 did not substantially revise Michigan's wetland program and offered two additional comments. EPA's detailed responses to all comments received are set forth in a document entitled ``Response to Comments Raised Regarding Revisions to Michigan Wetland Program.'' This document can be obtained from Mr. Douglas Ehorn at the address and phone number listed above. A summary of the comments and EPA's responses to the comments is provided below.
