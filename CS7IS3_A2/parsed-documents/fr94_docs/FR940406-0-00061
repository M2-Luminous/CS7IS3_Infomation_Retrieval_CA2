FR940406-0-00061 FR940406-0-00005 While the task of remaking the economic foundation of a community is never easy, a closed military base can be a community's single greatest asset in charting a new future. An airfield, a port, or the land, buildings, furniture and equipment on a base can be a catalyst for new economic activity. The Administration's plan to make base property more affordable to communities for the purpose of job creation is a fundamental change. It allows communities that have viable plans for economic redevelopment to obtain property at prices within their means. The President's Five-Part Plan was an important step in steering the base closure and reuse process toward rapid job creation. In announcing the community revitalization program, President Clinton recognized that existing Federal law required the Department of Defense to charge full price when closed bases will be used for job-creating economic development, yet it can transfer bases for free for a variety of ``public'' uses, including recreation, aviation, education and health. President Clinton stated that the Administration would seek to change the law, to enable the Department of Defense to transfer property for free or at a discount for economic development purposes, when community development plans meet a strict test for economic viability and job creation. Accordingly, the President asked the National Economic Council (NEC) an interagency coordinating arm of the White House and the Department of Defense to draft a proposal that puts economic development at the center of base closure asset disposition. The NEC convened an interagency working group that created the following framework for base disposal: _Where a ready market exists, sell properties quickly for public or private development to speed up job creation. _Where a ready market does not exist, make property available to the local redevelopment authority, without initial cost, for economic development. _Share the net profits between the Department of Defense and the local redevelopment authority if a property conveyed without initial cost for economic development is subsequently sold. The Congress, mindful of the need to reform this process, endorsed the President's plan by authorizing Title XXIX of Public Law 103&hyph;160, Base Closure Communities Assistance, the so-called ``Pryor Amendment''. Based largely on legislation sponsored by Senator Pryor, the provisions of Title XXIX provide the legal authority to carry out the President's plan by, among other things, authorizing conveyances of real and personal property at or below fair market value to local redevelopment authorities, and sharing of profits on subsequent sales and leases. Public Law 103&hyph;160 required the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations to implement the provisions of the law. This is being accomplished under the Administrative Procedures Act which allows for the public to comment on the regulations. Due to the need to begin acting on the proposed regulations, the Department of Defense has issued them as interim final rules which allow actions at closing bases to begin before the regulations are made final after the public comment period. The section related to the conveyance of property in consideration of environmental restoration costs, is issued as a proposed rule and cannot be exercised until a final rule is published following public comment. The following is a summary of the major elements of the rules.
