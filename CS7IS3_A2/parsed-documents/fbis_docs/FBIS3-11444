I have also said that the political movements that are going to prevail and have a broad social base are those that are capable of finding solutions for serious economic and social difficulties. A response must be made to the problems of inflation, stagnating production, unemployment, and many others. Of course there are political and social problems, but economics is also political, and it combines with everything; ultimately, economics is what matters. This is how the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] should see Nicaragua's situation. But first the responsibilities must be clearly established, because, let us say this straight out, the truth is that we all have a stake in the fundamental cause of our economic crisis. The FSLN's real debate should now focus on analyzing where this country is going. We need to examine, one by one, the social conflicts that have arisen from the election results, and so prepare to define the major lines of the economic battle for production and productivity. The new FSLN cannot remain outside a revolution that emphasizes the market, competitiveness, efficiency, productivity, and scientific and technological innovation; in order to act in this situation, the front must prepare itself. The FSLN needs to take part in this new reality, for otherwise it could lose its social influence. What must be defended now is economic reconstruction and the economic advancement of the nation. I believe there is no other way in sight at this time than convergence, economic collaboration, and working with the government on those points where we can agree. Organizing Economic Thinking This is the new economic thinking the FSLN should organize to continue integrating into a single activity the informal sessions, and some that appear clandestine, so they will become legal meetings. The present economic model cannot progress in the midst of a socioeconomic conflict that is the result of the aftermath of war. During the last three years the military conflict has not ended, and in the midst of all this, economic adjustment plans are being applied that have, and can have, no populist character because the present system that has been established here is one of market forces and free competition. According to the government, there is no other way to develop the nation. However, some elements that do not warrant support in the stabilization plan are the orthodoxy of the adjustment, insensitivity toward unemployment, the concentration of wealth in sectors having little interest in investing and making sacrifices to boost production, business nepotism, and the use of this presidential term to engage in corruption. For example, the government alleges that privatizing everything will solve the problem. No, it will worsen it. Any economic system that we want to construct requires a process during which an economic and educational level is developed (which we do not have today; it will take a number of years, many generations to achieve this). We must also look at the experience of other countries so that we will not act too hastily, and so that we can avoid making the same mistakes. Our economic growth strategy must be based on two elements of maximum importance: our society is overindebted and the major part of this debt is our external debt. This means that we do not generate sufficient liquid resources to cover our consumption, much less to invest. In this situation, what strategy should we pursue? Should we consume based on our financial potential, or continue to go deeper into debt? This is the reason why political language should not fall into the temptation of offering people what can never be produced in the mid- and long-term. We cannot offer a war, we cannot offer excellent hospitals, we cannot offer free services, we cannot offer special privileges and perks; instead, what we have to offer are hard work, sacrifice, and honesty. Clash Between New and Old There are no universal remedies for overcoming economic ills. Every nation, depending on its own particular circumstances and its level of development, must find the appropriate way to get through its crisis. The burden of the aftermath of the war falls on farmers and workers. The government has been forced to devote a large part of the budget to fighting people who have taken up arms again. However, the government has been using this as a pretext to design a fiscal and tax policy detrimental to production. In its debates the FSLN should concentrate on these problems in order to restore the model of a mixed economy, one that can again begin to function normally. At this time, the important thing is to solve the economic crisis; this is an urgent task that cannot be postponed. To accomplish it, a national consensus is needed; we need cooperation among the government, the workers, and the business community: agreement among all social sectors. An enormous vacuum can be seen in the FSLN leadership. Now we need to decide whether the partisan structures that are being maintained in a traditional format are appropriate or not. Thousands of workers and campesinos are rallying around the properties that have been acquired and that have to be paid for. Thousands of unemployed are supporting whoever can offer the most at this time. Departmental committees are more concerned about the unemployed than about the workers and people who own some land. The masses are experimenting with new social and production systems, while the FSLN still clings to its traditional system of leadership. The forthcoming Extraordinary Congress needs to resolve this situation and weigh the need to develop a new type of cadres, people who are prepared to promote change and pursue a new course, for this generation of Sandinists has been unable to respond to the organization itself and even less to create a new program for the nation's economic sector. We are trapped in worn-out economic and political thinking. The congress needs to address this issue. The FSLN crisis is everyone's responsibility. The different currents within the FSLN and the debate must be a part of the partisan democracy that gives life to the FSLN. Still, this should not be considered simply politics as usual, as that would lead to the paralysis of the front; nor should these groups be treated as suspect. We need to be open and transparent. This is a fight between a new Sandinism and an old Sandinism that is refusing to die.
