They believe that the Security Council should regard the common interests of the UN members as its goal instead of regarding the concept on value of some large nations and their political interests as the basis to make policy decisions. In addition, such policy decisions are often made quietly in the form of making deals. It is difficult for the ordinary member countries to understand the whole procedure in making policy decisions, let alone joining with others in making such decisions. They urge the international community to earnestly formulate a set of strict standards and the proper procedure for the Security Council to change this kind of irrational phenomenon at present. On Organizationally Expanding Security Council The voices for organizationally expanding the Security Council are becoming louder and louder in each passing day. These voices are mainly coming from the following sources: 1) Japan and Germany long to become permanent members of the UN Security Council. They believe that the provisions on enemy countries in the UN Charter with the World War II defeated nations as the targets have already become "obsolete" and something of the past, and should be abolished. In addition, Japan and Germany have already become members of the United Nations in 1956 and 1973 respectively. They have said that their economic strengths are incompatible with their international political status. They belong to the group of UN members who pay the highest membership fees (Japan accounts for 12.45 percent of the UN funds, next only to the U.S. share of 25 percent; Germany makes up 8.93 percent). On the one hand, they have been asked to shoulder more international responsibilities; while on the other hand, they are excluded from the ranks of permanent security council members. It is necessary to resolve the contradiction between their bound duties and their rights. They believe that they are capable of participating in the management of world affairs and have the responsibility to do so. 2) The developing nations seek to have more say in UN matters. However, there are no African or Latin American nations that are permanent Security Council members. For example, Indonesian President Suharto, Chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement, proposed to add six more permanent council members. In addition to Japan and Germany, the other four seats should be given to developing nations. He suggested that the two large populated Asian nations India and Indonesia be given one seat each, while the largest nations in Africa and Latin America one seat each. 3) Some regional large nations complain that they have not enjoyed the due rights to speak in the Security Council in solving regional disputes. They seek to become permanent members of the Security Council. 4) Many countries believe that the current distribution of the seats of the Security Council was determined by the balance of the international power when the United Nations was first founded. However, right now tremendous changes have taken place in international relations, and the regional distribution of the Security Council member states seems to be unfair. They demand that the existing structure of the Security Council be changed. Due to the fact that the Security Council has the power to pass any resolution of a compulsory nature, which all UN member states are obliged to accept and implement, a nation which is a Security Council member of the United Nations, particularly a permanent council member, enjoys great power in handling international affairs. Therefore, the competition to become a member, particularly a permanent member, of the Security Council is naturally fierce. Here, we have several issues that we must first take into consideration and discuss. 1) In dealing with an organization such as the Security Council, which assumes the primary responsibility in maintaining international peace and security, what kind of scale is most appropriate. If the scale is too small, it will lack comprehensive representation. If the scale is too large, it would be difficult for the Security Council to take actions effectively. Here there is an issue of scale. It looks like the expansion should not be too large. 2) If it is necessary to increase the number of the permanent members of the Security Council, the economic strengths of the candidates should be regarded as a major factor in selecting successful candidates. Some people have proposed that those nations which make the largest economic contribution to the United Nations and support UN actions most vigorously in maintaining peace should be selected. Others stressed the need to impartially choose the successful candidates from different regions. It is essential to fully discuss and deliberate on this issue beforehand. 3) Due to the fact that a permanent member of the Security Council has the veto power, the discussion of the issue on the increase of the number of permanent Security Council members will inevitably involve the veto power. Therefore, this issue must be considered with the veto power in mind. Some people even propose to add "semi-permanent council members" in order to work around the issue of veto power. Issue of Veto Power on Principle of Unanimity Among Major Powers In accordance with the provisions of the UN Charter on the voting procedure, votes of approval from nine council members are needed to pass any resolution concerning procedural matters, while votes of approval from nine council members including all permanent council members are needed to pass any resolution concerning non-procedural matters. That means to say that the vote of disapproval from any permanent council member would veto any resolution concerning non-procedural matter in the Security Council. That is referred to as veto power on the principle of unanimity among major powers. Amid the calls for reforming the Security Council, many people raise objections on the issue of veto power. Some people have said that veto power has become the "privilege of large nations." This runs counter to a passage in the UN Preface that "various nations, large and small, enjoy equal rights" and the principle of "all member states being equal" in its Article Two. Other people have said that all nations, large or small, rich or poor, should be able to discuss and make decisions on major world affairs on an equal basis. Large nations should not enjoy any special privilege. Still others have said that the current situation is different from the situation at the time when the United Nations was first founded and five major powers were given special status. These people believe that the five major powers should not enjoy veto power. Other people have also said that in view of the fact that veto power has often been abused by some major powers, the use of veto power should be abolished or at least restricted. We believe that we must carefully study the principle of unanimity among major powers from an historical point of view. When the United Nations was first founded, various nations had studied, and drew lessons from the experience of the League of Nations. Due to a provision of the League of Nations, votes of approval from all member states attending any session were needed to adopt any League or administrative resolution. It meant that all member states of the League of Nations enjoyed the veto power in general. As a result, the League of Nations could hardly achieve anything effectively. Therefore, the United Nations only gave five major powers the right to cast veto so that the United Nations could assume its due responsibilities, play its role effectively, and avoid taking the same disastrous road followed by the League of Nations. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that the major powers enjoy the right to cast veto in order to protect their own interests. Therefore, the principle of unanimity among major powers is built on the basis of helping the United Nations operate effectively and of safeguarding the interests of the large nations. This principle has dual characteristics. It has a positive side as well as a negative side. From the point of view of the positive side, the granting of the veto power to major powers not only represents a privilege, but also enjoins them to fulfill a task to maintain international peace and security. The veto power may spur major powers to strengthen negotiations and cooperation, and help the Security Council play its role even more effectively. Meanwhile the veto acts as a restraining force on some major powers which act wildly to trample upon the UN Charter. Nations vary in economic and military strengths, population and strategic positions. Therefore, their influences on the world affairs are also different. The United Nations cannot play its role very well, if major powers are not asked to assume some special responsibilities, consult with one another and reach unanimity in handling world affairs on the basis of the purpose and principle of the UN Charter, and if they are not given the veto power to restrain each other. Let us review the history. In July 1987, the five Security Council member states adopted, after consulting with one another, the No. 598 Resolution, calling for a cease-fire between Iraq and Iran. That was the first time for scores of years that the five mayor powers had reached unanimity on a major issue of war and peace. After this, the Security Council had played an unique role in helping Namibia become independent, tackling the Cambodian issue and settling regional conflicts. During the Gulf crisis, the Security Council had adopted 12 resolutions, effectively stopping Iraqi activities of aggression. From the point of view of the negative side, some major powers abuse the veto power for their own interests. The veto power was used 279 times from 1946 to May 1990 at the Security Council. On many occasions, it was abused. During the period of the cold war between the United States and the Soviet Union, both sides worked hard to oppose each other in many incidents, seriously weakening the role of the Security Council. Right now, the world has entered a new stage with the new structure replacing the old one. Although the confrontation between the two sides has ended, hegemonism and power politics still exist, and factors for the abuse of veto power have not disappeared. It seems that the abolition of veto power is not the best choice. To deny the special role and responsibilities of the major powers is unrealistic. Veto power can be abused, but it can also be used to maintain world peace and security. The question is how to give full play to its positive aspect, while suppressing its negative aspect. Opinions vary on the use of veto power right now. Some people propose to keep veto power, while others advocate its abolition. Still others believe that the use of veto power should be restricted. For example, veto power cannot be used on some issues (such as the admission of new member states). Some people believe that the power of the UN General Assembly should be expanded. For example, when a major power vetoes a resolution, such a veto can be overruled if the majority of member states vote against this veto at the UN General Assembly. This issue should be handled prudently. Principle To Be Followed in Carrying Out Reform The success or failure of the reform program hinges on correct orientation. In carrying out reform, we must take the purpose and principle of the UN Charter as guidance. The reform program should be conducive to the peaceful settlement of international conflicts and to achieving economic balance and development of the various countries throughout the world. In carrying out reform, it is essential to have a clear-cut objective. The reform is aimed at further improving the efficiency of the Security Council, increasing its abilities to act, and helping it fulfill the task entrusted it by the UN Charter without affecting the council's role and efficacy and damaging the existing effective mechanism. In carrying out reform, we must implement the principle of promoting democracy, justice, objective rationality and effectiveness in a balanced way. The reform of the Security Council involves the interests of various nations, regions and groups. Efforts must be made to coordinate the stand of the large nations with that of the medium and small countries, and the stand of the developed nations with that of the developing countries. We must carry out reform after extensively soliciting views from all quarters, and carrying out overall negotiations. The reform program must be generally approved by a large number of member states. A few nations should not have the final say on world affairs. As for the number of additional members of the Security Council, it is necessary to take into consideration the principle of regional distribution and impartiality. Reforming the Security Council involves amending the UN Charter. However, there is a legal procedure for amending the UN Charter. To amend the UN Charter, we must pass a resolution at the UN General Assembly and go through a General Conference specially held for this purpose. Article 108 of the UN Charter stipulates: "Amendments to the present Charter shall come into force for all Members of the United Nations when they have been adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly and ratified in accordance with their respective constitutional processes by two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council." Article 109 stipulates: "A General Conference of the Members of the United Nations may be held for the purpose of reviewing the present charter." It also points out that "Any alteration of the present Charter recommended by a two-thirds vote of the conference with their respective constitutional processes by two-thirds of the Members of the United Nations including all the permanent members of the Security Council." From this it can be seen that no matter whether the alteration is examined by the General Assembly or the General Conference, it must win votes from two-thirds of the members of the United Nations, including all the permanent members of the Security Council. Therefore, it is extremely important to strengthen negotiations among all member states and help all members of the Security Council reach unanimity. To sum up, the reform of the Security Council involves the interests of various nations and the amendment of the UN Character. It is essential to extensively solicit the views of all the countries, discuss all issues fully and carry out negotiations. It will be a long process.
