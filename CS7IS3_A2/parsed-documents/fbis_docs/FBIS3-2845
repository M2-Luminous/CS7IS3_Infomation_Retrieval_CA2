The deputies, wearing Western-style business suits, Tibetan gowns, or jackets, stepped down the ramp, carrying briefcases with digital locks or colorful Tibetan bags. As soon as he stepped down from the plane, Jian Zeng, who wore a business suit, told us: "Medog County can now be reached by car!" Medog used to be the only county in Tibet not accessible by car. Two years ago, Jian Zeng walked nearly two weeks from his county to Lhasa to catch a plane to Beijing to attend the Fifth Session of the Seventh NPC, but because of the rugged terrains he missed the plane, and his belated arrival made him a figure in the news. For this reason, many deputies forwarded a motion at that session that all counties in China must be accessible by highways. This wish has eventually materialized. Although Jian Zeng is only 39, he has served as deputy to two NPC sessions. He said: "I am particularly excited to be in Beijing today. People in my county asked me to deliver a message of thanks to the government for its concern and support. From now on, people in Medog have a way leading them to become well off." The Medog highway was a regret in China's communications history. The state attached great importance to the highway's construction and invested more than 35 million yuan in building it in mountainous areas. The highway was eventually completed and opened to traffic on 1 February. During the construction, dozens of road builders gave up their precious lives and nearly 100 workers have been disabled. According to Jian Zeng, people in Medog cannot wait to open shops along the new highway. He added that people in the county are working on projects of setting up village and town enterprises, and that the local people's per capita income has now reached 800 yuan. Bai Zen is one of the two female deputies of the Tibetan delegation. Speaking on changes in Tibet, she said no changes can be greater than the change in people's minds. Along with the establishment of the market economy, she said, the "roof of the world" has also opened its door. Even women who used to stay home all the time have become a main force in economic construction by setting up stores and restaurants and even doing business in coastal areas in southeast China. As the principal of the No. 1 Lhasa Primary School, she said she is proud that boys and girls in Tibet now have the same opportunity to receive education. She said that half of her school's pupils are girls and 90 percent of the teachers are female. Pingcuo is the only deputy representing the Moinba nationality -- a people with the smallest population in China. He said that none of his ancestors had ever thought of coming to Beijing to take part in state affairs discussions like he has. He said: Although the old Tibetan Government "Garsa" (parliament) also met once a year, serfs did not have any rights to express their views at all! Today, we and people of the other 55 nationalities have become the masters of our country and we have our own seats at the NPC where we can take part in state affairs discussion. Pingcuo, who has put on a brand new Tibetan gown, said: Tibetan delegation members have carried with them the wish shared by the more than 2.6 million Tibetan people, namely working with people of all nationalities in the country to achieve a better life and head for prosperity together through developing the economy. Before coming to Beijing, the Tibetan deputies had extensively solicited the views of people in all quarters, and they are ready to forward 15 proposals with regard to how to develop Tibet's economy and revitalize its agriculture and animal husbandry.
