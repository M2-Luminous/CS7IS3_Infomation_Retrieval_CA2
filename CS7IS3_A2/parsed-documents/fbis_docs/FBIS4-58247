The new inclination is tacit, for the time being, and no one will publicly admit it, but it is not one man's domain. It is embraced by power centers at the Foreign Ministry and, to a certain extent, by top IDF [Israel Defense Forces] echelons. It has not taken root at the prime minister's bureau yet, but experience shows that things which start brewing at the Foreign Ministry never fail to touch Yitzhaq Rabin eventually. Both the IDF and the Foreign Ministry would like to deviate from the Oslo agreement timetables and move on at once (after the agreement on the Gaza and Jericho withdrawal is signed) to talks on the permanent arrangements. In both bodies, the prevailing opinion is that adherence to the staged implementation principle will generate a prolonged period of terror that would best be skipped or reduced. It is believed that when the PLO takes over in Gaza and Jericho, it will try to curb terrorism in these districts and prevent terrorist attacks in the Jewish enclaves under its rule. Yet it is clear to all those who are involved in the negotiations that terror will continue in the West Bank and inside the Green Line and that the PLO will not go out of its way to prevent it. From 'Arafat's point of view, continued terror spurs Israel to concessions and makes territorial occupation abhorrent to it. In view of these assessments, very senior IDF and Foreign Ministry officials are saying that it would be preferable to forgo negotiations on the West Bank autonomy (following the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement) and broach the permanent arrangement issue at once. There is another, more moderate alternative: No official declaration concerning the dissolution of the negotiations on the interim stage of West Bank self-rule will be made. Rather, the interim stage will be imbued with permanent arrangement contents. Meanwhile, a proposal for an even more far-reaching course of action has evolved at the Foreign Ministry: Other central components of the Oslo agreements should be abandoned on the pretext that the experience amassed since September 1993 requires that new lessons be learned and basic premises be updated. This theory contends not only that the second stage -- that of the establishment of interim self-rule -- is superfluous and cumbersome, but also that Israel should dispense with the axiom that it will not disband settlements. The grounds for this doctrine are as follow: Israel scored "superfluous achievements" in Oslo. It demanded and received a five-year interim period, which today seems an undesirable station along the road. Furthermore, it has obtained the PLO's consent to all the Israeli settlements' remaining intact, although the truth of the matter is that there are quite a few settlers who would rather return home to inside the Green Line. The same applies to the fate of entire settlements that are isolated (such as Netzarim and Kfar Darom), which are being kept in place only because of the principle signed in Oslo, although all the Jerusalem policymakers agree that they are nothing but a nuisance. Why, then, should Israel zealously insist on each clause of the agreements, when the new reality suggests that certain clauses should be amended or waived? The promoters of this approach note, in addition, that under the interim stage clauses of the Oslo agreements, the IDF will have to evacuate the centers of West Bank cities. They wonder how this clause can be implemented as long as the Jewish islands in the heart of Hebron (and in Nabulus: the Joseph's Tomb yeshiva, for instance) are kept in place. The one man who does not share this perception (for the moment?) is Yitzhaq Rabin. The prime minister has developed an obstinate -- some say "square" -- adherence to the Oslo agreements, from which he refuses to budge. He wants to see how the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented, and only on the basis of lessons learned from this experience will he approach the next stage of the agreements. The message he is conveying is that he cannot imagine reneging on the commitment that no settlements will be disbanded during the interim period. For Rabin, keeping his promises is the supreme test of his personal credibility and, therefore, of his ability to retain his main electoral asset: the public's trust. In the coming days, Rabin is liable to find himself in a complicated situation in which the question will again arise: To what extent is he steering the course of events and to what extent are events controlling him?
