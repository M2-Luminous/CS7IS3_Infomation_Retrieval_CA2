Reports from Lisbon indicate that the returnees would be housed in disused buildings and military bases in northern Portugal after being airlifted from South Africa. Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said he was extremely concerned about the violence in South Africa but that he did not think he should advise the Portuguese community in South Africa to leave the country yet.
