It threw heavenly values overboard all over the world and then it trampled upon human rights while falsely bragging about them. It has confirmed its continued opposition to human rights in Iraq by its stupid insistence on continuing the unfair and unjust blockade. This despot behaves like one who refuses to look into the mirror to avoid seeing his ugly face. The devils are in Washington and London. They do not even bother to read about what Iraq has done to fulfill the UN Security Council resolutions, despite their unfairness. They are targeting true Islam as expressed by Iraq. They want to finally liquidate Arabism and pan-Arab hopes in a new war of the Franks, albeit in a tattered garb. Whoever reads history will understand the substance of the policy being pursued by the leaders of the capitalist Western powers. This is their custom toward the Arab world and Muslims. The Arab world knew them in the war of the Francs, which the West called the Crusades, and the invasion of the Arab Levant by the Knights of St John of Jerusalem following the liquidation of the Islamic state in Andalusia. Our people knew them in contemporary history after the Balfour Declaration and the Sykes-Picot Agreement that divided the Arab homeland among France, Britain, and Italy, and through the U.S. empire, represented by U.S. domination of several Arab officials and the confiscation of their independent decisionmaking, as well as its complete domination of UN Security Council resolutions. The United States must understand that no matter how much they suffer from hunger and the unfairness of U.S.-British policy, the Iraqis will be with the leader struggler Saddam Husayn, backing his decision, supporting his stand, upholding his opinion, and fighting at his behest. This is a fact that Western leaders must understand. It has been expressed by the poet who said: Even if they drown it in blood, Iraq will remain sincere to its Arabism. Damn U.S.-British policy and its hostile stands against the Iraqi people! God is great and victory will always be for the leader of Iraq and his great people.
