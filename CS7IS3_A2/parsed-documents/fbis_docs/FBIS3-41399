Zurich Police Are Helpless"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Zurich, 15 Feb (ATS) -- According to Arthur Grob, head of Zurich's municipal police drug-team, increased repression of drug-related crime in 1993 was ineffective. On Tuesday at the press conference on crime statistics, he stated that the police are helpless, and do not know how to curb the overt drug scene. Zurich's municipal police arrested more drug addicts and dealers last year than ever before--a 51 percent increase as compared with 1992. The police seized 30 kilograms of heroin, eleven kilograms of cocaine, and 1.72 million Swiss francs [SFr] in cash. None of this did improve the situation, Mr. Grob said. He believes that repression must be supported by the establishment of anti-drug "closed clinics." Out of the 1,657 persons held for questioning last year in the Letten, some 20 percent came from Zurich. Foreigners made up 8.4 percent of the total figure. Drug traffickers gather in one of Zurich's red-light districts. Out of the 1,368 persons held for questioning, 593 were Swiss citizens. The rest were nationals from Albania, former Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Turkey, and North Africa. Most were in Switzerland illegally--a trend already noted in 1992 according to Mr. Grob--whereas in previous years they tended to be registered as asylum seekers.
