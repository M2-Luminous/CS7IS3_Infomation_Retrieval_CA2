Is there a difference between a meeting and an encounter? Yes there is. Hafiz al-Asad did not go to meet with Clinton. He went to Geneva to have an encounter. Meeting is between two parties each of which has a specific position and opinion on the issues under discussion. An encounter is between two parties that agree on positions, opinions, and views under discussion or disputed issues. From the first moment of that encounter, observers noted there was a full agreement in views and positions. If this conclusion is not new to our people in Syria and the Arab world in general, it does at least put an end to what was said in certain Arab and Western capitals to the effect that Hafiz al-Asad has something to say to Bill Clinton. Hired and yellow [signifying anti-Arab] media hinted, or even stated decidedly, that Hafiz al-Asad would propose to Clinton solutions to our problems and issues out of concern for our national and pan-Arab issues, the most important of which is the Arab's central cause, the Palestine question, and withdrawal from the Golan Heights and South Lebanon as stipulated by UN Security Council resolutions, particularly Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. "The peace of the brave" is a term that was uttered repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, but neither of them said what it means. The "just and comprehensive peace" was also uttered repeatedly by Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, also without explaining what they mean by it. Bilateral ties and removing anything obstructing their improvement and progress between al-Asad's regime and the U.S. Administration was Hafiz al-Asad's main concern for the past four years. He did not want to be bypassed by the new world order, the order of hegemony and control which the United States is trying to impose on the world under the current imbalance. Consequently, during that period Hafiz al-Asad did everything to please the U.S. Administration. He even went so far as to send Syrian Armed Forces to stand by the side of the U.S.-Atlantic forces in Hafar al-Batin trenches to launch a flagrant, treacherous aggression against fraternal Iraq. In Geneva, and from the start, Hafiz al-Asad was nominated a representative and a faithful defender of the U.S. and Zionist interests. Lockerbie, terrorism, narcotics, and Lebanon are cases with which the U.S. Administration used to threaten Hafiz al-Asad's regime. They will all be closed after Hafiz al-Asad confirmed his good conduct and intentions toward the U.S. and Zionist interests and his constant readiness to be the obedient executer of all that he is asked to do in the forthcoming phase, the phase of normalization and entry into the Zionist age, the age of submission and capitulation and the burning of all false, shining slogans on liberation, progress, development, and defending the pan-Arab interests. Therefore, what happened in Geneva was not a meeting, but an encounter and a full agreement in views, directions, and conduct. The Geneva summit between Clinton and al-Asad marks a new phase that has its own characters and features. It will certainly be the phase of openness and publicity and the phase of full agreement and harmony between al-Asad's regime, the Zionist enemy, and the U.S. Administration to humiliate our nation, subjugate it, and plunder its wealth. However, Clinton and al-Asad have forgotten that the will of the free peoples cannot be tied to what the agents and the usurper enemies agree upon.
