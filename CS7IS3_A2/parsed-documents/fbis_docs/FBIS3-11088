Yesterday the Higher Foreign Trade Council voted to increase the duty on beans, set references prices for lentils, chickpeas, broad beans, and kidney beans, and maintained the import permit for cut-up chicken. The duty on kidney beans rose from 15 to 20 percent. The Ministry of Agriculture explained that the measure is an attempt to promote crop diversification and substitution programs being carried out in depressed areas. In the case of cotton, it was decided to adopt permanently the 10-percent duty that had been set on a provisional basis. The reference prices set for four types of grain are an attempt to establish a base value aimed at helping customs authorities to identify cases of underbilling on imports. Powdered milk imports were deregulated based on a possible shortfall on the domestic market. The decision to maintain the restriction on cut-up chicken was made because it poses a continuing threat to national producers. On the recommendation of the National Narcotics Council, it was also decided to include acetic anhydride and toluene on the list of products requiring an import permit. According to the Council, these products, which are used in the paint industry, could be entering the country for the purpose of producing illicit drugs. Minister of Foreign Trade Juan Manuel Santos said that one of the most important measures was the adoption of the trade protection system based on which the government will be able to impose duties or quotas on imported products that seriously affect local production. "If the national and international situation indicates that there may be a serious threat to national production, protection of a given sector will be justified," Santos explained. "This is a clause applied throughout the world and Colombia had simply delayed passing it," he added. Tariff and Cars The foreign trade oversight agency also ratified the automotive agreement between Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. According to Santos Calderon, an order will be issued next week setting the import duty on vehicles at 35 percent. The order helps luxury automobiles, the duty on which is now 40 percent. However, other types of vehicles will pay 35 percent. For commercial vehicles such as vans (panel trucks) and ambulances, the duty will drop from 20 to 15 percent. In addition, and as this daily newspaper announced yesterday, a system of safeguards was defined. This is a mechanism making it possible to establish temporary protection against an unusual increase in imports of a product hurting national production. For agriculture and fishing, the safeguard will consist of a surtariff. Manufactured products may also request a surtariff and, in extreme cases, an import quota. The issue of environmental requirements governing imported gasoline will be taken up at the next Council meeting. [Box, p 12A] Cattlemen Reject Imported Milk The Antioquia Cattlemen's Federation (FADEGAN) and Milk Cooperative (COLANTA) have emphatically rejected the deregulation of powdered milk imports, which had been required to have import permits since the middle of last year. In a letter sent to Ministers Rudolf Hommes (Finance), Juan Manuel Santos (Foreign Trade), and Jose Antonio Ocampo (Agriculture), the Antioquia Cattlemen are asking that the import permit be retained. FADEGAN says its position "in no way means that we defend excessive protectionism." The cattlemen also insist that allowing powdered milk to enter the country is a step backward, and warn of "the harmful consequences which this measure will have for the rural producer." In 1993, the livestock sector and dairy industry both experienced one of their worst crises ever. The difficult situation forced pasturizers to lower the price of milk and the government to institute the import permit in order to bolster national milk production. COLANTA, an association of 9,000 milk producers in Antioquia, Cordoba, and the coffee belt, argues that foreign milk is a danger to Colombian industry, which has to compete with the high subsidies granted by wealthy nations.
