How will it tackle economic tasks such as early enactment of the 1994 fiscal budget and the resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks? NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN has interviewed Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, on how he intends to carry out these pressing policies. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are there any prospects for resuming the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks? [Hata] The cooperative system between Japan and the United States is important for the world economy, so all members of the Hata cabinet will work towards resuming the stalled framework talks. Although the Japanese Government is trying to conclude the framework talks prior to the Naples summit, I intend to use every contact with U.S. Government officials as an opportunity to discuss ways to resume the stalled talks. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States imposes one-sided sanctions against Japan. What do you think of this U.S. posture? [Hata] Neither Japan nor the United States should engage in eccentric action. Now that moves are afoot worldwide to create the World Trade Organization (WTO), Japan should have a candid exchange of views with the United States in order to dissuade the latter from invoking the Super 301 provision against Japan. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons? [Hata] Japan needs to cooperate with any decisions made by the United Nations. Since North Korea intends to settle the issue through dialogue, it is premature to discuss specific ways to resolve the issue. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to promote deregulation? [Hata] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is being asked to press ahead with deregulation. MITI needs to make further efforts towards deregulation. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you see Japan's economy? When do you anticipate Japan's economy recovery? [Hata] Housing and certain commercial electrical goods are showing favorable indicators, but Japan's economy is still mired in recession. The budget has a great effect on the economy, so I want to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994 enacted in the Diet at the earliest possible date. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is growing criticism that the bureaucracy is conspicuously controlling the policy decision process. [Hata] Such criticism attests to the excellence of Japanese bureaucrats. While bureaucrats have expert knowledge, politicians make their decisions based on broad perspective. Politicians and political parties decide on policy matters and take responsibility for what they decide. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you have concrete measures to reduce Japan's trade surplus? [Hata] Japanese private enterprises are largely responsible for Japan's surplus trade. I doubt the administration set certain numerical targets for reducing Japan's trade surplus. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the controversy over the resignation of former Industrial Policy Bureau chief Naito? [Hata] Personnel changes are to turn the bureaucratic mentality around and make bureaucrats carry out their duties in a fair and neutral manner. MITI has tried to conduct personnel changes in that manner since Naito's resignation triggered the controversy.
