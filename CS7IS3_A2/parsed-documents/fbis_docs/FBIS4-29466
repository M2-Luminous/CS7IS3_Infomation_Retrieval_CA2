In Vietnam, which is proceeding with opening up to foreigners, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced that it had begun production of small buses jointly with a Malaysian firm in May. Various U.S. and European firms, such as Chrysler of the United States, are also probing expansion. By Japan's largest firm, Toyota, embarking on a study of commercialization, it appears that there will be full-scale competition in expansion by various countries. These memoranda were exchanged during a visit to Vietnam in May by Toyota Director Akira Yokoi. A team will be created by Toyota and VEAM, and they will survey prospects for the auto industry in Vietnam for the period of the next 20 years up until 2015, and explore possibilities of expansion. They are scheduled to compile it by August. VEAM was inaugurated in 1990 under the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Ministry of Heavy Industries. It is the country's largest machinery manufacturer, embracing 12 diesel engine and other factories. It has a record of technical cooperation with Yanmar in engines for agricultural machinery. In the outlook of the Vietnamese Government, it is estimated that the number of autos possessed in Vietnam, which currently appears to be 200,000 cars, will increase to over 650,000 in the next 20 years. Regarding the study of commercialization with VEAM, although Toyota Motor considers that "nothing has been decided on specifics (such as joint-venture production)," it is showing a positive stance on early expansion, saying that "Vietnam is moderate in size as a market compared to China." Since Toyota opened resident offices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in July 1993, it has proceeded with collection of information. The recent conclusion of memoranda means that the investigation of possibilities for expansion has advanced one step. According to a private research institution knowledgeable about the auto industry in Asia, VEAM "has experience in engine and other parts manufacture, and also has facilities and personnel." However, the government agencies that have jurisdiction over automakers in Vietnam are divided into the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and Ministry of National Defense, in addition to the Ministry of Heavy Industries which presides over VEAM, and basic auto production cultivation policy is not determined. For this reason, Toyota's policy is to await the completion of the survey with VEAM and cautiously study joint-venture parties and the time.
