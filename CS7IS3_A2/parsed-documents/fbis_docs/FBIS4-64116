The statement, made at the close of the military parade in Tbilisi's Central Square to mark independence day, was born out by the march-past of infantry, naval and paratrooper units sporting new uniforms and armed with the latest Kalashnikov automatic guns, the roll-past of armoured vehicles, artillery guns and anti-aircraft missiles. A squad of the Su-25 attack planes assembled at the Tbilisi plant performed aerobatics in the sky above the Central Square during the parade.
