Last year fixed-assets investment reached 27.2 billion yuan, up 93 percent over the previous year. Infrastructure received a record investment of 11 billion yuan, twice the amount for 1992. And more than 8,200 projects were launched. The region has introduced flexible measures to speed up the construction of important projects. For instance, the first joint- stock venture in the field of electric power was set up last year to promote the construction of the Bailongtan Station, which cost over 100 million yuan. By the end of 1993 a total of 34 priority projects were progressing smoothly, with over 20,000 long-distance telephone lines and five fiber-optic telecommunications lines installed, and ports achieving an annual handling capacity of 2.7 million tons. The region's construction industry has also seen remarkable progress. In 1993 it registered 5.03 billion yuan in output value, 78 percent more than in the previous year. Meanwhile, the real estate market has been booming in the area. Last year it grossed 1.4 billion yuan in sales of commercial dwellings, making a profit of over 100 million yuan. Meanwhile, the province has strengthened control over the industry, having already closed down about 380 substandard real estate companies. So far, the region has 14 cities, with an urban population of 7.38 million. In 1993 it poured 2.8 billion yuan into urban construction, three times the figure for 1992.
