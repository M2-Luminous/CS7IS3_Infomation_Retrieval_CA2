The year of 1992 marked the entry of the bilateral relationship into a new phase of development, Zhu, here on a nine-day official visit, said in a speech titled "China's Reform and Development in 1994." In 1992, Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin visited Tokyo while Japanese Emperor Akihito traveled to Beijing in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties, he explained. "The Chinese Government and people attach great importance to their good neighborly relations with Japan," he said. He said China shares much in common with Japan and the two countries complement each other economically. Bilateral trade totaled 39 billion U.S. dollars last year, an increase of 54 percent over the previous year, the vice-premier noted.
