[Kaczmarek] I was asked whether the issue of the free shares that the Jelfa work force is supposed to receive will reflect the value of the input of effort contributed by the employees to the development of that prosperous firm--also, whether the minister has the official power to bypass regulations that are binding for everyone else. It was suggested that I award 15 percent of Jelfa shares free to the work force, or recommend that the Council of Ministers do so. In addition, the employees expressed their wish to buy a further 5 percent of their firm's shares. However, during quite blunt talks that we held with the firm's representatives, I refused to endorse such a procedure. This is because I believe that the allocation of shares to the work force should be decided within the firm on the basis of its statute. Jelfa's trade unionists tried to persuade me to agree to different solutions, which depart from the regulations currently in force. [Saniewska] But there is no shortage of examples throughout the country that prove that exceptions are being made to the rule. Why should Jelfa or Polifarb Wroclaw not set another precedent? [Kaczmarek] There have indeed been several precedents, notably Kwidzyn, Gorazdze, Polifarb Cieszyn, and Tonsil. I am familiar with the last case from my own experience. I was obliged to buy out the promissory note drafted by my predecessor. There, the work force was not able to take advantage of the chance to buy their own company's shares on the same principles that had been enjoyed by the employees of the first five joint-stock companies to be floated on the stock market. There have been quite enough of these precedents, and I have no intention of bypassing the regulations set out in relevant parliamentary acts. The only cases where decisions to do so can be made at all must be truly exceptional, and I do not find such a situation at Jelfa--or in other enterprises whose work forces desire to make a major killing on the stock market in connection with the current boom. They want to grab as many shares for themselves as they can, at the lowest prices. However, such an attitude is very selfish when you consider the possibilities open to employees of the budget-funded sector, old age and disability pensioners, or the learned professions. I would not like to contribute to deepening divisions over privatization in our society. On the other hand, I intend to alleviate the effect of certain phenomena connected, for example, with purchases of company shares. That is why, in Jelfa's case, we intend to try out a different form of selling shares in public flotation. So we can avoid share "touts" and other irregularities and minimize the risk of going wrong with the selling prices of shares. [Saniewska] Do you have plans to privatize our copper industry? [Kaczmarek] This problem should be viewed from the perspective of at least 20 years and in terms of an eventual exhaustion of copper ore. This is because we must be prepared to bring in alternative solutions to compensate for the exhaustion of the raw material, so that we can at least make use of the infrastructure we have created there, including the copper-metallurgy sector and the entire copper-product-processing industry. All of this must be carefully planned so that, in case of economic disaster, that whole monoindustrial sector does not collapse into the sort of mess we already have in Mielec and Walbrzych. For the time being, we do not intend to privatize the copper plant, and, even more emphatically, we will not privatize its core element--that is, the integrated technological complex of mines and smelting plants. On the other hand, it might be that we will privatize the infrastructure and the firms constituting backup facilities for the whole complex. In turn, the main elements of the whole complex require a throrough restructuring to enable its particular components to talk the same financial language, so that it should be possible to prepare a detailed costs analysis of the whole enterprise. After all, it is the cost structure in the whole sector that will ultimately decide whether we can adjust to world prices and whether our copper plants do not lose in competition with their rivals. [Saniewska] What do you think of the concept of placing parliament members hailing from parties that form the government coalition on the board of directors of the copper corporation? [Kaczmarek] I feel bad about it. This is because I am forced to apologize for the fact that our coalition members have not withdrawn from their respective offices in the corporation. All of the other parliament members have done so because the law obliges them to do it. Only two of our own colleagues have not resigned, on the excuse that board members can be recalled only at a general meeting. Such a position does not become a member of parliament. Instead of engaging their energies in the cause of helping the copper sector, they are trying to create another source of possible unrest around themselves. Neither Sejm deputies nor senators are permitted to sit on boards of directors or hold office in joint-stock companies. And ministers are obliged to uphold these laws. That is why I consulted the Sejm and Senate speakers over this matter. [Saniewska] Among the privatization guidelines approved by the Sejm, there is a provision stating that a joint-stock company owned by its work force can be set up only if no other, more advantageous offer has been received by the enterprise. Does this clause not give officials too many opportunities for arbitrary decisions? And is it not an attempt to undermine the emerging joint "employee-owned" companies? [Kaczmarek] It is certainly not such an attempt because joint employee-owned companies have dominated our privatization scene. To every 1,000 of such companies, there are only 100 joint capital companies--that is, joint ventures with a strategic investor. The provision you mentioned should serve as a signal announcing the official state strategy. That strategy must pay priority attention to such elements as investors, minimum prices, and social benefit packages. When all of these factors are taken into consideration, employee-owned companies invariably lose out to solutions suggested by strategic investors. That is why, in our work on the the Enterprise Privatization Act, we intend to narrow somewhat the range of firms in which employees could set up their own joint-stock companies. They should be set up in enterprises whose work forces are not larger than 400 and whose annual turnover is lower than 12 million ECU's. Such preconditions are necessary if we are to avoid situations similar to that of Winiary, where a profitable firm could have been owned by a larger group of shareholders. From the viewpoint of its optimum development strategy, Winiary needs an aggressive investor. Why should we sell it to a group of employees? After all, in matters of privatization, we must not be guided by short-term tactics designed to soothe the moods of the public. [passage omitted]
