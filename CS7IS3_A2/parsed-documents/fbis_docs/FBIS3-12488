While Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has always accused radical Muslims of trying to derail the peace accord by attacking Israelis, in the wake of the Hebron crime it has been proved that the responsibility falls on the shoulders of racist Israeli settlers. Rabin's government must confront those narrow-minded people and put an end to their provocations. Although in yesterday's cabinet session the Israeli Government took some steps to restrict the settlers' movements, those steps are insufficient to reassure us of what will happen tomorrow. The feeling of dejection among our people can only be overcome by measures aimed at restraining the settlers, disarming them, and preventing them from carrying out provocative acts against Palestinians. Although the Palestinian-Israeli accord represented a political breakthrough between the two peoples, we are not misrepresenting the facts when we say that the deterioration of the situation, the nonimplementation of the accord on its dates, and Israel's attempt to extract more concessions from the Palestinian side were all factors that contributed to a setback and erosion of international fervor for the accord. Undoubtedly, the accord will be in danger of collapse unless Israel takes immediate steps to implement it without waiting for agreements on details. It is impossible to reach a finalized solution and agreement on all the clauses. The dangers surrounding the accord require one to bet on goodwill and begin implementing the accord. They also require the commitment of the two parties to address the economic concerns in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. [passage omitted]
