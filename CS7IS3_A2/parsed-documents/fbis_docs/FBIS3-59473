We received quite accurate data on the number of citizens of the Republic of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship. These data should be given some serious consideration. There are 169,313 people from the former Yugoslav republics who have received Slovene citizenship in accordance with Article 40 of the Law on Citizenship, of whom 78,000 (46.7 percent) are from Bosnia-Herzegovina and also hold Bosnian citizenship, 60,000 (34.8 percent) from Croatia, 22,000 (13 percent) from Serbia, 5,000 (2.9 percent) from Macedonia, and less than 5,000 (2.8 percent) from Montenegro. It is known that 80 percent of the almost 170,000 citizens from other republics of the former Yugoslavia who have received Slovene citizenship are unskilled workers. On average, they had resided in Slovenia eight years before obtaining Slovene citizenship, and a good fifth were unemployed. There are also 15,000 Slovenes who live in other European countries or overseas and hold dual citizenship. In total, there are approximately 185,000 citizens of Slovenia who hold dual citizenship.
