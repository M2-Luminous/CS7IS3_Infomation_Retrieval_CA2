AL-HAYAH has received a clarification from the party in Salah-al-Din in northern Iraq, which said: "In your 20 April 1994 edition, you published a report under the headline "Barzani Sets Three Conditions for Acceptance of Damascus Invitation." In the interest of the truth, we wish to make the following clarification: "1. Our party's relations with Syria are strong and based on mutual respect and understanding, and we attach much importance to these relations. "2. President Hafiz al-Asad received Barzani on all his previous visits. Barzani's relations with President al-Asad are strong and warm. "3. We wish to point out that Barzani would never visit Syria on preconditions. Syria is his own country and the gates of Damascus were and are still open. There is no need for preconditons between brothers." [passage omitted]
