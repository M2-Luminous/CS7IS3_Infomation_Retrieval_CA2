He said: After my meeting today with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, I do not think there is any reason for me to hold any more talks. In a statement at the Ledra Palace checkpoint, Clark said that before making any suggestions, he wants to think about what he discussed here and in his meetings with Greek and Turkish representatives. Asked if he suggested any changes to the 21 March UN document, Clark said: I only dealt with one suggestion. We always had just one package, nothing more, and the issue was how to implement it. I asked that we deal with it imaginatively. We have worked on it but reached no agreement. Clark and Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, will brief the ambassadors of the five UN Security Council permanent members on their meetings in Nicosia and Ankara. The meeting will be held at 1800 today at the British High Commission. Clark will leave Cyprus at 0800 tomorrow. [passage omitted] In answer to a question, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said it seems that the new UN effort has reached a deadlock. He said that our side is now waiting for the UN secretary general to submit his report, which would recount the events and should attribute responsibilities where they exist. Asked whether Clark will have a new meeting with the president, Kasoulidhis said the UN envoy wished the president Happy Easter and bade him farewell. He added that if anything comes up, the president will never refuse to meet with Clark. After meeting Kliridhis, Clark said he had a lengthy meeting with the president, adding that there is no reason for further comment in view of the new meeting with Denktas.
