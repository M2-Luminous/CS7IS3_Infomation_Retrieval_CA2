The result of the vote by the Joint Committee Session not only demonstrated the ardent hopes of the people for television reform but also reflected the abhorrence felt by many people during the elections when all three television stations were reduced to mouthpieces of the Kuomintang and not only favored the candidates of the ruling party but also went to extremes in every way to discredit the abilities of the opposition parties. The subtle aspect of this was that although the ruling party was constantly expressing views on the mass media (such as the need to scrupulously adhere to neutrality, and avoid exaggeration and incitation), the three stations did not change their ways. Instead, they pontificated instead at length on their demands that critics "not let political power interfere with reporting" as if vicious manipulators who interfered with television news reporting had never before existed. Most who criticize television fall into a morass of news reporting principles such as subjectivity and objectivity, neutrality and balance, which appear clear but are actually vague. I am listing here two commonly seen criticisms with analysis of the "delusions" behind them. Criticism one: As soon as elections come around, the television news takes on a distorted approach to discredit the abilities of the opposition powers. Wrong! Television news is always quite distorted. Whenever a sensitive topic arises which is of great controversy or which has created conflict between two political parties (such as the vote on the No. 4 Nuclear plant case or the Gu-Wang talks), the three television stations' willing role as mouthpieces for the government becomes especially obvious. The most disastrous example of this was during the Gu-Wang talks when the reporting style of some television journalists caused some people to worry about the lack of distinction between the enemy and ourselves. It is not only during election time that the voices of the opposition powers are neglected. They have always been merely an optional "news source" in television news. Criticism two: Excessive publicity for Kuomintang candidates in the television news during the elections can only have an opposite effect. Voters who actively participate in political affairs and are concerned about the elections will find excessively slanted reporting offensive. However, don't forget, in this society there are still a large number of "politically indifferent groups" who have no interest in politics. They see voting as a periodic ritual and lack independent political decision-making ability and adequate political knowledge. These people also tend to be loyal television viewers, relying on the "reality" described on television to construct their external world. The images carved by the television news of the opposition parties long ago became deeply engraved in their minds. To these people, so-called excessive exaggeration merely enhances already existing impressions. [passage omitted]
