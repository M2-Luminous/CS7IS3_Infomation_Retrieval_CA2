FR940525-0-00007 FR940525-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AAL&hyph;03] Revision of Class E Airspace; Juneau and Dillingham, AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revises Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. The FAA is preparing to develop and test Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) instrument approach and departure procedures at the Juneau Airport. Additional controlled airspace starting at 700 feet above the surface (AGL) is needed for instrument flight rules (IFR) departure and arrival operations at the airport. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham is being revised so that recently developed instrument flight rule (IFR) holding patterns are in controlled airspace. The areas will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., August 18, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Durand, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;531, Federal Aviation Administration, 222 W. 7th Ave. # 14, Anchorage, AK, 99513&hyph;7587; telephone number: (907) 271&hyph;5898. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On February 23, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise Class E airspace at Juneau and Dillingham, AK. (59 FR 12876.) The FAA is preparing to develop DGPS instrument approach/departure procedures for the Juneau Airport at Juneau, AK. The proposal was to revise the controlled airspace extending from 700 feet AGL in the Juneau area for IFR operations. Controlled airspace starting at 1200 feet AGL at Dillingham was proposed to be revised so that recently developed IFR holding patterns are contained in controlled airspace. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections to the proposal were received. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and controlled airspace extending upward from 700 or 1200 feet above ground level is now Class E airspace. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above ground level are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule These amendments to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revise Class E airspace at Juneau, AK, to provide controlled airspace from 700 feet AGL for IFR DGPS arrival and departure procedures, and revise Class E airspace at Dillingham, AK, to provide controlled airspace from 1200 feet AGL for recently developed IFR holding patterns. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED]
