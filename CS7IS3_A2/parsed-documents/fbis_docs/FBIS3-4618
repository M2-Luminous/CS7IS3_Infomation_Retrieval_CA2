Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Sri Annwar Ibrahim said the companies, which accompanied British Prime Minister John Major's visit to Malaysia in September last year and which had signed several memorandums of understanding (MOU) and intent letters, had yet to sign the actual agreements. He said one of the companies is (Balfour Beckley), a British company which heads the British-Japanese consortium for the construction of the Kuala Lumpur international airport at Sepang at a cost of about 9 billion ringgit. With the exclusion of Britain from the consortium, a new bid will be issued soon for the construction of the project. He was addressing a news conference to announce the cabinet's decision stating that the Malaysian Government will not award any new contracts to British companies. The cabinet made the decision in view of the British media, which hurled unfounded criticisms at Malaysia and its leaders and also at the British leaders. The media reports indicated that most of the major projects involved British companies that embarked on dishonest agreements and the corrupt leaders of the two countries. All British companies that had signed MOU's or intent letters were duly informed of the new ruling. However, the new ruling does not include services, administrative meetings, and education. Mr Major's visit was aimed at boosting his country's economic relations with Malaysia. Five MOU's, which were signed with the British companies, could create 25,000 employment opportunities, which are badly needed by the sluggish British economy. Meanwhile, British Government sources stated in London that a senior diplomat was expected to be sent to Kuala Lumpur soon to try to coax Malaysia into withdrawing its decision, which could make the British firms lose several million pounds. Malaysia's decision could also result in a huge number of workers losing their jobs. Chancellor Kenneth Clark pleaded with and urged Malaysia to understand that the British newspapers are not controlled by the British Government, contrary to the situation in Malaysia. The governments or trade deals had become the victims of what was published in the newspapers. He said trade with Malaysia is important, and economic relations between the two countries are also important to Malaysia. Mr Clark told the BBC that Malaysia would return to its previous good and warm relationship with Britain.
