It was decided at the meeting that the compilation of the market-opening package would be carried out in two stages: 1) to work out by the end of March as many firm measures as possible; and 2) to work out by June details in areas expected to require more discussion time, in time for the G-7 summit meeting of major industrialized nations in Naples in July. The government had planned to work out its complete, new, market-opening package by the end of March. However, it has become clear it cannot compile practical measures in such a short time because many government ministries and agencies have already implemented deregulation, among other measures, to the greatest degree possible. As a result, the government changed its plan. It decided to do its utmost to work out a market-opening package by the end of March, but would compile it in two stages, with June as the deadline for completion of the unfinished portion. Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura made a comment at a news conference held the same evening. He said: "There may be some areas where only basic guidelines can be determined by the end of March. However, a complete package, to be worked out by June, will include these areas."
