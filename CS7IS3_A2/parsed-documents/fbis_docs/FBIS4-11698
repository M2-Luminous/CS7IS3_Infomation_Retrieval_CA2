Africa TA3003122794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew 30 Mar 94 p A6 TA3003122794 Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ Hebrew BFN [Report by security affairs correspondent Sharon Shade] [Excerpts] Israeli sources express concern in view of the growing tension between black factions in South Africa in anticipation of the elections in April. The sources refused to react to foreign reports according to which missile scientists have threatened to reveal details of nonconventional weapons cooperation between Israel and South Africa. They also refused to comment on the possible ramifications of the new situation on bilateral cooperation. According to the sources, due to political reasons bilateral security cooperation has been extremely curtailed over the last few years, and this cooperation will be affected by future internal changes in South Africa. In the past Israel maintained tight military and security cooperation with the white regime of South Africa, including -- according to foreign reports -- the development and manufacture of weapons to the tune of billions of dollars, as well as nuclear cooperation, including trade in sensitive raw materials. [passage omitted] Israeli sources expect changes to take place in South Africa's security concept in the wake of the political changes there. It is possible that the South Africans will reevaluate various military projects. The Israeli sources believe that South Africa will strive to become a regional power and a leading African force by increasing its military power. This will require a rebuilding process in many parts of the Army, while introducing new battle doctrines to accommodate the new black recruits. The sources assess that the South African Army's ground forces will absorb many new black recruits. A long time will be required, however, to absorb them in the air force due to the complicated systems, which require long training periods for pilots, as well as technical and engineering personnel.
