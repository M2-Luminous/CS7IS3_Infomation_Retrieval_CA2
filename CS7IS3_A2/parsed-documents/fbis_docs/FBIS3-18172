The Finance Ministry made its decision after the number of tanker trucks crossing the border to Albania increased following the adoption of the measures against Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. There are many signs that these trucks used Albanian territory as a route to Skopje. According to the Finance Ministry decision, Albania's daily fuel needs are fully covered by the six tanker trucks that go through every day.
