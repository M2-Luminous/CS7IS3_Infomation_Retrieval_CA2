Morev, people's deputy of the Republic of Moldova and member of the Socialist Party: "Who Is the Leftist of Them All?..."] [Text] Now, on the eve of the elections to parliament, it is becoming necessary to explain more and more frequently that the socialists and social-democrats in Moldova are not only not close in their views but are political opponents who differ in their basic ideological positions. While the Socialist Party expresses the interests of wage labor, the Social-Democratic Party is a party of the national bourgeoisie. Up to the present time it has maintained the image of a "left-wing" people's party and even exploited the concept of "democracy" in its title, which means the "power of the people." But the fact that the SDPM [Social-Democratic Party of Moldova] also uses the term "social," well, after all, the national socialists also have it... Thus, the essence of parties is not in their names but in their fundamental ideological positions. First and foremost is the attitude toward property. Socialists understand the diversity of forms of property as an objective reality. But we are for a determinant role of people's property in the form of state and associated collective property. Only then is national income redistributed in the interests of the workers, and this means real social guarantees for the population, and there cannot be unemployment, inflation, and an increase in prices with a reduction in wages. People have access to housing, education, health services, etc., which makes it possible for them to live without fear of the future. There are also no reasons for massive corruption and crime. It is exactly under the supremacy of national property that it is possible to form the private sector of the economy on legal principles, with honest competition, and without the impoverishment of the working people. The social-democrats, first and foremost, defend private property, under which the income of the people is redistributed in the interests of property owners, but not more than 10 percent of the population can be the real owners of the means of production. I will not refute or confirm the opinion about the prerogative of the social-democrats in law-making and the conduct of privatization; i.e., the organization of the process of transformation of national property (state, kolkhoz, cooperative) into private property. Officially, everything went along the line of the state structure. Although V. Ciubotaru, while being one of the leaders of the SDPM, was the deputy general director of the State Privatization Department, and there are also members of this party in the department. But this is not the question. While the Law on Privatization defines this process as national privatization, the practice went in an entirely different direction. The law makes it compulsory to guarantee the social protection of the population, but, in fact, it cuts itself out of participation in privatization by means of duties, fees, taxes, contracts, etc. A person frequently cannot even privatize his own apartment and, what is more, later maintain it, although he has already paid for its cost with his labor over dozens of years. The rights of citizens are crudely violated in the receipt of an equal share of the ownership of state property that is subject to privatization. The first auctions revealed a deviation from the basic principles of privatization defined by law, including also the mandatory consideration of the work collective of the object being privatized. There is also a complete lack of reliable information about the progress of privatization. The law strictly prescribes that only citizens of the Republic of Moldova can participate in privatization, but, for some reason, the names of new owners are not publicized. But perhaps it is necessary to seek answers to such questions from V.B. Ciesuev, who holds the position of general director of a state department: "The show will be directed by whoever really possesses the property. The market--is it not the best place for the application of unselfishness?" Well, this is just as frank as it is cynical. The socialists are conducting an open political campaign against those who hurt the interests of the workers and violate their rights. At the initiative of the socialists, parliament decided that stocks acquired for BND [national property certificate] can later be sold only for national currency. We are for land and its wealth belonging only to the people and in no case to foreigners. We are for the ratification of interstate agreements and for Moldova's joining the economic union of the CIS. We are not for a return to the past, but for the improvement of society on socialist principles. We think that on 27 February 1994 it is necessary to submit to a referendum the question of the political independence of the Republic of Moldova, and its joining the CIS and its economic union. The people, and not the parliament and not diminutive parties, should decide whether the state of the Republic of Moldova will or will not exist. A very important factor that determines the essence of a party is its formulation of the type of authority that it defends. The socialists are for genuine sovereignty of the people; that is, for a referendum and for a national discussion on very important draft laws. The working people should not only nominate and elect deputies, but they themselves should also be represented with all of the powers in all branches at all levels of authority. The social-democrats assign primary importance to a professional parliament and to a bourgeois system of elections, where a working person is given the right to elect, but does not have a practical chance of becoming a deputy in parliament. After all, according to the new law on elections, the workers in Moldova are deprived even of the right to nominate candidates for deputy--only political organizations have this right, in a majority of cases small in membership and unknown to the people. This means that it is not the people who will nominate candidates, but the politicians--who will nominate themselves. The positions of the Socialist Party and the Social-Democratic Party have also diverged with respect to the tragic events in Moscow at the beginning of 1993. In our republic, only the Socialist Party condemned the tyranny against the Supreme Soviet of Russia, which confirmed its legitimacy in a referendum in April 1993 on a par with the president of the Russian Federation. In those days in Moscow, not only were many unarmed people killed but democracy was executed there, opening the way to dictatorship of the right-wing reactionary forces. But the social-democrats openly supported these reactionary forces, showing that they are democrats only in words, for camouflage. The party lists of candidates for deputy will also say a great deal. Oazu Nantoi, leader of the social-democrats, is now actively criticizing the democrat-frontists, but in the recent past he was cochairman of the People's Front of Moldova. Now Mr. Oazu has a new cover on his ideological banner... The destiny of the people of Moldova will be decided on 27 February 1994. On that day it will be possible to stop the policy of absurdity and put an end to the suffering of the people. According to the new law on elections, the elections are considered to be held if not less than 30 percent of the voters registered on the rolls take part in them. It is quite likely that if you do not come to vote, others will decide your destiny for you. Silence and inaction have already created trouble.
