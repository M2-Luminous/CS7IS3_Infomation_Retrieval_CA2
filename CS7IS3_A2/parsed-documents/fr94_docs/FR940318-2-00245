FR940318-2-00245 FR940318-2-00119 Further, the Company may include provisions for a sinking or retirement fund for any series of the Additional Preferred Stock designed to redeem annually, commencing a specified number of years after the first day of the calendar month in which such series is issued, a number of shares specified in such provision. Such provisions may also give the Company the option to credit against any sinking fund requirement shares of Additional Preferred Stock of that series theretofore purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company and not previously credited against any sinking fund requirement. Additionally, any such sinking or retirement fund provision may give the Company the option to redeem or purchase on an annual basis up to an additional equivalent amount of the shares so retired pursuant to the sinking or retirement fund requirement. The Company would not expect to determine whether to include a sinking or retirement fund as part of the terms of any series of the Additional Preferred Stock until at or about the time of issuance and sale of such series. The Company is requesting authority, for the period during which any shares of the Additional Preferred Stock are outstanding to (1) redeem shares of Additional Preferred Stock in accordance with any mandatory or optional redemption provisions established in any series of the Additional Preferred Stock, and (2) redeem (or purchase in lieu of redemption) shares of Additional Preferred Stock in accordance with any sinking or retirement fund provisions established in any series of the Additional Preferred Stock. The proceeds from the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock will be applied to redeem, or reimburse the Company's treasury in connection with the redemption of, all or a portion of one or more series of the Company's outstanding preferred stock, including the Company's 10.05% Preferred Stock, $100 par value and 8.72% Preferred Stock, $100 par value (collectively, ``Old Preferred Stock'') at the then current redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. Any net proceeds from the issuance of the Additional Preferred Stock not used for the redemption of the Old Preferred Stock, or reimbursement of the Company's treasury, will be used to repay outstanding short-term borrowings that provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes. In the event that the proceeds from the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock are less than the amount required to redeem the Old Preferred Stock, the Company will pay a portion of the redemption price from internally generated funds or available short-term borrowings pursuant to an order of the Commission dated March 31, 1993 (HCAR No. 24777) (``Order''). The Company will not redeem the Old Preferred Stock with the proceeds from the sale of the Additional Preferred Stock unless the estimated present value savings derived from the net difference between dividend payments on a hypothetical new issue of preferred stock of a structure comparable to the structure on the Old Preferred Stock is greater, on an after-tax basis, than the present value of all redemption, tendering and issuance costs, assuming a discount rate based on the estimated dividend rate on the Additional Preferred Stock. The Company is also requesting authority for the period during which any shares of the Old Preferred Stock are outstanding to repurchase, reacquire or redeem shares of the Old Preferred Stock. The Company will pay for any such repurchase, reacquisition or redemption from the proceeds of the issuance of debt securities approved by the Commission or from internally generated funds or available short-term borrowings as provided in the Order.
