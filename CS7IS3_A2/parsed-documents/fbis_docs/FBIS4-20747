The statement says that 15 years ago Khomeyni made a firm determination to establish a strong foundation, which has continued to grow stronger and more beautiful with our progress. In reference to this point that we are proud of the leadership of a people whose imam was considered as the brilliant sun of the Islamic Revolution, the statement adds: Today no one has any doubt that the beloved Khamene'i is the same great Khomeyni, the light of leadership and supremacy, who has enlightened the most remote parts of the world thirsting for justice, humanism and divinity. The Militant Clergy Association believes that, following the painful death of Imam Khomeyni, the secret of the proud victories of the people is preserved by the resourceful leadership of the revolution, and that the perpetuation of the revolution and the successes of the system will remain with the group that sincerely obeys Ayatollah Khamene'i, the spiritual leader, and understands his guidance and utilizes it in carrying out the policies of the system. The Militant Clergy Association of Tehran in its statement has emphasized the preservation of the valued gifts of the revolution, the perpetuation of combats against oppression, and support for popular liberationist struggles. It has said that the recognition of the enemy's different moves and the necessary preparedness against them will ensure the perpetual movement of the revolution. The Militant Clergy Association, indicating that the nations of the world are burning with the desire to enjoy living in the free atmosphere of the Islamic Republic, has described the people of Iran to be the freest people in the world and the Islamic Republic as the most independent state. In another part of the statement, the propaganda of foreigners about human rights in Iran is condemned. The best evidence of the enemy's baseless propaganda is about human rights violations in Iran. Combating oppression and injustice has been the prime purpose of our nation. The Militant Clergy Association, in another part of its statement, after having proclaimed its support for the government's economic programs, says that it is unfair to accuse the government of having followed a Westernized economic policy. It believes that the revolution in terms of the economy has been on a logical and desirable course Warning against excessive spending, the statement says that a life of opulence and luxury is a major plague to a revolutionary movement--particularly the Islamic revolution. The public and officials must know that an aristocratic and excessive style of life cannot be included in the dictionary of the revolution and it is not compatible with the divine values of the revolution. The Militant Clergy Association adds that careful control and supervision of the government's organizations by the revolutionary institutions is a most important necessity that will reduce at minimum any possible wrongdoing and trespassing upon the commonwealth of Muslims (state treasury). At the end, the statement urges the evermore increasingly glorious celebration of the Islamic Revolution anniversary on this holy day of Bahman 22 [11 February] with the wide participation of the devout people of Iran to make America and the usurper Zionist regime tremble with fear.
