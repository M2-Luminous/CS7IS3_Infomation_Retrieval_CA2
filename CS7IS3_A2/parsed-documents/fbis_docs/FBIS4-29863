International Trade and Industry Minister Hata told a news conference the economic community was shocked by the yen's sharp rise, which will cause a serious psychological impact on the domestic economy. Citing discussions with representatives of the Japanese automobile industry earlier in the day, Hata said a rise of 1.00 yen against the dollar will lead to a 10 percent drop in earnings by automakers. During the meeting, the industry leaders urged the government to make a maximum effort to stem the yen's appreciation. Hata said Japan's huge current account surplus is seen in the United States to be responsible for the higher yen. He stressed the need for Japan and the U.S. to reach agreement on a new framework for bilateral trade as quickly as possible.
