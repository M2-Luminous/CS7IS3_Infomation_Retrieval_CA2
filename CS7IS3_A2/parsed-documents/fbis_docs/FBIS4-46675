This was discussed at the hearings of problems of the stock market organized by the Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges. Representatives of the capital's and regional stock exchanges, investment companies, and broker firms, who were invited to the hearings, accused the commission of a lack of professionalism, demanded the inclusion of their representatives in its membership, and nicknamed what was happening around the stock market fighting under a patchwork quilt. The Union of Stock Exchanges spoke out even more sharply at the press conference, which it held immediately upon the conclusion of the hearings. Welcome to the Shadow Economy The Union of Stock Exchanges sent an appeal to the Russian Federation President, in which it warned him about the consequences of the actions of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank, which were pushing the securities market into the criminal sphere. The appeal stressed that the situation on the stock market was approaching the critical level and was developing toward the emergence of a new wave of scandals and exposures, which would definitively undermine the population's and investors' confidence in privatization and in the securities market. The paradox lies in the fact that representatives of precisely these three departments form the nucleus of the Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges under the Russian Federation President. In the absence of legislation presidential edicts must regulate the process of privatization and the mechanism of the securities market. One can only guess what information the president receives from the commission. However, as Yuriy Milyukov (the Moscow Commodity Exchange) and Igor Suvorov (the Russian Stock Exchange), presidents of the capital's two exchanges, and Aleksandr Deryabin, director of the International Stock Market Institute, stated, the commission works inefficiently, unprofessionally, and in a disinterested manner and represents only the interests of its constituent departments. It deliberately ignores the experience and intellectual potential of practical stock exchange experts and, counter to the president's decision, does everything to remove them from participation in the preparation of draft laws and the elaboration of recommendations for market regulation. Incidentally, participants in the hearings, who were not sparing of epithets directed against the commission, also fully shared this point of view. The essence of their statements boiled down to the fact that market regulation occurred according to the principle "to rule and not let go!", whereas the situation on the stock market and the course of privatization required the adoption of thought-out and balanced decisions, especially during the period of absence of legislative acts. In this situation it is significant that at the state level no one is responsible for the securities market. The commission operates not on a permanent, but, in fact, on a voluntary, basis. Nevertheless, collective irresponsibility does not rule out at all the adoption by the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee on the Administration of State Property of decisions, which, according to Igor Suvorov, push the securities market into crime. The scheme is as follows: At first the shifting of operations with securities from the exchange sector to the nonexchange sector, then transition to cash transactions, and, finally, departure for the shadow economy. If we are guided by statistics, Suvorov is right: The nonexchange turnover on the securities market already exceeds greatly the exchange turnover and, according to forecasts, this is a steady trend. Another trend--the increase in the confrontation between stock exchanges and the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank--can also be called steady. There are ample complaints. The Ministry of Finance is accused of appropriating the right to decide individually what is and is not a security; the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, of the attempt to divert the stock market to the nonexchange turnover and to deprive it of transparency, that is, openness and reliable information; of attempts to place the stock market under control through the establishment of so-called self-regulating organizations operating under the control of the State Committee on the Administration of State Property. As affirmed, this is done only in the interest of officials, who are threatened with unemployment upon the conclusion of voucher privatization. On their part representatives of the mentioned state structures and of the Central Bank maintain that strict control by them hinders unscrupulous issuers, investors, and middlemen. A totally absurd situation arises, when opposing sides, guided, according to them, by totally good intentions, are forced to observe how criminal structures ever more actively interfere in the process of privatization and gradually become established on the securities market. A Fight Where There Will Be No Winners Ultimately, the solution of the problem concerning the further fate of the securities market depends on the choice of what path to follow: To give preference to strict state regulation, or to rely on natural objective processes operating in the market economy. State management bodies rely on the former, and the Union of Stock Exchanges on the latter. In theory, compromise options are also possible. However, state structures, frightened by privatization, which is getting out of control, a fact recently acknowledged by Anatoliy Chubays, will hardly go for this. In addition to the introduction of order, which lies within the range of official duties, they will have to save their own reputation, because today the mechanism of privatization is subjected to criticism from right and left. However, no matter how clumsy privatization may seem, the interests of the parties concerned have already become clear. Privatized enterprises need money. Most of them not only do not have assets for production development, but, in general, are without circulating capital. They can get them either from the state budget, or from bank credits, or through a free sale on the securities market. If we take into account that the state treasury is empty, while the rates of interest on credit are high, emission is the only real way of attracting capital. Moreover, as experts believe, the establishment of a highly liquid stock market is the most efficient, as well as cheaper, method of activating investments. The Union of Stock Exchanges has already examined this matter repeatedly. What should be done? First, it is possible to more rapidly adopt a series of legislative acts regulating the rights and duties of investors and issuers, as well as stockholders. The system of guarantees for the return of investments should also be formalized legislatively, without which no one will begin to invest money in production. Then it is necessary to regulate the system of mutual settlements in order to ensure conditions for the transfer of capital. Today this is impossible, because, as Suvorov cleverly noted, the Central Bank established concentration camps for money, where it loses value owing to inflation. It is also necessary to determine our position on the technological base--depositaries and the recording of the movement of shares. At any moment the issuer must know how much he owes and to whom. This also includes the establishment of an efficient information space, which makes it possible not only to judge what is sold and where, but also to obtain exhausting information on issuers. It should be easily available to all--both private stockholders and big investors. Then a barrier will be placed against false advertising. It is necessary to train personnel, because in most cases the skills of middlemen operating on the stock market leave much to be desired. In general, it is not important who will issue licenses. It is only important that this be done according to a single form and within a strict framework of uniform demands on middlemen. Finally, it is necessary to establish in the law guarantees for owners' rights and mechanisms for the resolution of conflicts. Yuriy Milyukov, Igor Suvorov, and Aleksandr Deryabin believe that in many respects the crisis on the stock market has been created artificially. The reason: The fight for spheres of influence among officials, a fight, in which there will be everything except winners. Who Should Prepare the Package of Laws? As it turns out, today this is the question of questions. If we proceed from the rules of procedure, the Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges should submit projects for hearings to the State Duma. However, subjects of the market do not trust the commission. The satisfaction of their demand to include their representatives in the commission's membership seems very doubtful and does not frighten officials especially. As one of the presidium members remarked in passing, if you insist, submit a list. The staff will examine it in accordance with the established procedure, after which it will be submitted to the president for approval. One can say right away what will come out of this: While the paper circulates among the authorities, no time will be left to work out proposals. What will the State Duma adopt? For now the audience's attention has been called to three versions of laws. Two of them--the Law on the Securities Market and the Law on Investment Securities--were drafted in the Administration of Securities of the Central Bank. Two others--On Securities and Stock Exchanges and On Investment Securities and Stock Exchanges--were drafted by groups of independent experts. However, having received texts 1/2 hour before the beginning of the meeting, participants did not begin to spend time on studying them, having decided to give this to experts and to hear at the next meeting, where the commission would have to deal not with representatives of uncoordinated broker firms, but with especially delegated professionals. Possibly, proposals will also follow from the State Committee on the Administration of State Property, which immediately after the hearings promulgated its concept of postvoucher privatization. For now it does not say a word about the securities market. Thus, the countdown has begun and, as Anatoliy Chubays sensibly noted, it works against us. Experts assume that, if the opposing sides do not manage to attain a balance of interests, the stock market in Russia may not exist. That is, securities, of course, will circulate on it, but enterprises in need of an inflow of investments will not receive even a penny from this. Alas, the Fate of Stockholders Is Not in Their Hands Although today two out of three Russians are stockholders, no one can really say what they will have from this. Most of them are in the position of Pinocchio in the Land of the Fools. Having been burned by voucher privatization, it is unlikely that they will begin to chase after the shares of newly appeared issuers. This seriously worries the founders of privatization, because everyone knows that the population has money available. Today one can say with good reason that the investment crisis is based on the confidence crisis. On the other hand, it is already clear that the reforming of securities is meaningless without the reforming of other fields; for example, of the banking and tax system. The opposition quite justly reproaches the government for the lack of an integrated approach to reforms. One has to believe Aleksandr Livshits, director of the group of experts under the president, who declared at the hearings that he would like to find in the corridors of power at least one person seriously concerned about this problem. Stock market experts are almost unanimous in the opinion that without the consolidation of efforts in all directions it will not be possible to create an effective mechanism of circulation of securities. If so, just as we do not see our ears, we will not see a civilized stock market operating in the interest of issuers, middlemen, and stockholders. The circulation of capital will continue, but it will only unleash inflation. Money will make money, but production will lose its priority. Possibly, by the next hearings, which are to be held in 3 months, the commission's membership will be renewed. Then two scenarios are possible: Either at least outlines of an accord with the interests of the subjects of the market will emerge, or the fighting arena will move to the commission. And, finally, the last. Possibly, organizers of the hearings were sorry that they invited the press to them. Journalists did not have to chase after an interview. Participants went to the press center on their own in order to share urgent problems; especially representatives of regions, who complained about the unprofessionalism of regional administrations of the Ministry of Finance, arbitrariness of local authorities, confusion with the normative base, lack of information from Moscow, excessive taxes, corruption, and invasion of organized crime into the process of privatization. Answering my question concerning promises by Anatoliy Chubays and Dmitriy Vasilyev, the representative of a Rostov broker firm answered as follows: "This is like a dream! I am walking and squinting my eyes..."
