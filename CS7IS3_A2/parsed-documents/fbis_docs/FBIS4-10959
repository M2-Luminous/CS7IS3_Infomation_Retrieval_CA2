All sectors agreed, however, that this phase is part of the fulfillment of the peace agreement. Sergio Caramagna, director of the OAS International Commission of Support and Verification [CIAV-OAS], spoke to LA PRENSA about specific points of the agreement and said that "this is where the hard part begins." The Catholic Church, leaders of the FN 3-80, and even the government agree with that assessment. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta addressed the FN 3-80 troops and said that "if it was hard to achieve peace, it will be even harder to maintain it." Some 300 FN 3-80 fighters surrendered their weapons to the government at 1700 at the city's baseball stadium, located about 287 km northeast of Managua, in an effort to end the conflict that has killed no less than 600 people. The main points of the agreement between the government and the FN 3-80, which is now entering politics, call for security, land, and financial aid to begin production. They also call for the creation of a development region where the government has agreed to make specific investments. According to Byron Alegria, deputy chief of the Nicaraguan Agrarian Reform Institute, the government has kept its part of the land bargain. "We have granted all kinds of facilities for the demobilized rebels to acquire lands that were mortgaged to government banks," Byron explained. He added that "there are about 4,000 manzanas that can be used for cattle ranching or for growing coffee and grain." Land has already been selected for coffee production, and according to Alegria, some 300 people will begin work tomorrow. The farm will have its own electricity plant and three separator machines. Another 100 people will join the work in May, and there will be work for about 800 people during the harvest. Next Monday the Education Ministry will appoint 22 teachers to work at the new schools in Quilali and nearby towns, a measure that is also part of the peace agreements. About 600 demobilized FN 3-80 fighters are expected. Some 100 rebels surrendered their weapons during the first phase of the disarmament process on 2 March. Another 150 rebels surrendered their weapons on 8 April during the second disarmament phase, and on 15 April, El Chacal and another 300 militants finally ended the FN 3-80 demobilization process. Only 50 militants remain armed to provide security for the demobilized rebels. The government has concluded the police instruction program offered to 74 FN 3-80 members at the Police Academy. These future policemen eventually will be responsible for providing security for the demobilized rebels. The Sandinist People's Army reportedly will withdraw its soldiers from Quilali. Several trucks reportedly arrived in Quilali to remove the soldiers of the First Northern Military Command, which operated in that area. El Chacal surrendered two Redeye missiles and a Sam-7 missile to the government at the demobilization ceremony. Two U.S. Embassy officials who attended the disarmament ceremony asked for the immediate destruction of the missiles, but the Special Disarmament Brigade was not prepared to blow them up. The FN 3-80 weapons were destroyed in a hole dug for that purpose.
