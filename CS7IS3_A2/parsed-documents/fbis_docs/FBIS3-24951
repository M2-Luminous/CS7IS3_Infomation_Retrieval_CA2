An explosive device ripped a hole in the wall on Mr. Serfontein's farm, Boskop, near Potchefstroom. Explosions occur almost daily in the area and so far the police have not made a breakthrough. The police have not yet revealed the type of explosives involved. The ANC, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and other trade unions which have suffered damage because of the explosions believe commercial explosives are being used. COSATU said earlier that the police should do more to protect its offices and catch the extremists. COSATU is to ask the Transitional Executive Council Subcouncil on Law and Order to give urgent attention to the matter.
