A report in the newspaper JEDINSTVO states that Mjedi Qerimi is charged with allegedly having learned how to use weapons at a camp near Elba Ban in 1993. The accusation charges him with having trained for a possible war in Kosova. Because the defense counsel insisted on the presence at the trial of two witnesses who are at present in Nis military prison, the trial was adjourned until 14 June.
