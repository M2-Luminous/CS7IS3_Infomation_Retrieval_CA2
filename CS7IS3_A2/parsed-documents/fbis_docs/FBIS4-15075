Major Gediminas Jurciukonis, assistant head of the Voluntary Defense Service headquarters, said some 11,000 men aged above 19 could be called up but only 30-40 percent of recruits are fit for military service. The conscription will not affect university students, men aged above 27, clergymen of registered religious communities, persons sentenced to jail terms of over three years, fathers of two or more children and men who are the only bread-winners in their families. Jurciukonis said over 60 percent of recruits are expected to report to call-up commissions this year. The major said 57 and 49 percent reported to call-up commissions during last year's fall and spring conscriptions respectively. Those who will not report to call-up commissions will be fined 106 lits. 1,600 men were fined last year but only half of them paid the fines. Those who do not report to a commission repeatedly may face legal action. This year, recruits are examined by medical boards at local hospitals, which should make the selection better, Jurciukonis said. In his words, 5 percent of the recruits called up last year were later pronounced unfit for military service.
