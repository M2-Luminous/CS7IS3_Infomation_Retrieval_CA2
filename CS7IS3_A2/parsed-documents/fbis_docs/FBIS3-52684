The meeting was arranged in the wake of Egyptian-Iranian contacts held at the level of charge d'affaires in the past few weeks to reach an agreement on the basics principles for a return to normality in Egyptian-Iranian relations. According to the sources, the Iranian officials agreed to a proposed agenda of the meetings within a framework that would bring the views closer. During recent meetings, Iranian officials submitted memoranda in reaction to accusations leveled at some Iranian elements by the Egyptian authorities that they harbor, train, and finance violent groups in Egypt. This issue will have priority in the upcoming talks. The second item on the agenda will focus on regional security issues, particularly Gulf security and relevant issues. One of the principles established during previous contacts was that there is no conflict between the Egyptian and Iranian concepts of regional security. The sources affirm that Egypt and Iran have agreed to maintain secrecy on their communications and the topics under discussion until results are actually achieved.
