The Portuguese prime minister said his trip to China has two major purposes: namely, promoting the development of bilateral relations, including economic relations, and commemorating the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao issue. Silva indicated that one priority of Portugal's foreign policy is to develop relations with China. He said the Chinese Government also attaches great importance to developing relations with Portugal; this can be proved by Premier Li Peng's visit to Lisbon in 1992 and President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Rong Yiren's visits in 1993. Silva maintained that China, being a major country in the Far East and the world, deserves full access to worldwide economic, political, and cultural relations. He said China has achieved tremendous success in economic development, reform, and opening up; China's impressive economic growth will help the merger of China and the world's economies. As regards bilateral relations, Silva said the fact that 60 Portuguese entrepreneurs will join him in visiting China shows that Portugal hopes to expand the two countries' trade volume and develop cooperation between Portuguese and Chinese enterprises in making direct investments and establishing joint ventures. He indicated the future is extremely favorable for Portugal and China to develop economic and trade relations, and the two countries can develop cooperation in telecommunications, banking, infrastructure, and other areas. This should be a new way for promoting the development of the two countries' economic relations, he stated. On the Macao issue, Silva stressed that the signing by himself and the Chinese premier in April 1987 of the Joint Declaration by the Chinese and Portuguese Governments on the Macao issue was an important historical event because a historical problem was resolved as a result of the declaration. He said that, regarding the Macao issue, the Portuguese Government has three basic objectives to achieve: stability, progress, and building confidence in the future. He said: "The operations of the Portuguese-Chinese Liaison Group are proceeding normally. The second half of Macao's transitional period will be a smooth one." Commenting on international issues, the Portuguese prime minister said the Asia-Pacific region--particularly China--has become a world center enjoying high economic growth, and the gradual integration of Asia-Pacific economies has intensified these countries' extraordinary development. The development of economic and trade relations between the European Union and Asia-Pacific countries will be beneficial to both sides. Silva pointed out that although the European Union has encountered certain problems and obstacles in its construction, it still has achieved significant progress. He expects the economy of West Europe will be able to begin a new cycle of growth by the end of this year. In conclusion, Prime Minister Silva stressed that Portugal attaches great importance to problems between the north and south, and that Portugal has constantly reminded European countries not to forget the south.
