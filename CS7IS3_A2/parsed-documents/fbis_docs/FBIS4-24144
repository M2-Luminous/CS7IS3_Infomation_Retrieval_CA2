The minister of finance, Mr. Derek Keys, announced in his budget speech that the levy would be used to cover the costs of the Transitional Executive Council and the Independent Electoral Commission. However, Mr. Ken Andrew of the Democratic Party pointed out that next year's municipal elections would probably cost more than the national and provincial elections. The possibility of a referendum in certain provinces could also [not] be excluded. Earlier, Mr. Keys named the members of the commission that is to review South Africa's tax structure and make recommendations on improving it. The commission will be headed by Professor Michael Katz, who also heads the Tax Advisory Committee. Other members are Professor Dennis Davis, Dr. J. de Villiers Graaff, Mr. P. du Toit, Professor P. More, and Miss (D. Moktatle), and Mr. J. Njeke. Mr. Keys announced the formation of the commission in making his budget speech yesterday. The commission will examine personal income tax, corporate tax, VAT [value-added tax] and the income of the tax system on small business, savings, investment, foreign finance, and collection. Mr. Keys told this Joint Standing Committee on Finance that it was in South Africa's best interest to continue the Mossgas [Mossel Bay Gas] project. He said that not only did the state have major investments in the project but it also created job opportunities and was responsible for savings in foreign exchange. Mr. Billy Nair of the ANC noted that the government had spent about 3,000 million rands on the project last year and that the work on the project was so specialized that it did not contribute significantly to creating job opportunities. He called for a viability study of the project.
