In the hour-long meeting, President Clinton confirmed that the United States is paying great attention to the region. Security in Central Europe, he said, is important for both Washington and NATO. The Hungarian delegation welcomed the Partnership for Peace plan and reaffirmed their country's preparedness to take an active part in it. President Clinton said that security is not simply a military issue, but also a political and an economic one. The United States considers it important to promote economic development in Hungary and the region, the president added. The leaders discussed the Yugoslav crisis as well. The Hungarian foreign affairs spokesman stated: "I consider it important that the Hungarian delegation was able to directly inform the U.S. administration on how a neighbouring country sees the efforts made so far to settle the crisis in Yugoslavia, and what it considers to be desirable steps." The spokesman said President Clinton expressed his appreciation of the stability of Hungarian democracy. Washington considered the new prime minister's smooth and rapid election as a sign of this stability, Herman said.
