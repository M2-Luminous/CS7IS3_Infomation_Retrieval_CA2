The officials said radio broadcasts now reach 80 percent of the league's population, and TV programs 75 percent. With an area of 270,000 sq km, mostly desert, the league's major transportation means used to be camels and horses. So the herdsmen lived an isolated life until the early 1980s. Since then, the league authorities have invested 50 million yuan building 38 relay stations and 49 satellite ground stations, bringing 14 TV channels to the local people. According to the officials, some small towns and villages have even set up their own cable TV networks.
