Pakistan was not discovered by a Columbus; it was established after two million Muslims had sacrificed their lives. They left their ancestral homes, sacrificed their forefathers' memories, and left their graves just to attain the goal of establishing Pakistan. They irrigated Pakistan with their blood. However, reading or hearing about the U.S. attitude gives the impression that Pakistan was leased to us for 50 years only and this lease is about to expire. The United States appears to be watching Pakistan all the time. What are all these pranks about `do not do this' or `do not do that'? The United States sometimes imposes economic restrictions on us and other times stops the sale of F-16 planes to block our defense program. Is not Pakistan an independent nation? Does not this nation have its borders? Do not humans live here? Our neighbor India waged surprise wars on us three times. Cannot we make preparations to defend ourselves from a country five times bigger than us? India has openly blasted a nuclear bomb in 1974, and even today it is making weapons round the clock in its four ordinance factories to burn Pakistan; however, the United States cannot see this all. Instead, it is ready to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation. Whenever the United States provided aid to Pakistan, it took full advantage of it. It used Pakistani shoulders and Afghani guns to destroy the superpower that was the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was a country with expansionist designs. It wanted to destroy Afghanistan to reach warm water ports and the oil wells in the Gulf. At the same time, it could have become equal to the United States in Asia. It could have aimed at New York and Washington easily from here. Even today, the United States is very interested in Siachen and China, and the protection of its interests are behind these efforts. It can keep a close eye on the Central Asian (Muslim) nations and on China from here. The whole world is aware of the U.S. dichotomous policies. If it is sympathetic to humanity, then it should put out the fires in Bosnia. It should punish Hindu imperialism for its ugly crimes against humanity just like it attacked Iraq. When Pakistan was helping it stop the progress of its greatest enemy, the Soviet Union, the United States viewed Pakistan as a principled nation. Now that we are trying to stop the progress of our enemy, it is looking at us suspiciously and calling us a terrorist nation. However, thank Allah, Pakistan was able to survive without U.S. help in the past and will continue to survive proudly without it until the end of the world. A new problem has started now. They [the U.S. Government] say that drugs are smuggled from Pakistan to the United States. According to it, 156 important Pakistani people are involved in this trade. It is asking for their extradition as criminals. Pakistan is an independent and respectable nation. It also has courts and jails, as well as a justice system. Therefore, we can try people right here. Now the question is who is protecting this ugly and abominable trade? In which countries is heroin manufactured? How is it smuggled into an alert country like the United States? The truth is that every country in the world has its own jails. It proves that every country has its share of rotten eggs. Pakistan also has some people like that. New York is considered top most on the list of cities in the world with a high rate of crime. The latest example is the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment by a deputation led by Philippines President Fidel Ramos during its five-day trip to the United States. A television camera worth $74,000 belonging to the state television network was stolen in a motel lobby. Later a large bag containing the guests' wireless equipment and batteries for the cameras also disappeared. It was not the fault of the United States, and we are not blaming it because these vile acts were committed by some criminals. Similarly, Pakistan has some stupid and poor people. They open suitcases full of dollars and are dazed. They dream about becoming rich overnight, and join this ugly trade. This epidemic is hurting our nation. How can we like this trade? The government arrested hundreds and sentenced them to be flailed. The Americans, however, come here and tempt them again to become involved in this trade. The Government of Pakistan is fully focused on this problem, therefore, the United States need not worry about it.
