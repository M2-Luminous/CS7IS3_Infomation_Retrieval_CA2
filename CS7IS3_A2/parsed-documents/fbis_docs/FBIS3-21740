In several operations conducted in five of the Federation's states, it seized 11 tons and 215 kg of dried and packed marijuana worth over 200 million new pesos. In addition, 22 presumed drug traffickers were arrested, and 15 automotive vehicles confiscated. During the same operations, Federal Judicial Police [PJF] personnel seized 92.5 kg of ephedrine, a chemical precursor used to manufacture amphetamines and to "cut" cocaine, so as to make that stimulant more potent. The institution of federal justice cited a report from Sonora State, on the largest seizure of drugs, totaling 5,304 kg of marijuana, in an operation carried out in the vicinity of Benjamin Hill, at a PJF highway checkpoint. The PGR's representative in that state noted that the drugs were found on a tank truck bearing the label "nitrogen," which had left Guadalajara bound for the town of Tijuana, Baja California. The Federal Judicial Police discovered the ephedrine together with the marijuana. The vehicle's driver, Juan Silva Saenz, claimed that the drugs had been packed in Jalisco State, and stored in a false bottom of the tank truck's structure. [passage omitted]
