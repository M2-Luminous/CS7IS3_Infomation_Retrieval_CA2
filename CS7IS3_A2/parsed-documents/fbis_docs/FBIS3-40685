Here at home, the Union Government initially sought to dismiss opposition to the deal--not only from political parties, but from a wide cross-section of people including representatives of farmers, agricultural workers, industrial employees, public sector officers, and professional economists and analysts--as ill-informed and baseless. Subsequently, however, it has been forced to take a slightly different and at least somewhat defensive tack, conceding that the deal is not altogether in our favour, but arguing at the same time that this was the best we could do under the circumstances. The domestic votaries of globalisation within the framework of the existing world order have, of course, been far more vociferous in their support to the GATT deal. The entire Uruguay Round of talks has seen a steady erosion of the positions of the Third World and an enormous strengthening of the hegemony of the big three--the United States, the European Union and Japan--over world trade. One by one, new areas--services, agriculture, domestic investment policies, intellectual property rights--have been brought into the agenda of multilateral negotiations, with the clear intent of eroding the sovereign space available to the weaker member-countries. In this context, the absurd argument of symmetry in the loss of sovereign space--that if India loses sovereignty in certain areas of economic policy on account of the deal, so do the United States, the European Union and others--needs to be nailed. Notwithstanding the new GATT discipline and dispute settlement procedures--which themselves are heavily biased in favour of developed countries--the strong countries retain and will no doubt use from time to time their bilateral/unilateral options. Even leaving aside the extremely important issue of loss of sovereign decision-making space, what is the balance-sheet of gains and losses of India? Not a single improvement in terms by India could get through. While the U.S. attempt to delay the phasing out of the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) by another five years has not succeeded, there is little cheer for Indian textile exporters in the MFA phase-out calendar which opens up slowly to the extent of 49 per cent in the first nine years, and contains the somewhat incredible promise of the remaining opening up occurring in the tenth year. The other area where substantial gains are being claimed is agriculture. The picture that is being painted of India's agricultural exports expanding by leaps and bounds on account of the reduction in agricultural subsidies in the countries of the European Union is vastly exaggerated for at least two reasons. First, the final reduction agreed upon in the bargaining between the United States and the European Union is hardly significant. Secondly, primary commodity exports have faced, for quite a long period now, declining terms of trade, and the situation is unlikely to change. Thus, even if exports were to increase in physical terms, their value increase would be quite limited. Further, with the increasing industrialisation of agriculture, such modest gains as may be made in agricultural exports are likely to be far outweighed by the losses in the ground yielded in trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS). What must additionally be noted as far as the implications of the Dunkel deal for India in the area of agriculture are concerned, is the provision of minimum market access. This provision requires us to allow agricultural imports to the extent, at the minimum, of a certain percentage of domestic consumption. This minimum is also slated to rise over time. The argument that India can escape this provision by improving the precarious balance of payments situation ignores the fact that the provisions permitting even a temporary restriction of imports on balance of payments grounds have now been considerably diluted, and that in any case the IMF will be the arbiter. There are several areas in which the GATT deal is extremely unfavourable to India. The new IPR regime severely restricts access to new scientific and technological knowledge, and is thus in sharp contrast to the principles of "free trade" so sanctimoniously proclaimed by the West. It is a serious impediment to our scientific and technological advance. The introduction of product patent, the treatment of import as equivalent to working of the patent, the right to patent life forms, and the requirement of providing an effective, even if sui generis, system of protection to IPR in plant varieties--all these have strong negative implications for biotechnology and agricultural advance. The new IPR regime will sharply erode the self-reliance of our drugs and pharmaceuticals sector and lead to increase in prices of various drugs. The argument that most drugs currently under use are not under patent ignores two important facts. A "low" overall proportion of drugs not under patent is consistent with the same proportion being much higher for specific groups, and this is indeed the case with respect to such important groups as anti-bacterial and anti-cancer drugs. Secondly, in the context of the current biotechnology revolution, a lot of new drugs will be emerging, and under the Dunkel text these will be patented. Further, the claim that, where necessary, the government can invoke provisions of compulsory licensing in the public interest, is very misleading, since the Dunkel Draft provisions on compulsory licensing are very weak. Details apart, what needs to be unambiguously understood is that the new GATT treaty violates our sovereignty by seriously curtailing the power to decide policies not only in relation to foreign trade but in relation to such fundamental areas as agriculture, investment, and social welfare. Unfortunately, the Government has shown no willingness at all to put up even a decent fight, let alone try to evolve a serious negotiating stance independently and in conjunction with other developing countries. This is, of course, not surprising, given the present Government's abject surrender to the diktats of the IMF and the World Bank. The bulldozing of the GATT deal symbolises the emerging world order of the 1990s. In the period immediately after the Second World War, the imperial powers, save the United States, had suffered a steep decline in political and economic terms; a number of countries had embarked on the socialist path; and there was a wave of decolonisation. The new institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, were created, in the first instance, to stabilise the capitalist economic order in its citadels, GATT, while part of the same scheme of things, had to make some concessions to developing countries, in the context of the Cold War, and the presence of a group of socialist countries sympathetic to the Third World. For a brief while, in the 1970s, developing countries even made bold to assert themselves and demand a new international economic order. There has now been a sea-change, with the collapse of socialism in eastern Europe and the former USSR, and the triumphant centralisation and consolidation of international capital under U.S. hegemony. The new GATT deal is a milestone on the road to global recolonisation and a millstone around our necks. There is still time. The treaty will not be signed until the ministerial meet in April 1994. The people of this country can still say `no' to recolonisation. The inadmissible alternative is rule by transnational corporations and a mockery of people's sovereignty and parliamentary democracy.
