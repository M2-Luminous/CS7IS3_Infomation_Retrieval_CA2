A-310-300 planes are imported into Russia by Aeroflot under a leasing agreement with a consortium of European banks. Four air buses of this kind are now in operation in Russia. A fifth crashed near Mezhdurechensk, a town in the Kemerovo Region, killing 75 passengers and crew. Glazyev believed that the losses incurred in operating the A-310's was the sole reason why Aeroflot was given tax relief. Without this relief, the new import duties to be imposed as of July 1 on aircraft and their parts would kill the idea of importing A-310's, Glazyev believed.
