Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] [Excerpts] Amman--American and Jordanian officials are scheduled to meet in Washington Thursday [31 March] to discuss Jordan's demand for a solution to the negative impact on its economy of the de facto blockade of al-'Aqabah imposed by the enforcers of the 44-month-old international sanctions against Iraq, Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said Tuesday. Addressing a press conference after a regular Council of Ministers meeting, Dr. al-'Anani called on the U.S. to seek a speedy solution to the problem so that Jordan could go back to the 28-month-old American-backed Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The government has been informed by the Jordanian embassy in Washington that a meeting has been scheduled for Thursday among Jordanian officials and representatives of all concerned U.S. government departments and agencies to discuss the issue, Dr. al-'Anani said. "The Jordanian government urges concerned authorities in the U.S. and also the United Nations to speed up the proposal to replace offshore inspections by onshore inspections by a third neutral party," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted] Dr. al-'Anani said Jordan did not share the view that the Arab-Israeli peace process and the effects of the international sanctions imposed against Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 were two separate issues. "We believe that the issue of al-'Aqabah cannot be fully disassociated from the peace process," he said. "After all, the whole peace process was basically generated after the Gulf war. Therefore, to say that there is no link is not a view that is necessarily shared by Jordan." Dr. al-'Anani said a recent escalation of the interceptions and inspection procedures adopted by the American-led warships patrolling the Red Sea could not but be seen as a form of indirect pressure on Jordan to accept an Israeli demand that the Kingdom sign a peace agreement and then negotiate the terms of the accord. "Jordan is not going to succumb to pressures of this kind," the minister said. "We want the peace process to pursure a rational path. Jordan does not need to give any further evidence to its positive attitude and its important and key role in the peace process itself." [passage omitted] Dr. al-'Anani, who estimated that Jordan lost up to $1.3 billion in extra freight costs alone as a result of higher charges levied by shipowners sending their vessels to and from al-'Aqabah since the sanctions against Iraq were imposed in August 1990, noted that inspectors have not been able to find a single violation of the sanctions after checking more than 1,700 vessels. Despite such a record, he said, Jordan continued to suffer from the modalities of the inspections. The minister said the Kingdom reserved the right to demand compensation for the losses it incurred. "The final effect of the method of inspections on Jordan-bound ships is not justified by the method of application of sanctions against Iraq," Dr. al-'Anani said. "Alternatives were offered and we think they should have been studied but that should not have taken so much to be finalised and approved. "Therefore, when the number of ships that were intercepted escalated in the last month while there was a constructive proposal that has been discussed but not ratified, we had to draw a conclusion that Jordan is targeted economically and politically...," said Dr. al-'Anani. [passage omitted] The information Minister welcomed a statement by U.S. State Department spokesman Michael McCurry that the Jordanian proposal was under study and said Jordan hoped that "this matter will be very very soon resolved." "If that happens, then we think it would iron out a major problem which is not only affecting the Jordanian economy but also inflaming popular response to the whole situation," Dr. al-'Anani said. The minister was referring to a call issued by Parliament last week for the goverment to refuse to return to peace talks with Israel until the siege of al-'Aqabah is lifted and the lifting is formally announced at the Security Council. Dr. al-'Anani said the Jordanian call for an end to the "modus operandi" of inspecting Aqaba-bound vessels was not linked to the overall sanctions against Iraq although Jordan strongly felt that the situation of the Iraqi people was worsening due to lack of enough food and medicine. Dr. al-'Anani also reiterated that Jordan would not accept the stationing of international forces in its territory since such a move... will be in violation of Jordan's sovereignty and territorial integrity." [punctuation as published] Asked whether Jordan would attend an April 7 round of multilateral talks on the environment, which is part of the Middle East process, Dr. al-'Anani said: "We hope that the concerned parties will arrive at a speedy decision to solve the problem" of the siege of Aqaba.
