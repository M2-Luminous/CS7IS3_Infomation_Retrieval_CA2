ACTION: Notice of amendment to an existing system of records_``Confidential Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' (formerly ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System''). SUMMARY: As part of an ongoing examination of the FDIC's systems of records, the ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' has been reviewed for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a. Numerous minor amendments have been made that will clarify and/or more accurately describe the following categories in this system of records: System name, system location, categories of individuals covered by the system, categories of records in the system, authority for maintenance of the system, retrievability, and retention and disposal. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frederick N. Ottie, Attorney, FDIC, 550&hyph;17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, (202) 898&hyph;6679. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FDIC's system of records entitled ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' is being amended to clarify and/or more accurately describe its contents. These modifications include changing the system name to the ``Confidential Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System,'' updating titles of existing forms and sources of authority, and rewording descriptions of the contents of existing forms. Additionally, the description of individuals covered by the system specifically includes prospective employees in order to extend system coverage to those individuals under consideration for positions identified in 5 CFR 2634.904 who are required to file a Confidential Financial Disclosure Report as authorized by 5 CFR 2634.903(b)(3). This refinement has been coordinated with and approved by the Office of Government Ethics. Finally, the description of retention and disposal procedures is expanded to delineate the retention and disposal procedures for the records of prospective employees who are not selected for employment and to clarify that disposal of information in automated computer files is by deletion. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the FDIC amends the ``Employee Financial Disclosure Statement System'' to read as follows: FDIC 30&hyph;64&hyph;0006
