The delegation from Pyongyang, headed by Choe Kwang, chief of General Staff of the Korean People's Army, was invited by the Chinese General Staff Headquarters. The XINHUA dispatch did not give any details about the content of the talks, which were held later in the day. Leaving aside North Korean President Kim Il-song and son Kim Chong-il, who holds the post of supreme commander of the North Korean Army, Choe ranks No. 2 in the North Korean military hierarchy after Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u. Choe's visit to China is the first by a General Chief of Staff since August 1989. Given the rising tension on the Korean peninsula with North Korea's failure to dispel international suspicion that it is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, both sides are expected to discuss responses to possible developments in the controversy, such as U.N. sanctions. North Korea has warned that it will consider the imposition of sanctions a "declaration of war." Political observers said the dispatch of a top-ranking military official to longtime ally China at this stage of the nuclear row is aimed at demonstrating the close relations between Beijing and Pyongyang. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China can wield its veto to block any punitive action against the North, which the United States, South Korea and Japan have been urging. In contrast, by initiating talks with the North Korean military leaders, the communist country's hard-liners, it looks as though Beijing, which has advocated a negotiated solution, hopes to sound out whether Pyongyang is keen to diffuse the looming nuclear crisis.
