This was agreed on in Ohrid, during the recent meeting between road traffic experts of the Albanian Ministry for Transport and Communication and the Macedonian Ministry of City Planning, Construction, Traffic, and Ecology. All Macedonian transporting firms will be exempted from paying road taxes and tolls. The first contingent of 5,000 transportation licenses, bilateral and transit, as well as 100 licenses for transportation to and from third countries, is already being distributed. At the Ohrid meeting, the two sides also signed a draft agreement on international transport of passengers and goods through both countries. The agreement was signed in Albanian, Macedonian, and English. The Albanian side, however, had remarks on the name of Republic of Macedonia being used in the text, so they introduced a special clause on the agreement coming into effect after the additional consultations on the problem.
