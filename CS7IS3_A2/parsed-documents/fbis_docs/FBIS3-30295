The document proceeds from the procedure announced by the Brussels-based UN Sanctions Committee. In compliance with this procedure, the sides had to sort out some technicalities concerning Hungarian rules and legislation. "The Hungarians were understanding of all matters we raised," Bulgarian Deputy Transport Minister Kharalan Kharalanov told BTA. "There are some problems which our Hungarian partners were unable to solve right now, but they promised to sort them out and let us know soon. For instance, there was the problem on how truck convoys for the journey back from Hungary to Bulgaria will be formed." On the initiative of the UN Sanctions Committee, the Bulgarian and Hungarian delegations will confer in Budapest on February 3 and 4. Quite a few problems will be specified at that meeting. "At the meeting we will brief the committee on these technicalities which we have coordinated with our Hungarian colleagues, as well as on our arrangements with the Bulgarian border control authorities and possibly with the Serbian partners concerning the transshipment of goods via Serbia. Evidently, the convoys will not start overnight. We will also wait for the meeting in Budapest, to which we have yet to receive an invitation from Brussels, and we will then send the first applications for permits. Only after obtaining such permits, complying with all technical conditions, we can actually start transiting goods across Serbia," the Bulgarian deputy transport minister said. Each type and quantity of goods intended for transshipment across Serbia have to be cleared with the UN Sanctions Committee. These permits will be valid for three months, or the procedure will be the same as the one followed in permitting shipment of humanitarian assistance to Yugoslavia. In this case, however, the committee will deal with transshipment of goods to Western Europe and from Western Europe across Serbia to Bulgaria and, possibly, on to the Middle East.
