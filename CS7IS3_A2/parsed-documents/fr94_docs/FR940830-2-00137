Chances are, the answer is among this ranking of the top 300 ATM owners in the United States, listed by machines owned as of year-end 1992. These machine owners control some 47,910 terminals, or 55% of all ATMs. Not all significant ATM deployers are banks. Among the ranks of machine owners are six non-bank companies: Electronic Data Systems, Affiliated Computer Systems, Wegmans Food Markets, FIserv, Publix Super Markets, and Delchamps supermarkets. Each entry also records how many POS terminals the organization owns. As it happens, the top 300 ATM owners also control 58,100, or 54%, of all U.S. POS devices. [Pages irreproducible.
