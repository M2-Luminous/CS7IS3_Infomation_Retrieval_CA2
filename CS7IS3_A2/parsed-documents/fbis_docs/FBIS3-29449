He said: "I am greatly concerned about the impact of the yen's appreciation on the economy. The economic recession has lasted for four years. However, the economy -- far from being revitalized for the first time in four years -- will be cooled down by the recent strong yen." Vice Minister Kumano pointed out: "The yen's appreciation will largely worsen profits of export-oriented companies. In the short-term the exchange rate will have a negative impact on people's incomes rather than a favorable effect on commodity prices." He stressed that if economic conditions in Japan deteriorated further due to growing pressure for the yen to appreciate, it would have an unfavorable effect on the world economy as well as on the Japanese economy.
