To improve and perfect the quota allocation system, to establish a mechanism for fair competition, to protect the overall interests of the state and the legal rights and interests of enterprises engaged in foreign trade, and to ensure normal order in the export business, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] has formulated these procedures for inviting bids for export commodity quotas on the basis of the interim provisions for the administration of exported commodities sanctioned by the State Council. Article 2. In the work of inviting bids, it is necessary to abide by the following principles: "Fair, Open, Competitive, and Beneficial." Article 3. These procedures are applicable to all export commodities on the quota list of MOFTEC. Article 4. MOFTEC is responsible for the supervision and guidance of bidding invitations. MOFTEC determines the commodities for which bids are invited and set up. A special committee (the bidding committee) has been set up to administer bidding invitations for the quota of export commodities approved by the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The bidding committee is made up of the relevant division under MOFTEC and relevant import and export trade associations, which are in charge of the actual invitation of bids for commodity quotas. The bidding committee sets up various offices (the bidding offices) which handle day-to-day work in those trade associations. Article 5. The bidding procedures stipulated here are bidding with compensation. That is, the enterprise which wins the bid gets the quotas, provided it pays accordingly. The specific bidding procedures are determined by the bidding committee according to the type of commodities open for bidding. Article 6. Bidding scope: Size of quota, price of quota. Size of quota refers to the quantity of the export commodity on the quota list. Price of quota refers to the expense (in renminbi) for each unit the winning bidder has to pay. The winning bidder has to pay a fee; i.e., unit price multiplied by the quota quantity, to the bidding committee. The fee collected by the bidding committee is used entirely for the state's development of exports. Article 7. Quantity for bidding is decided by MOFTEC on the basis of the previous year's actual exports of quota-administered commodities and the need in the international market. The quantity the bidding committee invited for bidding must be within the range of the total quantity of commodity decided by MOFTEC. Article 8. The number of bidding invitations is determined by MOFTEC and the bidding committee according to the related situations of different commodities. In principle, each commodity is set for bidding twice a year. Each bidding invitation gives a three-month notice. Article 9. Bidding invitation notices are to be announced by the news media designated by the bidding committee. Article 10. All import and export companies that are members of the import and export trade association and are sanctioned by MOFTEC to have foreign trade management rights, all production enterprises that are sanctioned to have foreign trade management rights (restricted to their own products), and foreign-invested enterprises (restricted to their own products), may submit tenders. Article 11. All enterprises that intend to enter a bid must complete an "Application for Entering a Bid," which is issued by the bidding office. This application should be completed and submitted to the bidding office before a set date. An enterprise is allowed to enter only one bid for each commodity. Article 12. The "Application for Entering a Bid" must be submitted to the bidding office before the deadline established by the bidding committee. (It can also be sealed and sent by mail or by courier.) The date of receipt of the form determines the judgment of validity. Article 13. Based on the valid applications submitted by enterprises, the bidding committee assesses the quota quantity for the above-said enterprises. Article 14. The basis for assessment: 1. Consistent with Article 10 of these procedures. 2. The quota price should not be lower than the average price of the bidding prices offered by bidders. The average quota price is calculated on the following formula: bidders' quota price x bidding quantity Average Quota Price = --------------------------------------- total quantity of tender bidding 3. A copy of the certificate showing the previous year's export earnings related to the commodity concerned. 4. The Bidding Office has the right to rule out bidders whose offers are far from the normal standard. Article 15. Requirements for winning a bid: The list of bidders which are able to meet the requirements in Article 14, and the order of the winners are decided by the bidding committee according to their price offers for the quota of the commodity. Article 16. The bid-winning quantity of the winning bidder is calculated on the following formula: Bid-Winning Quantity = bidders' price X bidders' quantity \ total quantity for tender offer X winners' price X winners' quantity If the bid-winning quantity, which is calculated according to the aforesaid formula, is larger than the actual quantity the winning enterprise requires, the bid-winning quantity can be lowered to its requirement. The bid-winning fee is calculated on the following formula: Bid-winning fee = bidder's quantity X bidder's price Article 17. The bidding committee should finish its evaluation of a tender offer before a set date. Article 18. After the announcement of the bid winners, the bidding committee should send its certificate to the winner before a set date, report the result to MOFTEC, and notify the license-issuing authorities. If any malpractice or violations of the stipulations in these procedures are found and proved, MOFTEC has the right to veto the results of the bidding. Article 19. Names of bid winners are announced in a unified way by news media designated by the bidding committee. Article 20. Basis for issuing export licenses: 1. Names of bid winners (bid winners for major markets are listed separately). 2. Quantity of bids won. 3. Contracted price for the export commodity (not less than coordinated price). 4. Country or area to which the bid-winning quota is applied. Article 21. The bid winner may get the export license at the license-issuing authority upon presentation of the bid-winning certificate and transaction contract. The license-issuing authority must examine the bid-winning certificate issued by the bidding committee before issuing the export license. The license-issuing authority is not to issue export licenses to those who fail to produce bid-winning certificates or contracts which are not consistent with the certificates; otherwise, the license-issuing authority will be held responsible. Article 22. If the bid winner is unable to abide by a contract with the foreign enterprise, it should get approval from the bidding office before the set date and transfer its quota to another enterprise. For this, it has to pay a transfer fee. The transfer should be held publicly in a place designated by the bidding committee. Priority is given according to the order of time and price, which are handled by computer. Outside transactions are strictly forbidden. The new bidders must be qualified to bid for such commodities, and no further transfer is allowed. Article 23. If the bid winner is can neither abide by the contract with a foreign enterprise, nor transfer its quota to others, it should hand in the quota to the bidding office with a written explanation. Once the quota is handed in, part of the bidding fee is refunded. The returned quota will be added to the total quantity of the next tender offer. Article 24. When the quota of the commodity is cleared through Customs, the enterprise concerned should hand in the export license of the commodity to the bidding office (one duplicate copy is left with the enterprise). The bidding office is responsible for checking and filing statistics and reporting the execution of the contract to the bidding committee, to enable the latter to manage and supervise the export commodities subject to bidding. Article 25. If the bid winner fails to use the quota, to transfer it to others, or to hand it in to the bidding office within the time period before the set date, the bidding office, with the approval of the bidding committee, has the right to deprive this enterprise of the right to participate in the next year's tender bidding for the same commodity or to be a receiver of a transfer. Article 26. If a bid winner has transferred its quota to others without the approval of the bidding office, it will be deprived of its right to participate in the next two years' tender bidding for the same commodity, or to be a receiver of a transfer. Article 27. If the bid winner sets its export price lower than the coordinated price stipulated by the trade associations, this enterprise will be deprived of its rights for the next three years' tender bidding for the same commodity, or to be a receiver of a transfer. Article 28. These procedures shall go into effect on 2 February 1994. Rights for explanation remain with MOFTEC.
