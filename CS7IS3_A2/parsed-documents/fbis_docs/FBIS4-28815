FBIS4-28815 "dreas114_a_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Party Leaders Discuss Political Situation Party Leaders Discuss Political Situation OW1206092194 OW1206092194 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese in its "Sunday Discussion" (Nichiyo Toron) program at 0000 GMT on 12 June begins broadcasting a live, 60-minute roundtable discussion on the current political situation in Japan. The program is moderated by NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto. Participating in the discussions are Kozo Watanabe, acting Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general, and Kansei Nakano, secretary general of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), who are at the NHK studio. They are joined by Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ), and Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who are linked to the studio via remote hookup. Prior to the discussion, the program briefly describes the current, unstable political situation with the current Diet session scheduled to adjourn late in June. At 0230 GMT, Yamamoto asks Mori whether the LDP still plans to submit a no-confidence motion against the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Mori says that the plan has not been changed and stresses that the minority government of Prime Minister Hata should hand over power to the LDP. He states: "With the passage of the FY 1994 budget, the Hata administration has finished serving its purpose." In response, Watanabe says that sensible members of the LDP and the SDPJ do not really favor Hata's immediate resignation and that "should the LDP persist in submitting the no-confidence motion for no due reason, the SDPJ, as well as the general public, would oppose it." When asked what he feels about the LDP asking that power be turned over because Hata currently leads a minority government, Nakano replies that even though a minority government is not a normal situation, "it is not sufficient reason to propose a no- confidence motion." Asked how he feels about the same matter, Kubo answers: "There must be a good reason for a no-confidence motion. It is also irresponsible to turn out a government without the next administration that will replace it having a sound plan about what it intends to do." He emphasizes that the party has no intention of submitting a no-confidence motion right away. As for the possibility of the SDPJ's returning to the coalition, Kubo says that the party does not intend to return to the coalition right away and that it is only considering that possibility by holding further policy consultations -- not from the point where the party left the coalition immediately following the formation of the Kaishin parliamentary group but rather back when the coalition parties drew up policy accords on 22 April. Asked to comment on Kubo's remarks, Watanabe states that it is necessary for the SDPJ to return to the coalition. Nakano agrees and says that the DSP will do its part to try to convince the SDPJ to return to the coalition. Mori says that although it is up to the SDPJ to decide whether to return to the coalition, all the parties concerned should look back at what caused the SDPJ to leave the coalition, and he states that power should be turned over to the LDP because both Prime Minister Hata and former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa have advocated creating a political structure under which political forces can take turns ruling whenever this is appropriate. Watanabe says that the LDP can naturally return to power if it can win a majority of seats in the next general election that would be held under a new electoral system. He urges the LDP to support the Hata administration for the time being because the economy finally seems to be headed for a recovery and because there is the current need to deal with the DPRK nuclear issue. Watanabe adds that the LDP should then take on the coalition in a general election after these problems have been solved. Mori notes that the LDP has already offered the coalition sufficient cooperation. Asked whether the SDPJ plans to propose a no-confidence motion if the Hata administration fails to resign voluntarily, Kubo answers that the party is not out to topple the administration just for the sake of toppling it but rather that the party is prepared to offer its full cooperation toward forming a new coalition government. He adds that a general election following the dissolution of the Diet is an option. The discussion then continues on the issue of the SDPJ's possible return to the coalition. At 0027 GMT, Kubo explains topics on which agreement needs to be reached between the SDPJ and the coalition parties as a condition for the SDPJ's return to the coalition. Nakano emphasizes the importance of thorough discussions toward this end, and Watanabe reiterates this. Concerning possible policy consultations between the LDP and the SDPJ, Mori says that under the current conditions, it would be difficult for the two parties to hold concrete consultations. At 0039 GMT, Yamamoto asks Kubo about the SDPJ's view regarding the consumption tax. Kubo replies that the government should make greater efforts to make the people understand the need for a consumption tax increase, rather than having the government just say that this is necessary because of expected revenue shortfalls. Watanabe explains that the coalition government is currently working on tax reforms which fully consider the SDPJ's suggestions. Asked about the situation within the LDP on the issue of submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata administration, Mori denies that the party is divided over this issue, saying: "When I spoke to Mr. [Toshiki] Kaifu the other day, he said that his intentions were not necessarily being conveyed accurately. Mr. [Hiroshi] Mitsuzuka said that the party should not submit a no- confidence motion while knowing that it will be defeated. Of course, it goes without saying that the party needs to listen to such opinions from both within and outside the party." At 0048 GMT, Yamamoto shows an illustration which portrays the courses of action if a no-confidence motion were to be submitted and what might happen if the motion were not submitted. Discussions continue on the issues of a no-confidence motion, a dissolution of the Diet, and the next general election. After lengthy discussions, the program ends at 0100 GMT.
