['Arafat] It depends on the Israelis, and not only on the Palestinians. We are now expecting results from the Israelis in this respect. They appear to be insisting on a number of conditions that are far from the Declaration of Principles that we signed at the White House in Washington in September last year. We insist on the implementation of this agreement, on its accurate and honest implementation. [Labuhn] What conditions has the Israeli side set? ['Arafat] To take one example: According to the Israeli administration, the dimension of Jericho is 712 square kilometers. To start with, they offered us 27 square kilometers, which was then increased to 55 square kilometers. They want to control the access routes and border crossings, or, in other words, they want to put us into a ghetto or a Bantustan. But who would accept having to live in a Bantustan or a ghetto? The third issue is that the number of Jewish settlers in Gaza is no more than 3,000, and they insist on approximately 40 square kilometers for those 3,000 settlers, whereas the population there totals approximately 1.2 million, as you know. Can you imagine that this is fair? Could anyone accept this? Regrettably, I must say that they are demanding unacceptable guarantees. They only want to humiliate the Palestinians, and they do not want to solve problems or make peace with the Palestinians. [Labuhn] Should these problems be seen as a package, or should they rather be solved step by step? ['Arafat] I prefer to solve them step by step, because we do not want more than the accurate and serious implementation of the agreement. [Labuhn] In your view, what problem is the most important one? ['Arafat] We are confronted with these problems, and we are ready to discuss them in frank and open talks in the sense of the framework agreement concluded with Israel. [Labuhn] Israel insists on security measures for its settlers in the occupied territories. Do you understand these concerns? ['Arafat] They have no right to use this as an excuse, because we have accepted that in addition to our own responsibility in these areas, Israel can have full responsibility for their security. So this cannot be an excuse for Israel's position. [Labuhn] Will the talks with Israel be continued this week? ['Arafat] We hope so. [Labuhn] When? In a few hours, days, or not before next week? ['Arafat] It seems in a few days. [Labuhn] The implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement is now lagging three weeks behind the agreed time schedule. When are you hoping to move into your residence in Jericho? ['Arafat] It all depends on how the Israelis treat us, whether they continue maneuvering in order not to have to observe the exact dates.
