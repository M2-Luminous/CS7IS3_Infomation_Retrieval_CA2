In this way he, among other things, mentioned the existence of Croatian and Bosniak cantons and said that Mostar would be the capital of the community of the Croatian cantons. The concept of the constitution of the proposed federation, whose bases have been established by the Washington agreement, does not envisage ethnic cantons. This constitution does not envisage any other form of state organization beside a federation, cantons, and communes. Therefore, Trnka emphasizes, there was never any talk of any capitals of any community of cantons. The arbitrary statement by Mr. Sanader that Mostar will be the capital of such a community is completely inaccurate and bears no relation whatsoever to the Vienna talks. Such statements, as well as certain other steps, do not contribute toward the strengthening of mutual trust or the peace process as a whole. The Croatian delegation and the U.S. mediators had all these imprecisions and inaccuracies pointed out to them, after which Mr. Sanader personally asked me to accept his apologies, reads the statement for the public by Kasim Trnka, head of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation in Vienna talks.
