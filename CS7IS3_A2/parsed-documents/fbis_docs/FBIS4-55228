A new age is beginning in Hungary because it has become obvious that people's political taste is completely different from what it was four years ago. It is the job of the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] to assess the situation and to launch a new program on this basis, Fidesz Chairman Laszlo Orban told PESTI HIRLAP. [Bednarik] Do you agree with the statement that the Fidesz is one of the biggest, if not the biggest, loser in the elections because, although it is an opposition party, it did not even manage to reach its 1990 results in the first round of the elections? [Orban] I agree, but with the note that, nevertheless, it was the government parties that lost most. It is also certain that the Fidesz's performance was way below expectations and in this sense we are indeed the losers of these elections. [Bednarik] On the night of the elections, reacting to the results, you said that the country wanted a major correction rather than the half-turn advocated by the Fidesz. At the same time, the Fidesz defined itself as a nationally committed liberal center party -- as such, it should have found support with the broadest groups of society. [Orban] Unfortunately, this did not happen. The country's general mood was much more radical that the Fidesz's program. Since we decided not to join this radicalism, our politics had to go against the main drift. This was only enough to get the number of votes we did on 8 May. [Bednarik] Why did more people support the Free Democrats when the liberal parties had put up very similar programs and they had even coordinated these? [Orban] I cannot yet give an exact answer to this. Perhaps the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] advocated a much more radical change than we did. If, at a discussion, I said half-turn, [SZDSZ prime ministerial candidate] Gabor Kuncze always emphasized the need for a full turn. When I spoke about the danger of restoration of people in their positions, the SZDSZ said that this did not have much chance. The Fidesz distanced itself from the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] much more than the SZDSZ did. Therefore, the differences between the two liberal parties must have been quite clear for the voters. [Bednarik] Is it possible to maintain the cooperation agreement with the SZDSZ in spite of the fact that this will further damage the Fidesz's final chances? [Orban] When a party makes an agreement it should adhere to it. Up to now, the Fidesz has adhered to all of its agreements and it does not wish to change this practice. [Bednarik] How was the Fidesz's failure affected by the fact that, as Fidesz chairman, you conducted a very powerful campaign against the MSZP? [Orban] This is what is called sailing against the wind. I think that our strong criticism of the MSZP did not have an effect on the Fidesz's election results. [Bednarik] Then what did? [Orban] With hindsight, I believe that we did not participate in criticizing the government as powerfully as the MSZP or the SZDSZ. Therefore, the relationship between the Socialists and the Young Democrats did not influence the voters. [Bednarik] What is the hidden message of the first round of the elections? [Orban] It is perfectly clear that one of the most important periods of Hungarian transition has ended. From now on, Hungary has a new period in time because it has come to light that people's political taste is different from that of four years ago. It is the Fidesz's job to assess the situation and to create a new strategy based on this, to prepare for analyzing the government program, and to prepare for the local government elections in a few months' time. [Bednarik] Will the failure have any personal consequences? [Orban] The mandate of the party leadership is for two years, until 1995. Therefore, in theory, it is not possible to replace people in the party. However, the chairman and all deputy chairmen believe that the elections are an important enough event for the Fidesz also to reconsider its personnel decisions. We are not intending to resign but we will return our mandates if the congress that is soon to be convened wishes to elect new leaders. In this case, we will also overcome the obstacles in our statute which would prevent the changes. [Bednarik] What happens if the membership decides in favor of change? [Orban] In that case, I hope that they will find the people who can better adjust to the new situation than we can. [Bednarik] In view of the election results after the first round, Zoltan Gal, the MSZP's parliamentary group leader, did not exclude the possibility of cooperating with the Fidesz if the attitude of the Young Democrats changed. [Orban] I remember my late class teacher Geza Rimmel saying similar things. I never took him seriously, either. [Bednarik] Does this mean that there is still no chance of the Fidesz entering into a coalition with the MSZP? [Orban) We have not received such a request from the MSZP. I maintain that while I am the Fidesz's chairman, it is not possible to cooperate with this MSZP.
