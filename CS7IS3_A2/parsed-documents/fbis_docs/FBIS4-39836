The Moldovan delegation, headed by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Alexandru Burian, is comprised by representatives of customs departments. Sources from the government told BASAPRESS that these negotiations are held according to the 15 February 1994 Governmental Agreement. According to it, some passage points would be granted international status. The same source mentioned that the, Cahul-Oancea, Sculeni-Sculeni Giurgiulesti, and Costesti-Stanca passage points were opened in 1991 to facilitate border traffic and serve only Moldovan and Romanian citizens and economic companies. At the same time, Ukraine and other East European countries want to cross their goods and passengers at these points, at Giurgiulesti, in particular. The negotiations in Galati will not alter the passage regulations for Moldovan and Romanian citizens. Economic experts assert that one of the most difficult problems arising with this change of the passage points' status would be the creation of conditions corresponding to European standards for which Moldova is unprepared.
