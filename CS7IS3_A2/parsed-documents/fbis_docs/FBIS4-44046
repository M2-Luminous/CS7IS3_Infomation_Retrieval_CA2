In a statement to the correspondents after the meeting, which lasted nearly 90 minutes, Denktas said that Joe Clark has not been able to convey UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's letters to the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides because of Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos Kliridhis' negative approach. Clark has been unable to fulfill his mission as a result of Kliridhis' approach, he said. Denktas said the following: [Begin Denktas recording] Mr. Clark has been unable to convey the document or letter the UN secretary general is reported to have sent to the two sides. We have been informed by other sources that Glavkos Kliridhis talked with the UN secretary general by telephone for 45 minutes yesterday. He warned Butrus-Ghali that he should not be given a document and that he will resign if a document is conveyed to him. As far was we know, Kliridhis has objected to many points on the confidence-building measures. He pretended to agree, however, because he believed that the ball was in our court. His design was foiled when we agreed with the UN officials on all the issues. Consequently, he has moved to make a threat. Therefore, I was compelled to ask Mr. Clark whether he traveled all that way just to say hello to us. He replied that he believed that his talks with us were useful and that they gave him an opportunity to learn more about the problems. Obviously, he was unable to fulfill his mission because of Kliridhis' approach. We asked Mr. Clark why the UN secretary general has not submitted a report to the UN Security Council to inform it of the developments that have taken place since 30 May and the initiatives the Turkish Cypriot side has made in goodwill, particularly the sacrifices it has made for the sake of reaching and signing of an agreement. We asked why he had failed to do so during the past 23 days, regardless of the fact that he had promised to submit a report. Kliridhis will use the UN secretary general's 30 May report in the meeting to be held in Corfu. That report blames the Turkish Cypriot side. Is there an agreement to support Kliridhis? We insist that a realistic report be submitted. A decision at Corfu in favor of the Greek Cypriot side will have negative effects. It would be useful for all sides concerned to realize that. We underlined that to Mr. Clark. He responded that he is not concerned with what may happen in Corfu. But he has to be concerned, because the outcome of the meeting in Corfu may complicate his mission. It may even create a very unfavorable state of affairs. Yes, we discussed all that. We reiterated the decisions that have been adopted and the agreements that have been reached. He promised us that he will inform the correspondents that the Turkish Cypriot side has done what it was expected to do. It will be recalled that he informed the world after we met last time that the ball was in our court. However, the ball was in the Greek Cypriot side's court at that time as well. We also underlined that Kliridhis seems to have agreed to the confidence-building measures because of the Greek Cypriot side's tactical approach. However, he will not sign an agreement, because the Greek Cypriot side has no need for an agreement. Yes, we exchanged views. As he himself has said, he has observed the Turkish Cypriot side's goodwill once again. Mr. Clark said that time is required to allow the problem to cool down. We have been accused of wasting time. However, he suggested that time is required because of the Greek Cypriot approach. We should try to find a way to resolve the problem in time. We responded by saying: No other way exists but to draw up a written agreement. An agreement has to be drawn up and signed. Otherwise, no agreement can be reached. Therefore, you should hold talks with Kliridhis. He is obliged to sign the agreement. That is his duty. The UN documents and Kliridhis' statements refer to the agreement to be concluded and signed by the two leaders. Our people have authorized us to conclude a fair and balanced agreement. Nothing can be achieved in the absence of an agreement that will be signed by both sides. [end recording] Replying to a question, President Denktas called on Butrus Butrus-Ghali to maintain an impartial approach. He said: If Butrus-Ghali wishes to maintain an impartial approach and refrain from giving Kliridhis an opportunity to use the 30 May report against the Turkish Cypriot side in Corfu, then he should submit a report on the developments that will favor the Turkish Cypriot side. He still has time to do so. He can quickly draw up a new report.
