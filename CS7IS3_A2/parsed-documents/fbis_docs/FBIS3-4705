The government has decided to inform the North side of this position around 1000 [0100 GMT] 2 March. Therefore, the fourth round of North-South working delegates' contact for the exchange of special envoys is expected to be held at the House of Peace, the meeting site in the South side area of Panmunjom, at 1000 on 3 March, two days later than the ROK Government had proposed. The unification-related ministers' meeting also decided to maintain the position that the South side will announce the condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit joint military exercise for 1994 later if the North-South working contact is made, as the Ministry of National Defense has announced. Therefore, the South side may well announce the condition-attached suspension of the Team Spirit exercise when it confirms that the North-South working contact is made on 3 March. Prior to this, North Korea, in a telephone message in the name of Pak Yong-su, the North side delegate to the North-South working contact, said it agrees to the resumption of the working contact, admitting that the South side accepted the North side's demand for the suspension of the nuclear war exercise and the abandonment of the international cooperation system.
