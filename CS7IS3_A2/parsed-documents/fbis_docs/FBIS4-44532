The inspection and appraisal of grain imports by Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau at the port of Dalian show that imported grain is subject mainly to the following quality problems: 1. Substandard product imports make up quite a large percentage. From January 1993 to March 1994, the port of Dalian imported 3,715 batches of grain, for a gross volume of 1.371486518 tons. Through strict and legal inspection by Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau, it was discovered that 674 of these batches were substandard grain imports, involving substandard grain imports of 348,828.85 tons which, calculated by quantity, meant a substandard grain-import rate of 25 percent. 2. Certain batches have even more severe quality problems. For instance, from January 1993 to March 1994, we imported from the U.S. 984 batches of wheat, for a gross volume of 495,120.894 tons, of which Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau found 671 batches to be substandard, for a total substandard volume of 348,016.85 tons, or 70.29 percent of all wheat imported from the United States. Meanwhile, we imported from Mongolia two batches of barley, for a volume totaling 560 tons. Inspection by Liaoning's Commercial Inspection Bureau found that both batches of barley imported from Mongolia were substandard products. The reasons for this were: 1) the germination percentage did not conform to contract provisions; 2) the inner quality was worse than the outward appearance. For both of these substandard grain imports, the Liaoning Commercial Inspection Bureau promptly signed and issued documents stating that they were substandard, turning them over to the concerned parties for foreign damage claims. As to the existing quality problems in grain imports at the port of Dalian, the Liaoning Commercial Inspection Bureau has made the following suggestions: 1. For grain imports, concerned departments must present damage claims as quickly as possible to overseas firms based on the damage-claim documents signed and issued by the commercial inspection sector, retrieving the Chinese side's economic losses as soon as possible, to protect the Chiness side's legitimate rights and interests. 2. All departments in charge of grain imports, when signing contracts with overseas firms for grain imports, must act in line with international practice, by setting forth clearly and in detail grain-import variety, grade, volume (weight), quality, packaging, and inspection damage-claim terms. The terms must be set forth clearly and in detail, with no ambiguity, and inspection terms having clear inspection grounds, as well as reasonable damage-claim validity periods and quality guarantees. 3. All grain-import consignment and user units, when receiving overseas grain imports from now on, must take the initiative to promptly submit them for inspection to commercial-inspection organs at the stipulated times and sites, being allowed to sell and use them only after the commercial-inspection sector has inspected and signed and issued documents certifying that they are up to standard. If they are sold or used without being inspected by the commodity-inspection sector, when quality problems are discovered, and the claim-damage periods have expired, there is no way to claim damages from foreign firms, which is bound to create unnecessary economic losses for the consignment and user units, as well as for the broad masses of consumers. These suggestions by the Liaoning Commodity-Inspection Bureau should be brought to the attention of all concerned parties which, just like the business commodity-inspection sector, should combine management with inspection to do a strict job of guaranteeing grain-import quality.
