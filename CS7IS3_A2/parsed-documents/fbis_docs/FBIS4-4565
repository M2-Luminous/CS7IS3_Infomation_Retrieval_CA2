The Ad Hoc Committee on General Policy on Okinawa (chaired by Tsuruo Yamaguchi) of the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan has arranged the meeting and Kosuke Uehara, director general of the Okinawa Development Agency, will attend. It has been 20 years since both Japan and the United States, at the 25th meeting of the Japan-U.S. Joint Security Committee in 1974, agreed to return the Naha harbor facilities on condition that a site was secured for their relocation. In commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the reversion of Okinawa to Japanese rule in 1991, Japan and the United States began full-fledged discussions on how to return the harbor facilities and the discussions have since continued with no agreement reached. In connection with problems arising from U.S. military bases on Okinawa, Governor Ota met on 1 February with the prime minister to plead with the latter. During the meeting, the Okinawa prefectural governor also asked the prime minister to work for the return of the Yomitan Auxiliary Airfield and the Naha harbor facilities and a halt to live-firing exercise by U.S. Forces on Okinawa across Prefectural Highway No. 104.
