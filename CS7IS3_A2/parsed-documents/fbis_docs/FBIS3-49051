According to the spokesman, Synthesia has information that such an explosive -- based on a formula similar to Semtex -- has plainly been manufactured abroad for several years. So far, however, the Pardubice company has been unable to obtain a sample of the so-called Semtex, which is apparently very similar to the original and has similar characteristics. Synthesia was the first company in the world to make its plastic explosives easy to detect in accordance with the 1991 international convention adopted within the framework of the struggle against terrorism. The export of Semtex was halted in 1989. Last year, Synthesia exported several dozen tonnes to Kuwait, where it was used to clear mine fields and destroy unexploded shells. This November, Synthesia offered those countries to which it used to export Semtex the possibility of making the explosive detectable or, as the case many be, of destroying it free of charge if it was unsuitable for reprocessing. So far, according to the spokesman, no one has responded to this offer.
