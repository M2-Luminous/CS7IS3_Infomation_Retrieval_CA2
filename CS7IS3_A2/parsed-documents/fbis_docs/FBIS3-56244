The newspaper said key issues in foreign policy are used only as a "tool for internal struggle" and a lacks a clear attitude toward this or that problem. LIETUVOS RYTAS noted, however, that the international community heard Lithuania's name once again after a considerable break. "A majority of politicians consider the step premature, but they realized that Lithuania's aspiration is sincere -- to be safe on a dangerous crossing in Eastern Europe."
