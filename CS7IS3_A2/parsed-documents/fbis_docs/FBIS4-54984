After the talks, the two ministers made statements. Albino Cehic has a report. [Begin Velayati recording, in English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian] We have already concluded very friendly talks with his excellency the prime minister of Croatia, and we are happy that, less than a week after his visit to Iran, we had an opportunity to come to Croatia to implement what we signed in Tehran. This evening we remembered what we signed and, in addition to bilateral relations, we would like to include Bosnia as well, in order to establish tripartite cooperation between Iran, Bosnia, and Croatia. [end recording] [Cehic] This evening's meeting is also important because we have just come back from Sarajevo where we had useful talks with the Bosnian leaders and Alija Izetbegovic. We hope that Croatia and Bosnia will find a way to implement the agreement they signed recently. I believe that the future of Croatia and Iran, Minister Velayati stressed, lies primarily in the strengthening of bilateral cooperation between our and your country. Prime Minister Valentic had the following to say to reporters: [Begun Valentic recording] This is the continuation of the very concrete talks we began in Tehran, primarily on bilateral relations, and, even more importantly, on tripartite relations between Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iran, and Croatia. I think that very soon our three countries will form a joint economic commission, in order to make joint appearance in the world -- especially, as I have already said, in Islamic countries where we believe that mixed Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatian companies can obtain considerable financial projects. In the same way, Iran's help and support are important in the implementation of the agreement on the [Muslim-Croat] federation. We agreed that the federation is important, primarily for Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, but also for Croatia as a directly interested neighboring state, and a state which is concerned about its people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and it is also important for Iran as a state. Croatia attaches great importance to that, and we will continue developing bilateral and tripartite relations. [end recording]
