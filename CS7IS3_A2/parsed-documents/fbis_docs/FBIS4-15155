The letter states that the question of the Black Sea Fleet was addressed at an interdepartmental conference in February, attended by officials from Russia's Social Security Ministry, Foreign Affairs Ministry, and Defense Ministry, whose proposals on a settlement of the issue of the Black Sea Fleet were forwarded to Russian Federation Government Chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin on 9 March. The interdepartmental commission also noted that under the Massandra protocol of 3 August 1993, the preparation of an agreement between Russia and Ukraine was continuing. The letter points out: "It makes provision for the whole of the Black Sea Fleet and all its infrastructure in Crimea being used by the Russian Federation and having Russia's insignia, with the Russian side making appropriate payments for the half of the Black Sea Fleet, including its infrastructure, that under the previous accords was not to be transferred to Ukraine."
