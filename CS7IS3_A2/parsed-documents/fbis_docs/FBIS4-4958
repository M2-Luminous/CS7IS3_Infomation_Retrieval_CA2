Concerning the peace and security question, the general public has asked why there is insufficient stability in the country despite the fact that the Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC] has been set up for months as the legitimate government of the country? [Ranariddh] "Thank you. First, I would like to thank you, who represent the national tv and radio network, for interviewing me today on questions that are of concern not only to the people and Buddhist monks in general but also to His Majesty our august king, who continues to closely follow developments in the Kingdom of Cambodia, especially the on-going bloodshed between Cambodians. "The government is not happy with the current situation despite the fact that the so-called general war has been transformed into a mere state of insurgency. The RGC is not pleased at all with this insurgency war. Compared with the overall peaceful situation of the country, however, we see that this insurgency is very marginal. Nevertheless, the concern of His Majesty the king as well as that of the general public is most understandable. And it is the responsibility of the RGC, for the duty of the RGC born out of the elections is to seek peace and security for the people." In addition to this question of peace, there is the Khmer Rouge problem. As first prime minister of the RGC, I would like to inform the public of the following: I am very saddened by what is happening between us and the Khmer Rouge. We still have this Khmer Rouge problem to solve although we already held elections, reintroduced the monarchy, formed the RGC, and wrote the Constitution. After being nominated prime minister, I agreed to make so many concessions to the Khmer Rouge. Some of my cabinet ministers even criticized me for tarnishing the prestige of the legal, elected government by consenting to meet with Khieu Samphan. "They said: Khieu Samphan has never officially recognized you as prime minister. He always addresses you only as chairman of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]." But I still agreed to meet with him. This shows that the RGC and I have never hesitated in trying to put an end to the conflict between Cambodians. We have always supported His Majesty the king's five-point proposal for peace, a proposal which demands that the Khmer Rouge dissolve their army, a cease-fire be declared, and the Khmer Rouge be included in the government if they wish. When I talked to Khieu Samphan, he said these conditions were designed by the Vietnamese. I just mentioned above that these conditions were proposed by His Majesty, but Khieu Samphan insisted they were proposed instead by the Vietnamese. Another of our concessions is that we always refer to the Khmer Rouge as PDK or Party of Democratic Kampuchea. While we recognize the PDK, the PDK never recognizes the RGC. "The Khmer Rouge said they want to become government advisers or government members, but they have refused to recognize the RGC. This shows that they are not sincere." When I proposed to Khieu Samphan that there should be a cease-fire first, he answered no. He said: How can there be a cease-fire if the Vietnamese continue to attack us? "So, the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] have no choice but to continue the struggle. The Khmer Rouge do not consider us as Cambodians, but as Vietnamese. Therefore, we have to fight them." As I have already mentioned above, the PDK does not recognize the RGC. They keep talking about the quadripartite setup. This quadripartite setup is outdated. The four parties no longer existed after the elections. There is now only the RGC born out of the elections. The three parties forming the RGC cannot be regarded as separate entities. They already form the RGC. So, there are only the RGC and the PDK. I tell you of all this to show that the RGC is sincere in seeking to solve the problem. In spite of everything, we are always prepared to follow the instruction of His Majesty our king. If His Majesty wants us to talk with the Khmer Rouge today, we will talk with them today. "Although the KRAF have won great successes at Anlung Veng and Pailin, we are still prepared to talk. Some said that Anlung Veng was a defeat for us. Let me tell you that the RGC did order the KRAF to pull out of Anlung Veng. Why? Because Anlung Veng is no longer a town. [Khmer Rouge commander] Ta Mok burned down everything there. How could we stay in a burned out location and wait to be bombarded from the outside? The objective of the KRAF was to prevent the Khmer Rouge from using Anlung Veng as their economic, political, and military base from which to launch attacks against Siem Reap." In this goal, we were 100 percent successful. Concerning Pailin, before our campaign many people were very harsh with the KRAF, saying they were not capable of ending the Pailin tragedy, unable to stop the region from being raped and the Sangke river from being soiled. Now that we have attacked Pailin, they still criticize us, saying we are responsible for bloodshed. Allow me to stress here that this is our duty, the duty of the KRAF. Our constitution pointedly forbids secession of any part of our motherland. The KRAF have done their job and have upheld the Constitution. Once again, I would like to emphasize that we are always ready to comply if His Majesty the king instructs us to hold talks with the Khmer Rouge. . Moreover, of the estimated $1 billion, $585 million has already been spent. The people could not believe that so much money has been spent on Cambodia and nothing concrete has been achieved. Let me tell you, this international aid was slotted for technical assistance. It could not be translated into cars, tractors, or equipment. But mind you, the UN Development Program is in full control of this aid. The people should not worry that the government will mishandle aid at all. "In my opinion, what we need is not arms. What we need is a better life for the people. When the people have food, clothes, schools, medicines, roads, running water, electricity, and employment for the youths, when the people's living standard has improved, the problem of insurgency will be completely solved." [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Ranaridddh] Thank you again for reminding me of this issue. I would like to take this opportunity to recall that for 23 years we have been through so many wars, many killings, many destructions. It would take us another 10 years to become as prosperous as we were under Sangkum Reas Niyum [Sihanouk's pre-1970 ruling party]. "Nonetheless, the RGC is striving hard to set the foundation and this foundation is underground, invisible to the eyes. Yet, we need a strong foundation in order to build a sturdy house." This is not an easy job. We have to revise, to rationalize the structure. We have hundreds of thousands of state employees to manage and reorganize and we must reform our legal system to cope with new national requirements. It all will take a lot of time. Priority should be given to so many domains, such as education and the infrastructure. However, to achieve that we need favorable conditions: security and social stability. Under the current circumstances, some of us believe that we are wanting in security and stability. I have just returned from Europe and countries over there think differently. They marveled at our capability to achieve and maintain peace. Before leaving for Europe, I was a little worried that they might stop caring about what is happening in Cambodia. Giving us $773 million already shows how sympathetic and kind they are toward us. But the international community still cares about us because they have seen that we are serious about trying to help ourselves. In the economic field, they see that we have market stability, a stable riel currency, and an inflation rate below 10 percent. Our main concern now is with agriculture. I have informed the international community that they should give less attention to spending their aid on training our cadres. I just told the Americans that we received too much training; instead, what we Cambodians want to see are tractors, excavators, and water pumps. We should not make a fuss about technical training. Months have passed and nothing concrete, except for the Cambodia-Japan friendship bridge, has been visible. And already $585 million of the aid has been spent, just on training. Those people who are misinformed will surely believe that Ranariddh and Hun Sen have lined their pockets with all that money. So, I have urged the donors not to spend to much money on training. [Correspondent] As head of the RGC, what is your impression on the plight of the refugees forced to flee across the border in the wake of the large-scale government operations against Pailin? [Ranariddh] I do not have enough words to comment on this matter. We are very concerned about the refugees' well-being. Seeing the young and old people turned into war refugees after months have eclipsed since the formation of the RGC is heart-rending. I have ordered our Red Cross to be prepared to take good care of the refugees. In my opinion, the right procedure should be to request the UNHCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees] and the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] to take charge of the refugees. They should be in a position to allow the refugees to decide where they want to go and then provide them with the means to go there. This, however, was not what happened when our refugees fled from Pailin into Thailand. The Thais said they recognize the RGC. So, I said, we should hold talks at governmental level. I proposed that the UNHCR and the ICRC interview the refugees and help take them to where they want to go. If a sanctuary is needed, then we will set up one. But the Thai authorities, without informing us, instead forcibly repatriated our people to a region known to be under the control of the Khmer Rouge. "This does not conform with what the Thai authorities repeatedly assured me when I returned from Tokyo, that is, that they recognize only the RGC. They said: We do not help the Khmer Rouge. Highness, please believe us. What they just did, however, belies this assurance." I have learned that some of the refugees said they wanted to go back to Kompong Cham where they first came from. I have also learned from Battambang that a few of the forcibly repatriated refugees had escaped from that area and revealed to us that hundreds more wanted to flee. I ordered our authorities to do their best to contact and help them out. At least, we should give a free choice to the refugees to go where they want to go. Madame Ogata of the UNHCR and the ICRC have always been prepared to assist the refugees. The press are closely watching the government's record on press freedom since the editor of a local newspaper was arrested. What is your comment? [Ranariddh] "Thank you for raising this issue. It reminds me of an incident. This morning AFP wrote that I had claimed to be in possession of a picture clearly showing Pol Pot escaping in a car on a road inside Thailand. I would like to make it clear now before there is further misunderstanding by emphasizing that I really have a picture, but it is a picture taken by our agent showing a convoy of trucks transporting Khmer Rouge soldiers with pots, pans, and other belongings riding on a road in Thai territory from an area near Pailin to another area. I have this picture, but I have never said I have a picture of Pol Pot. I have a picture of Pol Pot's troops being transported, but not a picture of Pol Pot. I would be very happy to own one because Japan has promised to give $1 million to any person who can produce a picture of Pol Pot. So, I do not have a picture of Pol Pot, but I have a picture showing Pol Pot's men fleeing. I have to make this clear so that AFP will not report something that I did not say. However, I did stress that such a tarmac road with a white dividing line in the middle does not exist in the Pailin region. Where else can this road be?" Yesterday, our Parliament was debating a press bill in conformity with our Constitution. Our local press seem to be not very happy with the present state of press freedom in the country. The French press are even more strident in their protest. But what we are talking about here is only a bill yet to be passed by Parliament. We should not compare ours with the press freedom of the French who have had theirs since 1789. Moreover, we have a lot of things in this bill that the French do not have, such as a clause protecting the journalist profession for Cambodian citizens, and so on. Nevetheless, I am more concerned about the question of security than press freedom. There should be limits to all our undertakings. I told the cabinet meeting yesterday that His Majesty the king had sent us letter after letter urging us not to deprive this journalist of his right. However, while we must have a law on press freedom, we also must have some restrictions. A foreign newspaper said that I have gagged the national TV and radio network. You have my word, I have never asked His Excellency Ieng Muli or any other personalities to curb the TV and radio comments at all. I only once urged everybody not to make excessive additional comments on events, not to put words in other people's mouths. For that I have been accused of gagging the media. I swear I have never told His Excellency Ieng Muli to cover anything up. I only begged for cooperation in respecting press freedom and also the right of other people. The press should be informative, educational, and useful to society. At the same time, the press should support the RGC in its difficult mission of rehabilitating the nation. This is my appeal to the press. I am proud that our country, after years of wars, has now entered a very liberal period. I hope that the press will have a high national conscience to transcend that liberal stage, become the pride of the nation, and refrain from spawing what is known as diplomatic incidents.
