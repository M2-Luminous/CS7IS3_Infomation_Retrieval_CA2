The representatives of the Rwandan Armed Forces did not turn up and the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] delegation left early this afternoon. However, the UN special representative, Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh, wants to see some positive signs. Anne Corpet got through to him in Arusha earlier today: [Begin Booh-Booh recording] I do not think that it was the leader... [changes thought] The RPF secretary general was received by the prime minister and the OAU secretary general this morning. I was received after him, and I was told that some proposals about a possible agreement concerning the cease-fire were made to him and that he was intending to get in touch with the leader of his party. He will give the official reaction of his party tomorrow. He has left for Nairobi to get in touch with this person. In that respect, we cannot say that it is a failure. What concerns me is the hoax played by the representative of the Rwandan government. We have not had any news from this delegation. It was said that it was now in Goma, now in Kinshasa, now in Nairobi, and their absence here is a major handicap in the contacts we have to establish. [end recording] [Announcer] [passage omitted] As for the fighting, it continued all day in Kigali according to the United Nations. [passage omitted] We have just heard from Medecins Sans Frontieres Belgium that 170 Rwandan wounded who were in the hospital of Butare have been slaughtered by the Rwandan presidential guard since Saturday morning, yesterday morning. This was reported by Medecins Sans Frontieres Belgium, which also said that its team has had to leave the town of Butare.
