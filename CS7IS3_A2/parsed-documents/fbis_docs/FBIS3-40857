Based on the latest statistics published by the English Ministry of Commercial Industries, the value of the commercial exchanges between this country and Iran in the first 10 months of 1993, 9 Dey 1371 to Mehr 1372 [30 December 1992 to September 1993], declined 44 percent, decreasing in value from £[pound sterling]1.152 billion to £643 million. During the same period Iran's exports to England increased from £116 million to £226 million, a growth of 95 percent, while Iran's imports from England declined 15 percent, decreasing from £489 million to £417 million. Consequently, Iran's trade deficit with England decreased in the first 10 months of 1992 from about £372 million to £191 million. The increase in Iran's food exports to England is one of the most important factors in the improvement of Iran's balance of trade with this country. Another factor in the improvement of Iran's balance of trade with England is the increase in the volume of oil exports to this country. In the first six months of 1992 the value of these exports was about £50 million, while in the first six months of the year 1993 it was more than $125 million.
