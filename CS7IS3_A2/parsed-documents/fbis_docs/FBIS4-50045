Early at dawn, the city is thronged with business people and motor vehicles carrying fresh vegetables and other commodities from almost all parts of the country to sell goods or purchase what they need. A survey shows that the transaction volume of vegetables alone in Xuzhou tops 300,000 kilograms a day. "Xuzhou's business is so developed that people from all corners of the country wish to dig into it for profits," said Huang Yuannan, a businessman from east China's Zhejiang Province who is operating a stall of decorations at the Xuanwu small commodities market. He disclosed that his fellow natives have booked some 500 stalls at the market. Jiang Qijun, a businessman from Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, has made big profits by operating a furniture shop and engaging in furniture-making in the Kaiming market. The 30-year-old man now has fixed assets worth several hundred thousand yuan. Both Jiang and Xu are typical examples of 10,000 business people from other parts of the country who open shops in Xuzhou. In the afternoon and evening, Xuzhou's five major state department stores are the best places for visitors and shoppers. These splendid stores are a feast for the eyes and shop assistants with smiling faces are always ready to offer a helping hand. Xuzhou is located in the area where Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan and Anhui Provinces meet, and at the bank of the ancient Beijing-Hangzhou grand canal, where the Lianyungang-Lanzhou and Beijing- Shanghai railways meet. Known as a "museum of war," the city has experienced more than 200 battles in history. "It was its geographical location provided with convenient transport facilities that has enabled the city to develop into a business center," said Yu Xianrong, director of the Xuzhou Bureau of Commerce. According to Xu Jiping, director of the Xuzhou City Administration for Industry and Commerce, Xuzhou has set up 437 markets of farm produce, trade businesses, small commodities, industrial products and production factors, with an annual transaction volume totalling 12.5 billion yuan. "These markets are paving the way for the city to further boost the market economy," said Li Yangzhen, a senior official of the city. More and more Xuzhou citizens have abandoned their view of distaste toward business careers. According to statistics, Xuzhou has more than 100,000 registered private business people. While welcoming business people from across the country, Xuzhou is further improving its investment conditions to attract overseas investment. So far, 220 Taiwan-funded companies have opened service in the city.
