FR940817-0-00013 FR940817-0-00007 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms 27 CFR Parts 4, 5, and 7 [T.D. ATF&hyph;359] RIN 1512&hyph;AB31 Signature Authority for Approval of Certificates of Label Approval (COLAS) (94F&hyph;002P) AGENCY: Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), Treasury. ACTION: Final rule, Treasury decision. SUMMARY: This Treasury decision will authorize the removal of imported alcoholic beverage products from Customs custody in conformity with certificates of label approval signed by ATF specialists. Currently, ATF specialists issue label approvals by affixing the Director's name to each application. This Treasury decision will eliminate from 27 CFR §§4.40(b) (wine), 5.51(b) (distilled spirits), and 7.31(b) (malt beverages) the requirement that certificates of label approval bear the signature of the Director. This change will streamline internal procedures and improve resource management. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert White, Coordinator, Wine and Beer Branch, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20226 (202&hyph;927&hyph;8230). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 205(e) of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), 27 U.S.C. 205(e), requires that all distilled spirits, wine, and malt beverage products have either a certificate of label approval or a certificate of exemption from label approval prior to bottling, or in the case of imported products, prior to removal from Customs custody. Section 205(e) grants authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to issue certificates of label approval in such manner and in such form as prescribed by regulation. The Secretary has delegated authority to administer the FAA Act to the Director, ATF, including the issuance of certificates of label approval. See 37 FR 11696 (June 6, 1972).
