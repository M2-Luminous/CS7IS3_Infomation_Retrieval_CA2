Yes, if They Pay Us One Billion Dollars!"] [Excerpts] [Oreb-Jerkovic] The Slovene press is full of accusations against the Croatian Electric Power Industry [HEP] for nonpayment of debts to the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant for electric energy that has been delivered. Mr. Begovic, in your opinion, are the demands of the Slovene side justified, and is it true, as the Slovene Government claims, that Slovenes are providing electricity to the Croatian consumers on credit? [Begovic] The claims by the Slovene side proceed from a wrong assumption. Namely, Croatia does not buy electricity from the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant, we produce it there. This is not just a difference in the terminology, but in the understanding of the problems that have arisen concerning the nuclear power plant. The HEP regularly pays for the costs of electricity produced in this facility, which, for us, is very significant and valuable. This is not at all a matter of providing credit to the Croatian consumers. Such claims are inappropriate and unacceptable. [passage ommitted] [Oreb-Jerkovic] In recent days you participated in a series of talks with Slovene officials in connection with these controversial matters. Boris Sovic, Slovene state secretary for energy, stated that some new ideas have been examined. What is at issue? [Begovic] I have no knowledge of any new ideas. In past talks we presented nine points of interest for the Croatian side, in which we asked that the currently valid agreement of 1970 and 1974 be respected. The basic problem is that Slovenia, from the moment it gained its independence, stopped complying with existing interrepublic agreements and annulled them by passing new decrees. [Oreb-Jerkovic] Are you referring to the new law on employment of foreigners? [Begovic] Yes, among other things, I am speaking about this new legal decree. It violates article 9 of the aforementioned agreement of 1970, which legally regulates the issue of parity of employment of specialized personnel in the Krsko Nuclear Power Plant. With subsequent dismissals of our workers, we have been gradually losing control over the management of funds. The parity of employment was violated by the unilateral behavior of the Slovenes in dismissing 19 Croat workers. Presently 110 Croats and 500 Slovenes are employed in the plant. [passage omitted] [Oreb-Jerkovic] What will you do if the Slovene side does not stop putting pressure on the HEP to pay the unpaid costs? [Begovic] Recently, Slovene Ambassador to Croatia Matija Malesic stated in your paper that the Slovenes worry about their weekend homes in our part of the Adriatic sea. We also worry about our property. We feel that all these games about nonpayment of debts are an attempt to gradually take away our property. We will not accept the Slovene blackmail as long as clearly established investor rights are not respected by both sides. [passage omitted] We at the HEP would have nothing against the Slovenes paying us $1 billion dollars, which is the value of our share in the nuclear power plant. We would be able to resolve the issue of the entire energy system in Croatia with these funds. [passage omitted]
