The announcement was made by Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan Bijan and reported by INTERFAX-UKRAINE news agency as Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in Ukraine to discuss the dispute. "It's up to Russia to decide how to react to this resolution," the agency quoted General Anatoliy Lopata, chief of staff of the Ukrainian Army, as saying. A spokesman for the Russian Navy told AFP that the Ukrainian move was made unilaterally but said it "means nothing" as the future of the fleet would have to be resolved through negotiations. A Russian delegation led by Admiral Felix Gromov, commander of the Russian Navy, held talks with Ukrainian officials in Kiev Tuesday regarding the dispute, but the negotiations ended without agreement, INTERFAX reported. The Ukrainian move came a day after Russia accused Ukrainian special forces of storming the base at Odessa, wounding servicemen and arrested three Russian naval officers. Bijan said the three officers had been released following demands from the Russian Government. The decision to place the Odessa division under Ukrainian control was taken because "a considerable number of the men who serve in the division expressed their desire to serve in the Ukrainian Armed Forces," Bijan stated. The Odessa unit is a submarine maintenance division consisting of only several dozen servicemen, a shipyard and basic communications facilities, informed sources said. Details surrounding the attack on the base Sunday were still hazy, but naval officials suggested that it occurred when Russian sailors defied Ukrainian orders and left Odessa with a ship carrying expensive naval equipment. Control over the fleet, based at the Crimean port of Sevastopol, has been a crucial point of contention between Russia and Ukraine, which officially exercise joint command over it. The fleet was to have been divided into two equal parts under a 1992 accord but this has been delayed due to reluctance by the mainly Russian officer corps to be under Ukrainian command. Ukraine has also said it would give up its half of the fleet in lieu of payment of its multi-billion dollar debt to Russia, but this plan also has so far not been implemented. Bijan said Ukrainian servicemen were "breaking Ukrainian law" by serving in the fleet, but gave no further explanation. Separately, Ukraine agreed Tuesday to pay back its huge debt for gas deliveries with cash payments and by offering to Russia part ownership of pipelines and other facilities on its territory, officials said here. The head of Russia's giant Gazprom company, Rem Vyakhirev, said following talks here with a Ukrainian delegation that Kiev would pay 600 million dollars by June. Ukrainian Deputy Premier Valentin Landik said that Kiev would privatise gas pipelines, port facilities in Odessa and other installations to allow Gazprom to buy stock in the newly-privatised companies. Details of the plan however have yet to be hammered out and the two sides agreed to establish working groups to determine how the shared ownership would be implemented. Russia and Ukraine have been at odds over payment for gas deliveries and the dispute forced Moscow drastically to cut the gas flow to Ukraine in March. Gazprom has maintained that part ownership of the pipelines would allow it better to control deliveries to its European clients including France, Italy and Germany.
