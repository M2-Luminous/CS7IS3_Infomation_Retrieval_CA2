P. Kirsanov, A. V. Solovyev; UDC 629.7.05:519.2] [Abstract] This article presents an aircraft navigation method using reference points. The method makes it possible to reduce the volume of cartographic information stored in on-board memory. The method is based on analysis and comparison of the mutual positions and distances between reference points in a fragment of the field observed by sensors and a reference map. This approach is similar to a person finding his location by identifying known constellations whose position in the sky depends on time and the location of the observer. The set of observed reference points and the map are described by special graphs, and the comparison procedure is formalized as finding the maximally isomorphic subgraphs. Results of mathematical modeling are described and the accuracy of the method is evaluated. Figures 6; references 6 (Russian).
