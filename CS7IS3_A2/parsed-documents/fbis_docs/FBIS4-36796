[sentence as received] A recent report by the Ministry of Health has showed an alarming rise in mortality rate among Iraqi people, and in particular among children over the past month of April (three and a half years after the imposition of the embargo) in camparison with mortality rate recorded during the same period in 1989 (a year before the imposition of the embargo). The report blamed the rise in mortality rate to the dearth of food and medicine because of the UN-imposed trade sanctions on Iraq. As usual, children are hit hardest by the sanctions. According to the report some 3,119 children under the age of five perished because of diarrhea, pneumonia and malnutrition related diseases in comparison with some 347 children died over the same period in 1989. The Ministry's report attributed the rise in fatalities among children to acute shortages of food and medicine because of the trade sanctions and shortages of clean potable water and breakdown of a number of water-treatment plants in some parts of the country due to the bombing by U.S.-allies aircraft during the war and lack of spare parts for maintenance and repair work. The Ministry's report noted that during April, 1989, a year before the imposition of the sanctions, the number of children struck by malnutrition related diseases was 71, whereas the number of children fatalities over the same period 1994 reached some 1,146 scoring an almost a 1,514 per cent increase. Moreover, the report showed that diarrhea has claimed the lives of 122 children under the age of five over the month of April 1989 in comparison with some 940 deaths recorded during the same period in 1994, that is some 670.5 per cent increase. Likewise, the number of children fatalities because of penumonia during April 1994 recorded a sharp increase of 570.8 per cent, the report pointed out, indicating that the number of deaths registered during April 1989 was 154 in comparison with some 1,033 deaths for the same period in 1994. As for patients who suffer from chronic disease, the report noted that hypertension, diabetes and malignant neoplasms were the main causes of the death of 1,455 compared with some 454 deaths registered over the same period in 1989. According to the Ministry's report, some 105 people died because of hypertension over the month of April, 1989 in comparison with 401 who died over the same period in 1994, recording an increase of 281.9 per cent over 1989's figure. In the meantime, fatalities caused by diabetes have registered a sharp rise in April 1994, said the report, noting that some 272 people have died over the month of April 1994 compared with some 92 ones for the same period in 1989, scoring an increase of 195.65 per cent over 1989's figure. According to the report, some 783 people who suffer from malignant neoplames have died during April 1994 compared with some 257 ones died over the same period in 1989. The cause of the sharp rise in deaths among patients who suffer from cancer is blamed on the inadequate radio therapy received by the patients as a result of dearth of medicine caused by the embargo. According to an earlier report by the nuclear and radioactive therapy hospital, the hospital's departments face sharp shortages of chemical and hormone medicines. The absence of cobalt radioactive element needed for the treatment of malignant tumours has hit plans to care for people in bad need for radio therapy.
