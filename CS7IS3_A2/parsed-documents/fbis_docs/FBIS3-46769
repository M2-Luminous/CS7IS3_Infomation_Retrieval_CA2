[Wimon] You have to ask my superior, not me, because he can tell you what will happen in the reshuffle. I will not tell you what I have in my mind. No matter who becomes the new commander, he will do what I have been doing, and even better. I believe that the younger generations must be better than the old. I can prove this statement. In ancient times, people lived in caves. Now people live in houses. If the younger generations were not better than their elders, people would probably be living in holes in the ground. Personally speaking, I do not agree with one person holding two positions. [THAI RAT] You have always stressed mutual affection and solidarity, but many people are still suspicious of soldiers. What type of image do you want soldiers to have? [Wimon] I believe in the old saying: "Distance tests a horse's strength; time proves a man's heart." I have been doing my best, and those who distrust me will one day understand. We cannot force others to agree with us, because we have a democratic system. Everyone has his own views. Anyone with a fair and unbiased mind can tell whether I have done right or wrong. I have the answer for myself and my subordinates because what I have done is based on my own judgment. I am not disturbed by what other people think about me. But I am hurt when someone criticizes my institution instead of me. That is unfair, because the military institution belongs to the people of the whole Kingdom. Everyone wants it to be strong so it can defend our national independence and sovereignty. I welcome suggestions and criticisms regarding my performance. I will not hesitate, however, to counter any unconstructive criticisms that are aimed at sowing discord within the institution. I feel it is my responsibility. I must do my best. [THAI RAT] You used to say that if the military is hit too hard, the soldiers might not be able to tolerate it. [Wimon] I have not said this. I can tolerate it. But if others cannot, violence can occur. By violence, I do not mean that I will bring the soldiers out to do this or that. Violence can take the form of lawsuits. If those who have been hurt do not feel that they have been given justice, however, they may resort to other means of violence, such as dark influences, physical assault, or killing. I do not want to see that happen. Misinterpretation has damaged the military. They even say that the military is about to stage a coup. That is untrue. Why should I do that? I do not want power. I do not want to grow bigger than I am now. I graduated from the military academy to build up the Army. [THAI RAT] You have declared that you will not get involved in politics. How sure are you that your subordinates agree with your firm stand? [Wimon] I believe that every unit commander believes in democracy. We must admit that everyone loves the country. Every soldier has been taught to love democracy. Elections are not the sole ingredient of a democracy. There are many other factors involved. I can reaffirm that in this new era the soldiers are more democratic than some of the people preaching democracy. [THAI RAT] How are the current relations between the military and the government? [Wimon] I say very good, because the soldiers and the government are each doing their duty without interfering in each other's work. We receive and implement the policies the government has presented to National Assembly. The working relations between the government and the military are excellent; no problem at all. The government has never interfered with us. The government gives us their policies and we implement them for the sake of national security. Soldiers always comply with the government's policies. The government does not interfere with the promotion or transfer of sergeants or sub-lieutenants. Politicians find it unnecessary to interfere in these matters. I believe that we must work faithfully and honestly. Wrongdoers must be condemned, while those who do right must be respected. For the survival of our nation, we must not practice favoritism or think only of our personal gain. [THAI RAT] Many people say that military support for this government is based on your personal relations with the prime minister. [Wimon] As a matter of fact, it is the duty of the armed forces to support the government. Regardless of who is prime minister, the armed forces must comply with the government's policies. Prime Minister Chuan is doing his duty. He is a clean and honest man. I am also doing my duty. If what I have done brings stability to the government, then it is right. This is the duty of soldiers under a democratic system. I would do the same regardless of who heads the government. [THAI RAT] How is the Army's image since the May incident? [Wimon] As Army commander, I believe that unity is the foundation of success. If we do not join our mental and physical efforts, there will be no unity in the Army. When I was first appointed Army commander, I announced my top priority was to consolidate my subordinates so that they could make joint efforts to serve the country. At this stage, I am very proud to say that affection and unity prevails in the Army beyond my expectations. The second task is to instill among Army personnel the consciousness of serving the country and people at all costs. I am proud of being Army commander and of the sincerity and affection I have received. My success in the performance of my duty must be evaluated by the general public and mass media.
