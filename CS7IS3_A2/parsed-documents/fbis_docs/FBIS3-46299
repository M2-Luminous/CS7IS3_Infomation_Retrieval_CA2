The economic development plan, which was submitted by the State Council to the Political Bureau of the party Central Committee for discussion on the basis of deliberations at the end of 1993, has the following main contents: The GNP growth rate will be set at about 9 percent, that of total industrial output value at about 15 percent, and that of total agricultural output value at about 3.5 percent. Investment in fixed assets throughout society is set to be 1,300 billion yuan. In import and export trade, goods worth $100 billion will be imported, while the same value of goods will be exported. Society's retail price index is set to be in the range of 10 percent. Moreover, arrangements on the quantity of currency issued and the loans scale for 1994 have been made. Growth rates in the economic plan for 1994 have been readjusted from 13 percent GNP growth and 22 percent growth in total industrial output value in 1993. The top central leadership have deemed the above-mentioned readjustments necessary. This is the concrete embodiment of the idea of grasping opportunity, promoting development, keeping a sober mind, and squarely facing problems cropping up in the course of advancement, which the central authorities have repeatedly stressed. Only in this way can sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development be maintained. The top leadership maintain that in the second half of 1992, the central authorities urged guarding against overheated economic development, and, in July 1993, the central authorities again made a decision to strengthen macroregulation and control of the national economy. These policy decisions were made to counter difficulties in economic work. If they had not been promptly made, an economic situation such as that in the second half of 1988 would have occurred or there would have been big ups and downs, as Deng Xiaoping stated, and tremendous losses would have been incurred. Thanks to several months of efforts, positive results have been achieved in macroregulation and control as one may well say and big fluctuations have been rigorously brought under control. As a result, the economy has maintained a relatively good momentum of development and the international community has given quite a favorable response to China's macroregulation and control efforts. The Chinese economy grew by 13 percent in 1992 and its GNP topped the 3,000 billion yuan mark in 1993, or another rise of 13 percent from 1992 in terms of constant prices. After the economy grew at a rate of 13 percent for two consecutive years, the conditions for economic growth in some aspects have been strained and the restraining role of "bottlenecks" and inflationary pressures had begun to build up gradually. Moreover, we have to create conditions for maintaining rapid growth in the years to come. Compared with previous years, the greatest number of reform measures will be introduced in 1994, the tasks of reform will be the heaviest, and the widest range of interests of various sections will be affected. The top leadership holds that in making plans for economic work, we must give consideration to reform, development, and social stability. Plans should not be too rigid. We must create more favorable conditions for accelerating reform. Therefore, the central authorities set a 9 percent growth rate, a rapid growth rate with an appropriate margin left for unforeseen circumstances, as General Secretary Jiang Zemin put it. The authoritative source stressed that the central authorities set a 9 percent growth rate in terms of the national situation. When its comes to the economically developed eastern coastal regions where conditions are quite good, the central leadership urged them to make full use of their own favorable conditions and existing foundations for development and to develop a little faster if conditions permit so as to bring along and promote the development of less developed regions. If regions with relatively poor foundations for development cannot achieve such growth rates, they should not necessarily feel pressured. We must proceed in all cases from actual conditions and forge ahead steadily and surely.
