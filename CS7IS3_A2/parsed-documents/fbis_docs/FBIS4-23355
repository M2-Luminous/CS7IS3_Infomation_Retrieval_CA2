That's what police searching for illegal firearms in a Turffontein, Johannesburg house came across early on Thursday [2 June] evening. SA Police Services [SAPS] spokesman Capt Wikus Weber said members of the Vaal Triangle firearm unit, following up on leads, went to the Turffontein property. The officers found firearms -- "but they turned out to be legal". What wasn't so legal, though, was a pile of counterfeit us dollars big enough to make even your bank manager drool -- three million hundred dollar notes. Police also took possession of printing apparatus and placed under arrest a 60-year-old man who would probably appear in court on Friday, the SAPS spokesman said.
