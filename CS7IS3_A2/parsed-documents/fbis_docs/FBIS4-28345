In the meeting, the two governments agreed to make mutual efforts to settle at an early date the issue of Russia's delay in repaying debts in trade with Japan. Russia's trade debts have become a stumbling block to the promotion of trade between Japan and Russia. In the meeting, the Japanese delegates reaffirmed its proposal made by then Foreign Minister Hata in March that Japan will invite Russian leaders -- in the position of deputy prime minister or the equivalent -- to Japan. The two countries agreed to coordinate the scheduling of a visit by Russian leaders through diplomatic channels. The meeting was attended by representatives from the ministries concerned of the two nations. The Japanese delegates were led by Deputy Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Hayashi while the Russian side was headed by First Deputy Minister Phratokov [as published] of the Foreign Economic Relations Ministry.
