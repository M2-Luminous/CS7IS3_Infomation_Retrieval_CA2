The headquarters of the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) in east Kigali came under heavy fire from government forces, said Abdul Kabia, executive director of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR). The rebels returned fire from different parts of the capital, targeting a military camp in the south-east and other government positions in the south, said Kabia, speaking by telephone from Kigali. An international official in Kigali said the rebels, surrounding Kigali, "could take the city any time they want." RPF chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe and the interim government's Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura meanwhile held separate talks with Tanzanian mediators and UN officials in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha, a UN official said. UN envoy to Rwanda Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh said he would try to persuade the rebels to open face-to-face talks with the interim government, which they do not recognise. But Tanzanian officials said they were "not optimistic" that the rebels would agree to talk with the government, which they have branded "a clique of killers." The rebels said earlier that their leaders' mission in Arusha was limited to briefing Tanzanian officials on their position in the Rwandan conflict. But the rebels have agreed to meet military officers to discuss ways of halting the carnage in Rwanda, which has cost more than 100,000 lives since the death of president Juvenal Habyarimana in an April 6 rocket attack on his plane rekindled the war and plunged the tiny central African country into chaos. "We hope that the military men in both delegations will agree to meet," Booh-Booh told AFP by telephone. Ten days ago Tanzania failed to organise an earlier round of talks, also in Arusha where the rebels and government signed peace accords last August to end a three-year civil war. Rwanda's bloodbath has sparked a massive refugee exodus. Between a quarter and half a million Rwandans poured across the border to Tanzania last week. The rebels are mainly from the minority Tutsi tribe which has borne the brunt of the slaughter, while the government is predominantly from the majority Hutu group. Refugees in Tanzania said both government forces and rebels had massacred civilians. UN troops trying to evacuate about 300 terrified Rwandan civilians from a Kigali hotel were delayed by mortar fire and small arms exchanges, Kabia said. The civilians, mainly Tutsis, had been pinned down for weeks by fighting. UN soldiers evacuated 11 foreigners from Kigali to the Kenyan capital Nairobi on Monday. Most foreigners were evacuated weeks ago. UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali meanwhile stepped up his campaign to persuade African nations to send a large peacekeeping force to Rwanda, diplomats said. The United States, which has pledged 15 million dollars in aid for Rwanda, says it will also help finance an international military intervention. But no Western countries have offered troops. The United Nations slashed its force in Rwanda from 2,500 to 270 last month after 10 Belgian peacekeepers were killed.
