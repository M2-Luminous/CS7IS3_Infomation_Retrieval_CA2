This was disclosed by his brother Datuk Jeffrey Kitingan, who is the Parti Bersatu Sabah, PBS, [Sabah United Party] assemblyman for Bingkor. Datuk Jeffrey said he will inform Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and his deputy, Datuk Sri Anwar Ibrahim, of the offer in a special meeting tonight. Datuk Jeffrey was speaking to reporters at the open house hosted by Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir at Sri Perdana [prime minister's official residence] today. The three Parti Bersatu Sabah assemblymen who quit the party last Saturday lodged a police report against Chief Minister Datuk Joseph Pairin Kitingan and two others at the Bukit Aman Federal Police Headquarters early this morning. UMNO [United Malays National Organization] information chief, Haji Karim Zain, said the report by the trio -- Datuk Lajim Ukin, Rubin Balang, and Datuk Zainal Ishak -- alleged fraud against Datuk Pairin, State Assembly Speaker Datuk Haji Hasan Alban Sandukan, and Assembly Secretary Datuk Francis Yap in respect of their update undated resignation letters as state assemblymen. In their reports, lodged in about 1:45 AM, they denied that they had consented or given approval that their letters be submitted or that they had instructed anybody to put a date to the letters and submit them to the state assembly. The three assemblymen also asked police to investigate their case and to take appropriate action. They were accompanied by two lawyers when making the police report. The three state assemblymen announced their resignation from PBS to throw their support behind Barisan Nasional [National Front] last Saturday. They issued a statutory declaration stating that all documents or letters signed by them -- whether dated or undated -- pertaining to their resignation from the state assembly were null and void. Hours after the announcement which put Datuk Pairin's three-week-old state government in jeopardy, Datuk Yap announced that the trio had resigned from the state assembly and that by-elections would be called.
