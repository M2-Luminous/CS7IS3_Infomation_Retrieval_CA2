FR940930-0-00033 FR940930-0-00006 PART 778_[AMENDED] 3. Section 778.7 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1) and (d)(1) to read as follows: §778.7 Equipment and related technical data used in the design, development, production or use of missiles. * * * * * (a) *␣*␣* (1) Items subject to missile delivery systems controls. The items that require a validated license because they are subject to foreign policy controls on missile delivery systems are contained within ECCNs designated by ``MT'' in the Reason for Control paragraph. Exporters should consult that paragraph in each ECCN to determine the specific item subject to these foreign policy controls. * * * * * (d) Licensing policy. (1) Applications to export the items will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export would make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles. Applications for exports of items controlled for MT by CCL category 7A or by ECCN 9A21 will be considered more favorably if such exports are determined to be destined to a manned aircraft, satellite, land vehicle or marine vessel, in quantities appropriate for replacement parts for such applications. When an export is deemed to make a material contribution to the proliferation of missiles, the license will be denied. * * * * * 4.
