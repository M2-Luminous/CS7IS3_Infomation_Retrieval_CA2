Regarding the CPC top echelon, this popular figure represents a "state secret" unknown to the man in the street. For a long time, the CPC has been fond of using number codes to name some sensitive departments. The full name of this "106" is the "106 Work Office," which was founded on 6 October to specialize in collecting, studying and analyzing the conditions of personages from political, military economic and monetary circles of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, report to the State Council and the Central Military Commission, and set out specific strategies, principles, and policies toward Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao. Branches Will Be Set Up in 16 Cities At a time when Hong Kong and Macao are to be returned to China soon, and Taiwan's political situation is in turbulence, it is unusual for the CPC to have founded the "106 Work Office." The "106 Work Office" is ready to expand in a big way in the near future. When it was first founded, the office was set inside the People's Liberation Army Headquarters of the General Staff Political Department in west suburban Beijing, and moved to the Jingxi Guest House in early December; however, the actual place for its work were at some barracks under Guangdong Military Region in Conghua and the Shanghai Garrison Command in west suburban Shanghai. Besides, branches or teams were set up in late November last year in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Haikou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, Zhuhai, Nanjing, Chongqing, Wuhan, Lianyungang, Qingdao, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Dalian, and Shenzhen; these offices were all set up at local military or garrison commands. But nobody should believe that the "106 Work Office" was conducting mysterious "underground activities," for it has already conducted open and above board activities. It was learned that the "106 Work Office" was operating under the names of the Office for Taiwan Affairs, the ARATS Office, the office of research, the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, or the State Council General Office in work concerning external affairs. "106 Work Office" Is To Focus Its Efforts on Taiwan Because of the considerably important role of the "106 Work Office," the CPC top-echelon paid great attention to it as soon as it was established, equiped with the most efficient personnel. On 7 December last year, the State Council, the Central Committee,and the Central Military Commission called a meeting at Beijing's Jingxi Guest House, and ceremoniously announced that the "106 Work Office" had began work in a comprehensive way; Li Peng and Liu Huaqing attended the meeting and delivered speeches. Liu Huaqing's speech was noteworthy, in that he acknowledged that the "106 Work Office" would devote its energy and efforts to Taiwan affairs, and was a work department which would offer suggestions to the top echelon of the central authorities in resolving the Taiwan issue; thus it must consist of the cream from the party, government, and military departments. Liu Huaqing indicated that the core and most arduous job today is Taiwan; that being the case, the "106" must focus most of its energy on doing work concerning Taiwan. Liu Huaqing stressed that the "106 Work Office" was not a provisional work organization, but would probably exist for 10 or 15 years and even longer; but perhaps it would not last 10 years, or 5 years; in a nutshell, it would all depend on the development of the situation and changes in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Personnel Are the "Cream of Party, Government and Military Departments" Viewing the personnel of the "106 Work Office," they are really up to Liu Huaqing's requirement in his speech, namely the "cream from the party, government, and military departments": Its director is Zou Jiahua, and deputy directors are Ding Wenchang, Tao Siju, and Jia Chunwang. The office is comprised of five groups: liaison, research, intelligence, coordination, and economic groups. The major personnel were all selected from the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Defense, the University of Science and Technology for National Defense, the Office for Affairs of Taiwan Affairs, the Office for Affairs of Hong Kong and Macao, the Department of United Front Work, the Ministry of State Security, the Central Committee policy research center, the Guangzhou Military Region, the Nanjing Military Region, and the Air Force, with 70-some basic members, who were all cadres at and above department level. Besides, the CPC gave the green light to the financial needs of "106 Work Office." A source from the State Council said that Li Peng and Zhu Rongji approved a first allotment of 280 million yuan to the "106 work office" for its preparations.
