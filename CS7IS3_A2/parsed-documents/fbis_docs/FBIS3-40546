(Nobuhiko Kawamoto, president) and Ovonic Battery Co. (OBC, headquartered in Michigan), a U.S. venture company that produces electronic and electrical parts, have agreed on the joint development of a next-generation battery for electric vehicles and concluded a development contract. This is the first time automobile-related Japanese and U.S. corporations have joined hands to develop a next-generation battery for electric vehicles. Based on this contract, Honda will begin development of a practical battery based on the nickel-hydrogen battery on which OBC has been conducting research and development has over twice the storage capacity and durability of conventional batteries, development of a low-cost battery is envisioned at the time of its placement on board electric vehicles. In addition, because the battery does not include any lead or cadmium components, it is said to have the merit of being able to avoid secondary environmental pollution. The contract specifies that OBC will devise the design specs--based on the next-generation battery that the company has developed--for mounting in the electric vehicles that Honda is currently developing, then develop a prototype. Honda will mount the battery in its electric vehicles currently under use. Regarding the contract, Honda, in addition to procuring a prototype battery from OBC for research, test production, and testing, will pursue technology exchange. Honda is paying OBC approximately Â¥150 million for the next-generation battery technology. With California--due to the problem of environmental protection--introducing regulations by 1998 mandating that two percent of all vehicles sold there emit no exhaust gases, the development of electric vehicles is becoming hurried. But the development of high-performance batteries has become the major prerequisite for that. Amidst such developments, Honda is strengthening its development capabilities in environmental-protection vehicles by joining hands with a U.S. venture company with strength in a future field of technology. OBC, a venture company that excels in new materials development and chemical synthesis R&D, is a member of the Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) group of companies. With former General Motors chairman and chief executive officer Stempel recently becoming chairman of ECD, the parent company, the group is said to be strengthening its capabilities related to automobiles.
