FBIS4-53525 "dreas098__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-098-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX North Korea Kim Il-song Interview on Nuclear Issue Reported Kim Il-song Interview on Nuclear Issue Reported Comments Assessed OW1905064094 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database in Japanese 19 May 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1905064094 Tokyo Nikkei Telecom Database Japanese BFN [From ASAHI SHIMBUN 19 May Morning Edition] [Text] DRPK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song recently gave an interview to Korean-American journalist Mun Myong-cha, in which he said that the United States and the ROK are "trying to corner" North Korea on the nuclear issue, and strongly criticized moves to get the UN Security Council to impose economic sanctions. Kim expressed a desire to resume high-level negotiations between the United States and North Korea. He also indicated a willingness to reopen negotiations with Japan on the normalization of relations, saying: "No matter who the prime minister is, the door is always open." The interview was conducted at the presidential palace in Pyongyang on 21 April. Moon revealed the contents of the interview to an ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter in Tokyo before he actually publishes the story in U.S. ASIA NEWS, for which he works as chief editor. Kim said during the interview that if North Korea has the capability to manufacture nuclear arms, it would not bother to hold a dialogue with the United States. He thus reiterated his denial of allegations about the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons. Kim also disclosed that during high-level U.S.-DPRK talks last year, the United States pledged to provide assistance, including financial aid, to help the DPRK shift to light-water reactors which produce very little plutonium. This is believed to be an indication of the DRPK's bargaining position as it tries to eliminate suspicions about its development of nuclear arms and seeks economic reconstruction through negotiations with the United States. Normalization talks between Japan and the DPRK have been suspended since the eighth round held in 1992. Kim reportedly stressed that "whatever happens to the Japanese political situation, our position remains unchanged." Both sides consider the joint communique on early establishment of diplomatic relations (in 1990) between the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and Social Democratic of Japan, and the Korean Workers' Party to be practically null and void once the non-LDP coalition government came to power. Kim's remarks at the interview are seen as an attempt to prevent the DPRK's isolation over the nuclear issue, and to undercut cooperation between Japan, the United States, and the ROK. However, recently, there have also been behind-the-scenes moves on the part of North Korea to urge Japan to resume normalization talks. The Japanese Government will now have to seek ways to resolve this situation while also taking developments in the U.S.-DPRK dialogue into consideration.
