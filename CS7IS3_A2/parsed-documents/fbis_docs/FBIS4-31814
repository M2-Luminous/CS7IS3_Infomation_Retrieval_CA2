Dragoljub Stankic reports: [Stankic] It is positive that the truce is being observed, but many issues remain open, Vojislav Kostunica said. The acceptance of the proposed delineation and the 51-49 percent division is connected with other formulas, above all the quality of the territory that is being offered. According to Kostunica, the issue of the Serbian access to the sea, the width of the so-called corridor through the Sava basin region, the gray zones, and so forth are still contentious. Kostunica said that despite all this there are many reasons for optimism while waiting for the final denouement. If the future of the Muslim-Croatian federation is seen in a joint state with Croatia, then, Kostunica said, many contentious issues on the Serbian side will be solved much faster if the Srpska republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia become one state.
