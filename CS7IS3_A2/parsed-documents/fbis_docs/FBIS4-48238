FBIS4-48238 "drafr094_c_94014" FBIS-AFR-94-094 Daily Report 16 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 16 May South African Press Review for 16 May MB1605120894 MB1605120894 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR PWV Provincial Cabinet Viewed -- "The ANC, entitled to seven out of 10 portfolios in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], has retained the real heavy-weight positions," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 16 May in a page 10 editorial. "It is clear that Premier Tokyo Sexwale has borne in mind the party's allies -- Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions] and the SACP [South African Communist Party] -- as well as SANCO [South African National Civics Organization] in constituting his cabinet." These men are apartheid survivors, "but their single-minded involvement in the struggle against apartheid has a down side when it comes to assuming the reins of power. Few have had either the training or the necessary experience of formal, specialised administration which would assist them in the task ahead." The move to provide "strategic management teams" to support Cabinet ministers is welcomed, but delivering on election promises is what will make or break the government. BUSINESS DAY Budget Priorities for New Government -- "This week one of the toughest tasks of government begins in earnest -- finalising the settling of spending priorities ahead of next month's national budget," states the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 May in a page 12 editorial. ANC economic officials want to be judged by the 1995/96 budget, but the 94/95 budget "will nevertheless provide some early indications of what is to come." The rest of the editorial questions whether Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo is "equipped" to coordinate the Reconstruction and Development Program with other ministers. Democratic Party's "Devastating Blow" in Election -- "Despite the support of the bulk of the English language Press, the Democratic Party [DP] was comprehensively rejected at the polls," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 May in a page 12 editorial. "It was a devastating blow to a party that so often stood alone in its dedication to democracy itself. It played an important role, not only in opposing apartheid in the dark years but in championing the rights of the individual in the shaping of the interim constitution. Yet it was defeated by what DP chairman Ken Andrew correctly described as the forces of history -- the ANC and the National Party." Continuing the editorial states that "there is no reason why it should not establish itself again as a voice commanding respect." "Zach de Beer's departure gives the party the chance to make a fresh start."
