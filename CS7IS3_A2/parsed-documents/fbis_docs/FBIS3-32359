The leaders stated that they will continue to support the coffee-producing countries' efforts to permanently upgrade the bean's international prices. Regarding their bilateral relations, the heads of state agreed to continue working to establish the Colombian-Salvadoran Commission on 24 and 25 February in San Salvador. This commission will allow them to formulate an effective cooperation program. Gaviria and Cristiani will request that the commission gear its work toward reaching an agreement on judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance issues "so as to establish a common front to counter all kinds of criminal organizations," in reference to drug-trafficking activities. The leaders agreed that factors, such as extreme poverty, persist and negatively hinder their countries' possibilities to achieve the desired socioeconomic development. In this respect, they expressed their support for preparation of the Social Development World Summit to be held in Denmark in March 1995. The presidents stated their conviction that full respect for human rights and basic liberties are an essential part of all democratic systems and praised the efforts made by their administrations in this respect. The presidents underscored the importance of the Uruguayan Round negotiations and of the free trade agreement implementation between Mexico, the United States, and Canada on international trade. They also reaffirmed their decision to continue strengthening the solidarity and cooperation between their countries, which are fundamental to confronting the world's challenges and requirements.
