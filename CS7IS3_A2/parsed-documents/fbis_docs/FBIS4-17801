This is contained in a statement adopted today by an overwhelming majority of votes -- 239 in favor, 11 against, and four abstaining -- in connection with the murder of State Duma Deputy Andrey Ayzderdzis. This crime, opine the authors of the document, should spark resolute measures to combat crime. Deputies think that the government and law and order protection bodies are failing to take effective action to stop the criminal encroachment against citizens "which threatens not just the lives of individuals, but the very existence of Russian statehood."
