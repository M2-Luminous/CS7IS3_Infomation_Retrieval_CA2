De Leon thus countered newspaper reports of a split in the Army created by peace talks between the government and guerrillas. Rumor has it that the Army has split into three factions: the first being the military personnel who were removed following the self-inflicted coup attempt by the later deposed President Jorge Serrano in 1993, the second being the "hard-liners," and the third being those who support institutional rule. According to SIGLO VEINTIUNO, the "hard-liners" oppose talks with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Alliance [URNG] and support the president, but only on certain conditions. The newspaper says those military personnel are willing to join the removed officers to resume armed field actions against the guerrillas if the government gets the United Nations more involved in the peace talks. According to an agreement signed between the guerrillas and the government in Mexico on 10 January, the United Nations will moderate the peace talks, which are scheduled to resume early in March. The president labeled the reports as false and added: "I am not worried about rumors. I am convinced that the officers are aware of the role they play in the democratic process. There could be differences of opinion, but no division." De Leon said the Army feels fully responsible for the country's institutional order. The president spoke at the Main Square in front of the government building shortly before meeting with Monsignor Prospero Penados del Barrio, Archbishop of Guatemala. De Leon said the Archbishop's visit was of a personal nature, although they would also discuss subjects related to the country's political, economic, and social crisis. Defense Minister General Mario Rene Enriquez has also reiterated the Army's support for peace talks but opposed the creation of a truth commission to investigate human rights violations perpetrated since armed conflict began in 1960. De Leon said discussions on human rights with URNG will have to include all related aspects, but he declined to give any additional details. Finally, Gen. Enriquez said the Armed Forces object to the creation of a truth commission because it would disregard the Army and would polarize rather than assuage the population.
