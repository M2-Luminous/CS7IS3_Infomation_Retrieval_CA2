"Although I can invoke my authority to call a general election even under the current multiseat constituency system still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested under the new system," Hata said. Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Although the Diet legislated in January a package of electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system for the 511- member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional representation, it requires the passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the single-seat system. At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates. Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has been reduced to a minority government." However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to firmly establish the (single-seat) system." "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in various elections," he said.
