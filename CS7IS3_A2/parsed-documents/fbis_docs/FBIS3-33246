According to police, the clandestine groups of Medellin's outskirts, linked to the National Guerrilla Coordinating Board [CNG], claimed responsibility for the attacks because they regard the peace negotiations between the government and a similar group, the People's Militia, as "treason." Carlos Gottberg Riveros, Venezuelan consul to Medellin, said that although he does not know the reason for the attack, "it could have something to do with the subversives' interest in creating confusion in the city. My first impression is one of surprise because we live in a friendly country. Many Colombians live peacefully in Venezuela and many Venezuelans live in Colombia in stability and respect." The bomb attacks only caused damage, estimated at some $30,000. The worst damage was sustained by the Venezuelan consulate, located in the Manrique-Rosales neighborhood, in the western part of Medellin. The Bolivarian Militia of Medellin believe the negotiations between the Colombian Government and the People's Militia "are an unconditional surrender." The attacks perpetrated in Medellin are part of a wave of CNG attacks throughout the country, including the kidnapping of two parliamentarians and one mayor as well as clashes with policemen and soldiers in the outskirts of Santa Fe de Bogota.
