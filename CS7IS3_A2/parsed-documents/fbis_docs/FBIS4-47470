Andriyevskiy [New Chemical Problems Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, (Chernogolovka)] under the ``Research Methods and Properties of Powder Materials rubric''; received May 12,1993; UDC 539.2:620.7.018.45] [Abstract] The article attempts to summarize information on physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties of nanocrystalline refractory compounds (RCs), mainly powder nanocrystalline materials (NMs) carbides, borides, nitrides, oxides etc. in consolidated state. Data on film NMs are provided for comparison. Data on hardness, which is among the most well studied characteristics, are presented, along with manufacturing methods, and analyzed. Residual porosity affects hardness: a 5% TRiTchange of porosity changes its hardness by almost 50%. Hardness also depends on grain size. There is a real possibility of creating new superhard materials based on nanocrystalline RCs, but it is necessary to find a reasonable consolidation methods that will make it possible to obtain NMs with the optimum grain size. The failure mechanism of such materials remains virtually unknown. Information of the nature of grain TRvTboundaries in NMs is mainly available for TiOCCDDCC2DD. The boundaries are similar to those in regular large grain materials. One of the most interesting characteristics of refractory compounds based NMs is their superductility, but studies of this phenomenon are in a rudimentary state. Data on properties of nanocomposites have appeared in literature. Few works deal with physical and physico-chemical properties of RCs in nanocrystalline state. Among possible new applications of nanocrystalline RCs is the technology of nanocrystalline hard alloys WCCo with high hardness and wear resistance for making microtomes and other critical products. It is concluded that only first steps have been made in studying properties of refractory compounds based NMs. Figures 3, tables 2, references 52: 21 Russian, 31 Western.
