Emphasizing that the NDH [Independent State of Croatia] had extraordinary significance for the Croatian people, which gained its own state after 830 years, Prkacin emphasized that how 10 April was treated today was very important, because Croatia was in the most unfavorable position of all the newly independent states, since it controlled the least of its own territory, and to a considerable extent the international community was deciding its future. "The key thing is whether Croatia will occupy a place among the countries of Western civilization, or whether it will stop half way and resemble the South American banana republics," said Prkacin, recalling that the NDH disappeared because of the new world order, but also because of the romanticism of the Croatian communists who are called antifascists today, and he emphasized that certain lessons should be learned from 10 April, because the NDH knew who its friends were and who its enemies were. Tomislav Opacak, member of the HSP's Headquarters, presented a report on the subject of "The Truth About 10 April and the NDH," asserting that the NDH was the result of the will of the Croatian people, and not of Italy and Germany. "The Croatian people's struggle was a necessary defense," Opacak said, emphasizing that the Ustasha movement was not anti-Semitic, since there were Jews among high NDH officials, and he concluded the report with the words: "As long as there is no deed without a defect, we cannot blink over an action like the NDH and 10 April."
