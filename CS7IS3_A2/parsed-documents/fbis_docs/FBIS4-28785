FBIS4-28785 "dreas114_m_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-114 Daily Report 14 Jun 1994 Thailand Dailies View Current Political Tension Dailies View Current Political Tension BK1406103194 BK1406103194 BFN [Editorial Report] The 14 June issues of four Thai dailies -- SIAM RAT, THAI RAT, MATICHON and NAEO NA -- carry editorials on the current political situation, which has arisen from the demand for constitutional reform by hunger striker Chalat Worachat and his supporters and detractors both in and outside parliament. Bangkok SIAM RAT in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word editorial, entitled: "Tackle the Political Crisis." It says: "The call for constitutional reform initiated by Chalat Worachat by staging a hunger strike has evolved into a call for political reform. Chalat himself is probably surprised by the way things have developed, which are different from his four original demands. However, it appears that Chalat has no objection to the new development." The editorial concludes: "The current political crisis should develop in a direction that benefits society and the country as a whole, not any particular group or political party." Bangkok NAEO NA in Thai on page 3 carries a 600-word editorial, entitled: "Dissolve the Parliament." The editorial says: "The current political situation has gone beyond Chalat's hunger strike since organizations for democracy and academics have joined the campaign for political reform." The dispute within the Phalang Tham Party over whether to support the campaign "could result in the party withdrawing itself from the coalition government. The resulting political crisis could lead to a clash between mobs of the opposite sides and a blood bath as Dr. Prawet Wasi warned earlier. This situation could be exploited by certain groups to seize power. Therefore, the best solution is to forget pride and dissolve the parliament in order to return power to the people to avoid such a seizure of power." Bangkok MATICHON in Thai on page 2 carries a 700-word editorial, which is entitled: "Open and Sincere." It says: "The differences of ideas triggered by Chalat Worachat's hunger strike have increasingly widened. A cause for this development is the inflexible position of the government leader and his political party. Another cause is probably the confusion over the numerous proposals by various sides on how to solve the issue. The unclear positions of the various coalition parties, which try to conceal their stands to gain political advantage, are also to blame." The editorial concludes: "In this situation, we appeal to all sides which are carrying on political activities to do so openly and appropriately inform the public. Do not conceal these activities to gain political advantage. Only sincerity and determination will help relieve the current situation. In particular, the government leader, who is responsible for what happens in the country, promptly must play his role. He cannot just cling firmly to his stand regardless of how the situation may develop. The question, which the government must answer, is: What must be done to solve the situation peacefully? The question is no longer about who is right and who is wrong." Bangkok THAI RAT in Thai carries a 700-word editorial on page 3 entitled: "To The Democrat Party." The editorial says: "The political situation has reached the point that a decision has to be made. Chalat's demands have received considerable support by democracy-loving groups, although some of them disagreed with the protest method. It is possible to have the House of Representatives form a commission to study or redraft the constitution. Whether or not its recommendations can be put into use is another matter. "To relieve political tension and prevent divisiveness among the government political parties and the situation from worsening any further, we appeal to the prime minister and the Democrat Party to listen to the views of other parties in the coalition government and democracy-loving people. The constitution amendment may not be achieved today, but it is time to start now."
