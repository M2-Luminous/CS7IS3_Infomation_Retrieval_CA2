Hanzel was state secretary in the Justice Ministry under ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's government. "We have to create the right conditions for an independent judiciary, and to safeguard its function financially," Hanzel said. The problems of courts which had no money for electricity and stamps had to be solved immediately, he said. "However, the lack of finances in the judiciary should not be connected with the pay of judges," Hanzel said, adding that he believed that judges' pay was commensurate with that of other civil servants. Hanzel said he did not think that Slovakia needed a law on the protection of the republic, because the protection of the republic and its representatives was sufficiently assured by the the legal code. He announced himself in favour of abolishing Articles 102 and 103 of the criminal code, which concern the defamation of the republic and its representatives. New Defense Minister Pavol Kanis said he wanted to carry on with what his predecessor Imrich Andrejcak had successfully managed to do concerning the creation of ties with West European security structures, and also to solve the problems of young men after they entered military service. Kanis is the deputy chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL). He added that he too had taken part in the plans bringing Slovakia nearer to West European structures, so there should not be any problems with continuity regarding the Ministry's previous work. "I do not put my own ideas above the needs of society. Today, however, it is clear to most people that early elections are essential for the calming of society, and these should be held in the autumn at the latest," the new defense minister said, asked if he could imagine staying in his post until 1996 which is when elections would take place normally.
