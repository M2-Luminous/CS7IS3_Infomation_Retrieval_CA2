[Salah] The purpose of the visit is to perform 'umrah [minor pilgrimage] with a delegation from the towns situated inside the Green Line (Israel). It was arranged in coordination with the Jordanian Awqaf Ministry. [passage omitted] [Khashuqji] Let us move to politics. You have participated more than once in local Israeli elections. How were the results with regard to the Islamic tendency? [Salah] Recent local government elections were held on 28 November 1993. The Islamic Movement participated in the elections in several cities and villages in the Arab areas, and with Almighty God's help, the movement was able to win the mayorship in Umm el Fahm, Kafr Qasim, Kafr Bara, Jaljuliya, and Kafr Qari'. It also secured good and satisfactory results -- temporarily -- in Kafr Kanna, Rahit [as transliterated], and some other areas in the city of 'Akko. [passage omitted] [Khashuqji] Was the peace issue and the recent accord included in your election program, and were you forced to talk about it in front of your candidates? [Salah] Actually our position as Muslims has always been clear vis-a-vis the peace issue. Our understanding of a real and just peace is part of Muslims' view in life. This is why we as Muslims always maintain this value and adopt it not as an empty slogan, but as a value of belief that has a truthful, realistic, comprehensive, and just substance. [Khashuqji] Did you talk more clearly about the Gaza-Jericho agreement during the elections? [Salah] Without doubt a position was adopted on this plan. The position was defined through the numerous questions we raised, which have received no responsible answer from any official party. For example, the Gaza-Jericho plan does not answer questions like: What about the fate of holy Jerusalem? No answer. There is no clear official position on this issue. Or about the fate of the Palestinian refugees made homeless in 1948 after their cities and villages were destroyed. [passage omitted] [Khashuqji] But please allow me to ask you: Are you Palestinian or Israeli? [Salah] I say it clearly and openly: I am a Palestinian Arab Muslim living on my land with no charity from anyone. [Khashuqji] Have you been accused of sympathizing with Hamas? [Salah] Yes, there are accusations by some quarters. But we have confirmed our clear and open position: We support Palestinians' rights wherever they are, whether in the West Bank or in the Gaza Strip or beyond these boundaries. Because we consider ourselves an integral part of this people, to whom we are bound by ties of blood, history, and religion. Without doubt this bond is fixed, permanent, and cannot be severed by anyone. So we do not deny our sympathizing and cohesion -- and I am not just saying sympathizing, but also cohesion -- with Palestinian legitimacy -- the legitimacy of the Palestinian people, who have the full and natural right to establish their state and to cling to their capital, holy Jerusalem. We do not hesitate to express our cohesion in many situations. [passage omitted]
