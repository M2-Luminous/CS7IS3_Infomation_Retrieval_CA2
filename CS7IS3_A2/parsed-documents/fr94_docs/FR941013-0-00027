FR941013-0-00027 FR941013-0-00010 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Fiscal Service 31 CFR Part 205 RIN Number 1510&hyph;AA40 Rules and Procedures for Funds Transfers AGENCY: Treasury, Fiscal, Financial Management Service. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This rule amends the regulations implementing the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), as amended, which governs the transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the States under Federal assistance programs. It finalizes without change a previously published interim rule which delayed the date on which the State of New York had to begin the second phase of CMIA implementation. This rulemaking makes no other changes to the CMIA regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rulemaking is effective November 14, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Galligan, (202) 874&hyph;6935. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations at 31 CFR part 205 established a two-stage implementation of the Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 (CMIA), as amended, which governs the transfer of funds between the Federal Government and the States under Federal assistance programs. During the first phase of implementation, only the 20 largest Federal assistance programs were covered by CMIA. From the second year onward, the scope of CMIA expands to cover all ``major Federal assistance programs,'' as defined by the Single Audit Act. This second phase of implementation takes effect at the start of each State's 1995 fiscal year, so that States can introduce the new cash management requirements with a new fiscal year. The State of New York, however, has a unique fiscal year that begins on April 1, which is 3 months prior to the start of the typical State fiscal year on July 1. Hence, New York would be subject to expanded CMIA requirements 3 months before the other States; it would have only 9 months for the first phase of implementation, whereas all other States and territories would have a full year. On March 30, 1994, therefore, the Financial Management Service (FMS) issued an interim rule to amend 31 CFR part 205 and allow New York a full year for the first stage of implementation (59 FR 14753). This interim rule modified the implementation schedule so that no State had to begin the second phase prior to July 1, 1994. It made no other changes to 31 CFR part 205 and affected only New York. It was effective upon publication, but public comment was solicited from all interested parties. The FMS received one comment on the interim rule. The Executive Department of the State of New York wrote to express support for it. Accordingly, the FMS considers it appropriate to adopt the interim rule as a final rule. The purpose of this rulemaking, therefore, is to finalize, without change, the provision contained in the interim rule. Executive Order 12866 It has been determined that this regulation is not a significant regulatory action as defined in E.O. 12866. Therefore, a Regulatory Assessment is not required. Regulatory Flexibility Act Because no notice of proposed rulemaking was required for this rule, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ) do not apply. List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 205 Electronic funds transfer, Grant administration, Grant programs, Intergovernmental relations.
