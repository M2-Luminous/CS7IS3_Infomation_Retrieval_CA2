As I understand it, an "invention" means a special measure under special circumstances. In other words, socialist reform is valuable because it is aimed at emancipating the mind. To develop socialist productive forces, one should not be afraid of adopting some capitalist managerial experience, its technical innovations, and its organizational methods in production. We should not think that this is practicing capitalism, nor should we provoke a controversy over whether what we are doing is of a capitalist or socialist nature, as this could bind reformers hand and foot (to put it more bluntly, this could be as bad as banning and opposing reform). This refers to the repudiation provoked by the leftists in the period after the 4 June incident to 1990, which criticized reform as "retrogressing to capitalism." As a matter of fact, this repudiation was targeted at Deng Xiaoping, therefore some people regarded it as "repudiating Deng" for the second time. During his southern tour, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the main danger was "leftist" tendencies (but people should also be on the alert for rightist tendencies), adding that the controversy over what was being done was of a capitalist or socialist nature was inappropriate. Deng Xiaoping's response to the "leftists" offensive was quite "mild and moderate." Instead of "drawing a sword," he only said "we should not engage in controversy" for the sake of maintaining stability in reform, he only tried to prevent both sides from engaging in controversy. The Magazine ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU [IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH] Provoked a Controversy Silence prevailed in the ideological field for a period of time after Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks. Some people wrote several "leftist" articles, but they were not strong enough to create the necessary climate. It was said that it was very difficult to have articles published, and even the authorities did not support such publications. But this did not in the least harm the "leftists!" Some people tried to run middle-of-the-road publications and asked some famous people to express insignificant remarks. This enabled the "leftists" to clearly see the opponent's weakness. Thus the "leftists" waited for an opportunity to provoke a new trouble. After making all the necessary preparations, they thought the time was ripe for a new controversy. At that time, I went to the mainland and heard people commenting on several articles in a magazine called ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU. These articles were published in issue No. 4 of this year's ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU. The most conspicuous one was a "commentator's article" published by the magazine. I happened to see the magazine at a friend's home and began reading the article quickly. As I was not an expert in this respect, it was a little difficult for me to understand the meaning, not because it was abstruse, but because it was evasive. After reading it twice, I finally understood these two points: First, it pointed out that "bourgeois liberalization is still the biggest danger on the ideological front," therefore it urged launching a powerful criticism "like the one occurring after the 4 June political storm." Apart from directly asserting that opposing "leftist" tendencies was "liberalization," the article did not explicitly indicate the performance of "liberalization" at that time. Instead, it cited many problems and difficulties arising in reform, such as inflation, excessive price hikes, loss-incurring state enterprises, loss of state assets, prominent regional differences between the poor and the rich, corruption, and rampant malpractice. The article pointed out it was natural that these had happened, but that these problems should be resolved. By citing these examples, did it mean that all these problems were the results of "liberalization"? The Purpose Was To Criticize the Theory of Focusing on Economic Construction Another main point of the article was criticizing the proposition of "poor socialism." For this reason, the article launched an offensive against "bourgeois liberalization." The article said there had never been "poor socialism" in the Marxist dictionary, adding that this expression was mere trash and was completely anti-Marxist; socialism advocates common prosperity and the elimination of exploitation; poverty has nothing to do with socialism. I was confused. As everyone remembers, it was Deng Xiaoping who first said "poverty is not socialism" and who first criticized the idea of "poor socialism." It is true that Marx never mentioned "poor socialism," but China's socialism did proceed from poverty. In 1956, when China asserted that it had become a socialist society, this socialist society could not be regarded as rich. If it could not be called a "poor socialist society," it would do if we called it an "undeveloped socialist society." As Deng Xiaoping pointed out, strictly speaking, this socialist society cannot be regarded as a "qualified" socialist society. But this "undeveloped socialist society" is a reality in China. No one can deny it. In other words, this is a historic fact. Obviously, the criticism of "practicing poor socialism" was a criticism of the erroneous ultraleftist policy--a policy of "taking class struggle as the key link." The Great Leap Forward, the people's communes, and the Great Cultural Revolution were examples of the implementation of this ultraleftist policy. It was this policy that undermined the vitality of socialist productive forces and left many localities in prolonged poverty. This was a grave lesson in socialism, not the glory of socialism. Now the gentlemen who were "in pursuit of truth" revealed this historic fact and started saying in abstract that there was no such thing as poor socialism. What was their purpose? Marx did not favor egalitarianism, but China previously practiced socialism with different degrees of egalitarianism. Was this not a fact? It was strange that they "pursued truth" by engaging in empty talk regardless of the facts. Evidently, these gentlemen's purpose was to criticize the theory of focusing on economic construction and developing the productive forces, but they did not dare to conduct a direct criticism, so they took an evasive method. How the New Controversy Was Provoked This friend of mine did not know how the new controversy had been provoked, but only said that it had been brewing for more than two months. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the CPC opened a national meeting on propaganda and ideological work. At the meeting, a leader made a significant remark in his speech--a remark which interested those gentlemen who thought the opportunity for a controversy had come. Thus they were ready for such a move. In my opinion, if the authorities could look further into the future, controversy is not a good thing. At that time, Deng Xiaoping proposed "not to engage in a controversy," out of consideration for maintaining stability in reform. The situation has remained stable in the last few years because many people have refrained from controversy. Now there are many comments in China and abroad on China's situation after Deng Xiaoping's death. These comments vary with different people. Many think that there will be a change and political turmoil in China. As this leader is at a venerable age, like a candle guttering in the wind, the policy of stability must be pursued and efforts must be concentrated on resolving problems in reform, instead of allowing a controversy on the ideological front or provoking trouble. Otherwise, this could lead to evil consequences. Letting tigers out the cage harms oneself; thinking oneself clever kills oneself. There have been many such examples. If a controversy arises on the ideological front, this will cause differences of opinion among leaders (including retired leaders) on the policy and line to be adopted. People throughout the country who have embarked on the track of reform will not sit idly by either. In such cases, stability in reform could be ruined and no one can remedy it, and China could face a confused situation or retrogress to the period before 1978. This is a weakness in China's reform and a danger for its future. The CPC should seriously take this into account.
