FR940919-0-00046 FR940919-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 651 [Docket No. 940951&hyph;4251; I.D. 081694B] Northeast Multispecies Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this final rule to implement Framework Adjustment 6 to the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The intent of this rule is to reduce the catch of juvenile silver hake in the Cultivator Shoal whiting (silver hake) fishery by increasing the minimum mesh size from 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) to 3 inches (7.62 cm). EFFECTIVE DATE: October 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of Amendment 5 to the FMP, its regulatory impact review (RIR) and the initial regulatory flexibility analysis contained within the RIR, its final supplemental environmental impact statement, and Framework Adjustment 6 are available upon request from Douglas G. Marshall, Executive Director, New England Fishery Management Council, 5 Broadway, Saugus, MA 01906&hyph;1097. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan A. Murphy, NMFS, Fishery Policy Analyst, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9252. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Amendment 4 to the FMP, published May 31, 1991 (56 FR 24724), established the Cultivator Shoal whiting fishery, a specified area within the Gulf of Maine/Georges Bank Regulated Mesh Area. For 3 years preceding Amendment 4, NMFS had conducted an experimental fishery program in the Cultivator Shoal area using NMFS sea samplers to collect data about the silver hake fishery and particularly about the regulated species bycatch. The data collected by sea samplers led to the conclusion that the Cultivator Shoal whiting fishery had minimal impact on regulated species. Under the terms of Amendment 5 to the FMP (59 FR 9872, March 1, 1994), vessels may fish for silver hake in the Cultivator Shoal area from June 15 through October 31, unless otherwise specified, if the vessel: (1) Has onboard a letter of authorization issued by the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director); (2) has a minimum mesh size of 21/2 inches (6.35 cm) applied to the first 160 meshes counted from the terminus of the net; and (3) does not exceed the possession limit of regulated species as specified in 50 CFR 651.27(a). Fishing industry members recently asked the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to adopt more restrictive regulations to conserve the silver hake stocks and protect this resource from a potential increase in fishing effort directed at the juvenile component of the stocks. Their concerns are based on at least two recent developments in the industry that directly affect the silver hake fisheries, as well as on the assessment scientists' uncertainty about the stock status and the impact of those recent changes. First, as restrictive management plans are implemented in other fisheries in the region, a significant amount of potential fishing effort is being displaced. Fishers anticipate that some portion of that displaced fishing effort will be directed on silver hake, since this fishery is relatively unregulated and the stocks are comparatively stable. The effect of a sudden increase in fishing effort on silver hake stocks and markets is uncertain, but potentially detrimental to both. The most recent advisory report from the Stock Assessment Workshop (SAW) in February 1994, which was SAW # 17, states that, although there are uncertainties regarding the exploitation pattern in the silver hake fishery, it is recommended that any increase in effort on these stocks be avoided.
