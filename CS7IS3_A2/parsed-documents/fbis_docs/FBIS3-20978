Other German companies are exhibiting alongside Siemens: only by way of innovations in the "high-tech" technologies can the crisis be overcome with invigoration. Several items in the area of electronics manufacture which demonstrate this are displayed at the 9-13 Nov 1993 PRODUCTRONICA Exhibition in Munich, but is this enough? Since 1990 have Siemens and IBM been working in expectation of this day. As to the public response to their success, managers and developers have indeed been more than disappointed. Hardly anyone seemed to take notice when at the end of September the first in the world 64 Mbit chip was shown. The newspaper BERLINER ZEITUNG found this event to be worthy of only three full lines in the WIRTSCHAFT (Economy) Section. Some samples had already been previously distributed among select customers. The size of a single chip is 10.7x18.1 mm[.sup]2[/]. The finest DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) structures, only 0.35 ï¿½m wide, had been produced by the photolithographic process in far-ultraviolet light. Because of the most readily achievable symmetric and regular DRAM structure, production of this type of memory is so important to a semiconductor manufacturer that methods of producing ever finer such structures are being explored and developed for such memories. This type of memory is, in effect, the stimulator of technological innovations in microelectronics. With this chip, a German enterprise has finally knocked the Japanese and the North Americans hard in the key technology dominated by them. What the significance of this success will be in the long run remains to be seen. Meanwhile, a 256 Mbit chip is already being worked on by Siemens together with IBM and Toshiba. This example indicates that there are some German enterprises which do not participate in general wailing about the recession but rather channel their strengths toward a leading position in the field of electronics. They are pursuing their chances particularly in specialty sectors of the market. In electronics processing technology and production facilities, strongly emphasized at the PRODUCTRONICA, overseas competition is certainly still ahead. But even overseas innovations have helped German enterprises find a few niches. An example is the new LA 440 S sputtering apparatus, a joint development by the Von Ardenne Anlagentechnik (Equipment Engineering) Ltd in Dresden and the Balzers Hochvakuum (High Vacuum) Ltd in Wiesbaden. This apparatus facilitates deposition of thin films on wafers. It can be easily re-equipped to suit most diverse technological processes and sputtering methods, which is ideal for research and development. It demonstrates a high potential for electronics and machine manufacture in West and East Germany. Another example is the Karl Kuess Ltd in Garching, worldwide leader in manufacture of x-ray stepper drives. They are used for x-ray lithography, a method of most highly integrated microchip structurization. This company has found a market in the U.S.A., since hardly any x-ray lithography is being done in Europe. Recently Jenoptik is competing with its x-ray lithographic equipment against Karl Kuess in that overseas market. Its new X-Ray Scanner has attracted worldwide attention of professionals in this field. Germany is also strong in communications engineering: Siemens, still the world master of innovations, has cropped a winner with its ATM (Asynchron Transfer Modus). This is a multiplexing and exchange system for the future broad-band telephone network. While synthesizing and standardizing this system, Siemens has simultaneously developed the now classical technology based on use of ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits); just as it did for the GSM mobile radio system and for the cordless telephone in the DECT Standard. New developments are budding even in East Germany, where the electronic industry sector quickly collapsed after having been previously subsidized while cut off from the international market. A scientific and technical potential is still to be found here: LSI Logik in Erfurt, VLSI Technologie in Dresden, Elektronikwerkstoffe (Electronic Materials) Ltd in Freiberg, Jenoptik in Jena, and many smaller candidates for niche positions in the market are vying for them. In Soemmerda (Thuringia), where once the Robotron combine was manufacturing office machines, Germany's most modern computer factory is now in place and production has resumed beginning last October. In this new plant the ASI Computer Ltd will employ about 600 workers and produce at least 300,000 personal computers annually, which will make this enterprise Europe's largest PC producer. By manufacturing them in Germany, management hopes to respond faster to a fluctuating market demand and to thus extract pricing advantages better than is possible with imports from the Far East. Take the Electronic Materials Ltd in Freiberg, the sole manufacturer of GaAs single crystals in Europe. After the West German previous manufacturer Wacker had closed shop, the Freiberg company was able to take over its European customers despite a few initial difficulties. However, top-notch German electronic specialists are rather an exception: "There are no white elephants among the electronic companies" deplores Tom Sommerlatte. At the end of last October the Arthur D. Little consulting team had concluded its investigation of German companies. The objective was to identify those which had in the past three years, despite crisis and recession, realized above average output and profit gains. The list includes quite a few well managed medium-size industries, but no electronic companies. By the way, Sommerlatte has nothing particularly good to say about the German economy anyhow. The enterprises, he claims, are far too frozen into their old business molds and originate very little innovation. The Federal Republic is a land deficient in raw materials, which the Research Minister Paul Krueger is quite aware of. Therefore, it can retain its position as a leading industrial country only by top performance technologically and not being last in the field of electronics. Its only chance is investment in intelligence and creativity. Jens Uwe Fuhrmann of the Bavarian VDMA [Verein fuer Deutschen Maschinenbau und Anlagenbau = German Machinery and Equipment Construction Society] agrees with the Research Minister on this point. But on the foreground of PRODUCTRONICA '93 he has also accused the intolerable power wrangle in Bonn of being responsible for the fact that future-oriented decisions made regarding Germany's research and industrial status are exceptions rather than the rule. "Discussion about the status, though certainly needed, are missing the main point" believes Dr. Ekkehard Suess, chairman of the Productronic technical group within the VDMA. He demands more recognition for technical science, because it is the source of prosperity and jobs. "It is even helpful in protecting the environment" he said when addressing the PRODUCTRONICA '93 in Munich. In the long run, Doctor Suess warns, "Germany will not be able to keep up with the international competition if chip production is left more or less to the Siemens company alone." For this key product line competition in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now also in China is being backed by the "entire government machinery." Poor Germany! Industrial manager Suess calls it outright pure nonsense that ensuring and promoting microelectronics production be entrusted to the Ministry of Research, already burdened by shortage of funds, instead of also involving the Ministry of Economy. As far as the Research Minister Paul Krueger is concerned, Ekkerhard Suess crashes open doors. The minister wants to focus his policy on "the new technologies which have good chances both economically and technically" so that the results of research can be faster converted into competitive products and processes. A top product line under consideration for the next ten years is electronics. In order to push this through, Paul Krueger had formed a strategizing team which held its first meeting last September. Its task is to set in motion the needed dialog between scientists, economists, and politicians. Members of this team include Hubert Markl (former president of the German Research Society), Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker (director of the GenCenter), Heinrich von Pierer (on Siemens board of director), Edzard Reuter (on the Daimler-Benz board of directors), and Lothar Spaeth (business manager of Jenoptik). Krueger's model is Japan's innovation model. Eventually he will also bring about a general consensus in Germany. The BMFT (Federal Ministry of Research and Technology) has just pushed through a project involving effective division of tasks between the Government and economic management, namely promotion of the Laser 2000 concept. As a part of this project there have been set up and are being tracked five sub-projects, with diverse objectives ranging from heavy-duty diode lasers to medical instruments.
