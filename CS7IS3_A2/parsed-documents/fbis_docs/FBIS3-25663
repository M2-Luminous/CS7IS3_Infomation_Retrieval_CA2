He told a press conference in Umtata he would stay on as head of state in spite of a busy campaign schedule that starts with a visit to the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] this weekend. "During the election campaign I will continue in my present position as chairman of the ruling military council and attend to state matters as is applicable to other heads of government in southern Africa or in South Africa such as (President F W) de Klerk." Gen Holomisa, who is on the ANC's list for the national assembly, said the election campaign would be used to inform "locals" of the impending end of the homeland system and of homeland government. His participation on an ANC ticket did not imply other political organisations in the territory would be exposed to unfair treatment. Whatever the Transitional Executive Council and independent electoral commission put forward to ensure free political activity would be implemented in Transkei. "Personally I'm an advocate of free politicking...not even the TEC will teach Holomisa and his government how to be tolerant." He said the shift from being a military ruler to campaigning for the ANC would mean he would have to submit to party discipline and not use "dictatorial terms". Gen Holomisa will campaign in all four provinces in the run-up to the elections.
