Acting permanent secretary in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Vincent Selato, said Botswana had completed the formal procedures to join GATT and accepted the obligations of membership last month. Mr Selato said Botswana would now receive all benefits of the information and analysis of world trade developments prepared by the GATT secretariat. Full membership indicated to other trading partners and investors that Botswana was now prepared to take a full role and obligations in developing its new trade policy, Mr Selato said. "This message will be important for foreign investors who may wish to establish in Botswana to supply foreign markets and utilise foreign intellectual property and services". About the possible impact of joining GATT on the local textile industry, Mr Selato said the formal accession to GATT would have no impact on the competitive position of the textile industry, since Botswana was already subject to GATT obligations through Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and South Africa's membership in GATT. He said the conclusion of the current GATT negotiations might have some impact on the textile industry in two ways: -- firstly, many of the clothing exports from Botswana to non-SACU countries arose because low cost producers in other countres were limited by quotas from exporting more to European and North American markets. "The GATT negotiations initiated a process to phase out these quotas and replace them with general tarrifs in the importing countries", he said. He added that when this happens the low cost producers "will again be able to ship unlimited amounts to those countries, and will compete very strongly with Botswana's exports". -- Secondly, the new GATT agreement would probably involve some lowering of tariffs on textile and clothing imports into the SACU region depending upon the outcome of last minute negotiations between GATT members and South Africa. "This may also lead to additional competition within the SACU market for local producers. In the short term, GATT membership will mean very little to the small man. "Over a longer period of time, however, the more secure access to foreign makets, including those in SACU, should lead to more investment, more employment, a higher rate of income growth and a more secure level of income for the small man. "It will take time for the benefits of Gatt memberhip to mature". He said local business would continue to have the protection of SACU tarrif against large foreign companies outside the SACU. "Although this tarrif will be lowered to some degree as a result of the current GATT negotiations, it will still provide very substantial protection. "Ultimately, the best protection against large foreign companies is to improve productivity through better training, more efficient work practices and more modern technology and management. "Lower costs and improved quality of output are the only real protection for local businesses". Mr Selato said all Botswana's major trading partners including those in the SACU were already GATT members.
