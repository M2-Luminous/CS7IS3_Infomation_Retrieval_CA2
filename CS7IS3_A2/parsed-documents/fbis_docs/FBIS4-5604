Rep. Yi expressed concern that if the problem is not resolved, there will be louder calls for the South to go nuclear as well, prompting Japan to do the same and leading to unbridled nuclear competition. "This is what both Korea and China do not want," he said, tactfully urging Beijing to be more aggressive in persuading Pyongyang to halt its suspected nuclear arms program. Wu, former deputy premier and foreign minister, explained that China wishes to see peace and security maintained on the Korean peninsula. "Although China's role is limited, we will continue our efforts to persuade North Korea," he said.
