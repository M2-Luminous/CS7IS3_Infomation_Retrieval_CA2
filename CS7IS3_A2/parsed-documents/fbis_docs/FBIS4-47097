FBIS4-47097 "jpusr066___94052" FBIS-USR-94-066 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 31 May 1994 BALTIC STATES LATVIA Election Results From Latvia's Largest Cities Election Results From Latvia's Largest Cities 944K1476A Riga LABRIT in Latvian 31 May 94 p 2 944K1476A Riga LABRIT Latvian CSO [Articles by various reporters: "Results Of City Council Elections"] [Text] "Predictions Confirmed" by Guntis Kokars, JURMALA, special to LABRIT In almost all electoral districts in Jurmala on election day people most often mentioned two lists: "Our Jurmala," in which the LNIM [Latvian National Independence Movement] and the citizens group "Our Land" were united, and "Prosperity," which included representatives of LW [Latvia's Way], the Harmony of People party and the SDLP [Social Democratic Labor Party of Latvia]. Election predictions were confirmed: "Our Jurmala" gained six seats in the council. "Prosperity" gained three seats. The rest were alloted thus: DP [Democratic Party, formerly Democratic Center Party]--two; and one each to united FFF [For Fatherland and Freedom] and the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] list, the united PFL [Popular Front of Latvia] and AP [Agrarian Party] list, and to the political organization "Proprietor". Most popular among the voters was the doctor Leopolds Ozolins. It is possible that his placement in the "number one" position gave "Our Land" so many seats. Of nationally known and familiar persons, Andrejs Inkulis, former deputy chairman of the Riga city council, who represented "Prosperity," was also elected. From FFF the most popular turned out to be the singer and composer Adrians Kukuvass. No list won a majority of the vote, which is why a coalition is expected to be established. If "Our Jurmala" forms a coalition with FFF and the CDU, then it is possible that Ligita Zacesta, who already is the acting chair of the Jurmala Council of Peoples' Deputies, would become the mayor of Jurmala. The popular Leopolds Ozolins has said that he will not be a candidate for the office of mayor. Already during the election campaign "Prosperity" named as its mayoral candidate Janis Armicans, but with only three votes this idea will be difficult to realize. It is possible that the deputies will agree and elect someone from a neutral list. That might be the Jurmala municipal autosport enterprise director Juris Visockis, who is a member of the DP. "Harmony of People Party Victory" by Santa Belinska The hot election campaign period is over and a long awaited silence has descended upon Daugavpils. The Harmony of People party can celebrate victory, for it won ten seats in the new city council out of 15. As expected, Aleksei Vidavskis, list leader and deputy chairman of the state stock company "Dautex" received the most voter support. Judging by articles in newspapers he could also be the person who the townsfolk and party members want to see in the post of mayor. About twenty percent of voters cast their ballots for Aleksei Vidavskis. The other council members elected from the Harmony of People party are SIA "Austra" director Rita Strode, physician Reinits Joksts, Social Assistance Center worker Andrejs Grave, insurance association "Ezerzeme" president Peteris Savostjanovs, "Latvia's Gas" Daugavpils affiliate director Viktors Gajevskis, state revenue service inspector Natalija Semjonova, High School Nine director Silvija Birjulina, enterprise "Lokomotivs" trade union committee chairman Ivans Pucka and stock company "Dilars" president Dmitrijs Sinders. The SDLP and the Democratic Party of Latgale unified list got three seats in the city council. Those go to the current city council chairman Valdis Lauskis, state stock company "Dautex" director Janis Ambainis and city chief architect Gertrude Kudina. Agrarian Union of Latvia candidate Andrejs Dauksts and Social Democratic Party list member Aleksejs Providenko, who has a highly controversial reputation in the city, each emerged victorious. Before the election candidates on the Harmony of People list said that they are willing to work with all other lists on economic issues. The Daugavpils elections commission will submit its list of the new city council to the Central Elections Commission, which will have to rule on the level of state language comprehension for three council members before they can take office. "It's All Clear to One--Others Somewhat Confused" by Marina Marinina Seven members of the Popular Front, three Democratic Party list "We for Liepaja" members, two Association of Nationalist Organizations members and one each from "For Fatherland and Freedom," the Democratic Labor Party and the Liepaja Entrepreneurs Association were elected to the Liepaja city council. Although the Popular Fronters did not win the one additional seat needed to govern absolutely, Janis Birzkops, chair of the Liepaja section of the PFL [Popular Front of Latvia], the first person on the victorious list, and now also the likely head of the city, does not anticipate any obstacles to the work of the resulting Liepaja council. Despite the agreement of intent already concluded with FFF at the level of a protocol, Mr. Birzkops still hopes to work with the LNIM, similar to what is being discussed in Riga. FFF section chair Arkadijs Zebergs confirmed yesterday that Janis Gailis, former Home Guard batallion commander, now landlord, construction company owner, and the Fatherlander elected to the council, supports the PFL orientation, and for his part Valdis Prancans, Association of Nationalist Organizations member, said that both deputies from his list--the doctor Egils Deksnis for the Christian Democrats and Vilnis Maulins from the LNIM--will, for the time being, remain in the opposition. Similarly, he predicted that "We for Liepaja" would be in opposition to the Popular Fronters. Ivars Lagzdins, who submitted this list, looking at the seven council seats he considered should have been his and that certainly Andris Jaunsleinis should have been elected, acknowledged that the Popular Front phenomenon in Liepaja surprised him somewhat and that predicting the future is truly difficult at this moment. We were unable to contact "We For Liepaja" deputy Teodors Enins, but the other two, Inese Liepniece, Liepaja Commerce Bank board chair, and Janis Dreiblats, Liepaja Theatre director, acknowledged that they neither expected nor particularly wanted to get onto the council, but Mr. Dreiblats was pleasantly surprised by his popularity among the city's inhabitants. They declined to discuss the future for the time being. Liepaja Entrepreneurs Association director Janis Spriedejs was hopeful that he sees no reason that his deputy, Music College director Rihards Rubins, could not cooperate with the Popular Fronters. Mr. Birzkops did express a bit of regret that a representative of producers was not elected from the LEA [Liepaja Entrepreneurs Association], because the council does not have anyone like that, but that does not mean that he has any claim against his former schoolmate, Mr. Rubins. When asked about a possible opposition, for example, from the "We For Liepaja" side, Mr. Birzkops answered that he views opposition with skepticism, for people normally argue only because they are missing a clear conception of various things. As for "We For Liepaja," they are former Popular Fronters and all are honorable and sensible people with whom it is possible to work in a team in the the name of Liepaja's interests, [he said]. The possibility of cooperating with the PFL and "We For Liepaja" has not been completely ruled out by the Fatherlanders either, despite their undisguised worries, but arguments against it have already begun to appear. Time will tell whether or not they are won over. "A Convincing Victory" by Valda Madalane Even though only four lists battled in the municipal election for seats on the Rezekne city council, the final results came slowly, although they could have been predicted well in advanced. Monday morning it became known that a convincing number of seats--six--had been won by "Rezekne's Proprietor" (Ernests Jurkans, Vladimirs Cvetkovs, Helmuts Cibulis, Vilmars Stanislavs Jukna, Irena Silinevica, Janis Zudans). Two seats each went to the National Power Association of Latvia (Janis Novaksanovs and Janis Visockis) and to the Harmony of People party (Viktors Reblis and Valentina Sidlovska) and one to the Democratic Party of Latgale (Jazeps Korsaks). The simplest mathematical computations show unmistakably that leader affilitations alone do not create the prerequisites for real coalition creation. Such a viewpoint is also expressed by newly elected Rezekne city council deputy V. Reblis and he adds that in this kind of situation it is pointless to seek the office of city mayor. In turn "Rezekne's Proprietor" member H. Cibulis clarified that the list leader usually nominates the candidate for mayor. So: Ernests Jurkans? The future of the city will be determined by six entrepreneurial and energy branch representatives, three doctors and two educators. "Expectations--Moderate" by Zane Matulena In the elections for the Jelgava council the 15 seats were divided as follows: LNIM (six seats), SDLP (2), DP (2), AU (2), FFF (2), LW [Latvia's Way] (1). Yesterday afternoon we contacted various list members elected to seats on the Jelgava city council. They could only express their own personal views about possible coalitions and candidates for mayor, because consultations within the local sections of the parties and movements, as well as the mutual consultations of those on the lists still had not occurred. LNIM Jelgava section member A. Burba said that the key to building a coalition will be the people who end up in the council from the other lists. Cooperation is possible with two new councilmen from the AU list. One of them, it is possible, will be the Jelgava city chief physician, U. Cacus, who in a telephone conversation acknowledged that he has received an unofficial offer to work with LNIM representatives on the council. Of course it will be concretely decided by the leadership of the Agrarian Union's regional section. The LNIM representative emphasized that he was expressing his personal thoughts, calling as a potential city council chair the current Jelgava city municipal leader, LNIM member Uldis Ivans. Equally reserved in his predictions was the current city commerce director R. Vitolins. Last night the Jelgava section of "Latvia's Way" held a meeting. A resolution was adopted that for the time being the movement will be neutral and wait to see who will be nominated to the post of mayor by others. If a compromise is not reached "Latvia's Way" will be prepared to offer one of their members. J. Abele, Jelgava section coordinator for "Latvia's Way," said that to resolve actual issues in his city it would be better to be part of the ruling coalition, though it is possible that they find themselves in the opposition. Unfortunately we were unable to find out the thoughts of "For Fatherland and Freedom," the Democratic Party or the SDLP yesterday. These lists will also be represented in the city council.
