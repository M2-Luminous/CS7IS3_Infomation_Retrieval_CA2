Fujii, speaking at a regular press conference after a morning cabinet meeting, declined as usual to comment on exchange rate levels but said, "it has become a consensus among the (G-7) nations that recent movements were led by speculation not reflecting economic fundamentals." G-7 financial authorities have intervened jointly in the currency markets since finance ministers and central bankers reaffirmed in late April in Washington that they would cooperate to keep exchange rates stable and reflecting fundamentals. Fujii said, "We are constantly keeping in close contact to take appropriate, timely measures to cope with unstable movements." Concerning Japan's current account surplus, Fujii said steady implementation of the February 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package will boost domestic demand for a "meaningful" reduction. The politically sensitive surplus topped 130 billion dollars to hit a second consecutive record in the fiscal 1993 figures released Monday. But Fujii stressed that exports declined and imports expanded in volume terms, and yen-based figures pointed to the first decline in three years. While dismissing the need for any fresh fiscal actions, Fujii said he stressed at the cabinet meeting the importance of drawing up a bill in June and having it enacted by the end of the year for tax reform, including permanent tax cuts. Japan promised in its March market-opening package to detail the tax reform, especially to extend the 6 trillion yen tax cuts implemented for the current fiscal year. The minister rejected reports that the government's tax commission is considering multiple consumption tax rates as one of the options for its proposals to be issued in June. The November report issued by the commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, indicated such multiple rates are inappropriate, Fujii said. The Finance Ministry is insisting a single consumption tax rate, currently at 3 percent, and a uniform rate hike to offset income tax cuts. Referring to a monthly economic report issued by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), Fujii said, "I don't consider it as pessimistic." The report kept its assessment unchanged from the previous month, saying the economy remains generally sluggish although some bright signs are emerging. Fujii said, "The economy is at a delicate stage...with even experts mixed in their assessment" over recent statistics showing both good and bad signs.
