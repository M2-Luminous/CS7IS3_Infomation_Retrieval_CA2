Korolev; place and date not given: "There Are No Secret Lobbyists Among Us..."] [Text] No election platform, no statements or promises from party leaders will tell more about the party itself than its election slate. Drawing up this slate is difficult, painstaking, and not always pleasant work, and it is better for the voters not to know all the details of what goes on in the kitchen. They are offered the dish already prepared. This interview with Tudor Olaru, deputy chairman of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova, was prepared before the slate of candidate deputies from this party was registered with the Central Electoral Commission and published in the newspapers, but nobody made any secret of it--at a meeting of the ADPM council on 4 January the composition of the slate was discussed openly, so there was reason for discussing it. [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, the slate of candidates from your party is not very similar to the slate of the Agrarians. Everyone is included here, there are even leaders and members of the current government. [Olaru] If you have read our party's program attentively you will know that its main objective is to achieve real sovereignty and independence of Moldova, that is, the construction of a new state. Therefore we need not only agricultural specialists but also lawyers, economists, practical businessmen, and scientists. Some 10 percent of the candidates from the ADPM are lawyers and approximately the same number are economists. [Korolev] What was the principle on which the slate was formed? [Olaru] The main principle was representation of all rayon and city party organizations. This, incidentally, pertains to members of government as well: Sangheli was nominated by Riscani Rayon, Oleinic--by Balti, Gorincioi--by Chisinau, Kunev--by the Bulgarian villages of Taraclia and Ciadir-Lunga rayons. Now it is easy to gain points by criticizing the government, but there is a proverb: For every one that is beaten there are two that are not. Our proposals have also been accepted by people who are simply well known in the republic, for example, the chief physician of the republic clinical hospital of Moshniaga, the vice president of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova Lupascu, and Ion Surucanu, who needs no introduction. [Korolev] Are there any journalists among the candidates? [Olaru] Diakov, Angeli...those are the only ones I know of. [Korolev] Mr. Olaru, as soon as the Law "On Elections" was adopted, in an interview with our newspaper you gave the name of the person who should become prime minister in the new government. Rather, he should remain. Have you changed your mind? [Olaru] No, I have not changed it. As before, I think that if we were to win the elections we should form a government and it should be headed by Andrei Sangheli. Dumitru Motpan, as the party's leader, should remain in parliament. In general our policy with regard to this issue is as follows: Those who are elected to parliament will work as deputies of parliament. There are also many worthy people in Moldova who are not on any party slates. And they must be invited to the government. This does not mean that none of our candidates will be ministers, but their number will be limited. There will be three or four and no more. People are mistaken when they think that when "rushing to power" the ADPM will give all ministry portfolios to its own deputies just to "advance" the slate and pack the parliament with as many of "its own" people as possible. [Korolev] How many votes does the ADPM hope to receive in the elections? I am interested not in your personal prediction but the minimum number of deputy mandates necessary in order to uphold the principle of equal representation of all regions of Moldova. Because if there are any unpleasant surprises, it could happen that Balti could be represented in parliament by several deputies from the ADPM while, for example, Singerei or Soldandesti--by none. [Olaru] There is no such threshold and therefore, frankly, the formation of the lower part of the list did not go altogether smoothly. Incidentally, I dare say that this should be admitted by all parties. But we want, through our representative on the Central Electoral Commission, to make a proposal that each party after receiving a certain number of positions in parliament decide for itself who should hold them. Regardless of where the candidate stands on the slate, first or 140th. It seems to me that this would be fair. I hope the rest of the parties will support us. [Korolev] It is no secret that private entrepreneurial structures are very interested in the elections. They are trying to insert their "candidates" first on one party slate then on another. Has the ADPM received similar proposals? [Olaru] Yes, there have been such proposals, and sometimes in fairly veiled form. We do not have our own secret service or counterintelligence, but we have tried not to give in to pressure from the outside. There are no secret mafia lobbyists or anyone like that among us. That can be ruled out.
