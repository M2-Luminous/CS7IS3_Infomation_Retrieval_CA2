FR941107-1-00054 FR941107-1-00011 The current regulations at ยง654.23(b)(2) prohibit intentional/willful interference with fishing or obstruction or damage of a fishing vessel or fishing gear. The placement of this prohibition in the paragraph dealing with the shrimp/stone crab separation zones creates an inference that it applies only in such zones. However, the rules that originally implemented the prohibition stated that it applied ``in the FCZ'' (49 FR 30713, August 1, 1984). The former FCZ (fisheries conservation zone) is now the EEZ. Because such interference, obstruction, or damage is reprehensible wherever it occurs, NMFS proposes to clarify that these acts are prohibited throughout the management area. The inclusion of the phrase ``with intent to'' and the word ``willfully'' in the current language regarding these acts significantly reduces their effectiveness_proof of intent or willfulness is difficult. To enhance enforceability, NMFS proposes to remove ``with intent to'' and ``willfully'' and substitute ``knowingly'' in each case. Proof of a violation would then hinge on the placement, or use of articles or gear that cause obstruction or damage, if such placement or use was other than by accident. The procedures for creation or modification of the shrimp/stone crab separation zones to prevent gear conflicts, currently at ยง654.24 would be removed. These procedures apply to Florida regulatory agencies, the Council, and NMFS and are contained in the FMP. However, they are not regulatory in nature; that is, they do not control the behavior of fishermen. Therefore, their inclusion in the regulations is not necessary. Classification Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires NMFS to publish regulations proposed by a council within 15 days of receipt of an amendment and regulations. At this time, NMFS has not determined that Amendment 5 is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making that determination, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. This action has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed moratorium on Federal registration of stone crab vessels operating in the EEZ would not: (1) Reduce the number of current participants in the fishery, harvest levels, or annual gross revenues of participants; (2) affect production or compliance costs of participants; (3) require capital investment to comply with the rule; or (4) require a current participant to cease business. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.
