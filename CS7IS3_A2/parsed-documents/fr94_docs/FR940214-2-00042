FR940214-2-00042 FR940214-2-00027 Idaho National Engineering Laboratory Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project; Public Meetings The National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) announce the following meetings. Date: Wednesday, February 16, 1994. Time: 10 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m. Place: Best Western-Ameritel Inn, 900 Lindsay Boulevard, Idaho Falls, Idaho 83402. Date: Wednesday, March 2, 1994. Time: 10 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m. Place: Best Western-Cotton Tree Inn, 1415 Bench Road, Pocatello, Idaho 83201. Date: Wednesday, March 23, 1994. Time: 10 a.m.&hyph;4 p.m. Place: Red Lion Inn-Riverside, 2900 Chinden Boulevard, Boise, Idaho 83714. STATUS: Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. The meeting room will accommodate approximately 100 people. PURPOSE: Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC. In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles. Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. With an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho, as well as a worker study at the same site, the availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of Idaho citizens to provide consensus advice regarding these projects is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The draft charter for this proposed committee states, ``Because of the varying concerns within communities at each DOE site, operational guidelines at each site must be developed separately to clarify the scope of activities and the responsibilities of the Committee members and agencies.'' Therefore, CDC and ATSDR are holding a series of public meetings to begin developing operational guidelines at specific DOE sites. The purpose of these public meetings is to update the public on the status of CDC's and ATSDR's community involvement plans and to seek individual advice and recommendations from interested parties concerning operational guidelines. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon request from the contact person listed below. Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate. CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION: Leeann S.
