Last year the overseas-oriented province launched 685 cooperation projects with other provinces and 1,438 new enterprises based on internal cooperation, absorbing three billion yuan from other parts of the country. The achievement was made by offering domestic enterprises the same preferential policies given to Sino-foreign joint ventures and rural enterprises, who enjoy autonomy in employment, distribution and management systems, among others. In 1993 more than 550 domestic firms were registered in Xiamen city alone. Cooperation thrived between the province's coastal areas and the mountainous interior. Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou cities formed economic and technological partnerships with four inland counties and cities to support the development of natural and the human resources. Economic and trade cooperation with neighboring provinces also flourished. More than 1,200 projects were implemented last year, generating an output value to the tune of 2.9 billion yuan and profits taxes of 220 million yuan. Some of the cooperative projects were signed through representative offices set up in Fujian by other provinces. Last year the province received 2,000 groups of visitors from other provinces who came to seek cooperation opportunities.
