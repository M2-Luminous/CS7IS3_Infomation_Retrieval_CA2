But for now the central bank is just a plan--the National Bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina lacks the means to influence the financial reality of the country. It has contented itself with printing up coupons for Sarajevo on poor-quality paper, the value of which, in theory, is equal to the Bosnian dinar. This new Bosnian dinar, printed in April 1992, shortly after Bosnia-Herzegovina gained independence, has never actually circulated in Sarajevo because of the siege by Bosnian Serb forces. In an interview with a journalist from FRANCE PRESSE, Governor Omicevic says, "We have given a lot of thought to the banking system that we will establish after the war. It will be set up on criteria common to Western Europe and criteria recommended by the International Monetary Fund. Our banking system will follow the economy closely on the basis of the principles of free enterprise, while in reality we will continually save for democracy, because that was our basic motivation in signing the new federal constitution for Bosnia-Herzegovina." Present-day reality is completely different, he admits: The black market is flourishing, and all transactions are conducted in German marks [DM]. "We cannot eliminate that type of market through an ordinary administrative decision. For now, the black market is the market," says Omicevic. A strong and convertible dinar in a recovered economy will itself eliminate the black market and completely supplant the German mark as a means of payment, the governor contends. In Sarajevo, everything is paid for in marks. One mark is worth 500,000 dinars in coupons, which is equivalent to the average monthly wage. A kilogram of meat costs DM90, and DM35 must be put down for the same quantity of potatoes. And that is the impossible dream for the approximately 350,000 inhabitants of Sarajevo. Fed by free humanitarian aid packages that arrive in Sarajevo by airlift, residents mostly use their coupons to buy bread or the daily OSLOBODJENJE. Now they will be able to buy streetcar tickets for 30,000 dinars as well. International aid will be running dry before long, the governor emphasizes, but much remains to be done. The government has estimated the cost of reconstruction at around $3 billion. The bank has a small quantity of foreign exchange, $50 million, while the country has $1.6 billion in reserves, deposited before the war at the central Yugoslav bank in Belgrade. In June 1991, the national debt was estimated as $1.5 billion. Even if the governor is not deluding himself into thinking that it will be possible to collect all or even part of the foreign exchange reserves, he does believe that there will be new negotiations on settlement of the debt, and he is also counting on significant support from the international community. "We were supposed to pay off $250 million annually, which we have been unable to do because of the war," he explains. Restoring the banking system also depends on the confidence of the populace. That is why the government is preparing a bill that would guarantee to depositors the return of deposits entrusted to banks before the war over a period of two years after the end of the fighting. In the meantime, banks could issue letters of credit to depositors, which would be used to engage in commercial transactions. For now, all Sarajevo banks except the National Bank of Bosnia-Herzegovina are closed. Only the employees of that institution can be seen at its cash desks, because there are no depositors....
