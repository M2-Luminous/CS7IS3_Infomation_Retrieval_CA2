Yi Zhenqiu said that of the number of new stocks the state allowed to Guangdong last year, some 90 million yuan worth had not been issued. Recently, the provincial commission for restructuring economy has drawn up a list of enterprises, which already has been submitted to the State Commission for Restructuring Economy for its examination and approval. However, the number of enterprises and the list itself cannot be published as of today. Yi Zhengqiu said the selection of enterprises to be listed this year would continue to comply with the national industrial policy of focusing efforts on supporting key projects in energy resources and infrastructure. It is certain that the method of selling application forms for drawing lots in the marketing of new stocks will not be repeated. On the issue of Chinese stocks to be listed outside the border, Director Yi said that the Guangdong Foshan Earthenware Group has been included in the 22 firms to be listed outside the border, as decided by the central authorities; also included are the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway and the Southern Aviation Company, which are enterprises under ministerial jurisdiction. At present, those enterprises included on the list are conducting asset assessment.
