This is how he put it: "I expect many votes for myself, for my party, and for the majority. The vote is for Europe, but in the elections the Italian people will be telling me: We like your government; carry on; we are with you. Or not, in which case they will vote against the government." As his mouth voiced this wager, the prime minister's eyes showed that he was wagering on a virtual certainty, as he clung to Forza Italia's good-luck charm -- the latest, inevitable, promising opinion poll. So next weekend will be the time for a referendum or, rather, a plebiscite, which is for what the prime minister is calling. With regard to the recent past, he judged it unnecessarily full of "bugbears" and "windmills." This is the substance of the anxieties about the neofascist ministers, the suspicions and hostility expressed abroad; so said Silvio Berlusconi, who offered his personal loyalty to democratic principles as an "absolute guarantee." As he repeated for the umpteenth time that there is no Fascism and no problem, his smile grew strained: These things irritate him, to the extent that he let slip a half-insult to [French President] Mitterrand: "There are abroad some old politicians who have been in power too long and who are seeking electioneering arguments...." At last a ready-made referendum, albeit an informal one: on whether or not the Italians like a prime minister who is also owner of Fininvest and many other things besides. Berlusconi announced its result: "I have consulted the people. The situation is already clear now; the guarantees are there; what more do people want?" But perhaps Berlusconi will do something more; perhaps he will sell: "I have thought about relinquishing my companies to my five children." He let it be known that he has not yet decided whether to go so far, but certainly any future sale will not take place outside his family. It is unnecessary, he repeated, but this, he made it understand, is the last sacrifice that he is prepared to make: "My company no longer belongs to me; I own shares and I do not rule out selling them in the future." So tomorrow Fininvest could be owned not by one Berlusconi but by five Berlusconis. [passage omitted] Prime Minister, there are some anxieties.... "They have no reason to exist. There is a complete democracy in Italy. And if there are any dangers, they do not stem from the Right and the center-Right. There is nothing to worry about; the fact is that abroad, in France, in Greece, people are tilting at windmills." Prime Minister, there are the fascists.... "I testify to the complete adherence to democracy of the people in my government. The Israeli under secretary merely expressed a personal opinion. Clinton has understood that there was no democratic alternative to this majority in Italy. People are brandishing bugbears. But I have worked as a publisher, out in the open. There are not many people of whom it can be said, as it can of me, that they have made a profession of democracy. And this is the absolute guarantee." Prime Minister, the European elections.... "I am standing as a candidate, even though I cannot be a member of the European Parliament. It was important, essential, for me to lead the movement. These elections will serve the government and have a domestic significance. They must grant the government greater authority than it has now." Prime Minister, are you referring to the League? The prime minister elegantly evaded the question and preferred to stress "Italy's need for a government that will not change after a short space of time. A tragic legacy cannot be changed in 100 days. Furthermore, please be patient; we are not yet acquainted with the state machinery." There must be no public disputes between the allies, and the government must be a "long" one. Bossi and voters, please take note. Prime Minister, your companies.... "I am light years away from them. I have asked the people. Should I sell? And if so, to whom? This somebody does not exist. The real guarantee is my conscience. I am a man of government." The last question concerned the celebrations and the emphasis that the Right placed on the anniversary of 24 May 1918, but Berlusconi misunderstood, thinking that it was a return to the dispute about Fascism, and replied by asserting his loyalty to the principles of the Republic and his aversion to dictatorship: "Let us concentrate on the future, on the real problems, not on dangers that do not exist."
