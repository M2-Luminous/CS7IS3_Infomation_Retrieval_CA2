According to the report by an advisory body to the minister of international trade and industry, the leader in the world of technology should boost access to its technological innovation for foreigners. The report, released by a subcommittee of the Industrial Technology Council, also called for promoting international collaboration in developing new industrial technologies, while playing a key role in solving environmental problems and AIDS. Unlike the conventional concept of a techno-society focused on technological development at home, the proposed new technology-based society would be primarily characterized by free inflows and outflows of industrial technologies. Currently, Japan's technological exchange is overwhelmingly lop-sided, with the number of Japanese researchers studying in the United States five to six times higher than that of foreign researchers here. Access to Japanese technologies for foreigners is one of the key themes of the stalled "framework" trade talks with the U.S. The proposal comes with the emergence of the need to pursue global collaboration in technological areas due to slumping investments in research and development and a declining number of local engineers. The same needs have emerged elsewhere, as the end of the Cold War has made technology a tool for economic growth, rather than for military expansion. In addition, the ballooning costs and risks involved in technological development make global alliances meaningful. In country-to-country technological transfers, Japan should pay more attention to assisting recipient nations, mostly developing countries, to upgrade their technological levels. More globally, the country should take the initiative in fighting such global challenges as environmental protection with its advanced technological know-how, the report said.
