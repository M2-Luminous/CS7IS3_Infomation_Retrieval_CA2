Existing plans call for the government to invest 430 trillion yen in public works in the period. The sources said the proposed increase in public works spending is intended to appease the U.S. tension has been rising between the two countries following the breakdown of the bilateral framework trade talks earlier this month. The increased investment would help expand Japan's infrastructure, such as national communications networks, housing and parks, boost domestic economic demand and cut Japan's chronic current-account surplus with the U.S., the sources said. In the framework talks, Japan had pledged efforts to sharply reduce the surplus in the medium term. The government had earlier said it would announce next month a voluntary four-point program for cutting the surplus and opening its markets to imports. But that and other programs announced in the past would not be enough to satisfy the U.S. Government, the sources said. An advisory panel for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Council for Economic Restructuring, called in December for an expansion of the public works investment program, and Hosokawa himself told a new year's news conference he agreed with the proposal.
