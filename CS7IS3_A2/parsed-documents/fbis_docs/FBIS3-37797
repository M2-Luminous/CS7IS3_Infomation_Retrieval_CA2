The meeting took place at the request of the Italian minister, who flew to Budapest especially to hold talks with his Russian colleague. In an exclusive interview to the ITAR-TASS correspondents at the end of the meeting, which had been held in the Russian Embassy, Beniamino Andreatta said: "I am heading for Brussels, and I made a request by telephone for this meeting to be organized so that I could discuss personally with Andrey Kozyrev, first of all, the situation in Bosnia and the 'happy ending' to the settlement of the Sarajevo problem. We agreed on the need for joint work on the problem of protecting other populated areas in Bosnia as well." The main thing, the Italian minister stressed, was "not to lose momentum" in consolidating the good results now achieved in settling the situation around Sarajevo. In Beniamino Andreatta's view, this will be the first step on the path towards peace in Bosnia as a whole. Secondly, the minister continued, new impetus must be given to the process of finding a political settlement of the issue, holding various forums to this end. Also discussed was the "format" of some such meetings and negotiations. In addition, we examined the European Union's plan of action and "worked on it" in order to determine "more realistic" borders and possibilities for the exchange of territories, and also some forms of arbitration, taking account of the region's particular historic, cultural, and ethnic features. In the minister's view, this will make it possible to arrive at a genuine settlement of the conflict in Bosnia. It was also necessary to exchange opinions on the political future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the minister continued, "and at least as a start we agreed on the possibility of maintaining Bosnia's present borders." The Italian government is in favor of any settlement of the conflict which would predetermine cooperation at least between two ethnic national groups in Bosnia, and if it is impossible between all three, Beniamino Andreatta said. Also discussed in detail was the problem of the sessions of countries of the Seven and the Eight, and the organization of genuine cooperation between the world's leading states. Preference must be given in this to examining economic aspects of such cooperation within the format of the Seven, and political aspects within the format of the Eight. They also discussed the problems of the CSCE in the context of Yugoslav problems, and the situation in the Baltic countries (the minister intends to visit the Baltic countries in the near future). I believe that with the heightened activity of the U.S. and Russia to settle the situation in Bosnia the situation has significantly improved and the possibilities for a peaceful solution are now much more real than before, Beniamino Andreatta said in conclusion. In turn, Andrey Kozyrev stressed in an interview with the ITAR- TASS correspondents that an extremely wide range of problems and ideas had been discussed. But above all attention had been focused on the question of how to move forward towards a settlement, in order to profit from the possibilities which have opened up for a political settlement and the enforcement of a security zone in Sarajevo and other areas. It is necessary to push forward the process of seeking a peaceful settlement in Bosnia as a whole. Italy is now the coordinating country of the Seven, and we have examined the conditions for holding sessions of the Eight on political issues. We believe it is extremely important to establish full-scale relations of partnership with the U.S., Italy, and other states in the Seven on political aspects. Otherwise how can we achieve practical results in Bosnia or elsewhere? Andrey Kozyrev believes that it is wrong to adopt "separate unilateral decisions; progress should be reached in the settlement of the Bosnian crisis by joint efforts." This constituted the essence of our meeting, for which I am extremely grateful to the Italian minister, Andrey Kozyrev said in conclusion. "Now it is my turn to catch my Italian colleague somewhere on the move", the Russian minister laughed.
