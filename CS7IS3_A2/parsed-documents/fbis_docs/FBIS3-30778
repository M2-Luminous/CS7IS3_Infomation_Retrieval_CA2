[passage omitted] Two UN peacekeepers -- a Frenchman and a Canadian -- drove to the site in a jeep and offered to help, but were jostled by an angry crowd and forced to leave, a French photographer at the scene said. But other peacekeepers took seven of the wounded to the UN hospital in an armoured troop transport vehicle. The attack came a day after mortar shells killed eight civilians, including two girls aged eight and nine, in the suburb of Dobrinja as they were queueing for food aid. The new British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Michael Rose, said Saturday an investigation had shown "with certainty" that Bosnian Serbs were responsible for Friday's attack. [passage omitted] Bosnian Serb military commander General Manojlo Milanovic protested to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) about "accusations from the Moslem authorities that the Serb army had committed the massacre" on Friday, the Bosian Serb news agency SNRA reported. Milanovic threatened to block relief convoys travelling across Serb-held territory from Monday unless a joint commission was set up by Sunday morning, including Serb, Moslem and UN experts, to investigate Saturday's massacre. Bosnian Vice-President Ejup Ganic meanwhile blamed the Serbs and called for "an end to the arms embargo (against Bosnian authorities) so they can defend themselves." [passage omitted]
