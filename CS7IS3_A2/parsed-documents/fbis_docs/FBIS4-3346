Bank loans which went to science and technology sectors increased from merely 15 million yuan in 1984 to 6.3 billion yuan in 1993, according to a conference sponsored by the China Commission for the Promotion of Relations Between Science and Technology and Banking, which was held yesterday in Nanning, capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. At present, only about 15-20 percent of the scientific and technological achievements in China can be put into practical use, due to the lack of necessary funds, according to the meeting. However, banking services related to science and technology undertakings have been developing rapidly over the past few years since the People's Bank of China initiated a science and technology loans project and various professional banks started similar services. Banks have become another accelerator for the development of science and technology following state budgets and funds raised by enterprises on their own. In 1984, the Bank of Industry and Commerce and the Bank of Agriculture took the lead in granting loans to the development of science and technology, which reached 15 million yuan for the year. The figure reached 6.3 billion yuan in 1993 when the country's finances were in disorder for a time. Of the loans, 1.2 billion yuan went to the "Spark Program" in favor of local economic development, 1.7 billion yuan went to the "Torch Plan" in support of the development of high- and new-technology projects, and 900 million yuan went to a program which is aimed at the promotion of new technologies among traditional enterprises. The other funds went to research programs on the application of military technology to civil use, application of achievements of research institutes, exploration of resources, environmental protection and the development of new medicines. Under the coordination and support of the People's Bank of China, professional banks have developed the services for nearly a decade and have achieved great economic gains. Statistics from Shenyang, a major industrial city in north-east China's Liaoning Province, show that high and new technologies contributed to about 31 percent of the output value yielded by the enterprises in the city last year, largely because of support from bank loans.
