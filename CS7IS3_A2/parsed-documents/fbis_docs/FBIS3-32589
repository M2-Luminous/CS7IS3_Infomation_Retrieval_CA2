This personality, who wished to remain anonymous for security reasons, emphasized the Cite Soleil slaughter that caused the deaths of about 50 persons on 27 December, and the murder of about 15 youths on the night of 2 February. Of these 15, 12 bodies were discovered in Sarthe, on the northern road out of the capital. About 10 more youths were shot down in Cite Soleil or its surrounding areas because of their presumed affiliation with the lavalas movement during the same period by armed civilians or men in military uniforms. The human rights activist also cited the cases of several persons killed under questionable circumstances, whose bodies were later discovered at the general hospital's morgue in Port-au-Prince. According to this human rights spokesman, political assassinations are considered casual facts in Haiti. He holds the international community responsible for the impunity with which crimes are committed daily in Haiti. He also pointed an accusing finger at a huge segment of the business community, which denounces the ravages of the embargo caused by the military coup d'etat, but considers the violent killings normal. Citing the murder of Manette Jean-Louis, a young girl in the Mahotiere area, who was shot down on 31 December by Nationalistic and Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti Deputy Saurel Jacinthe, the human rights defender also denounces the blocs within parliament whose members are accomplices in crimes against life.
