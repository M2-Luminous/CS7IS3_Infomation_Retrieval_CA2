A Commission spokesman said the 12-member European Union was considering the move as one of a series of aid options for Ukraine proposed by the EU's executive. The building of the two new reactors would take years, the Commission said, adding that the proposal envisaged financing to ensure the gradual decommissioning of the two reactors still operating at Chernobyl, the scene of the world's worst peacetime nuclear catastrophe in April 1986. The remaining reactors are responsible for around 7 percent of Ukraine's energy production. The Commission wants the two reactors to be phased out, along with an assurance that a third reactor at Chernobyl, shut down last year after a major fire, will not be reopened. On Monday in Moscow Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk warned that only foreign aid and alternative energy sources could secure the closure of Chernobyl nuclear plant. The same day French Environment Minister Michel Barnier had pleaded for the partially crippled power station to be shut down. Barnier said Chernobyl's number four reactor -- which exploded eight years ago -- urgently needed to be topped off with a second protective bunker. But Kravchuk said that Ukraine alone was incapable of funding the closure of the complex. "The West only provides helpful slogans and has yet to give us the financing it has promised," he said, adding that, unless the security of the whole complex could be guaranteed, "Europe will find itself under threat of another misfortune." In 1992 and 1993, the EU accorded Ukraine a total of 61 million dollars to fund staff training programmes and additional security measures in the country's nuclear power sector. Wednesday's Chernobyl offer was one of a package of proposals to shore up Ukraine's battered economy covering the agricultural and nuclear energy sectors. Funding for the programme could be cleared rapidly if it is approved at an EU meeting May 16 and 17, the Commission spokesman said.
