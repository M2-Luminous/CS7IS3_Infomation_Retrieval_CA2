FBIS4-58827 "drnes089_j_94007" FBIS-NES-94-089 Daily Report 8 May 1994 ARABIAN PENINSULA Yemen Southern Forces Attack Targets in Sanaa Southern Forces Attack Targets in Sanaa More Scuds Fired at Sanaa JN0805042394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0332 GMT 8 May 94 JN0805042394 Sanaa Yemeni Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Statement by "responsible military source" at the Defense Ministry and the General Staff Command on 8 May -- read by announcer] [Text] In the last moments of the defeat of the suicidal forces of apostasy and secession and as a crazy expression of the hysteria of death and annihilation, the criminal forces fired a number of Scud missiles at Sanaa and areas of the Sanaa Governorate at 2310 [2010 GMT] yesterday, Saturday, targeting secure citizens and vital and strategic civilian installations. However, thanks to God, this fierce offensive of more than five missiles failed to inflict any losses; it only terrorized citizens in the areas where they landed. In a related development, the military source stressed that the decision made by the dismissed Haytham Qasim Tahir in the name of the defense minister declaring a general mobilization and calling up the reserves is considered baseless and illegitimate because it was issued by someone who has lost every military and official authority. It is a decision that expresses adherence to the delusion of survival. It has been proven practically that his end as well as the end of all secessionist forces rebelling against the Constitutional legitimacy has approached and is, God willing, imminent. We are confident that those who deceived the officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers in our Armed Forces' units, over which they hold sway and which they sent to death, will not be able to mobilize civilians and those helped by circumstances to remain outside the military service. They survived and were [word indistinct] the savage plotting ordeal and were confident they will be away from it. O Sons of our Armed Forces -- officers, noncommissioned officers, and soldiers of the military units under the pressure of the rebelling elements in the secessionist leaderships of the Socialist Party: We address this appeal to you and ask you not to obey the orders of the rebelling gangs among the adventurous and hegemonistic leaderships of the Socialist Party. We address to you a sincere brotherly appeal to join the forces defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which are the forces of all the people, and not the forces of a gang or party. In the same manner as they protected the people's gains and accomplishments, these forces are today very heroically, efficiently, and capably working to rid you of the domination and hegemony of the gangs of apostasy, secession and adventurism among the secessionist military gangs. We make the pledge of the free and loyal to you that you will find every concern to secure your life, preserve your dignity, and restore your military honor. The stand of the legitimate and Constitutional leadership, which is defending unity, along with the officers and soldiers of the 3d Brigade in 'Imran, is sufficient evidence and cogent proof of the integrity and sincerity of the legitimate leadership in which we, as well as all Yemeni people, confide and consider their legitimate representative and the protector of all the Yemeni people's interests. O sons of the Armed forces -- soldiers, noncommissioned officers, and officers of the units under the control of the military gangs in the Socialist Party: We demand that you not throw yourselves into the pit of an unfeasible bloody confrontation or suffer by standing with those outlawed gangs that broke away from law, Constitutional legitimacy, and unity. Let us say enough of fighting, suicide, destruction, and bloodshed. We call on you to join the ranks of Constitutional legitimacy. You will receive all care and attention from a loving and compassionate brother. This is a guarantee and a free promise in the name of the people and before Arab and world public.
