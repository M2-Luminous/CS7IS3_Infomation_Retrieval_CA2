The initial microstructure consists mostly of _a_-Al, Al[.sub]6[/]Fe particles and a smaller volume fraction of an amorphous phase. During annealing, the amorphous phase transforms into _a_[.sub]T[/]-AlFeSi phase, the globular particles of Al[.sub]6[/]Fe growth up and some needle-like Al[.sub]3[/]Fe phase precipitates near the _a_-Al grain boundaries. At 673 K, 96 h and 773 K, 5 h annealing, the Ti and C dissolved in the _a_-Al during rapid solidification precipitates as a compound phase of TiC[.sub]0.79[/]. The formation process of TiC phase is discussed.
