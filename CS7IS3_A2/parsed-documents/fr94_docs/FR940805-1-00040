FR940805-1-00040 FR940805-1-00008 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MN32&hyph;1&hyph;6373; FRL&hyph;5028&hyph;4] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: On November 10, 1992, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a SIP revision which included two elements: (1) a commitment from the Governor or his designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation; and (2) a schedule of implementation. On December 15, 1993, the MPCA fulfilled its commitment by submitting proposed revisions to its State Implementation Plan (SIP) for carbon monoxide (CO) to USEPA for approval. The submittal requests approval of its basic inspection and maintenance (I/M) program which applies to the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area. The Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area, which includes Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties, has been classified as moderate nonattainment for carbon monoxide. Therefore, Section 187 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the State to submit a basic I/M SIP. In this action, the USEPA is proposing conditional approval of the State's basic I/M program submittal. DATES: Comments on this requested revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by September 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Copies of the SIP revision request and USEPA's analysis are available for inspection at the following address: (It is recommended that you telephone Gina Smith at (312) 886&hyph;7018, before visiting the Region 5 office.) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Written comments should be sent to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gina Smith, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 886&hyph;7018. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 187(a)(4) of the CAA, as amended in 1990, requires States with areas designated moderate nonattainment for CO to make changes to improve existing I/M programs or implement new ones. Section 182(a)(2)(B) requires USEPA to review, revise, update, and republish in the Federal Register guidance for State motor vehicle I/M programs. On November 5, 1992, (57 FR 52950), USEPA published a final rule establishing performance standards and other requirements for basic and enhanced I/M programs. The November 5, 1992, I/M Regulation required each State that must implement an I/M program to submit by November 15, 1992, a SIP revision including two elements: (1) A commitment from the Governor or his designee to the timely adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation; and (2) a schedule of implementation. A memorandum dated December 11, 1992, from Phil Lorang, Director, Emission Planning and Strategies Division outlines the elements that a State's schedule of implementation must include for acceptability. These elements include: 1. Passage of enabling statutory or other legal authority; 2. Proposal of draft regulations and promulgation of final regulations; 3. Issuance of final specifications and procedures; 4. Issuance of final request for Proposals (if applicable); 5. Licensing or certification of stations and inspectors; 6. The date mandatory testing will begin for each model year to be covered by the program; 7. The date full-stringency cut-points will take effect; and 8. All other relevant dates. Following publication of the I/M program final rule (57 FR 52950), the USEPA also made available to States a document entitled, Checklist for Completing the Inspection/Maintenance SIP (Checklist). The Checklist was developed to assist States in the development of I/M SIPs and outlines in detail the criteria the I/M SIP submittals must satisfy in order to be approved for incorporation into a State's federally approved SIP. II. Summary of State Submittal In 1988 the MPCA was authorized and directed by the State legislature to adopt rules establishing an I/M program in the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area. As required by Minnesota Statute Section 116.62, the MPCA adopted Minnesota Rules parts 7023.1010 to 7023.1105, which established standards and criteria governing the testing and inspection of motor vehicles for CO and hydrocarbon emissions in the Twin Cities seven county metropolitan area. Vehicle testing began on July 1, 1991. Upon publication of the USEPA's final rule for I/M Programs (57 FR 52950), the MPCA recognized the need to amend the rules for operation of the State's I/M program. The State submitted a committal SIP on November 10, 1992. Additional information was provided on December 14, 1992, on January 6, 1993, and on February 22, 1993. A public hearing on the committal SIP was held by the State on February 22, 1993. The submittal includes a commitment for the adoption and implementation of an I/M program meeting all requirements of the I/M regulation and the CAA, a schedule of implementation which contained the elements described in Phil Lorang's December 11, 1992 memorandum, and a submittal date to USEPA of November 15, 1993. On November 15, 1993, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted the first of two parts of its State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision request for the Twin Cities seven country metropolitan area I/M program. The second part of the revision request, consisting of the public hearing notice, was received by USEPA on December 15, 1993. The submittal requests approval of the Minnesota I/M program which has been operating in the Twin Cities metropolitan area since July 1, 1991. The seven county metropolitan area includes Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington Counties, which have been designated moderate nonattainment for carbon monoxide (CO).
