[Basescu] I clearly said that confidential documents of the Petromin company were transferred to General [Nikos] Grylakis in Greece, the route being Romanuel Posedaru [one of the directors of Petromin], [former Romanian Transportation] Minister [Paul] Teodoru, and General Grylakis. I do not know whether the documents were personally handed over by Minister Teodoru or rather [presidential counselor] General [Vasile] Ionel. I presume, it was General Ionel. My presumption is based on the fact that I cannot imagine Minister Teodoru holding talks with an intelligence general [Grylakis], because he is too bright to establish direct ties with an intelligence general. [Vintan] Do you mean you never referred to President Ion Iliescu? [Basescu] No, I never referred to him. It is the merit of your daily to have also mentioned Iliescu's name, although I am not prepared to state that the things published by ROMANIA LIBERA were lies. [Vintan] For how long have you been holding these pieces of information? [Basescu] For a very short time, and I also have evidence. Otherwise I would not venture to make such assertions. I have never asserted anything publicly without also being able to prove it. The case of Romanuel Posedaru may be explained in the following way: He handed them [the documents] over upon the orders of Minister Teodoru. The responsibility for delivering those documents to Grylakis mostly lies with Teodoru. [Vintan] The persons you accused are asking why you need to interpret a commercial transaction as an espionage case involving the highest-level officials of the state power. [Basescu] First let us take a look at the Forum Maritime-Petromin deal. There was this insignificant and honest Katounis, a person who did not have either a bad or a good reputation in the shipping business; he was merely an obscure shipping businessman. Well, one fine day he unexpectedly comes to conclude a contract by which he would have taken control of 51 percent of Romania's oil tankers and ore carrier ships [the Petromin fleet]. This man had received the necessary information, by way of that Arab, Taher, before he came here to conclude the contract. He held information both regarding the financing contracts and the commercial contracts that had been concluded by Petromin. He is not a dumb person and this is proved by the fact that by the end of 1993 the company began to make profit. Currently its profits amount to 500 million lei. So he came precisely at the right time. In 1993, he intended to sign a contract by which he would have taken over the company. At the same time, Minister Teodoru was making a great fuss everywhere claiming that Basescu had left him a bankrupt Petromin [company]. But look here, it is not bankrupt at all. In June 1993, Teodoru and [Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae] Vacaroiu claimed vehemently that 51 percent of Petromin ought to have been sold to Katounis because the company was going bankrupt. And look what happened, eventually the contract did not become effective and the company is making money. This means that they [Teodoru and Vacaroiu] lied to justify an unfavorable contract. Under such circumstances, if a prime minister and a minister sign a contract that is later declared illegal, normally they should have no other choice but to step down. [Vintan] What is your opinion about the arrest of the four former Petromin directors? [Basescu] This is a political game, in which -- considering that the contract has been declared illegal -- the state power, Teodoru and [Ion] Honcescu [head of the Prime Minister's Control Corps] have staged the whole thing by having the four former Petromin directors arrested. [Vintan] Do you think they are innocent? [Basescu] Absolutely! They are victims of a major hoax intended to fool public opinion. The press also made a great fuss about it, of course, because it is a spectacular case. All this happened on the eve of the court ruling on the Petromin-Forum Maritime contract, in which Teodoru and Vacaroiu are fully involved. Everyone let themselves be led astray by the hoax and ignored precisely what was essential, namely that, for the first time ever, a government decision is rejected by our justice. And that the prime minister and a minister, who were coauthors of that illegal decision are now fine, thank you very much, and on top of it they are given the chance to be appear as the defenders of the people for having ordered the arrest of the four [directors]. [Vintan] What do you intend to do with the evidence you have? [Basescu] My number one priority is to convince [the court] that the four persons have been arrested for nothing. You might also find it difficult to believe that. I was not involved in any illegal dealings together with the four, they are simply four colleagues of mine, four innocent people who are victims of the dispute between myself, on the one hand, and Vacaroiu and Teodoru on the other. I hope I will be able to address an open letter to Teodoru and Vacaroiu to point out the illegal dealings they are involved in and to prove that they are abusing these people, and that the day will come when they will be held responsible for it. [Vintan] Do you intend to hand the evidence over to the General Prosecution? [Basescu] No, as long as those people are in power I will not do that. I know they control the prosecution. [Vintan] You know that your party [Democratic Party -- PD] has concluded a nonaggression pact with the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania -- ruling party]. The majority of the persons accused by you are orbiting around that party. [Vintan] I do not want to hear about political pacts. If need be, I will become an independent parliamentarian, but I will still defend my opinions. They wanted me to be a member of the [PD] commission that held negotiations with the PDSR, but I refused, precisely because there is nothing I can negotiate with such partners.
