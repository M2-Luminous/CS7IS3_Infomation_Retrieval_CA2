Due to the assault, one of the Korean schoolboys suffered an injury. It will reportedly take ten days for him to recover. Representatives of the Chiba Prefectural headquarters and Tokatsu branch of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and teachers and students of the school on May 19 called at the Matsudo Police Station to inform it of the damage and demanded that it take an appropriate measure to prevent the recurrence of such grave case. A series of cases prove that the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongnyon campaign of the Japanese authorities is also directed against Korean students in Japan.
