Hata said at a plenary session of the House of Representatives that negotiations in specific areas should be resumed before the summit, adding his government will seize every opportunity to reopen the bilateral talks, foundered in February. But Hata reiterated Japan cannot accept numerical targets to measure market access improvement, saying setting such targets runs counter to Japan's basic stance on trade. Bilateral trade relations soured after former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton failed at their meeting in February to reach a trade pact under a bilateral framework agreement in July 1993. The talks broke down after Japan rejected a U.S. demand for numerical targets to gauge progress in such areas as the auto, insurance, medical equipment and telecommunications markets. Hata said his government plans to pursue bold economic reforms, focused on deregulations and domestic demand-led growth to solve the bilateral dispute over Japan's huge trade surplus with the United States. On current economic conditions, Hata said the domestic economy remains by and large in a slump despite some bright signs. While pointing to a brisk housing sector and a slight recovery in consumer spending, he admitted corporate capital investments continue to decline, and the labor market is weak with prospects for corporate earnings still bleak. He said the government will make every effort to put the economy back on a firm footing "as early as possible in fiscal 1994." The government will place a high priority on securing a stable labor market and on sustainable economic growth propelled by expansion of domestic demand, he said.
