In his letter Kharrazi emphasised that the Iranian interest section in Washington last month asked the Embassy of Pakistan to inform American secretary of state over the incident and to ask for an explanation. The letter describing details of the incident was distributed as a United Nations Security Council document at the UN headquarters here on Thursday.
