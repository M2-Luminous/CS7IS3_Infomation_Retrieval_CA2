FBIS3-52091 "drnes001yy_94004" FBIS-NES-94-001 Document Type:Daily Report 3 January 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Israeli Source on Sha'th Letter TA0301071994 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0600 GMT 3 Jan 94 TA0301071994 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Text] A senior political [Israeli] source said this morning that the new PLO compromise contains nothing that could advance the negotiations. He was referring to the offer Nabil Sha'th sent last night to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, again by fax, since the prime minister said yesterday that everything should be presented in writing from now on. Jerusalem sources again explained that the talks will resume only on the basis of the Cairo agreements. Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: The recent Palestinian offer of compromise, relayed last night to Israel, includes nothing that could lead to progress in the negotiations, a senior Israeli political source said this morning. He was referring to the letter which Nabil Sha'th, Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser, faxed to Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. The document arrived last night around midnight and included a Palestinian compromise offer, in a PLO attempt to renew the Taba talks this week. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres reported the content of the offer to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Israeli sources again stressed that the messages relayed to 'Arafat's aides, through their fax machines, were unequivocal: We are not willing to hold negotiations about the Cairo agreements which, from Israel's point of view, are a basis for the resumption of the Taba talks. Israeli sources stated that over the past 24 hours, Egypt also played an important role in the contacts with the Palestinians, mostly held by fax. Regarding the ridiculous claims by Sha'th that the document presented after the Cairo talks was not an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Israeli sources said: Do not ask us; ask Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa. He was with us in the same room. Minister Yosi Sarid said that even the first document Sha'th sent to Rabin on 30 December -- which included amendments to the document formulated in Cairo -- indicates that a joint Israeli-PLO agreement was indeed made in Cairo. Had we wanted to write an Israeli position paper, Sarid said with a smile, I do not believe we would ask for an Egyptian or Palestinian advice. We could have done this alone at home.
