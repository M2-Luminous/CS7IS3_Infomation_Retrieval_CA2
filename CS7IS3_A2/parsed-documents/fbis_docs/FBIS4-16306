Soskovets dismissed reports by some mass media that the government was drafting a document to raise import duties. He noted, however, that following the recent rise in import tariffs, "a commission will be set up to specify these issues". The first deputy prime minister believes the draft federal budget for 1994, which was submitted by the government to the State Duma, should be taken as a basis. He is confident that this document provides a most thorough analysis of all items of revenues and expenditures. The draft budget "is to be finalized and approved within the next few weeks", Soskovets reported. "For the time being, the government has to manage with the quarter budget", he said. The first vice-premier declined to give any comments as concerns wage indexation for state-subsidized industries in the second quarter of 1994. He admitted, however, that the government did not have the necessary resources.
