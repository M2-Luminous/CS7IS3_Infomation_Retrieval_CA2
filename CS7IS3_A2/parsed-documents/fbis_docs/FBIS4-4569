As the Hiraiwa Report stresses, the abolishment of such regulations is a trump card to revitalize the current state of the Japanese economy and narrow price differentials between Japan and other nations. It is very regrettable that the government has reached a half-formed resolution on relaxing the regulations. Primary reasons for the government drawing up such a half-formed resolution include: first, medium- and small-scale retailers have strongly reacted against completely abolishing the regulations, and their reaction has led the government to fear political risks in taking such action; and second, the government has concluded that even if the conventional regulations are left unrelaxed, large-scale stores can open new branches of their retail stores anyway. When the Large-Scale Retail Store Law was enacted 20 years ago, large-scale stores could freely open new branches, provided each had a floor area of less than 1,500 square meters. The government then restricted the area of new retail store outlets to 500 square meters by strengthening the regulations. This time, the government has somewhat relaxed the regulations, but the deregulation has fallen short of reaching the size available 20 years ago. The United States has pressed Japan to open its markets and has asked Japan to set numerical targets, because in many instances, Japan has agreed in general to relax its regulations; however, Japan has yielded to pressure from interest groups whenever it has planned to take concrete steps to relax its regulations. Political pressure exists in all nations. Politicians should make a firm decision on whether to yield to pressure or adhere to their principles and push for reforms to the last. Voters will decide whether such decisions are right or wrong when they cast ballots in elections. This is part of the democratic process. At present, however, government-led consultative councils submit reports to the government and policies are actually formulated based on the conclusions of such reports. This is not a healthy process. The present situation is such that the collusive relationship between the government and the private sector is hard to break, and bureaucrats, whose decisions are not mandated by voters in elections, have taken the initiative in deciding to keep the Large-Scale Retail Store Law in effect. This situation clearly runs counter to the principles of democracy. There is a "logic of adults" [otonanoronri] behind Japanese-style decisionmaking; such logic is villainous. The government's idea is that, "since large-scale stores can still open new retail outlets under the Large-Scale Retail Store Law, it is desirable to reap the benefits of keeping the law in force." It appears that the "logic of adults" has been behind the government's recent decision to keep the Large-Scale Retail Store Law intact. We must not forget that the "logic of adults" has prevented transparency in Japanese decisionmaking. The government's decision to keep the law intact clearly will be advantageous to major Japanese firms that have already consolidated their business foundations in the distribution industry, but will be disadvantageous to foreign firms that have yet to firmly establish themselves in the Japanese market. The Large-Scale Retail Store Law does not exist in the United States. The nonexistence of such a law has constantly revolutionized the distribution system and kept prices low in that country. Wal-Mart, a discount store in the United States, is well-known worldwide for its innovative management. Wal-Mart is a fast-growing, high-profit firm that has posted the world's top retail sales over the past few years. The characteristic feature of the company's strategy is to open retail outlets in small towns with populations around 30,000. Major supermarkets are reluctant to open retail outlets in such small towns. Many conventional retail stores are small, while the prices of goods sold at such stores are high. Wal-Mart has focused on opening retail outlets in rural towns. The American firm has tried hard to purchase goods from all over the world at the lowest prices, and this has made it possible for its retail stores to sell goods at lower prices. As a result, townspeople have rushed to Wal-Mart to buy goods, leaving rival conventional stores bankrupt. To be sure, the bankruptcy of conventional small retail stores has resulted in great pain for such firms. However, the living standards of townspeople have greatly improved. Their real purchasing power has grown and existing business has become brisk in order to meet fresh demand. In addition, one new business after another has emerged. People who have lost their jobs in conventional small retail stores have found new jobs in Wal-Mart, and some of them have started new businesses. The arrival of Wal-Mart has substantially revitalized towns and improved the livelihood of people in the towns. The Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters headed by the prime minister will create today (28 March) a "panel on import promotion, market opening, and distribution." I hope that as a trump card to drastically narrow the price differentials between Japan and other nations, the prime minister will make a political decision on the repeal of the Large-Scale Retail Store Law.
