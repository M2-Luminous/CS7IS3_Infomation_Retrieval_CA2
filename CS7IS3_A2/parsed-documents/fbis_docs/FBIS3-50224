Lezsak praised the high political culture of the leaders of the Hungarian parties represented in the Slovak parliament, but criticized Slovak politicians for lack of accommodating stands. They consider representatives of the Hungarian minority their "hostages" and provoke them by instigating hysteria and rumors, the radio quoted Lezsak as saying. The Hungarian minority of 560,000 or 11 percent of the Slovak population, is represented in the parliament by the Egyutteles movement (9 out of a total of 150 parliamentary seats) and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH, 5 seats). Egyutteles Chairman Miklos Duray told the radio that his movement now "works as a bridge between Slovak and Hungarian officials." He claimed that the aim of the MDF three-man delegation's three-day visit to Slovakia was to study on the spot the living conditions of ethnic minorities. Reacting to the positive evaluation of Slovakia's nationality policy by Max van der Stoel, high commissioner of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) for ethnic minorities, and Miguel Angel Martinez, president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (CE), who visited Slovakia this week, Duray said they had been given one-sided information, probably "only from Mr. Meciar (Slovak prime minister).
