The talks were held in a warm and friendly atmosphere. At the beginning of the meeting, Li Peng said he was pleased to have the opportunity of visiting Mongolia on the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Mongolia. He evaluated highly the Sino-Mongolian exchanges and cooperation in the political, economic and trade, science and technology, cultural, and military fields. He said that China and Mongolia share a long border, that Mongolia is China's important neighbor, and that China attaches importance to friendly and good-neighbor relationship with Mongolia. Li Peng said the Chinese Government will abide by the following five basic points in developing relations with Mongolia: First, adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as a basis for the development of friendly cooperation with Mongolia, which looks toward the 21st century. Second, respect for Mongolia's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the Mongolian people's choice of their own path of development. Third, developing trade and economic cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, in an effort to promote common development and prosperity. Fourth, the hope of maintaining peace and stability in East Asia; appreciation for Mongolia's positive efforts to safeguard regional peace and stability; and support for Mongolia's policy to become a nuclear-free zone, in not allowing foreign troops or the deployment or transportation of nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction in or through its territory. Fifth, the Chinese Government is also willing to see Mongolia develop friendly relations with other countries. Li Peng said that the consolidation and development of Sino- Mongolian friendly relations is not only in keeping with the fundamental interests of the two peoples but also will be conducive to regional peace, stability, and development as well. Li Peng said that the "Friendship and Mutual-Assistance Treaty Between China and Mongolia" that was signed during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Mongolia in 1960 laid a foundation for the development of relations between the two countries. Now both the domestic situation in the two countries and the international situation have undergone great changes. Taking Mongolia's wishes into consideration and with a view to further developing the friendly relations between China and Mongolia, both sides have revised and perfected the treaty. Today we will officially sign a new treaty of friendship and cooperation. He said that the signing of this treaty will be an epoch-making event in the history of bilateral ties. It will legally establish the relationship of friendship and cooperation between China and Mongolia. It will provide a new political basis for future bilateral relations. It will also be a basic principle for standardizing the handling of various bilateral affairs between the two countries. This treaty will make China and Mongolia even better friends and neighbors. Jasray extended a warm welcome to Li Peng's visit. He said that he agreed with Premier Li Peng's assessment of bilateral ties. He said that Li Peng's significant visit coincides with the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Mongolia and China. The Mongolia Government assesses highly China's major achievements in developing the economy and in improving the people's living standards. A stable and developing China and a China that is embarking on reform and opening up is important for peace and stability in Asia, in the Pacific, and in the world. Jasray said that Mongolia's foreign policy is based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit regardless of the beliefs or size of a country. The development of friendly relations with China and Russia, two large neighbors, is a priority of Mongolian foreign policy. Mongolia will not only develop relations with the Western and developed nations but it also will strive to expand ties with Asian countries, in particular those of East Asia. Li Peng welcomed Mongolia's adoption of the policy of attaching importance to its ties with China and Russia. Jasray said that thanks to the efforts of the two countries, relations between Mongolia and China have been completely normalized and constantly developed and expanded in recent years. The maintenance of high-level contacts between the two countries has promoted the mutual trust between the two countries and the two peoples. China's respect for Mongolia's chosen method of development is very important for the further expansion of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. He pointed out that the Friendship and Mutual-Assistance Treaty signed by the two countries in 1960 and the joint communique of 1990 have played a positive role in developing relations between the two countries. Today the two countries will also revise and sign a new treaty of friendship and cooperation. This treaty will surely become a legal basis for long-term development of the friendly and cooperative relations between Mongolia and China. Mongolia and China already have signed a number of agreements on cooperation and will sign more agreements on cooperation today. Therefore, the development of Mongolian-Chinese relations will surely be very smooth, which is in accord with the fundamental interests of the two countries. When touching on the economic and trade cooperation relations between the two countries, Li Peng said that the trade relationship between China and Mongolia is developing very rapidly, that bilateral trade is basically balanced, that the two countries have signed a number of working-level agreements, and that both countries have opened many border posts. China has become Mongolia's second-largest trading partner. China is willing to develop mutually beneficial cooperation with Mongolia. In the area of economic cooperation, the two countries may set up joint venture, establish enterprises in each other's country, and further expand the sphere of cooperation between the two countries. Jasray said that Mongolia attaches importance to developing trade relations with China and that he hopes the two countries will further discuss ways and areas for enhanced cooperation. He said that Mongolia also hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in the area of investment and to make joint efforts so that the cooperation between the localities and enterprises of the two countries will become more effective. He added that because Mongolia is a landlocked country, it is important to solve the transportation problem when developing economic and trade cooperation relations between the two countries. Mongolia is willing to make continued efforts to improve and enhance conditions in this regard. Jasray appreciated Li Peng's support for Mongolia becoming a nuclear-free zone. He also expressed satisfaction over the good cooperative relations between the two countries in the cultural and other fields. Jasray said that the Mongolian Government and people appreciate the Chinese Government's understanding of their economic difficulties and the economic assistance that China has provided to Mongolia. Jasray reaffirmed that the PRC is the sole legitimate government of China, that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory, and that the Mongolian Government will not enter into any official relations with Taiwan. Premier Li Peng expressed appreciation for this stand. Li Peng extended an invitation to Jasray to visit China at his convenience, an invitation which Jasray accepted with pleasure.
