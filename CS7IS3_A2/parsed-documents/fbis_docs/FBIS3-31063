Keri report: "Horn: We Have More Than One Suitable Prime Ministerial Candidate"] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Gyula Horn [chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] said that a year ago they had asked citizens various questions: What are their views on the current government? What suggestions do they have to remedy the social and economic problems? Whom would they welcome in the new parliament and government? In 1993, the social dialogue continued and the party's expert program was drawn up. At the same time, the MSZP began to select its individual candidates in 1993, in which the local organizations's views were most decisive. The same principles were used when the county lists were drawn up. The party's national organizations only had the right to express their views but could not directly influence the selection. [passage omitted] Horn admitted that the MSZP's national list was drawn up after fierce debates. He said that the place of Laszlo Bekesi and others were also debated. According to Horn, "it is very difficult to form a view on people because everyone is bound to be biased to a certain extent." As for Bekesi, he is a distinguished representative of the MSZP and has a determining role in the party's economic policy, Horn said. On the national list, even according to the original suggestion, Bekesi was ahead of many leaders of the party. However, the fact that he now is on the third place of the draft national list was a result of the discussions. "This is one of the ways in which we expressed the importance of economic policy and of Bekesi," Horn said, who considers internal debates in the party perfectly natural. Answering our question, he said that he could even imagine Bekesi as the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate, but it will not be up to Horn to decide this. [passage omitted] The Socialists have many times stated that they did not want to tie themselves down before the elections. "In other words, we are open to all democratic forces and at our congress [at the end of February] we wish to draw up the conditions for opening subsequent talks on forming a government, if the MSZP gets into this position," Horn said. He also explained that in this view, Hungary does not need a chancellor type prime minister because it is very likely that a number of parties will jointly form the next government. If the parties decide in advance who the members and the leader of the government should be, then it will be very difficult to reach a coalition agreement. He added that, rather than insisting on posts, the MSZP wants the best representatives of the given area to be in the positions. Therefore, these people will not necessarily come from the coalition parties. [passage omitted] To the assumption that, even in case of a successful election performance, the MSZP would find Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats, suitable as prime minister, and the Socialists would occupy the key ministerial positions, Horn said that Kuncze is not the MSZP's prime ministerial candidate but they are open even to him. However, all this depends on the election results and the coalition talks, he added. About the danger of the so-called left-wing bloc, Horn said that some form of election cooperation between left-wing parties is natural in all democratic countries. However, this is not the case in Hungary, he stated. The MSZP does not wish to work together with the Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] or the Labor Party. "In the past four years, we have not had any contact with the MSZDP and, as for the Labor Party, we have not even talked to each other," he said. Therefore, everything that is said about the danger of the left-wing bloc is mere speculation and has nothing to do with reality, Horn confirmed. [passage omitted]
