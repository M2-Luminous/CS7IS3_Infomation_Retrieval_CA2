I am the new chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS]! This is how the SNS chairman welcomed journalists at the party's regular news conference today. [passage omitted] After the news conference, Jan Slota spoke to our correspondent Lydia Mrazova. [passage omitted] [Begin recording] [Mrazova] Mr. Chairman, in an interview for the SLOVENSKY NAROD newspaper, you said that your members and sympathizers were aware of the danger threatening the Slovak Republic. "Danger" is a very serious term that can hide anything. What, then, is your interpretation of danger in current politics? [Slota] I understand the term "danger" as two distinct dangers. On the one hand, as the communist danger, and, on the other, as a danger from the south. As regards the former, I wish to stress that it would be very dangerous if Slovaks supported left-wing parties because, in 1948, this danger was also underestimated. Perhaps not so much in Slovakia, but, all the same, eventually communism was planted in Slovakia, too, and we know very well what sort of time followed, the 1950's and all that. So the Slovaks should not forget the past. As regards the latter, the south, well, anyone who does not wish to see will not see. But we, SNS members, really do see how Slovaks in the south of Slovakia, the very people whose state and territory this is, find themselves in a position of an ethnic minority. Slovaks are afraid and migrate to the north. In a word, they are afraid to assert themselves as Slovaks. [passage omitted] [end recording]
