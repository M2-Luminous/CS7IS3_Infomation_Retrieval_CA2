The new agency, to be called the Central Directorate for Immigration Control and the Fight Against Employment of Illegal Aliens (DICILEC), will begin operations on January 15 with senior police official Robert Broussard at its head. Interior Minister Charles Pasqua, who announced the move on French television late Wednesday [5 January], said the government was "obliged to take coercive and administrative measures" to stem the tide of illegal aliens. "Once we have sent back several planeloads or boatloads, the world will get the message," he said, referring to the deportation of aliens aboard government-chartered transportation. The government was forced to give up this method after the deportation of 101 Malians by chartered aircraft in October 1986 caused a popular uproar in France. Arguing that France "cannot take on the misery of the entire world," Pasqua warned that the country's immigration problems could only get bigger. The system in Eastern Europe has disintegrated and "if clashes break out there, we will not avoid a huge wave of immigration," he said. In Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, Pasqua said that "by the end of the decade there will be 130 million North Africans, including nearly 60 million aged under 20 with no prospects and, further south, one billion other Africans." He noted, however, that coercion and new rules would "not solve the problem alone." France should lead a "crusade for development" in countries where the emigrants came from, he said. "If one percent of GDP (gross domestic product) were devoted to this, the problem would be solved," he said. The 1993 state budget allocated 0.58 percent of GDP to development aid. France is currently home to 4.1 million foreigners out of a total population of 57 million. Each year up to 100,000 people enter French territory legally, usually by joining relatives residing there (58,000 in 1991) or by requesting political asylum (about 12,000 in 1991). Pasqua hopes this figure will be halved as a result of measures taken since the conservative government of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur came to power in March. Over the past several months, several laws -- some of which required a modification of the constitution -- have tightened controls over immigration in France. Because of these new laws, the right to asylum has been restricted, the conditions for acquiring residency permits and French nationality have been tightened and deportation measures have been relaxed. There were 568 deportations from France from January 1 to October 31, a 21 percent increase over the same period in 1992. French police have also carried out an increasing number of identity-control operations over the past few weeks. According to a survey conducted in October, 59 percent of the French population consider immigration as a threat to the economy and 58 percent feel there are too many immigrants in the country.
