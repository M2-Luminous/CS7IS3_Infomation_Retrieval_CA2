FR940613-0-00078 FR940613-0-00015 This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Although its effect will be to prevent the expansion of the ISTEA vehicle network beyond that which States allowed on June 1, 1991, that is a direct result of the underlying statute. Moreover, there is no indication at this time that the States planned any significant expansion of that network which would be impeded by this requirement. This action merely implements requirements of the ISTEA. Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.217, Motor Carrier Safety.
