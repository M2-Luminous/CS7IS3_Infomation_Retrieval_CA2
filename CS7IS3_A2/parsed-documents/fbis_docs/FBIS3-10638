Declaring itself "on a war footing" over the new decree, the Association of Argentine Banks (Adeba) criticized the measure, which opens up financial markets in Argentina and eliminates the "principle of reciprocity." The association also prepared a document urging the government to "reevaluate" the 21 February decree. Adeba head Eduardo Escassany warned that an increase in banks in Argentina would not cause interest rates to drop. He asserted that "even though, in practice, reciprocity has never been enforced," Argentina has just lost a "bargaining chip" for negotiating on world markets. Former Central Bank President Javier Gonzalez Fraga deemed the measure "unnecessary" and "counterproductive," adding that globalization of the economy should be a "two-way street."
