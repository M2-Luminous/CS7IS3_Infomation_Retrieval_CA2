According to the document, no construction of new horse racing and golf courses is allowed in the future. All provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are expected to strictly follow the "four no's principles": No horse racing and golf courses established as listed projects; no permission granted to such projects; no land provided; and no loans given. An informed source in Beijing said: The State Council transmitted the document to various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country in mid-January, requiring them not to grant permission to construction of new horse racing and golf courses as of the day the document was received. In the meantime, the Construction Ministry, the State Land Administration Bureau, the PRC State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State General Administration of Taxation jointly issued a circular stressing that no licenses, land, and loans shall be given to projects involving a high rate of consumption, including horse racing and golf courses. This is another specific administrative measure against the building of new golf courses since the national conference for land bureau directors held last October. It is reported that central authorities had earlier made it a rule that apart form a few major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, where golf courses have been built, only one golf course shall be built in each province and municipality. However, many provinces ignored the order and pressed ahead with the construction of golf courses under the pretext that a good recreational environment is necessary for attracting foreign funds. Take Hainan for example, the provincial government gave formal approval to 15 golf courses last year and more golf courses are in preparation pending permission. The same source said: Many people on the mainland are presently interested in "speculating in certificates," believing "speculating in real estate is more profitable than speculating in stocks; speculating in futures is more profitable than speculating in real estate; and speculating in membership cards is more profitable than speculating in futures." "Speculating in" golf club membership cards serves as a shortcut to getting rich. Possessing a golf club membership card is regarded as enjoying a higher social status.
