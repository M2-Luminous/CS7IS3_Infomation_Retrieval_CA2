FR940114-1-00012 FR940114-1-00003 If States no longer need to meet specific MCI reactor prevalence rates, we believe it is even more important for the States to concentrate on the activities required following identification of an MCI reactor (tracebacks, epidemiologic investigations, and, usually, herd testing or quarantine). The epidemiologic investigation and herd testing can reveal whether an MCI reaction is a spurious titer or a valid indication of brucellosis. If herd testing reveals one or more animals that test positive to the official test for brucellosis (brucellosis reactors), all other animals in the herd are considered brucellosis exposed. Brucellosis reactor cattle and brucellosis exposed cattle may move interstate only in accordance with subpart B of part 78 (§§78.5 through 78.14), to control the spread of brucellosis. If a herd is quarantined in lieu of testing following epidemiologic investigation of an MCI reactor herd, the quarantine protects against the possibility that the herd may be infected and could spread brucellosis. Herd testing or quarantine only occur for MCI reactor cases that are ``successfully closed'' (defined below). The larger the number of MCI reactor cases that are not successfully closed, the greater the possibility that brucellosis could spread from herds associated with the uninvestigated MCI reactors. Therefore, we are proposing to require that a minimum percentage of MCI reactor cases must be successfully closed. We would consider MCI reactor cases that have been traced to the farm of origin to be successfully closed when: (1) An epidemiologic investigation is completed within specified time limits; and (2) the herd is tested, or State or APHIS animal health officials confine the animals to their premises under quarantine; or (3) State or APHIS animal health officials determine there is justification for not testing the herd or quarantining it. We propose to add to §78.1 a definition of ``successfully closed case'' that reflects this standard for successful closure.
