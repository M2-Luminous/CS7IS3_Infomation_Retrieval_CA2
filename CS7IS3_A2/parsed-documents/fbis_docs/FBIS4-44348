They could refer to the unanimous predictions of virtually all international financial strategists, and there was absolutely no indication that, just like last year, the dollar rate might again fall into a deep "summer hole." Rising U.S. interests were making the American currency attractive, the economy was flourishing, NAFTA was to provide additional stimulus for industry, which was working at capacity anyway. Some analysts even saw the dollar rise to the level of 2 German marks [DM] or 14 schillings after the American currency had plummeted to DM1.60 or about 11 schillings in the middle of last year. The dollar has now dropped to that level again to the surprise of everyone, at least in Europe. Yet, the real reason for the weakness of the dollar is probably to be found further east. In Tokyo, the U.S. currency stands at just 100 yen, which is a historic low. Fifty years after Pearl Harbor, this might impair the Americans' self assurance; economically, however, it is a blessing for the U.S. economy, which suffered a more than $60-billion record deficit last year in trade with Japan. The lower the dollar falls, the more expensive Japanese cars become, for example, on the American market. Or vice versa: To remain competitive, the Japanese must put up with losses in sales -- they get fewer yen for each dollar they gain in the United States from their exports. The dollar is almost 10 percent down from last year's high. This also explains why political experts in the United States not only acknowledge the decline of the dollar with relative indifference but even deliberately produced it. Gail Fosler, chief economist of the New York-based "Conference Board" business organization, in a predicition that received wide international attention, said that the dollar might drop as low as DM1.50. His analysis is regarded as one important cause for the slump of the dollar. Fosler has, of course, provided good reasons: The German economy was recovering, which would lead to rising interests in Europe, making the dollar less attractive compared to the German mark; prices for oil, metals, and agricultural products might force up inflation in the United States in the second half of the year and affect the economy. Investors got the message and promptly sold dollars. They now prefer to invest in European currencies and the yen. Yet, this is only the obviously rational element of the dollar spectacle. In reality, "negative remarks to force down the U.S. currency" are an important part of the determined campaign against the flood of Japanese exports. In the middle of February, U.S. President Clinton, who was visibly upset, had to recognize in the summit talks with then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa that his partner in the talks was not ready to conclude an efficient trade agreement. For a moment, the Americans considered discriminating against Japanese products on the American market through a decree. Yet, even in the United States, which certainly has very few scruples as far as this is concerned, such a step would have been regarded as a rather primitive blow against the unwanted competitor. Yet, what a coincidence: Since then, prominent U.S. economists and political experts have analyzed the dollar systematically down. Soon the dollar would be worth no more than 80 or 90 yen, they predict -- and the Japanese industry already sees itself confronted with enormous losses on the U.S. market. This is, of course, a much more elegant way of conducting a trade war. Plus, it also explains why the Americans are currently only making half-hearted attempts to effectively stabilize the course of the dollar. Undesired side effects, such as higher prices for certain imports, only play a relatively insignificant role in this trade war.
