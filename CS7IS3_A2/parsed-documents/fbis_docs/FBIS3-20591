At the time the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into Xinjiang had already aroused vigilance on the part of Yang Zengxin, then governor and military commander of Xinjiang Province. He regarded the infiltration as a potential threat to stability in Xinjiang, and adopted preventive, restrictive, and crackdown measures, which played some role in maintaining social stability in Xinjiang. I Pan-Islamism is also translated as Greater Islamism, and was founded by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani. During the middle of last century, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani began to have Pan-Islamic ideas. He advocated uniting believers of Islam, reinvigorating Islam, and resisting Western colonialism's influence on the politics, economics, and culture of the Islamic countries. At the time such ideas had some progressive role to play in opposing the colonialist aggression carried out by Western powers. However, such supranational, suprastate, and supraclass narrow religious views were later used by feudal autocratic and imperialist forces as their ideological tools for carrying out aggression in the relevant regions. The most devoted promoter of Pan-Islamism was Abdul Hamid II of the Ottoman Empire (the predecessor of the Republic of Turkey and commonly called Ottoman Turkey). He came to power through a coup in 1876. As the head of government he proclaimed himself "sultan," and as a religious leader he proclaimed himself "caliph," practicing theocratic feudal rule. But the size of his realm was no longer comparable to that in the past. The purpose of his effort to promote Pan-Islamism was to try to bring believers of Islam all over the world under the rule of the sultan and caliph of the Ottoman Empire, so as to relive the historical experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past which had stretched across the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Pan-Turkism has often been mistranslated as the doctrine of Greater Turkey. The ancestor of Turkey was a Turkic tribe which moved westward during the Middle Ages; the chief of that tribe was Osman. The Osmani Turks moved from Central Asia to Western Asia, and gradually became the Turkish nation through assimilating local peoples. Pan-Turkism advocated that Turkey unite all turkic-speaking peoples, that is, to establish a great Turkic empire headed by Turkey, stretching from the Bosporus to the Altay mountains, or even from the Mediterranean to the Pacific Ocean; obviously a large part of China's territory, including Xinjiang, would be included. Pan-Turkism was the same as Pan-Islamism, and there was no difference in essence between the two. The aim of Pan-Turkism was also to relive the experience of the Ottoman Empire of the past. Ideas of Pan-Turkism originated among the Turkic-speaking Tatars in tsarist Russia. Ismail Gasprinski was an early representative figure of the effort to propagate Pan-Turkism. He founded JOURNAL OF TURKMENISTAN in the Crimea in 1878 and founded the journal TERCUMAN in 1883, calling on Turkic-speaking peoples to get united. Each edition of that journal had 5,000-6,000 copies, some of which were brought from Central Asia to the Xinjiang region. By early this century propagating Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism had become an important component of the means used in imperialist aggression. There were then as many as over 200 publications propagating those ideas. In 1909 the Committee of Union and Progress of Turkey (called the Young Turks by the Europeans) overthrew Hamid II and organized a new government. Politically that government advocated constitutional monarchy, and ideologically it made energetic efforts to promote Pan-Turkism, allowing Pan-Turkic organizations to operate openly. After the October Revolution many Pan-Turkic activists infiltrated the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union. They distributed tens of thousands of propaganda pamphlets, smuggled firearms into the region, and tried to incite the Turkic-speaking peoples to create disturbances; they were also already having a impact on China's northwestern border region--Xinjiang. II Because of geographical, ethnic, and religious factors, Xinjiang was all along coveted by Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces around the world. Shakhmatov and Kireyev, scholars of the Soviet Union, would argue: Yakub Beg who invaded Xinjiang in 1865 pursued an "adventurous, naked policy of Greater Islamism," and established a "feudal khanate."[.sup]1[/] This view warrants debate. In 1865 Pan-Islamism was in its infant stage. It was in the 1890s that Pan-Islamism came to be given attention and exploited by Hamid II, sultan of Ottoman Turkey. However by that time Yakub Beg and his aggressor regime had already been buried by the Chinese people. It should be said that Yakub Beg exploited Islam in invading Xinjiang but did not start the effort to promote Pan-Islamism (i.e., Greater Islamism). Based on the historical data now available, generally it can be argued: During the period from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism began to be propagated in Xinjiang. The main manifestation was that Gasprinski's Pan-Turkic journal TERCUMAN had reached Xinjiang. In 1908 Maolamusha Sailami [3029 2139 2607 3097 6357 2139 4717] of Baicheng, Xinjiang, changed the title of his book A HISTORY OF ANNING into A HISTORY OF HAMID (the Chinese translation was YIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF YIMIDE) or HAIMIDE SHI (A HISTORY OF HAIMIDE). He wrote in the preface: Hamid II is the leader and great protector of all Muslims. As shown here, Pan-Islamism had already had some influence on people of the religious community in Xinjiang, but cannot be said to have already produced harmful effects on society. It was during the early years of the republic after the 1911 Revolution that harmful effects on social safety in Xinjiang began to be produced. When Yang Zengxin ruled Xinjiang in the early years of the republic, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism infiltrated Xinjiang in a substantial manner. The infiltration was manifested in the following several ways: 1. Running schools. Under the flag of having a new kind of school, efforts were made to instill ideas of Pan-islamism and Pan-Turkism into the minds of adolescents. Ahmad Kamal, a Turkish subject, run a school in southern Xinjiang, and Masud Sabri, who had returned home after studying in Turkey, run a school in Ili. These were two obvious examples. In March 1914 Ahmad Kamal, 25 years old at the time, came to Xinjiang on a tourist visa. When teaching at the Ottoman Unity Force School in Istanbul, Turkey, two years earlier, he had got acquainted with members of the Committee of Union and Progress, Fuat Koprulu, Ziya Gokalp, Mehmed Talat, and others, who were all active promoters of Pan-Turkism. For instance, Ziya Gokalp later published the book Turkculugun Esaslam (The Principles of Turkism). Mehmed Talat was a leader of the Committee of Union and Progress. He led a secret organization, the task of which was to propagate Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism outside Turkey. Toward the end of 1913, during their pilgrimage journey to Mecca some hajjis from Xinjiang came to Istanbul, Turkey, travelling in a roundabout fashion, and were received by Mehmed Talat. At that time a member of the wealthy Husayn Bay family of Artush, Xinjiang, proposed to hire Turkish teachers to teach in Xinjiang, so as to improve the cultural and scientific knowledge of Uighur adolescents. Mehmed Talat immediately realized that this was a wonderful opportunity to have ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism infiltrate Xinjiang of China; so he agreed to the proposal right away and sent Ahmad Kamal to Xinjiang. When Ahmad Kamal arrived in Artush around mid-February after leaving Istanbul, he was received by Husayn Bay and Baha al-Din. According to Buguozhai Wendu [The Correspondence of Yang Zengxin] by Yang Zengxin, Bawuding [1572 0063 0002] and Yiming'aili [5902 2494 5337 6849] of the local gentry hired Ahmad as a teacher at Small Artush Village. The school was divided into two or three parts which were situated in Beijie and Genggongci. The scripture was the main subject being taught, while such subjects as medicine and arithmetics were also taught. In addition, according to Burhan: Baodingbayi [0545 0002 1572 0181], a wealthy businessman in Kashi hired Ahmad Kamal from Turkey as a teacher, and built a school in Artush, which was to exclusively engage in propagating Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism.[.sup]2[/] On 19 April 1914 Ahmad Kamal opened a normal school in Artush with three classes, mainly admitting local elementary school leavers at the age of 15 or older, including some children from wealthy families. There was also a special class which admitted exclusively those students who had learned some Arabic and Persian from imams. In addition to religion courses there were also history, geography, art, and gymnastics courses. Teaching materials consisted entirely of translations of Turkish textbooks, and printing machines transported here from Istanbul were used to print them. The journal ULU DIN was also printed. Ahmad Kamal forced the school to accept the sultan of Ottoman Turkey as the leader and to regard the caliph of Ottoman Turkey as the spiritual father, and only allowed students to sing Turkish songs.[.sup]3[/] He used the school as a position in the battle of propagating ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, and spread ideological poisons harmful to China and the Chinese nation with regard to state and national identity, thereby poisoning the adolescents. Masud Sabri was from Ili, Xinjiang, and was born to a wealthy family in 1887. In 1904 he went to Ottoman Turkey to study medicine. He came to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism in Istanbul. After returning home in 1915, he, together with a few Turkish subjects, operated hospitals and schools in Ili. When speaking to students, they openly advocated the idea that "our ancestors were Turks" and that "our motherland is Turkey,"[.sup]4[/] and other ideas, completely deviating from the fundamental interests of the country and the nation and thus becoming spokesmen of foreign aggressors. According to Masud himself: he operated the Turan, Deernaike, and Dongmaihailai schools in Ili.[.sup]5[/] The usual translation of Turan is now "Tulan." The Turkish Pan-Turkic theorist Ziya Gokalp argued that Turan was the "great motherland" of all Turks. The intention of using this term as the name of a school in Xinjiang was very obvious. At that time Yang Zengxin sent Prefecture Administrator Xu Guozhen to inspect the counties in Ili. It was found out that schools there were purely religious in nature, having no teachers of the Chinese language. It was thus suggested that the situation "be rectified immediately." According to later statistics: in the 1920s teaching was carried out completely in Turkish in the eight schools in Ili, with 28 classes, 68 teachers, and over 2,000 students. Only three of those schools offered Chinese language courses. Those schools became important places used by Masud and others for propagating Pan-Turkism. The instances of foreigners' openly operating schools in Xinjiang, especially in southern Xinjiang, were not isolated. For instance, in 1915 Luxierwaner [7120 1585 1422 1354 1422], a Tatar (customarily called tataer in Xinjiang), secretly opened a school in Kuche; in 1916 Yakefu [3660 0668 3940] (also translated as Akububoke [7093 1655 1580 0130 0344]) opened a vocational school in Shache. In 1920 Imam Musuer [4476 4790 1422] of Turpan and others hired a Tatar Hasanmihaiyideer [0761 2718 4717 3189 0044 1779 1422] and others to secretly open a school; also a Turkish national named Ismail Haqqi was sent by Ahmad Kamal to open a school in Hetian, etc. In those schools some domestic and foreign forces propagated ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, and selected and trained their agents. 2. Using religious activities to propagate ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism. There were imams teaching the scripture in all the cities, towns, and villages in Islamic areas of Xinjiang. Early this century this front was also exploited by some Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces. In 1917 Yang Zengxin reported to the Internal Affairs Ministry that Turkish subjects were conducting rampant fomenting activities in the name of propagating the scripture, posing an unimaginable potential threat. The Internal Affairs Ministry returned a telegram the next year, claiming that it had been determined that the phenomenon of hiring Turkish subjects to teach the scripture was widespread across all the counties. It was also emphasized that "as Turkey and Germany are in an alliance and as China has declared war on Germany, Turkish subjects in Xinjiang will unavoidably carry out rampant cryptic fomenting activities in the name of propagating the scripture."[.sup]6[/] As shown here, the cryptic fomenting activities carried out by some forces in the name of religious activities had already produced some impact, arousing attention from the central and local authorities. Without authorization, some mosques and scripture schools hired foreigners as Islam-propagating imams and teachers. Among those hired, some abused their forums and cryptically advocated evil ideas in the name of propagating the scripture and the Prophet's messages. Many of those who attended the scripture-propagating activities were seriously poisoned. In launching a rebellion in Kuche in 1918, Maimaitielihan [6314 6314 6993 0500 3063] and others spread a rumor about the reincarnation of Mohammed so as to incite the local Muslim masses to a rebellion. In addition they used the slogan of "get rid of the Hans,"[.sup]7[/] adopting an open anti-Han stand and openly trying to evict the Hans. They were intentionally trying to foment ethnic hatred and to destroy the historical tradition of hundreds or thousands of years of the Uighur and Han nationalities's coexistence, coprosperity, and joint efforts to develop the border areas of the motherland as well as the profound friendship between the two nationalities. 3. Conducting propagating activities targeted at ordinary Muslims who went aborad on pilgrimage and who were worshiping at mosques. Each year around 10,000 people from Xinjiang went to the holy place of Mecca on pilgrimage, travelling there through India or Central Asia. Some of those people would consciously or unconsciously come to espouse ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, and bring back various books and journals; especially, those written in Turkish (the old script used before the reform) were mostly easily propagated and spread in Xinjiang. Some people also founded journals and wrote articles in Xinjiang. The aforementioned Ahmad Kamal first operated schools and published publications in southern Xinjiang, and then came to Urumqi where he on the one hand propagated Gasprinski's TERCUMAN, Jarullah's work Uzun Kunlarda Ruza (A Young Man in the Long Days) and others, and on the other hand devoted more energy to publishing the journal YENGI HAYAT, of which 30 issues were published. Ahmad Kamal himself said that the journal "has more directly, fervently, and candidly pointed out the way for Muslims."[.sup]8[/] As reported, at that time some people also founded the journal TURAN. In Xinjiang where there was a severe shortage of reading materials in the languages of the nationalities, the two journals produced unusual effects on Muslim youths. Also Chief Imam Abuduojiayidamaola [7093 0008 1122 0502 5902 1129 3029 2139] of Kashi requested several times for the permission to publish journals but the requests were rejected. Thus he put up handwritten propaganda posters in mosques, and read those posters to the masses, creating a large impact. Efforts were also made to print and circulate the book A Concise Biography of the Prophet Mohammed written in 1928 by Sabit Damullah (who became the prime minister of the illegitimate "Islamic Republic of Eastern Turkestan" in 1933). In addition some foreign institutions and individuals and consulates of foreign countries in Xinjiang also mailed and sent propaganda material to some government officials. In 1917 Prefecture Administrator Zhu Ruixi of Kashi received letters and documents from foreign Islamic leaders, which urged Chinese Muslims to ally with Germany in the First World War. Surely such letters and documents were not just sent to Zhu Ruixi alone. In 1918 the British Consulate in Kashi sent to the county governments copies of the declaration by the governor of Mecca which called on the Arabs to shake off alien rule and achieve independence. All this constituted indirect and cryptic fomenting efforts targeted at the Muslim masses, and the intention involved was to create division and turmoil so as to harm the country. III The infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into Xinjiang aroused attention from Yang Zengxin from the very beginning. In order to maintain social stability in Xinjiang and safeguard his position as the ruler as well as national security, he adopted some preventive, restrictive, and punitive measures, producing some effects. First, during the First World War, Turkey sided with Germany and exploited Pan-Turkism in carrying out aggression against other countries. After China severed her diplomatic relations with Germany, Yang Zengxin gave even greater attention to the activities of German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang. He ordered a check on German and Turkish subjects in Xinjiang, and took different actions on the different cases after facts were ascertained. In 1915 Magistrate Xiao Jianzhang of Shufu County reported that Ahmad Kamal was serving as a teacher at Small Artush Village. Yang Zengxin immediately checked the person's background, and at the same time reported to the Foreign Ministry of the Northern Warlord Government. He argued that as the European war was now going on, Turkish subjects were enemy aliens, and that if strict preventive and restrictive measures were not taken, they would unavoidably try to confuse and poison the minds of local people. "This will not only have harmful effects on diplomacy but also unavoidably pose a potential threat to China."[.sup]9[/] Consequently he ordered the closing of the elementary school run by Ahmad Kamal, and imprisoned the people involved. Although the school was later permitted to operate, it was explicitly stipulated that there be no manifestations of loyalty to Turkey and that Chinese language courses be offered. After being imprisoned for two years in Urumqi, Ahmad Kamal was repatriated to Turkey vie Shanghai in 1919. Those moves undoubtedly dealt a severe blow to the Pan-Islamic and Pan-Turkic forces which had infiltrated Xinjiang. In August 1916 Magistrate Liu Rentan reported that a Turkish subject Yakefu established a so-called vocational school, again arousing vigilance on the part of Yang Zengxin. He issued to his subordinates an order that Turkish subjects be prohibited from being hired as teachers and that Turkish subjects be prohibited from opening schools. As a result the authorities banned all the schools in such places as Kuche and Turpan which had been found to be using foreigners to do the teaching. In February 1917, after learning that the Chinese Government had severed her diplomatic relations with Germany, Yang Zengxin immediately ordered a check on Turkish subjects in Xinjiang. Those who were engaged in legitimate business activities were given effective protection after the number of people, the businesses in which they were engaged, and the amount of property were ascertained; those propagating and teaching the scripture were prohibited from serving as imams, but were to be given effective protection, and were barred from leaving the country for the time being; as it was difficult to make sure that illegal businessmen and those who had, in an unauthorized manner, come to Xinjiang without tourist visas were not spies, strict precautionary measures were to be taken, and when necessary, it was permitted to detain those people, who would then be prohibited from leaving the country before their identities were ascertained. Yang Zengxin reported to the Internal Affairs Ministry, stating that If not being subjected to special restrictions, the Turkish subjects hired as imams in Xinjiang could pose a threat in various ways, and requesting that the Internal Affairs Ministry approve the continuation of the ban on Turkish subjects' propagating and teaching the scripture. The Internal Affairs Ministry returned a telegram to give its approval, while pointing out: "The matter involves local public order and is therefore not a light matter. It is necessary to conduct a check and impose a ban."[.sup]10[/] In March Yang Zengxin gave his subordinates an order that if German or Turkish subjects were found in any place in Xinjiang, facts about them be ascertained, and they be detained on the spot and prohibited from having contacts with local people. At the time intelligence reports showed that seven Turkish subjects, carrying a huge amount of money, were going to travel from Gansu to Xinjiang in order to establish contact with Muslims. Yang Zengxin immediately sent telegrams to magistrates of the counties of Yanqi, Weili, Qiemo, and Ruoqiang, asking them to check the situation and take precautionary measures; at the same time he ordered a calvary force led by Company Commander Zou Weixin to move from Korla to Ruoqiang, so as to prevent Turkish subjects from secretly travelling to Xinjiang from Dunhuang. In April the provincial government instructed each of the relevant county magistrates in southern Xinjiang to submit a report on the number of Turkish subjects living in the county. It was emphasized that Turkish subjects should keep themselves engaged in their own businesses and be prohibited from travelling to all the places to get involved in fomenting activities. Those who had lived in China for many years and who had not violated the law should be regarded as local residents, and those who had not gone through the procedure for acquiring Chinese citizenship should go through such citizenship procedure now, thereby becoming permanent Chinese citizens. Yang Zengxin's check on the Turkish subjects who lived permanently or temporarily in Xinjiang and the Turkish subjects whose identities were unclear and whose behavior was suspicious lasted two or three years, resulting in some crackdown and restrictive effects on the activities of some lawless elements. Second, Yang Zengxin realized that Xinjiang was in a unique geographical position, and thus paid great attention to the influence on Xinjiang exerted by some Central Asian countries bordering on Xinjiang. In 1916 Yang Zengxin said in his report to the Northern Warlord Government: "Xinjiang is alone, situated outside the Great Wall. It is bordered by Russian territories to the northeast and British India to the southwest. Without exception, there are foreign businessmen and residents in each of the 40 counties of Xinjiang. As many foreigners have come, any error in dealing with them would immediately lead foreign countries to intervene diplomatically."[.sup]11[/] An increasing number of foreigners, especially Turkish subjects and people of British India, entered the country from Afghanistan. In order to strengthen defense forces, Yang Zengxin decided to send forces stationed at the provincial capital to provide support. Thus as ordered, an army calvary force led by Ma Fengzhang and Dou Juxu moved to Puli County (Tashkurghan), becoming a garrison force there. With regard to the aforementioned letters and documents that foreign Islamic leaders had specially asked people to deliver to the prefecture administrator of Kashi, he ordered that the delivery people, together with the letters and documents, be made to leave the country under escort. He also issued a document to the localities, asking them to try their best to collect and burn copies of the declaration by the governor of Mecca that the British had distributed in Xinjiang. In 1918 Yang Zengxin issued an order, banning unauthorized establishment of places of worship and prohibiting foreigners from using religious activities in places of worship for carrying out sinister plots. At the beginning of the next year he also issued an order to prohibit foreigners from serving as imams, describing those Islam-propagating imams as a source of disturbances. Their activities both had a religious element and affected local public order. If the activities were not banned, the potential threats posed by them could not be eliminated. Third, while precautionary measures were taken against foreign-originated ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, coercive measures were taken against local people who had induced fomenting and deceptive propaganda from abroad. In September 1925 Yang Zengxin instructed the prefecture administrator of Kashi to impose punishments on Bawuding and Yiming'aili of the local gentry, who had hired the Turkish subject Ahmad Kamal as a teacher; the next year Masud Sabri was arrested for operating a school in Ili to propagate splittist ideas and was sent to the provincial capital Dihua (Urumqi) under escort. He personally interrogated Masud Sabri three times; Masud Sabri was released after being detained for one year. Yang Zengxin used force to put down the rebellion which Maimaitielihan and others instigated in Kuche through using religious and ethnic slogans. By openly resisting domestic and foreign hostile forces' efforts to carry out, through exploiting Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism, aggression against Xinjiang and activities of instigating the division of Xinjiang, Yang Zengxin both maintained his own position as the ruler and contributed to the unity of the country and unity among the nationalities. Nevertheless he was just a feudal bureaucratic warlord, and it was impossible for the measures he adopted to fundamentally suppress the infiltration of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism into Xinjiang. After his assassination in 1928, ideas of Pan-Islamism and Pan-Turkism got propagated in Xinjiang even more extensively because of the changes in the international situation, quickly getting Xinjiang caught in even greater turmoil.
