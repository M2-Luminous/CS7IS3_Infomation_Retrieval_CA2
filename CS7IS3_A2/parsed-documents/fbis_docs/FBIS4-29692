Hong Kong Electric Power is building two 350,000 kilowatt electric power facilities as part of the electric power base that it has been developing on Lamma Island since 1980. The amount of the order is about 11 billion yen, and it will be the largest overseas project that the company has received by itself. Taking advantage of this, it is thinking of trying to get orders for power plants in China. The order received is for execution of the No. 7 and No. 8 Hong Kong Lamma Island thermoelectric power stations. They are coal power stations with an output of 350,000 kilowatts, and will be built on a site of about 50,000 square meters. No. 7 is scheduled to begin operation in December 1995, and No. 8 in December 1997. The company has already dispatched about 10 technicians to the site and begun steel framework on the boiler portion. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries was in charge of design. The two power facilities are comprised of a turbine generator, boiler, desulfurization equipment, coal conveyor facility, and coal incineration ash collection device, and the company is in charge of this work as a package. It is expected that it will dispatch at peak times about 50 expert technicians in charge of the boiler, electrical controls, etc. Actual execution will be left to three local cooperating companies such as Power Generation Process Corp. (Hong Kong). However, it is expected that company technicians will be in charge of important portions such as the boiler welding work. The Lamma Island Power Plant construction project began in 1980, and so far six coal thermoelectric power plants and six gas turbine power facilities are in operation. The performance of the company in undertaking jointly with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries execution of five coal thermoelectric power plants and gas turbines was assessed and it succeeded in receiving this order. When Hong Kong returns to China in 1997, it appears that Hong Kong Electric Power, which has ample capital, will embark on construction of power plants in Mainland China. Taihei Dengyo is strengthening its relationship with Hong Kong Electric Power by this big order and would like to receive orders for power plant construction work in China that is anticipated in the future.
