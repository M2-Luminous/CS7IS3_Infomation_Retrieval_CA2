Association President Nebojsa Tomovic assessed that the census was designed to provide a basis for dividing the F.R.Y.M. between the Macedonians and ethnic Albanians. It was also to enable federalization of this republic after the American-designed model used in the case of the Bosnian Moslem-Croatian Federation. The F.Y.R.M. has a population of about two million, according to the latest census in 1991. Ethnic Albanians accounted for 21 percent, although they claim their number was higher. "All this is being prepared behind the back of the Macedonian people, and the in-the-field decisions are being taken by American politicians according to intructions from Washington. The Serbs in Macedonia fully share the fate of the Macedonian people and oppose such U.S. plans on federalization of Macedonia," he said. The census, Tomovic added, was designed to reduce the number of Serbs in the F.Y.R.M. to an insignificant figure and thus eliminate their influence on the final outcome of such plans. Tomovic described as a provocation by the Macedonian authorities the fact that many Serb nationals -- originally from Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija -- when obtaining F.Y.R.M. citizenship papers discovered that Macedonian police had put down they came or were born in the "State of Kosovo". A strong separatist movement of ethnic Albanians, demanding a separate state and its secession from Serbia, was active for the past two decades in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo and Metohija. The Serbs and Montenegrins were increasingly frequently questioning the validity of the upcoming census, and even their participation in it because of the rigorous conditions set by citizenship legislation. Among other things, it requires 15 years of permanent residence in the F.Y.R.M. to obtain Macedonian citizenship. It is believed that several thousand Serbs and Montenegrins would not meet the conditions required for obtaining citizenship. In this way, the participation of the Serb community in the overall population of the F.R.Y.M. would drop. The F.R.Y.M. authorities, say Serbs accounted for about 2.2 percent of the population, while the Serbs there claim they number about 250,000, or above 10 percent.
