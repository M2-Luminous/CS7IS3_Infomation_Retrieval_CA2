FR940928-1-00026 FR940928-1-00008 Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Part 215 [FRA Docket No. RSFC&hyph;7, Notice No. 2] RIN 2130&hyph;AA68 Freight Car Safety Standards; Maintenance-of-Way Equipment AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), Department of Transportation (DOT). ACTION: Extension of comment period. SUMMARY: FRA is extending the comment period on its notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the Freight Car Safety Standards. The NPRM proposed changing the provisions in 49 CFR Part 215, by making all maintenance-of-way vehicles subject to the Standards with the exception of stenciled cars not used in revenue service and restricted to a speed of less than 20 miles per hour. The extension is necessary to clarify initial comments received from interested parties. DATES: Written comments must be received no later than November 28, 1994. Comments received after that date will be considered to the extent practicable without incurring additional expense or delay. ADDRESSES: Written comment should identify the docket number and the notice number and should be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590. Persons desiring to be notified that their written comments have been received by FRA should submit a stamped, self-addressed postcard with their comments. The Docket Clerk will indicate the date on which the comments were received and will return the postcard to the addressee. Written comments will be available for examination during regular business hours in room 8201 of the Nassif Building located at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Phil Olekszyk, Acting Deputy Associate Administrator for Safety Compliance and Program Implementation, Office of Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0897), or Cedestra L. Jordan, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20590 (telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: FRA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11238) to amend its Freight Car Safety Standards. The Freight Car Safety Standards, at 49 CFR 215.3(c)(3), exclude maintenance-of-way equipment from the requirements of Part 215, ``if that equipment is not used in revenue service and is stenciled in accordance with ยง215.305.'' The proposed amendment would add to the present regulation an additional condition which must be met before a freight car in maintenance-of-way service can be operated without complying with the Freight Car Safety Standards: the equipment must be operated at a speed of less than 20 mph. FRA has received comments from the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees; The American Short Line Railroad Association; the Brotherhood Railway Carmen Division, Transportation Communication International Union; the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway Company; and the Association of American Railroads (AAR). In light of comments received, particularly from the AAR, FRA is preparing a request for clarification on some issues presented in the AAR's comments. FRA's written request as well as any written response will be included in the docket and made available for review. Based on the comments received, FRA believes it would be beneficial to extend the comment period, so that all interested parties will have ample opportunity to comment. For these reasons, FRA has determined that an extension to November 28, 1994, is appropriate. In addition, FRA has not received any requests, formal or informal, for a hearing on this matter; therefore a hearing will not be scheduled. Donald M. Itzkoff, Federal Railroad Deputy Administrator.
