Pirated Products Cost Little, But Earn Big Money The copyright law in China only has a short history of two or three years. Although the start was late, the development has been rapid. China started out by first promulgating the PRC Copyright Law on 1 June 1991, and by 30 April 1993, China had already joined the Bern Copyright Convention, the Universal Copyright Convention, and the Cassette Products Convention, thus incorporating copyright protection in China into the international copyright system. When Dr. Bogsch, director general of World Intellectual Property Organization, visited China early this year, he described China's copyright protection as "from zero to everything." It was under the conditions that propaganda was inadequate, management was lagging behind, and copyright piracy and infringement was given room to grow that the legislation was adopted. The audiovisual business developed only in the last 10 years or so, and in particular, compact discs (CD) and laser discs (LD) spread and became popular at a surprising speed, while pirated CD's and LD's also developed simultaneously. According to people in the trade, it costs only three or four yuan to pirate a CD, then sell it at the price of the original CD if the packing is good and the quality is not bad. Generally, it can sell at 10 to 20 yuan. Low prices naturally attract many consumers, and some Hong Kong and Macao residents also go to Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Guangzhou to buy a large number of them. Lured by the low cost and the high profits, many audiovisual manufacturers and individual operators have participated in the production and sale of pirated CD's and LD's. Taking into account the smuggled goods pouring in from outside the province, even before inspection, the prices of pirated CD's and LD's in Guangdong had already dropped to 8 to 10 yuan and 160 yuan respectively. The smooth production and sales channels enabled piracy in the audiovisual market in Guangdong, and even in the whole country, to become increasingly rampant, and this not only seriously disrupted the local audiovisual publication market, but also caused concerns in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. At present, seven departments, including the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department, China Press and Publications Administration, and State Copyright Bureau have issued a joint notice, demanding strengthened management of work in duplicating CD's and LD's, as well as serious efforts to handle copyright piracy. Some Shops Close Doors Guangdong carried out six inspections of the audiovisual market last year, but the main goal was to wipe out "poisonous pornography" and counterfeit products. During the unified inspection campaign this time, over 1,600 stalls selling audiovisual products in the province were inspected in one day alone, over 140,000 pirated CD's and 1,300 LD's were seized and sealed for storage, and more than 80,000 videotapes were also seized. During the inspection campaign in Guangzhou, the relevant personnel made a special effort to inspect some electric appliances markets such as Yifa Mall in Panyu City, Haiyin Electric Appliances Concourse in Dongshan District, and Xicheng Electric Appliances City in Liwan District, and when they arrived at some stalls which refused inspection by closing their doors, they took compulsory measures. Thus, in one day, over 60,000 CD's were seized. In Zhuhai and Shenzhen, where the situation pirated CD's was rather serious, they also seized over 20,000 CD's. This morning, the Guangzhou City Copyright Bureau and the relevant departments took the lead in using a steamroller to crush some of the seized CD's and audiovisual products -- about 20,000 pieces -- in front of the public. The emergency action in Guangdong Province is still going on. Today in Guangzhou I have visited some popular spots which sell electric appliances, such as the Haiyin Electric Appliances Concourse and Huifu Road Electric Appliances Street, and I found that the often busy electric appliances markets have been deserted, some shops have shut their doors, and the windows which used to display numerous pirated CD's are empty or have only a few original CD's and LD's, while the shelves which were specifically used to keep pirated CD's are now being used to keep blank cassette tapes. Some stall owners told me that in the past, they knew generally that sales of pirated audiovisual products were not permitted by the state, but the profits were high, and the business had become popular in Guangdong, and they never received any notice saying that this was unlawful behavior and must be strictly banned, so they dared to do it. They also said that the confiscation this time did not really cause great economic losses to them, but they would not wantonly sell pirated CD's and LD's for a short period to come. Copyright Law Badly Needs To Be Publicized Looking at this mighty unified inspection campaign, various social quarters in Guangdong have responded differently. The departments in charge of culture and publications have hated this kind of copyright piracy and infringement for a long time, and a manufacturer of audiovisual products said that this kind of behavior, which infringes on the legitimate rights of copyright holders, should have been severely punished through legislation a long time ago. A person in charge of Guangdong Provincial Copyright Bureau said that the current 23 CD production lines in 16 factories inside the province will be included under press and publications management, and the China Press and Publications Administration will soon promulgate regulations on the registration and examination of CD copyrights, while the relevant departments will coordinate efforts with the customs department in cracking down on the smuggling of pirated CD's and LD's. Regarding the stalls or wholesalers which sell audiovisual products, a management method of "first permit, then license" will be practiced; that is, they must first apply for permits from the administrative department, then apply for licenses from the industrial and commercial management department. As for the manufacturers and retailers who stubbornly go the wrong way, they will be punished according to law. This move is not to restrict the development of CD's, but to guide the production of audiovisual products onto a healthy track of development. When the public saw piles of CD's being crushed to dust by the steamroller, the first response of many citizens was: Too bad. Some citizens said that original CD's, especially some new ones, are too expensive, whereas pirated CD's suit the purchasing power of the ordinary citizens. They added that some Hong Kong and Taiwan singers have also relied on pirated CD's and tapes to become popular on the mainland. Here we can see that it is an urgent task to crack down on copyright piracy and infringement, and to protect intellectual property; and that the relevant quarters must adopt corresponding measures to publicize the sense of the copyright law and establish the correct values among the citizens.
