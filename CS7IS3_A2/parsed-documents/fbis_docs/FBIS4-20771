These details included the fact that the budget deficit amounted to more than 50 percent of the total. At the beginning of this year, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT obtained some information indicating that the budget deficit totaled 40 billion Yemeni riyals [YR]. This is something that recently came to light when the new agencies said that the total budget was about YR74 billion and that the public revenues amounted to YR32 billion, whereas the deficit amounted to about YR42 billion. Yemeni economic, business, and financial sources had warned of the dangers of this deficit if the economic situation in the country continued as is as a result of matters piling up during the nation's transitional period to national unity and unlimited public expenditures. They warned of the consequences of the monetary policy that is being followed and the government's continued printing of more paper currency without sufficient backing--something that has weakened the value of the domestic currency vis-a-vis hard currencies and increased the rate of inflation. The sources, in subsequent statements, went on to say that the political crisis that has afflicted the nation since August [of 1993] has caused complication of the economic situation and the addition of new factors to the problem facing the nation's public budget. It was not known precisely how the Yemeni Government has managed to deal with the deficit in the nation's public budget, which has been steadily increasing during the last year. But economic sources have indicated that one approach it has used has been that of printing more Yemeni currency bills and flooding the market with them. This has recently led to the collapse of the Yemeni currency vis-a-vis hard currencies, especially the U.S. dollar, the price of which in the parallel market has increased to more than five times its official price declared by the Yemeni Central Bank. It has not yet been possible to determine accurately how these huge amounts of money, included in the public budget deficit, have been spent. But the sources have indicated that the total spent on wages, salaries, compensations, and other such payments amounts to far more than 50 percent of the total budget, which is YR74 billion, according to the latest information. What this means is that even the total in revenues is unable to cover the salaries and wages earned by more than one-half million Yemenis, that is, the total number of persons employed in the nation's public sector, administrative apparatus, and armed forces units. The sources have said that the events of 1993--particularly the public elections that took place in April and subsequent political developments in the country, the last of which was the public census project they decided to postpone--also resulted in a new burden for the public budget. The government recklessly spent billions in order to deal with the demands of this experiment, and the two parties in power spent unlimited amounts of money in order to gain more supporters and mobilize them to confront the other side. Concerning the development projects and services programs, the sources have said that they were allotted only a small part of the public budget. No improvement worth mentioning has been noticed in services and infrastructure projects. Also, people have not noticed any new additions. The situation has remained as it was in previous years, or else has gotten even worse, especially with regard to roads, electricity, and water and sewage projects, which have noticeably come to a halt. The sources doubt that the Yemeni Government has resorted to borrowing from abroad to deal with the deficit that has afflicted the public budget, because relations with the lending nations that used to deal with Yemen are still angry about Yemen's position concerning the recent Gulf crisis (Iraq's occupation of Kuwait). Also, in the view of many of these nations, Yemen has become an oil-producing nation. Even when cooperation between Yemen and many of the nations and international organizations has continued, it is restricted to technical aid, consulting, [the acquisition of] special expertise, and some services projects, especially in the fields of public health, environmental health, etc. The sources considered that it is not possible, in any case, to hold any particular party responsible for the latest deficit afflicting the Yemeni public budget, in view of the fact that the fiscal and monetary policy does not differ much from that of the rest of the policies which have been followed by Yemen during its stage of unification. The government agencies have multiplied to an extent previously unknown in this country, and the Ministry of Finance, together with the Yemeni Central Bank, have been transformed into mere executive agencies who have no say in the formulation of policies and decisionmaking and cannot restrain the higher authorities that merely want to have their orders carried out without having to take into consideration the consequences of these orders--especially those dealing with the printing of more paper money to deal with ever-increasing expenditures. The sources remember how the statements exchanged between the leaders of the General People's Congress [GPC], and those of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] contained accusations concerning fiscal policy, public expenditures, wasting money, and not adhering to the rules and clauses dealing with spending the public budget. The leaders of the GPC consider that the YSP is directly responsible, since the prime minister, who belongs to it, is responsible for the steadily increasing expenditures and the printing of more paper currency in order to cover the salaries, wages, and compensations being paid out in the southern provinces. The YSP leaders are saying that the salaries they are talking about in the PCG do not amount to anything in comparison with the unlimited expenditures of the nation's president and the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and, in this regard, they refer to what 'Ali Salim al-Bid recently mentioned concerning the fact that the Central Bank is being administered by telephone from the Presidential Palace. Finally, the sources pointed out that the deficit that has afflicted Yemen's public budget is also the result of the fact that Yemeni society is accustomed to having the Public Treasury meet all of the expenditures. Recently some newspapers, by means of cartoons and satirical articles, have compared the treasury to a dairy cow that is expected to provide all the members of a family with what they need, without any serious thought being given to how to make it possible for the cow to always be able to do this.
