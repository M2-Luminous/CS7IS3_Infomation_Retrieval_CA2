The Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG reported on 27 April that the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe issued an opinion on 26 April that clears the way for the prosecution of individuals for the public utterance or publication of the "Auschwitz lie," the denial of the systematic murder of Jews in the concentration camps of the Third Reich. The case was brought by the Munich-Upper Bavaria district organization of the NPD (National Party of Germany) against Munich officials who had granted the party a permit for a public meeting only on the condition that no speaker utter a denial of the Holocaust. The Court's First Chamber, presided over by Constitutional Court President Roman Herzog, ruled that the "Auschwitz lie" is a palpably false assertion and a serious denigration of the reputation of both the actual victims and Jews still living in Germany. The Court thus ruled that it is not covered by freedom of speech, and is punishable under law. In contrast, in an opinion on a second case issued at the same time, the court ruled that banning a book in which the author denies German guilt for the outbreak of World War II would be unconstitutional and that the author's exposition of his historical thesis is protected under freedom of speech. This pair of decisions came only days after the Federal Supreme Court (BGH) had issued a written opinion substantiating its decision--announced on 15 March--overturning the public incitement conviction of NPD national chairman Guenter Deckert for spreading the "Auschwitz lie," and returning the case to the lower court for retrial. Since the BGH decision in the Deckert case had created the impression in some quarters that the "Auschwitz lie" was no longer punishable under law, as reported by SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG on 27 April, the Federal Constitutional Court, evidently in response, acted "unusually quickly" to issue its own unanimous opinion to the contrary. Commenting on the BGH decision in the Deckert case, Ursula Knapp in the Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU of 12 April described the current period as one in which no day passes without "anti-Jewish attacks," and anti-Semitism has again become a "topic" in Germany. In this atmosphere, if the federal judges were to hold to their view "that the `Auschwitz lie' in itself, without further evidence of neo-Nazi sentiment, can no longer be forbidden as public incitement, there would be dire consequences." In an indictment of the FRG political and legal establishment for having "prepared" the ground for the growth of right-wing extremism, Martin Winter, in the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU of 7 April, took aim at federal judges and other justice authorities: "Federal judges who cannot recognize public incitement in the Auschwitz lie make themselves just as culpable as protectors of the constitution, police officers, prosecutors, and judges who have long treated right-wing extremist perpetrators of violence with amazing leniency." No Acquittal Following the Federal Constitutional Court's decision, Joachim Kaeppner, in a signed page-one editorial in the Hamburg weekly DEUTSCHES ALLGEMEINES SONNTAGSBLATT of 29 April, defended the Federal Supreme Court judges, who had "never" meant their decision to be interpreted as an "acquittal" of the "Auschwitz lie," and cited the satisfaction of Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, with the Constitutional Court's unambiguous ruling which ensures that "there can never be an acquittal of the `Auschwitz lie.'" Thus, the "much maligned" judicial authorities, he asserted, "are proving themselves capable of putting up a fight against the right." Rudolf Wassermann, commenting in the Hamburg daily DIE WELT of 28 April, also welcomed the Constitutional Court's militant response to those who would deny the horrors of Nazism: "With the decision, Karlsruhe has knocked a weapon out of the hands of extremists on the far-right wing of the political spectrum." In a broader sense, since the deniers of the Holocaust "are betraying" the principles on which the Federal Republic was founded, "this state should be a militant democracy which defends itself when antidemocrats want to break loose." Two Lies Viewing the Court's seemingly divergent opinions on the "Auschwitz lie" and the "war guilt lie," the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, in an editorial on 27 April, posed the question: "How should a state which has been damaged throughout the world due to the neo-Nazis react to such propaganda nonsense?" In both cases the "basic rule of a free democracy," that each person should be able to say freely what he or she thinks, should apply, but with the proviso that "the right of freedom of speech gives no unlimited right to lies and insults." Christian Semler, in a signed editorial in the 27 April edition of the Berlin daily DIE TAGESZEITUNG, also welcomed the Constitutional Court's placing of limits on the freedom of public expression of opinion as it applies in the case of the "Auschwitz lie." With its decision, he writes, "the Constitutional Court has not so much broken new ground, as newly staked out the boundaries on familiar territory." At a time when even the Office for the Protection of the Constitution has "no criteria for right-wing extremism in Germany," Hans Schueler wrote in the Hamburg weekly DIE ZEIT of 29 April, "how good it is, therefore, that the Karlsruhe constitutional judges at least, with two decisions, have now let us know what's what, so that voters may preserve their basic democratic attitude and at the same time protect themselves from deviations toward the extreme Right." However, while the Karlsruhe court has cleared the way for convictions on the charge of public incitement in cases involving the "Auschwitz lie," the FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU pointed out in a 27 April editorial: "How the criminal court judges will handle these directives, how they will rule in individual cases, does not of course fall within the purview of the guardians of the constitution." Reacting positively to the suggestion of former Constitutional Court judge Ernst Mahrenholz that the laender appoint special prosecutors to speed up prosecution in the mounting cases of right-extremist criminality, including the "Auschwitz lie," the Bonn weekly RHEINISCHER MERKUR editorialized in its 29 April edition: "Only swift punishment is a deterrent and creates respect for the law which tramples right-extremist criminals under foot. Immediate action is called for. Also and especially because in 1994 we are in an election year." Criminalization Debated The federal court decisions have also sparked a debate over whether the penal code should be amended to specifically criminalize the "Auschwitz lie." In a page-one editorial in the Frankfurt/Main daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 7 April, Eckhard Fuhr opposed the intention of the SPD, shared by Federal Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, to quickly close the perceived legal loophole ostensibly permitting the dissemination of the "Auschwitz lie" in the wake of the initial announcement of the Federal Supreme Court's decision in the Deckert case: "If the genocide against the Jews is not to become a dark, tabu-reinforced myth in the public consciousness, but is rather to remain an object of living and tormenting remembrance, then the penal code should be left alone. The recognition of truth cannot be forced." Also addressing renewed efforts--such a proposal had been made in the early 1980's--"to stiffen the threats of the penal code against disputing or minimizing of National Socialist acts of violence against the Jews," Friedrich Karl Fromme, editor for domestic politics and coordination, in a later page-one editorial in the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE on 27 April, reached a similar conclusion: "Historical truth cannot be established by the penal code; that ill befits a state committed to liberality, as painful or embarrassing as it may be in any particular case." According to Goetz Aly, commenting in the 19 April edition of DIE TAGESZEITUNG, more important than an amendment of the penal code is the development of a "democratic consensus" including the historical fact of Auschwitz as an integral part: "For if one advocates the punishment of those who assert an `Auschwitz lie,' then for that purpose not a scientific, but rather a democratic agreement is necessary. With the use of Auschwitz as a political-moral all-purpose weapon, as chiefly representatives of the left and left-liberal milieu treat it, such a consensus is made more difficult." In response to the views published by Fuhr and Aly, SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) Deputy Chairman Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, in DIE TAGESZEITUNG of 2 May, forcefully advocated making the denial and minimization of the Holocaust punishable under law: "No, this concerns us all. Here it is essential, also by means of precisely targeted penal code prohibitions, to set limits which underline and safeguard the sociopolitical proscription of such conduct." DIE TAGESZEITUNG of 29 April reported that both the SPD and Alliance 90/Greens have introduced draft laws in the Bundestag that would criminalize the "Auschwitz lie."
