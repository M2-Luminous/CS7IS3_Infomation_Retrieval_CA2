The committee's actions will not depend on the anticipated contract with Russia on the further use and dismantling of the radar station, said the committee head, the country's Environmental Protection and Regional Development Minister Girts Lukins. The group sees its chief task in rehabilitation of residents' health and sanation of the environment, said Lukins. "The committee's work will be over only when the locals start to feel better, and this is by no means connected with this treaty between Latvia and Russia," said the minister. The group was set up in February. It includes officials of the Environmental Protection and Regional Development Ministry, Welfare Ministry, Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry, Finance Ministry, physicians and local authorities. As reported, Russia has promised to get its troops out of Latvia until Aug. 31 if the Baltic country allows it keep the radar for five and a half years.
