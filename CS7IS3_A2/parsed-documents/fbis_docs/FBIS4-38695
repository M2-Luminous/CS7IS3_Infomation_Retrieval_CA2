The Geneva talks were in question until the last moment because Akashi had no guarantees that Bosnian Serbs would stand up to their promise and withdraw their remaining units from the 3-kilometre zone around Gorazde. The Muslim leadership refused to participate in the talks if the Serbs do not withdraw. On Thursday Akashi received a message from Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic confirming that the troops would be withdrawn. Churkin told TASS that the degree of readiness for the talks at which a complete end to hostilities in Bosnia is to be discussed, is "very high". He added that "serious discussions" would go [as received] about a number of details, but "chances for success are very high".
