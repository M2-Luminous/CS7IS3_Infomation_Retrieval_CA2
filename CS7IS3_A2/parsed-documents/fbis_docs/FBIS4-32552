Two deputy ministers--Wojciech Misiag and Henryk Chmielak--have been dismissed. [Begin Kolodko recording] Today I am handing a thank you letter to Dr. Chmielak and Minister Misiag, who will now be working in a different capacity. This is in connection with certain changes arising from the implementation of the Strategy for Poland program, which is now official and has been adopted by the Sejm. They are leading experts and we do not have enough of them. They will be helping us out, using their experience, expertise, and qualifications in a different way. At 0805, on behalf of Prime Minister Pawlak, I will be making appropriate nominations. Dr. Krzysztof Kalicki from the Main School of Commerce, a leading expert in monetary policy, will be appointed as first deputy finance minister and secretary of state. Professor Elzbieta Chojna-Duch, from the Law Department at Warsaw University, who was until now my adviser on budget policy, will be appointed under secretary of state, with responsibility for supervising the budget sector. I would like to add that these are not the only changes. These are the changes that are being implemented today in this ministry. [end recording] [passage omitted]
