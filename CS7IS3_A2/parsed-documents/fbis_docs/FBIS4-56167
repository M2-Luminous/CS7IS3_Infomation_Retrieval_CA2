The Brazilian Aeronautics Ministry considers the refurbishing cost of these airplanes, which are poorly maintained, very high. "They are as worn out as a driving school Volkswagen Beetle," an Aeronautics officer said. These airplanes, also called [Aerotec T-23] Uirapuru, were used to train Aeronautics cadets in their first year of pilots school.
