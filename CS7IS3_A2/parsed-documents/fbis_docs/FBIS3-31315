As the agency went on to say, according to unconfirmed reports, they do not intend to attend the Cabinet meetings before their position is clarified. Minister Jozef Moravcik is said to have taken his leave. Our colleages Dagmar Bazlikova and Michal Tvarozek interviewed the two Cabinet members late this morning. [begin recording] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, what is on the agenda of the Cabinet meeting that prevents you and the foreign minister from attending the meeting? [Kovac] The prime minister's opening address included a number of accusations against us, and the prime minister asked us to leave the Cabinet meeting. Immediately after our departure, the debate of the regular 17-point agenda concerning privatization started. It was said that, if we did not leave the Cabinet meeting, the Cabinet would end its meeting and there would be a consultative meeting of some ministers--that is, a consultative meeting of the ministers excluding us. We complied with the prime minister's wish and left the Cabinet meeting in order not to complicate the course of their debate. [passage omitted] [Tvarozek] Mr. Deputy Prime Minister, do you not perceive this as some sort of a psychological war--the prime minister declared that he expected that you would leave the Cabinet voluntarily. [Kovac] I think that if we leave voluntarily it would be a certain admission of mistakes committed by us in our posts. I do not think that either Minister Moravcik or I committed mistakes that would lead us to the conclusion that we do not do our work properly. There is yet another fact here: Because we, together with deputies' initiative [Alternative of Political Realism], proposed a certain solution to the current political situation, there is a question of whether the prime minister will make a decision about our future membership in the Cabinet or whether he will not make such a decision. He really has the right to choose colleagues whom he fully trusts. [passage omitted] [Moravcik] I would like to add one thing. In his opening speech, the prime minister said that he would ask the Prosecutor's Office to investigate whether our course of action was in accordance with the law and whether regulations of the penal code might be used to deal with it. I would like to say that such a way of thinking is absurd because there is our parliament here to tackle political crises. That means that, when a way out of the current internal political problems is being sought, the solution must be sought through the parliament. This is the fundamental principle of parliamentary democracy. When we took our course of action, we acted fully in accordance with the Constitution. [passage omitted] [Tvarozek] Shouldn't the current situation be characterized as a parliamentary crisis followed by a government crisis? [Kovac] It is possible to say that the Cabinet will continue its activities only with great difficulty because all of the measures they will present to the parliament will pose considerable problems there. I think that a number of officials of the parliamentary parties have made statements on this issue. [Tvarozek] Mr. Minister, according to a report by the press agency, you are said to be taking your leave now. [Moravcik] To be honest, I would really welcome to have leave, from my personal point of view. However, these days it is not appropriate to take leave.
