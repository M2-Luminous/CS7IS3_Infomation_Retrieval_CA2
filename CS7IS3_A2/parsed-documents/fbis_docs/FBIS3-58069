At the beginning of next week, NATO will be holding a summit during which Bosnia will certainly be a subject for discussion. We cannot reasonably hope to see, by the waving of a magic wand like in a fairy story, any miraculous solution emerge from this meeting of the Sixteen. But at least we can hope that the allies will agree on a stance to take, and that they subsequently stick to it. It is in fact on 18 January that events should start to turn. This is when the warring parties meet in Geneva to continue negotiations. Yet again, there will be comments by those who no longer believe that a solution can be found at a table covered with green baize; it will be a last-chance meeting for the many experts involved in the negotiating process. It does seem clear that further failure will have dramatic consequences as it would be impossible to implement peace before the spring and that, as a result, the war leaders could return to their activities undisturbed. This scenario, which would be disastrous for the populations of the three communities, is, unfortunately, a serious possibility. On Thursday morning [6 January], in an interview given to RTBF [French-language Belgian Radio and Television] Television from his headquarters in Sarajevo, General Briquemont spoke of information indicating that the Bosnian authorities now want to win the war. This is not the first time that it has been said that Mr. Izetbegovic is not interested in a cease-fire: Sufficiently armed, he feels that he is able to adopt a position other than that of peacemaker. Diplomats who attended the conference organized on 22 December in Brussels by Mr. Claes have also concluded -- in all "neutrality" -- that the responsibility for the failure of this negotiation lay -- in technical terms -- with the Muslims. They demanded, with a view to a negotiated division of the republic, 33 percent of the land with links between the isolated enclaves. The Serbs, who are anxious to achieve a lifting of the international embargo imposed on them, were ready to make the concessions that the negotiators demanded of them; but Mr. Izetbegovic wanted more or -- more specifically -- other zones than those which Mr. Karadzic agreed to deliver. This is not a question of coming to the Bosnian Serbs' defense, but fairness prevents all the blame for the present impasse being attributed to him in the way which Mr. Claes chose to do at the end of the negotiations -- and in terms which are scarcely in keeping with what one would expect of a foreign minister.
