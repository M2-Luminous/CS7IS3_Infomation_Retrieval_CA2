The case involves connections stretching to a senior party and military leader, Yang Shangkun, and could result in disciplinary action against the mayor of Chengdu, Wang Rongxuan. Documents obtained by Eastern Express show that the country's top anti-corruption bureau -- the Supreme People's Procuratorate -- ordered a special investigation this month into massive embezzlement of funds invested by overseas Chinese in Sichuan province since 1988. The case pits a famous Kuomintang warlord family with links to the Yang family in Beijing against powerful elements of the Sichuan provincial bureaucracy. The Sichuan bureaucrats have resisted instructions from Beijing to investigate other officials accused of making off with millions of renminbi in funds. A series of "internal reference" reports concerning the case have circulated among top Beijing leaders, but have not previously been made public because of fears that this would reduce the flow of funds from overseas Chinese (including those in Hong Kong and Taiwan), which account for more than 80 percent of foreign investment in China. Allegations centre on Wen Jinjing, the chairman of the Chengdu Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese. In April 1990, Wen appointed himself president of the Chengdu Overseas Chinese Property Development Company, a joint venture between the federation and a group of overseas Chinese in the city led by Su Tianshu. The 58-year-old Su was instrumental in attracting funds to the company before he was forced to retire because of the vast Taiwan and overseas Chinese connections of his former wife, Wang Jihua. Wang, who emigrated to Hong Kong in 1988, is the granddaughter of a Kuomintang general who served in Chengdu during the Chinese civil war. Since the sacking of Su, shareholders have accused Wen of making off with millions in funds from the company and its investment fund, most of which they claim has found its way into the pockets of city officials. Su fled from Chengdu to Beijing in December 1990, fearing detention after he accused city officials of corruption and misbehaviour in the federation's virtual confiscation of the company. He received protection in Beijing because his current wife, Yang Shaojing, is the niece of the senior party and military leader Yang Shangkun, who was China's president at the time. When Su first fled to Beijing in 1990, Yang family connections arranged the first of several "internal reference" articles on the case. Such articles are written by senior staff of party-controlled media organs on sensitive issues for restricted access by top leaders. An internal reference article on the case -- written by the Industrial and Commercial Daily editor, Chen Hongyu, in late 1990 -- said Wang Rongxuan, the then deputy party secretary of the city, had failed to issue any written orders to discipline those involved in the takeover of the company. While Wang held a special party meeting on the case, no notes were taken and no written instructions issued, the article said. The article was circulated to top party and government officials of Sichuan province, but Su claims no action was taken. Wen first got into trouble with the law in December 1991 when the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court ruled against him in a dispute with the Sichuan Light Industrial Products Sales Centre. Wen had used the name of the property development company's investment fund to take on a consignment of Rmb1.1m [renminbi] (HK$900,770 [Hong Kong dollars]) worth of goods from the light industry company, hoping to resell it later at a big profit. After Wen reneged on the debt, the investment fund was forced to pay the money, even though investors claimed he had no authorisation to conduct such business. Wen had mainly taken refrigerators, alcohol, gold and televisions -- although it is not clear where the goods went. By the time Su appealed to the provincial government in 1992, Wen had paid only Rmb700,000 for the goods he took. Su argued that evidence uncovered in the court case about Wen's wrongdoing should have been sent on to the procuratorate-general or public security authorities for criminal investigation. The court had said there was not enough evidence to support such charges. The Sichuan procuratorate later admitted that Wen's "mismanagement" was to blame for the Rmb400,000 that was never paid, but stopped short of taking disciplinary action. Allegations of embezzlement also surrounded Wen's dealings with the head of the investment fund, Hu Zuokui. Six overseas Chinese investors in the company accused Wen and Hu of illegally borrowing a total of Rmb4.57m from the investment fund none of which had been returned -- in a December 1991 letter written to the then Chengdu deputy party secretary, Wang Rongxuan (now mayor), and former party secretary, Wu Xihai (now a member of China's political consultative body). The letter said Wen took Rmb390,000 for himself and used another Rmb800,000 as bail after Hu was detained on charges of fraud in a case in Zhuhai. The rest of the funds were unaccounted for. Savings in an investment fund under the company had reached Rmb36m when the letter was written. In a letter to the Sichuan procuratorate general in March 1992, Su charged that Wang Rongxuan and the party secretary of the federation, Zhao Bingyue, had protected Wen from being disciplined after the body set up a joint provincial city team to reinvestigate the case. Su also said Wen should have been tried on criminal charges for unlawfully firing him, confiscating his personal investment of Rmb320,000 in the company and ransacking the office. Company annual reports show that because of the ransacking of the office, staff were forced to set up temporary offices at work sites in order to continue work on low-cost housing projects in Chengdu. Between 1992 and this year, Su has made several more trips to Beijing and pressure has mounted on the Sichuan government to reopen the case and impose disciplinary measures. In March the first signs of a change of heart among Sichuan officials appeared. The Sichuan procuratorate called on Chengdu officials to restore Su to president of the company or alternatively "make proper arrangements" for him, usually taken to mean monetary compensation. It added that it was "considering" disciplinary action against Wen. But Su is uninterested in monetary compensation and insists the investigation must go to higher levels. "Although the [Sichuan] government made certain statements, there has been no result," Su told the Supreme People's Procuratorate in Beijing in a letter last month. In a veiled reference to charges presented to Beijing that senior officials in Chengdu received some of the funds allegedly embezzled by Wen, Su called for "all those responsible" to be disciplined. Now Beijing has decided to step into the case. Su returned from Beijing last week, where Yu Xueru, the head of the Number Nine Office of the Supreme People's Procuratorate -- handling Sichuan affairs -- promised to force his provincial counterpart to reopen the case. Speaking to Eastern Express from Chengdu, Su indicated his demands that higher levels be investigated will be met. "Mr Yu has promised complete satisfaction," he said. The Chengdu party secretary, Huang Ymkui, has been ordered to provide a written report to Yu on the case by the end of this month, Su said. Su admitted it was the Yang family that made it possible to bring the case to the attention of the central government. "Yang [Shangkun] does not allow family members to get involved personally in cases. But they helped get my materials to the right people," he said. Su has stepped forward to reveal details of the case because, as he said, "supervision of officials by public opinion is not adequate in China". "After four years of frustration, I feel only by using the free press of Hong Kong can anything be accomplished," he said.
