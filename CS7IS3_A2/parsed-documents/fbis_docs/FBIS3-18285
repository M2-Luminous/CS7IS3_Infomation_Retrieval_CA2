Foreign Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen in Brussels ponders in the following remarks whether a negotiation result will be achieved on the basis of the new offer during the night: [Begin Salolainen recording] Well, that depends entirely on whether we will get our central views accepted. As has been noted, this document is not acceptable to us as it is; there must be considerable improvements made to it. We are currently deliberating them among ourselves and preparing our own counterproposals. That will indicate whether a solution can be found. [end recording] [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto is, however, still dissatisfied. [Begin Haavisto recording] There are numerous points. Of course, the two most central ones are that we must get the subsidy arrangement to extend to all of Finland and, secondly, that the arrangements for the transition period must be such that they do not cause unreasonable problems for any sector in Finland. [end recording] The Finnish Government will meet in an hour to study the situation in the EU negotiations, i.e., a couple of hours before the original deadline. Prime Minister Esko Aho thinks that there is, if necessary, a margin of flexibility in the timetable.
