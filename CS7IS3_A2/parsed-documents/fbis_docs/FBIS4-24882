Li made the remarks in a meeting here this afternoon with Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Lojze Peterle and his party. The premier noted that conflicts in that region are one of the negative effects left by the Cold War. After the Cold War, the world has not become as peaceful as some people have imagined. The fact is that the world has witnessed a rise of destabilizing factors, such as national disputes, regional conflicts and economic discrepancy. This has been shown all too clearly in the former Yugoslavian region, Li said. China is concerned about the evolution of the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation, he added. China holds that international conflicts should be settled through peaceful means and that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country involved be respected, and the rights and interests of its minorities be protected, he said. Though far away from Europe, China sincerely hopes that Europe attains peace and stability, Li said. Peterle expressed his appreciation for this stance of the Chinese side, adding that Slovenia also hopes for a just and fair solution to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. During the meeting, Li extended a welcome to Peterle on his first visit to China. Li also recalled his meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister J. Drnovsek while attending the world environment and development conference in 1992. He asked Peterle to convey his best wishes to his Slovenian counterpart. The Chinese premier invited Drnovsek to visit China within the year. Peterle said that Drnovsek is looking forward to that visit. Peterle told Li that he was pleased to be here and his talks with Chinese officials have been satisfactory. He voiced the belief that the bilateral relations will be enhanced in the future. Later in the afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress, met with Peterle and his party.
