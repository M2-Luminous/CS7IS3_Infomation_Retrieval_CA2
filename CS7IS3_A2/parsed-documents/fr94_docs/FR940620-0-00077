FR940620-0-00077 FR940620-0-00026 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 21. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Commission has prepared a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for this item as follows. I. Need for and Purpose of this Action 22. This action is taken to relax the Commission's standards regarding acceptance of applications for stations in the low power television (LPTV) service, and to permit LPTV stations to request four-letter call signs. II. Summary of Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis_None. III. Significant Alternatives Considered and Rejected 23. The Commission considered a lesser relaxation of the application acceptance standards. The Commission also considered not allowing LPTV operators to apply for four-letter call signs until after they are licensed. 24. The Secretary shall send a copy of this Report and Order, including the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration in accordance with paragraph 603(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. No. 96&hyph;354, 94 Stat. 1164, 4 U.S.C. 601 et seq. (1981)). Ordering Clause 25. It is therefore ordered that pursuant to the authority contained in Sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r), the Commission's policy changes set forth herein are adopted, and §§73.3522, 73.3550, 73.3564, 73.3591, 74.780 and 74.783 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 73.3522, 73.3550, 73.3564, 73.3591, 74.780 and 74.783, are amended as set forth below. The revisions to §§73.3564 and 73.3591 relieve existing restrictions. As such, they are exempt from the effective date requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1), and will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register . The revisions to §73.3522 will become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register . The revisions to §§73.3550, 74.780, 74.783 and to the Commission's terrain shielding policy in the LPTV service will become effective 60 days after they are published in the Federal Register and subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget. List of Subjects 47 CFR Part 73 Television broadcasting. 47 CFR Part 74 Television broadcasting. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. Rule Changes Parts 73 and 74 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as follows: PART 73_RADIO BROADCAST SERVICES 1. The authority citation for Part 73 continues to read as follows: Authority: 47 U.S.C. 154, 303, 334. 2. Section 73.3522 is amended by revising paragraph (a)(3) to read as follows: §73.3522 Amendment of applications. (a) *␣*␣* (3) Subject to the provisions of §§73.3525, 73.3572 and 73.3580, any application for a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster station may be amended as a matter of right during the application window filing period pursuant to §73.3564(d). If it is determined that a low power TV, TV translator or TV booster application is substantially complete but contains some defect(s) or omission(s), a deficiency letter will be issued affording the applicant 30 days to correct the defect. * * * * * 3. Section 73.3550 is amended by revising paragraphs (b), (f), (h), (j) and (n), as follows: §73.3550 Requests for new or modified call sign assignments. * * * * * (b) No request for a new call sign assignment will be accepted from an applicant for a new station until the FCC has granted a construction permit. Failure by the permittee of a new station to request the assignment of a specific call sign within 30 days of grant of the construction permit will result in the FCC, on its own motion, assigning an appropriate call sign. All initial construction permits for low power TV stations will be issued with a five-character low power TV call sign. * * * * * (f) Only four-letter call signs (plus an LP suffix or FM or TV suffixes, if used) will be assigned. However, subject to the other provisions of this section, a call sign of a station may be conformed to a commonly owned station holding a three-letter call assignment (plus FM, TV or LP suffixes, if used). * * * * * (h) Call signs are assigned on a ``first-come-first-served'' basis. Receipt by the FCC of a request for an available call sign blocks the acceptance of competing requests until the first received request is processed to completion. In the case of requests for the same call sign being received on the same date at the FCC, the assignment (if otherwise grantable) will be made to the station having the longest continuous record of broadcasting operation under substantially unchanged ownership and control. However, involuntary and pro forma assignments will not be taken into account in determining priority. If a low-power TV operator and an AM, FM or full-power TV operator apply for the same call sign on the same date at the FCC, the AM, FM or full-power TV operator will prevail. Note: The provisions of paragraph (h) of this section shall not apply to a licensee requesting a transfer to another frequency where the existing and new facilities serve substantially the same area ( i.e., where at least one of the stations serves both communities of license). * * * * * (j) The provisions of this section shall not apply to International broadcast stations, to stations authorized under Part 74 of the rules (except as provided in §74.783 of this chapter), nor to FM or TV stations seeking to modify an existing call sign only to the extent of adding or deleting an ``&hyph;FM'' or ``&hyph;TV'' suffix. The latter additions and deletions may be effective upon notification to the Commission. * * * * * (n) Where a requested call sign, without the ``&hyph;FM,'' ``&hyph;TV'' or ``&hyph;LP'' suffix, would conform to the call sign of any other non-commonly owned station(s) operating in a different service, the applicant must obtain and submit with the application for the call sign the written consent of the licensee(s) of such stations.
