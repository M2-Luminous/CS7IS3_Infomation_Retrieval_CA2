Such an action will only give rise to a wave of violence in the region and create suffering for innocent people. This situation calls for a quick, fair, long-term, and lasting solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict with the Palestinian issue at the core. Vietnam supports the current peace process in the Middle East.
