The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at St. James Municipal Airport, St. James, MN, to accommodate a Nondirectional Beacon (NDB), Runway 32. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed for aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. Aeronautical maps and charts would reflect the defined area which would enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rules requirements. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.
