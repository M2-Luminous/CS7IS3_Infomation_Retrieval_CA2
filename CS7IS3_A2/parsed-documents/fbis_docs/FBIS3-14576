He said the main reason for the increase in the foreign exchange on the free market is the demand for foreign exchange. He said: Recently the market demand for foreign exchange by certain groups has increased dramatically, and this has caused an increase in its rate. Dr. 'Adeli said the main groups are importers and merchants. He said: This group has put pressure on the foreign exchange market, and as a result of this demand, the corresponding rate of foreign currencies has increased. He said: Factories and industrial units, which are mostly government-owned, have brought heavy demand to the foreign exchange market, and this has caused an increase in its rate, and this increase has also been accelerated by brokers and speculators. Dr. 'Adeli said: Another factor, which has been very effective in the value of foreign exchange, is increases in the prices of products from some government factories, where this group mainly uses the bank's floating foreign exchange rate of 1,750 rials [R]. In explaining this matter, he said: These factories have raised the prices of their goods so much that importers of goods are using dollars that cost more than R2,000. He noted that another factor in the increase in the foreign exchange rate is psychological, which must not be overlooked. He said: The method of reporting on changes in the foreign exchange rate by some publications is such that not only does it not serve to calm the economic atmosphere, it severely heats up the rumor market. He added: At this time Iran's enemies, by decreasing the price of oil, are trying to stop Iran's growing economy. Thus the nation's various economic agents must join hands and prevent damage by the enemy. Dr. 'Adeli said: To prevent plots like this, the various sectors must not increase demand on the foreign exchange market and cause the rate to rise. He emphasized: All agents must work together to protect and stabilize the nation's money. One cannot expect to guide all the agents in the commercial, guild and financial sectors in the proper direction through Central Bank sales of foreign exchange. Dr. 'Adeli said: Various studies have been done following the recent changes on the foreign exchange market. After views were exchanged on the Economic Council and in the Council of Ministers, the proposals studied were considered in the Paragraph 3 Committee. To bring about the necessary cuts in this year's foreign exchange costs, in view of the reduced pressure from the nation's foreign exchange commitments as the result of the current financial negotiations with our trading partners, and also in view of the reduced foreign exchange expenditures for next year as the result of investments and the self-sufficiency achieved in some economic sectors, the Paragraph 3, Note 29 Committee presented the following decisions to the president of the republic aimed at reducing the existing demand for foreign exchange on the free market and on the foreign exchange market and to answer that demand through the banking system: 1. The foreign exchange required to register the orders remaining in the Central Bank will be allocated in the form of drafts by the Central Bank, and the necessary steps will be taken concerning this amount by the end of the current year. 2. The Central Bank will allocate the foreign exchange required to register priority orders that are now in the banks, and will pay it in the form of drafts by the end of the current year. 3.- As of the beginning of the year 1373 [21 March 1994] the Central Bank will take steps to meet the demand for foreign exchange to register all orders that have been made through ordinary procedures such as the opening of credit documents by the commercial banks. In view of the measures that have been taken, these kinds of credit documents will be paid when they are due. Thus all those seeking to import raw materials and parts will be able to get the foreign exchange they need at the bank's floating rate by opening credit documents payable on sight or payable at maturity at one of the commercial banks, after registering their orders at the Ministry of Commerce. 4. In view of the fact that the import of any kind of merchandise can be done only by registering the order at the Ministry of Commerce and through the lawful executive officer, the relevant organizations are therefore required to intensify the campaign against smugglers and to deal with violators. 5. When necessary, the Central Bank will intervene in the foreign exchange market in the manner required. 6. Increases in the prices of the products from government factories and companies and factories and companies affiliated with the government without the approval of the Economic Council has been prohibited. The Ministry of Commerce and the Consumer and Producer Protection Organization are required to take the steps necessary to set prices, in accordance with regulations. At the same time, government organizations and companies and organizations and companies affiliated with the government are not authorized under any circumstances to procure the foreign exchange they need on the free market. They are required to procure the foreign exchange they need exclusively through the lawful executive officer. Dr. 'Adeli then advised the owners of industry, producers, and importers not to rush to buy the raw materials for the products they produce and not to obtain the goods they need on the free market, but rather to do their work at the proper time, calmly and gradually through normal bank procedures and using the banking system. He said: The Central Bank's studies show that the market foreign exchange rate is not justifiable, and the Central Bank has decided not to increase the floating foreign exchange rate. It believes that with the cooperation with the other agents previously named, this rate can even be decreased. Dr. 'Adeli said: Next year credit accounts will be opened in the normal way, and those registering orders should not rush to obtain their goods. Decisions have also been made in the area of import procedures using the foreign exchange from exports, to be announced later by the Ministry of Commerce. Dr. 'Adeli was then asked for his opinion about a rumor on the foreign exchange market that the government is increasing the foreign exchange rate to make up its budget deficit. He answered: This rumor is completely unfounded, because the government has no need to make up its budget deficit in this way. He explained: Rial credits have been allocated to the same extent that we have revenues, and the Plan and Budget Organization has exercised great economy in its rial expenditures. Revenues are therefore entirely in line with expenditures, and for some costs 70 percent has been trimmed from the amount expected. A second point is that this year foreign exchange costs have been sharply cut, so that the eight-month statistics for the nation's imports show savings of 35 to 40 percent on foreign exchange costs and reductions in the nation's imports, which is a striking figure. Dr. 'Adeli said: The government and the bank favor a lower foreign exchange rate. If the bank decides to intervene in the market sometimes, this intervention will be to control prices. Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effects of the recent drop in the price of oil on recent events. He said: Decreased oil revenues affect the amount of foreign exchange the government sells, but several other things have also happened, which compensate for this drop in price to a great extent. These events include the fact that in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] heavy cuts were made in foreign exchange expenditures, and this was accomplished by controlling imports of certain goods, controls on imports and increased tariffs. He said: The result of these steps was a reduction in the amount of goods imported into the country compared to the previous year. At the same time the nation's foreign exchange needs were reduced by self-sufficiency and investments in some sectors. Dr. 'Adeli was asked about the effect of currency in circulation on the demand for foreign exchange. He said: Currency in circulation and its growth is an important factor in the excessive demand for foreign exchange. The people know that in the first half of the current year [21 March-23 September 1993] the Central Bank made striking efforts to control currency in circulation. In this regard 'Adeli asked the government factories and companies to manage their finances efficiently in order to minimize their need for currency in circulation, and to refrain from buying foreign exchange on the free market. In conclusion he said: To control the foreign exchange rate, cooperation is necessary from all those involved.
