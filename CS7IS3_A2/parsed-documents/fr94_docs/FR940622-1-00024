FR940622-1-00024 FR940622-1-00009 3. Because NOAA's proposed rule may be published as a final rule before the Department of the Interior (DOI) publishes the two Type A models as final rules, NOAA is seeking comment on three options: (1) Publish the formulas as final rules, with the option to revise once the DOI Type A models are promulgated as final rules; (2) publish the formulas as interim final rules, pending revision based upon the completion of the Type A models; or (3) reserve the formulas as proposed rules pending the completion of the Type A models, with the rest of the NOAA rule being published as a final rule; or (4) repropose each formula after the model upon which it is based is published as a proposed rule. 4. NOAA is proposing that the damages generated by the compensation formulas be conclusive in nature for those resources and/or services covered by the formulas. That is, once the rule becomes final and survives any judicial review, parties may challenge the information used in applying the formulas in a particular assessment or the appropriateness of using the formula for a specific incident, but may not challenge the underlying algorithms and data used in developing the formulas. NOAA is specifically seeking comment on this approach. 5. Passive use (nonuse) values are not included in the formulas at this time, since NOAA determined that sufficient information does not currently exist concerning average passive use values applicable to the compensation formula approach. NOAA decided to propose the formulas without passive use values so that they would be available for trustee use rather than delay proposing to a future date. The trustee, of course, may use some other assessment method to estimate lost passive values. NOAA specifically requests comments on how such passive values might be included in the compensation formulas. 6. Several simplified natural resource damage assessment schemes have been developed by State trustees over the last few years to estimate damages to natural resources resulting from discharges of oil. How may any inconsistencies among the various State assessment methods and NOAA's proposed rule be addressed through NOAA's rulemaking? Regional Restoration Plans Section 1006(f) of OPA requires that sums recovered as damages be used to develop and implement a plan for the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, or acquisition of the injured natural resources. The proposed rule allows the trustees either to develop an Incident-Specific Restoration Plan to address the effects of the incident of concern, or to pool recoveries to apply them to a Regional Restoration Plan. These regional plans could be developed on a geographical or ecosystem basis to allow the recovery of the system covered by the plan. Where such a plan already exists (i.e., National Estuary Program (NEP), established by Congress in 1987; includes 21 estuaries), whether developed through prespill planning efforts or under regular management efforts, that plan may be used if it is developed through a public review and comment process that considers the major factors contained in the restoration planning guidance in the rule. The restoration action must address similar or comparable resource injuries as those identified in the assessment procedure. In NOAA's view, there are a number of benefits to aggregating recovered monies in a regional restoration plan. First, it is not cost-effective for trustees to attempt to restore natural resources affected by oil if those restored resources are still going to be at risk from other pollutant sources that trustees have no authority to address. This problem is less likely to arise when a regional restoration plan is used because regional plans are more likely to include a wide range of federal, state, and local enforcement authorities to address pollutant sources (i.e., point and nonpoint sources) affecting the region in question. Second, the trustees could also benefit from information gathered by the regional planning process conducted by other agencies (i.e., EPA's Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plans developed under the NEP) in efficiently and effectively addressing injured resources. Third, where a coordinated structure involving both public and private parties already exists, it is prudent to take advantage of that structure for public review of trustee restoration plans. Comment Summary Comments centered on the accountability of trustees for monies in a regional restoration pool and protections necessary to prevent monies intended for restoration from being used for other purposes. In general, there was suspicion that the regional restoration funds would be siphoned off for non-restoration-related purposes or for research projects related to natural resource damage assessment. One commenter stated that NOAA has no statutory authority for pooling recoveries and that each recovery must be spent for the restoration of resources injured by a particular incident. One suggestion received was that pooled recoveries be permitted only on a consensual basis with each responsible party. Another suggestion was that a time limit be imposed on trustees for the expenditure of pooled restoration monies. Specific questions on which NOAA is seeking comment: 1. Is it likely that these regional plans would be useful in areas with long-term pollution effects, where damages from a single incident would be too small to ``restore'' the injured natural resources or where the planning costs for the restoration after a single incident would be quite high compared to the damage figure? 2. Is pooling of funds contrary to the principles of restitution or compensatory damages? 3. Does the use of such regional plans contradict section 1006(f) that ``there be a nexus between monies recovered resulting from a particular spill and their use to restore or enhance the specific resources `affected by a discharge.'''? 4. May some percentage of the ``pooled'' funds be used to pay for the planning costs to develop such plans, since the estimated restoration costs from the underlying incidents do include planning costs?
