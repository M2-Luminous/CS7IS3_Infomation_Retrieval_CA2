According to "the law to protect the North Korean compatriots who sought refuge in the South," the government should convene a committee of officials from related ministries to decide whether to assist North Koreans within 30 days of their request for protection from the health and social affairs minister. The committee, sponsored by the Health and Social Affairs Ministry, recently decided to offer protection to four North Korean escapees from Siberian logging camps including Kim Kil-song, 31, and Kwon Ki-hae, 53, who fled North Korea through a third country. Under the law, the government will give each refuge seeker 14.7 million won (about 18,300 U.S. dollars) for resettlement and 7 million won to rent a small apartment. The decision is attracting attention because more North Koreans have been seeking refuge in the South recently, the officials said.
