But only 168 contacts, or 27 percent of those approved, took place as the others did not due to lack of their preparations or refusal by North Koreans to meet. One hundred and eleven contacts were made in China, mostly in Beijing and Shenyang, 33 in Hong Kong, 15 in Japan and nine in other countries, the National Unification Board [NUB] said in its "White Paper on Unification" released yesterday. The ratio of actual contacts to total authorized applications declined from 39 percent in 1990 and 1991, 27 percent in 1992 and 21 percent last year, apparently in line with the growing tensions between the two halves of the peninsula. As far as the number of applications was concerned, small and medium industrialists were more inclined to inter-Korean contacts. A total of 516 applications came from small and medium companies and 137 from large ones. Since the enactment of the Law on South-North Exchange and Cooperation in 1990 through last year-end, the NUB said, 419 South Korean businessmen met with North Koreans in the 168 cases. They were part of the 3,088 South Koreans who made contacts with North Koreans in 838 cases on various occasions such as academic forums, family reunions and business during the period. Those who visited the other side of their fatherland numbered 1,270 on 38 occasions, largely consisting of the several rounds of prime ministers' talks, each attended by a total of 100 negotiators, support personnel and newsmen. Economic cooperation, which started in October 1988 with the capitalist South lifting its trade embargo in the wake of the successful hosting of the Seoul Olympic Games, cooled later in 1992 when Seoul linked it with the nuclear issue. Businessmen here expect that inter-Korean economic ties would resume soon after the one-year impasse over the North's nuclear development plan is broken. As Seoul is likely to give the green light to entrepreneurs seeking to conduct trade with the North, the private sector is vigorously moving to gear up for more business relations with the communist state.
