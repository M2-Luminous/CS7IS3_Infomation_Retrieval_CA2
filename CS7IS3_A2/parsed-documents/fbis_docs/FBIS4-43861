FBIS4-43861 "drweu120_q_94010" FBIS-WEU-94-120 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 TURKEY DEP Eviction May Trigger Parliamentary Elections DEP Eviction May Trigger Parliamentary Elections NC2106205494 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS in English 18 Jun 94 pp 1, A8 NC2106205494 Ankara TURKISH DAILY NEWS English BFN [Text] Ankara--With the closure of the Democracy Party (DEP) and the upcoming eviction of 13 deputies from Parliament, the fate of Turkey's politics has fallen into the hands of four former DEP members. On Friday [17 June], the DEP's last acting chairman Remzi Kartal appealed to his former colleagues from Brussels, calling on them too to resign from Parliament. If the four Kurdish-origin deputies agree to Kartal's plea in order to "avoid being instrumental to the system"--as he put it-- Turkey will enter a crucial election period in which by-elections to fill vacant seats in Parliament have to held within three months. With its ailing economy, political observers say the financial burden of an "election economy" in Turkey would be too great, and would impose a serious threat for the future of the current coalition government. Currently, there are eight seats vacant in Parliament, but once the detailed verdict is published in the Official Gazette and relayed to the Parliament Speaker, the vacancies will number 21-- only two short of the number required for by-elections to be held. If two more DEP-origin deputies agree to resign immediately, as Kartal has called for, they will be playing a major role in Turkish politics. The Turkish Parliament has 450 seats shared between the ruling True Path Party (DYP), which holds 178 seats, the junior coalition Social Democrat Peoples' Party (SHP) with 55 seats, the main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) with 100 seats, the Welfare Party (39), Republican Peoples Party (18), Nationalist Action Party (14), Grand Unity Party (7), Democratic Left Party (3), New Party (3), Nation Party (2), with independents holding the remaining 10 seats. In order to avoid expulsion from Parliament in the case of a party closure, DEP deputies Mehmet Emin Sever (Mus), Muzaffer Demir (Mus), Mahmut Uyanik (Diyarbakir) and Mahmut Alinak (Sirnak) said earlier they had either resigned from the party or were never actually members of it. The Constitution says that any politicians who are members of a party when a case is launched by the Constitutional Court, will lose their parliamentary status and immunity if a closure decision is taken. Although Alinak's immunity was lifted earlier he is still in prison, he has insisted that he resigned from the party before the case was launched. On Thursday, the Court did not remove the parliamentary status of these deputies, agreeing that they were not members of DEP when the case began. Although DEP executives still argue that they were members, they have had little support in this argument and claim that the decision not to abolish the parliamentary status of these deputies stemmed from the political decision not to force Turkey into an election atmosphere.
