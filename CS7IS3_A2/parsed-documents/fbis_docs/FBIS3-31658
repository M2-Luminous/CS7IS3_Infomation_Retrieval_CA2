On this point, Fejfar says that while, on one hand, he believes the Czech Republic needs a less strong army, such as will be acceptable to NATO, on the other hand, during three years nothing much has changed in the army, and therefore it has to be cleansed. However, he does not mean the removal of former communists, whom he says formed 90 percent of the army command. The categories Fejfar has in mind are firstly the former members of the military counterintelligence, of whom several hundred remained in the army. The second class are the former official political indoctrinators, who are still hiding in the army. They are very experienced and capable, with their own information channels, and are thus very dangerous, Fejfar says. Baudys' talk of how much has changed in the army he calls "a very optimistic view." Asked to comment on his past statements concerning the operation of KGB officials in the army, Fejfar says they arose from a combination of concrete knowledge and certain suspicions, but he cannot talk about them in the paper. On the subject of the "gentlemanly agreement" between Interior Minister Jiri Ruml [name as received] with the head of Russian counterintelligence that the two countries' intelligence services would not work against each other, Fejfar says it would be naive to imagine that foreign intelligence agents, including Russian ones, did not operate here. The question is whether they are working against the Czechs or whether they are merely monitoring the situation, whether their interest has not shifted to the economic sphere. Fejfar thinks Russian intelligence understands that the Czech Republic is no longer in their sphere of influence, and thus their aims are definitely changing. However, there has to be some cooperation, especially in the area of organised crime. Intelligence services work here, it is a question of keeping their activities within bounds, he says. Asked what he thinks of the opinion that the Interior Ministry is run by a group of friends who know nothing about being professional, Fejfar says there are two options, either you leave the old (pre- revolution) professionals in place, which is no good, or you rely on friends whom you can trust fully. If there are affairs in the ministry, it is because the old is clashing with the new. There is the same problem in the army, but the affairs there are not written about, although they might be after there is radical change, he says.
