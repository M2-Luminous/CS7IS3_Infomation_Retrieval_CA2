[Begin recording] [Bildt] This is very good news, and this means that the last formal obstacle to a quick signing of the agreements that make our membership possible from the beginning of next year has now been removed. [Correspondent Tomas Ramberg] The biggest obstacle to your ambitions to enter the European Union is still there, the Swedish nation. Do you think this decision will have some influence on opinion in Sweden? [Bildt] I think that possibly it will. There have been many who have always said that this will not succeed, it will collapse because of this or that, and this was maybe the last thing they had pinned some of their hopes on. [end recording] [Announcer] The date of the national referendum where the Swedish nation will make a decision on EU membership will be 13 November.
