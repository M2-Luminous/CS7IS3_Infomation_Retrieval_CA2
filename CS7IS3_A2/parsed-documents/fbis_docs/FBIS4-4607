The students denounced that Perry aggravated tension on the Korean peninsula by ordering the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South Korea. They stated that North Korea denounced the deployment of Patriot missiles as an act of war against Pyongyang. The students burned a portrait of Perry and models of Patriot missiles in a park in downtown Seoul. As a result, black smoke rose to the sky and the U.S. flag was tumbled all about on the ground. About 200 police assumed a guard posture to block the park in an attempt to check the students' street demonstrations. Some protesters, wearing masks, shouted the slogan, "We oppose the deployment of Patriot missiles!" Approximately 400 riot police with shields and clubs were standing in front of the U.S. Embassy in the center of Seoul to repress possible disturbances. In the past students have burned the U.S. flag and staged demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy opposing U.S. policies.
