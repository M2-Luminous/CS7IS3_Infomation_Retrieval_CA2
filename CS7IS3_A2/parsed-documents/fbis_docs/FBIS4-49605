Plans for the strengthening of ideological work were laid down by its municipal Communist Party Secretary Li Youwei in a speech delivered at a municipal work conference last week. According to his speech published by Shenzhen's official media, Mr. Li said ideological work in the border city could only be boosted -- not weakened -- in the course of seeking economic prosperity. He hinted that the closeness of Shenzhen to Hong Kong made it more vulnerable to bad influences. "We should have a sober mind to see that thoughts of money-worshipping, hedonism and extreme individualism have been prevalent among some people," said Mr. Li. This, he said, had given rise to malpractices including trading power for gains. He pointed to the grassroots sector of villages and townships, where political indoctrination was weak and lax. Mr. Li also accused some cadres of paying lip-service to ideological work, and others of downgrading its significance. "We must grasp with both hands our economic construction and ideological work," he said. Mr. Li called on party cells at all levels to take the lead in learning Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on socialism. They should take forceful measures to enhance the ideological education and quality of the 93,000-strong party members in the city he said in a Shenzhen Special Zone Daily report. Government cadres above the division level should return to party school in the next two years to be educated on the socialist dogmas, said Mr. Li. He singled out management cadres in enterprises as important targets. "They should consciously resist the infiltration of thoughts of 'money goes first' and decadent lifestyles....They should handle well the proper relationship between public interest and individual interest," he said. Mr. Li urged cadres to widen their prospective and abandoned outdated thoughts. He admitted reforms had hit a snag where cadres considered their own interests first, and warned this would "obstruct or delay" reform. Mr. Li said propaganda officials should constantly spot problems facing the people and take prompt measures to deal with disputes.
