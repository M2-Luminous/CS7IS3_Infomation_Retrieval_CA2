Paye'dar: "Beijing-Tehran: The Need for Cooperation"] [Excerpts] PRC Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who is also the deputy prime minister, arrived in Tehran on an official visit yesterday. Qian Qichen, who is the second in command in the massive political apparatus of the PRC after Jiang Zemin, was quoted as saying on the eve of his visit that Iran is the most important country in West Asia, and in particular, in the Persian Gulf region. He said: The PRC believes that Iran can play an immensely important role in the preservation of peace and stability in the Persian Gulf region. Qian Qichen cited the volume of trade between the two countries as $710 million in 1993 and added that this is the greatest trade volume between Iran and the PRC in the history their relations. Beijing is quite satisfied with this trend of expansion. Commenting on the critical situation in the region, the PRC foreign minister said: Reports indicate that the sale of weapons to this region by some of the bigger countries in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war are valued at billions of dollars. The PRC believes that the sale of arms to the region is certainly not in the interest of peace and stability. He said that he hoped that the countries exporting the weapons will adopt a policy of restraint in order to preserve the peace and stability in the region. [passage omitted] The importance of PRC-Iran cooperation is obvious to anyone but it may be claimed that there has not been much attention to this matter. Even though in the past, there have been many visits and trips by numerous high-level officials, it appears that the level of bilateral relations has not changed qualitatively to attain what could be described as a new regional equilibrium. Regardless of the reason for such a state of affairs, allowing it to continue in the face of the new international connotations of power and security that have emerged in the contemporary world does not seem logical. It is therefore not very effective to use the traditional lever of bilateral cooperation in all fields, and this in itself dictates the need for new parameters [preceding word in English] and a new atmosphere in their bilateral diplomacy. Iran as well as the PRC enjoy special political importance within their respective geographical areas, even though this importance is not of uniform in regional and international affairs. However, both countries, in their own right influence that transcends their own political boundaries. In any case, this importance has provided ample and logical reasons for Beijing and Tehran to deepen, expand, and revamp multilateral cooperation between them. This is significant for the following two reasons: 1. Beijing's expectations of Iran's role in the region and the direction that it envisages in this regard. 2. Iran's view of the PRC as a political power and a future economic power. Regarding the first factor, as Qian Qichen stated, a country such as Iran cannot be ignored and the broadening of cooperation with Iran enjoys high priority. However, as for the areas of this cooperation, Qian Qichen implied the following: 1. Iran's importance lies in the Persian Gulf. 2. The expansion of economic cooperation and transfer of technical know how. 3. Military cooperation. 4. Beijing's willingness to cooperate with Tehran, especially in broadening the role of the Economic Cooperation Organization [ECO] and restructuring it. Of course, the importance of Iran's role in the Persian Gulf is clear to all and Beijing is also completely aware that Iran's perception of the way the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman should be administered plays a fundamental role in promoting stability in the region. In any case, the emergence of any kind of insecurity in the Persian Gulf--in view of the enormous investment by the PRC in the region, especially in the latter half of the 1980's--will be an immense source of concern for the PRC. The Persian Gulf war and the concomitant economic losses sustained by the PRC are still fresh in the minds of the PRC leaders. The huge sums (totally borne by the regional Arab countries) spent on beginning and ending the war and eliminating its consequences resulted in the suspension of all industrial and developmental projects in the region. The PRC also suffered massive losses, as the foreign demand for its goods was greatly reduced. The difference was that when the war ended--in view of the nature of the forces embroiled in the war, and the importance that the Arab governments attach to Western countries--Beijing did not get a piece of the cake, or more accurately, they were not allowed to have any. This is why the PRC is pursuing its objectives in a totally different way than the Arab governments and why it considers Iran's role extremely important in attaining its objectives. Stability is the "elixir of life" for both countries and this is the best reason for mutual cooperation. [passage omitted] The current trend, which lacks the desirable trend and volume, cannot be defended. It appears that most of Iran's imports are manufactured goods, which is not in keeping with the economic development program of the government, while the PRC's imports from Iran mainly consist of crude oil. This is the situation even though the Chinese have valuable experience in the fields of power generation, nuclear reactors for civilian use, light industries that generate employment, geological prospecting, building refineries, textiles, shipbuilding, port construction, airplane manufacture, agriculture, engineering, and urban construction. This expertise can be transferred to Iran if we do some intensive planning in this regard. As for cooperation in the military field, the experts should give their views. Here, only one point can be mentioned and that is: The Chinese have made immense advances in the manufacture of defensive weapons; and the not so complex technology of Chinese weapons (of course as compared to Western weapons) is capable of being absorbed into Iran's defense system. On the subject of cooperation with the ECO, to which Qian Qichen alluded, the PRC sees it in the perspective of Iran and Pakistan, but Iran is more important. The situation was different prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, but now Iran has common borders with some Central Asian countries that are eager to broaden their relations with Iran. Therefore, the Chinese are watching the ECO closely, as it should naturally culminate in expanding Iran's role. In addition, the establishment of a unified economic front stretching from Turkey to the northern and western borders of the PRC has immense economic and political importance to that country. This is especially so because most of these countries view the PRC as an independent politico-economic power which--after the collapse of the Soviet Union--will have the last word in Asia. However, Tehran's vantage point is totally different from that of Beijing and is extremely strategic. In view of the international military structure, the perception that the PRC is a durable regional and international politico-economic force is gaining ground among Iranian leaders. Facts and figures indicate that this perception is very realistic. Beijing is a relatively independent force on the international political and economic scene and its model of national expansion has drawn the attention of many Third World countries. On the international diplomatic scene, the PRC is the sole Asian member of the Security Council and can be of great importance to many countries in view of the largely Western composition of the Security Council. In the economic field, the PRC can finish numerous uncompleted projects in Iran and can also make new investments, especially in the field of energy production. In this regard there appears to be only one obstacle, to which the PRC leaders should find a solution. Unfortunately, it appears that in regard to the peace trend in the Middle East, the PRC has not adopted an independent stand and has ignored the overall interests of the Arab countries and Muslims of the region for the sake of Israel. Even though the traitorous talks on the Gaza-Jericho accord were in progress, the PRC restored ties with Israel and high-level delegations have been exchanged between the two countries. The Iranian officials should discuss this matter in their talks with the PRC leaders and should ask the PRC to take a more logical stance toward this negative phenomenon, in view of the Zionists' evil deeds.
