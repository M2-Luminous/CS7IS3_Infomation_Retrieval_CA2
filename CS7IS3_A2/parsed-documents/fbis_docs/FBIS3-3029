He said: Both Henan and Heilongjiang have scored great achievements in reform and opening up. I hope all of you will establish confidence, overcome difficulties, and continue to make use of your assets to further carry out economic construction. More than 20 deputies from Henan and Heilongjiang expressed their views on enlivening large and medium state-owned enterprises; increasing agricultural investment, conserving energy, ensuring the smooth implementation of reform measures; and other issues. After hearing deputies' opinions and suggestions, Premier Li Peng spoke on related issues. He said: Since the policy of reform and opening up was adopted by implementing the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and by developing secondary and tertiary industries, great changes have taken place in rural areas -- the development of village and town enterprises is especially notable. We have been feeding 22 percent of the world's population with only 7 percent of the world's cultivated land -- this is a remarkable achievement. Currently, we have abundant grain in stock, but we must not be slack for a moment in grain production. Li Peng said: Now we have many peasant entrepreneurs in rural areas. Most of them have practiced strict self-discipline; worked deligently; continued to improve themselves ideologically, politically, and vocationally; and enjoyed a good reputation. However, a small number of them have changed qualitatively -- some of them even have committed crimes. This problem is good food for thought. Part of the reason is because these people's educational level is low. Some people tend to commit big mistakes after they become rich and powerful if they are not subject to supervision. Our cadres and governments at all levels also need to be supervised. Party organizations at all levels should cherish, help, and educate those who lead others to become better off in rural areas, and the masses also should exercise supervision over them. At the same time, these people, as peasant entrepreneurs, also should continue to enhance their understanding of the rule of law. While discussing transforming large and medium state-owned enterprises' operating mechanisms, Li Peng said: To establish a modern enterprise system and to solve problems concerning large and medium state-owned enterprises, we need to transform the operating mechanisms and must conduct specific analyses taking the reality and specific problems into consideration so that we can suit the remedy to the case. One of the very important factors that decides an enterprise's efficiency is whether its products are readily marketable. Li Peng continued: This year so far we have initiated a number of major economic reform measures, enabling us to take an important step toward establishing a socialist merket economic system. These measures will contribute to fair competition; they not only play a positive role in the current economic development, but also have far-reaching significance. Problems of various natures will come up in the course of implementing these measures. Our attitude is to solve problems as soon as they come up. Li Peng stressed: Energy conservation is important work. We have scored considerable achievements in this area over the last few years; however, there is still a lot we can do. Energy is keenly in short supply in China. We have to invest a lot of money every year in building power plants and coal mines, and, compared with advanced countries, our energy utilization efficiency lags far behind. We need to work hard to catch up.
