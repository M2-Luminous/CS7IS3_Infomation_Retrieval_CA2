FR940202-1-00011 FR940202-1-00004 Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require modification of the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. The FAA estimates that 23 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 32 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be provided by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $40,480, or $1,760 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: De Havilland, Inc: Docket 93&hyph;NM&hyph;203&hyph;AD. Applicability: Model DHC&hyph;8&hyph;301 airplanes; serial numbers 116 through 185 inclusive, 187, and 188; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent collapse of the floor and subsequent injury to passengers, accomplish the following: (a) Within 6 months after the effective date of this AD, modify the sidewall panels in the passenger cabin (Modification No. 8/1339) in accordance with de Havilland Service Bulletin No. 8&hyph;25&hyph;53, dated August 4, 1989. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), ANE&hyph;170, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO. Note: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on January 27, 1994. James V. Devany, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
