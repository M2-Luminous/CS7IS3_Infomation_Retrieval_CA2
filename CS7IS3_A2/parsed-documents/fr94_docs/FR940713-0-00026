FR940713-0-00026 FR940713-0-00011 (iii) Subsection (d)(1)&hyph;(4) requires an agency to permit an individual to gain access to records about the individual, to request amendment of such records, to request a review of an agency decision not to amend such records, and to provide a statement of disagreement about a disputed record to be filed and disclosed with the disputed record. (iv) Subsection (e)(1) requires an agency to maintain in its records only such information about an individual that is relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose required by statute or executive order of the President. (v) Subsection (e)(2) requires an agency to collect information to the greatest extent practicable directly from the subject individual when the information may result in adverse determinations about an individual's rights, benefits, and privileges under federal programs. (vi) Subsection (e)(3) requires an agency to inform each person whom it asks to supply information of the authority under which the information is sought, the purposes for which the information will be used, the routine uses that may be made of the information, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, and the effects of not providing the information. (vii) Subsection (e)(4) (G) and (H) requires an agency to publish a Federal Register notice of its procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request whether the system of records contains information about the individual, how to gain access to any record about the individual contained in the system, and how to contest its content. (viii) Subsection (e)(5) requires an agency to maintain its records with such accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness as is reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the individual in making any determination about the individual. (ix) Subsection (e)(8) requires an agency to make reasonable efforts to serve notice on an individual when any record on such individual is made available to any person under compulsory legal process when such process becomes a matter of public record. (x) Subsection (f) requires an agency to establish procedures whereby an individual can be notified upon request if any system of records named by the individual contains a record pertaining to the individual, obtain access to the record, and request amendment. (xi) Subsection (g) provides for civil remedies if an agency fails to comply with the access and amendment provisions of subsections (d)(1) and (d)(3), and with other provisions of the Act, or any rule promulgated thereunder, in such a way as to have an adverse effect on an individual. (xii) Subsection (m) requires an agency to cause the requirements of the Act to be applied to a contractor operating a system of records to accomplish an agency function. (2) Inspection Requirements_Investigative File System, USPS 080.010; Inspection Requirements_Mail Cover Program, USPS 080.020. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a (c) (3) and (4), (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1)&hyph;(3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e) (5) and (8), (f), (g), and (m). The reasons for exemption follow: (i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to subsections (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1)&hyph;(4) could (A) Alert subjects that they are targets of an investigation or mail cover; (B) alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation, and of evidence obtained; (C) enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or apprehension; (D) subject confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities were released to the target of an investigation; (E) constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation; (F) intimidate potential witnesses and cause them to be reluctant to offer information; (G) lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction or alteration of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of testimony, or the compromising of classified material; and (H) seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations that might involve law enforcement aspects as a result of the above. (ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) is impractical because the relevance, necessity, or correctness of specific information might be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant to a specific Postal Service investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity that might relate to the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service and/or other agencies. As to accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can be established only in a court of law. (iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would require collection of information directly from the subject of a potential or ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she is a target of an investigation or mail cover, enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously compromising law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances the subject of an investigation is not required to provide information to investigators, and information must be collected from other sources.
