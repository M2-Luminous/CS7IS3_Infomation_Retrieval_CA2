However, he ruled out the possibility of broadening the organization immediately. "We cannot replace old divisions with new ones," said Clinton. The speech by the President of the United States was the most important event on the day before the opening session of the North Atlantic Council. It was delivered at a meeting with young people in Brussels City Hall. In his 30-minute speech, the President emphasized: Europe is the main partner of the United States, but it is not the only one. The United States is also linked by partnership to the Americas and Asia. Discussing the security of Europe, the President stated that it must be constructed on the rules of democracy, free market, and civil society. Military security depends on all of these factors as well. The President said that Europeans are part of the Western European Union, the European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. However, NATO is the foundation of security. "Partnership for Peace," understood as a process or an evolution, is aimed at broadening NATO and opening the door for cooperation for all former adversaries, including Russia and Ukraine. The U.S. President did not exclude the possibility of NATO intervention if peace were jeopardized in Europe. The Final Communique Commission has almost finished working on the text of this document. As we could find out in Brussels, the most important part of it concerns NATO relations with the states of Central and East Europe. It is supposed to be declared that these relations will be broadened, deepened, and strengthened. As a sign of the final overcoming of former confrontation, joint maneuvers of NATO and former Warsaw Pact states are to be held as early as this year. They are supposed to be a preparatory step before peace missions. The project defines "Partnership for Peace" as a transitional form that would link the Central and East European states to NATO and that would not threaten Russian reforms. Thanks to broad military cooperation, these relations are to be raised from the level of dialogue to the level of political and military partnership. NATO will want to adjust the Central and East European armies to the standard of the alliance through practical cooperation and officers' training. Thus, an important condition would be met before integration with NATO at a later date. The first step is supposed to be joint maneuvers. Moreover, Central and East European states will be allowed to send liaison officers to NATO Headquarters. In the general document, which should be signed by NATO and its partners soon, East European states are supposed to commit themselves to respecting the following rules: non-secrecy in national defense and budget planning; democratic control over the Armed Forces; allowing the United Nations and CSCE to employ their military units in peace missions; developing military cooperation to plan and carry out these missions, as well as transforming the Armed Forces so that they will be able to act jointly with NATO forces at the operational level. NATO is supposed to supply these states with the necessary technical information. Soon both parties are to select units that will cooperate closely with each other. The final document will also include a detailed list of the measures that are necessary to harmonize activities, including the standardization of arms and equipment, as well as necessary for logistics, strategy, and the martial doctrine. The only thing that was not made clear before the summit is the matter of financing the future cooperation. The mere establishment of additional offices and work posts will cost at least several million ECU. Aside from that, the NATO summit is to decide whether quick-reaction multinational forces should be established for possible use in peace missions. They would be able to include military units of states that are not NATO members and of states that are not part of the military structures of the alliance, that is to say, France and Spain. "Combined Joint Task Forces" [CJTF] [preceding four words in English, translated into Polish as] ("Combined Forces") -- consisting of all kinds of weapons, may be employed in all crises not envisioned in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. It is expected that CJTF will also consist of units of neutral states as well as from Central and East European states. If these forces were established, in crises NATO would not have to act as a whole; it would place only some of its military installations at the disposal of the Europeans. [Box, p 23] In their reports from Central Europe, world news agencies draw attention to the fact that President Lech Walesa threatened to reject the concept of "Partnership for Peace," if NATO does not state unequivocally at the summit in Brussels that the "Partnership for Peace" program is the road leading to Poland's full membership in NATO. Agencies report that Lech Walesa is said to have stated that unless the NATO summit produces a decision on opening this organization to states such as ours, he will not go to Prague on 12 January to take part in the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Visegrad Group leaders. The President's Press Office did not confirm this information on Sunday when asked by RZECZPOSPOLITA. The decision whether Lech Walesa will go to Prague is supposed to be reached on Monday, after the session of the government and the president. In his interview with French television on Sunday, Walesa maintained his criticism of the "Partnership," calling this proposal "blackmail." Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that the initiative of the U.S. President is "unclear," known only by its name. His talks with representatives of the U.S. Administration did not result in any declarations that the "Partnership for Peace" program will lead to membership in NATO.
