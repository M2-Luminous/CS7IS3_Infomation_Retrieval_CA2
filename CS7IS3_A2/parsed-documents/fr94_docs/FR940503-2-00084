SUMMARY: The following described public lands have been determined to be suitable for disposal by exchange under sec. 206 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1716): Boise Meridian, Idaho T. 1 N., R. 2 E. Sec. 5: SE1/4NW1/4 T. 2 N., R. 2 E. Sec. 7: Lot 4, SE1/4SW1/4 Sec. 8: SE1/4SW1/4 Sec. 14: NW1/4NW1/4 Sec. 17: SW1/4NW1/4, NE1/4SW1/4 Sec. 18: S1/2NE1/4, SE1/4NW1/4. Aggregating 403.40 acres, more or less, in Ada County. In exchange for the above described public lands, BLM will acquire the following described private lands from Thomas Nicholson and Ronald Yanke: Boise Meridian, Idaho T. 4 N., R. 2 E. Portions of Sections 34 and 35. Containing 13.02 acres, more or less, in Ada County. T. 8 S., R. 6 E. Sec. 36: All. Containing 640 acres, more or less, in Owyhee County. The purpose of this exchange is to dispose of public lands that have no legal access, limited resource values, are difficult and uneconomic to manage, and would better be managed in private ownership, in exchange for private lands that contain important wildlife, riparian, and recreation values in Hulls Gulch and along the Bruneau River Canyon. The public interest will be well served by the completion of this exchange, as the consummation thereof will fulfill the Secretary's Fish and Wildlife 2000, Recreation 2000, and riparian management initiatives. The values of the lands to be exchanged are approximately equal. Full equalization of values will be accomplished prior to closing through either acreage adjustment or cash payment in an amount not to exceed 25 percent of the value of the lands to be transferred out of Federal ownership. DATES: On or before June 17, 1994, interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager, Bureau of Land Management, Boise District, 3948 Development Avenue, Boise, Idaho 83705. Objections to this proposal will be reviewed by the State Director, who may sustain, modify, or vacate this realty action. In the absence of any adverse comments, this realty action will become the final determination of the Department of Interior.
