The Central Fatherland Administration of the party will be elected by a show of hands and the chairman will be elected by secret ballot among several candidates. This was what Party Chairman Vojislav Seselj announced at the regular news conference. The journalists' attention was mostly attracted by Radical's stands on the interparty agreements on the election of the new chairman of the republican parliament. Dragoljub Stankic has the details: [Begin recording] [Stankic] It is the principled stand of the Serbian Radical Party that a member of an opposition party be elected Serbian Assembly chairman. The first solution, that Vuk Draskovic be elected, is unacceptable to the Radicals. The other proposal, the one that was accepted, failed to receive a sufficient number of votes, Vojislav Seselj said. Vuk Draskovic did not consult anybody about the second round of voting, but decided himself that the same proposal be given. We opposed that, Seselj said. He said that he proposed that the candidate be a member of the Democratic Party or some other party and asked why that person had to be from Depos. We complied with everything that was agreed among the opposition parties, but we are not going to allow Vuk Draskovic to speak on behalf of the whole of the opposition, because he is not authorized to do so, Vojislav Seselj pointed out. He commented on the situation among the opposition parties as follows: [Seselj] I do not think that an opposition bloc should be formed, nor do I think that there has been a rift among the opposition parties. A rift can only occur if there was unity before, and, in this case, no unity existed. We only agreed upon one specific question. [Stankic] If there is an intervention by NATO, Seselj called on the Serbian people to oppose it with all means. In that case, one should respond fiercely against Croatian and Muslim targets and do so indiscriminately. And, as he put it, one should attack UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units as well, wherever they may be. [end recording]
