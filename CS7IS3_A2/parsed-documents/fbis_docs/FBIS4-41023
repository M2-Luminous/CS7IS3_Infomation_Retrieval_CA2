For example, a Cambodian entrepreneur has ordered 10 million cartridges of this calibre; the Dutch have ordered even more -- 50 million cartridges. To retool the Lugansk-based plant as soon as possible, the "Ukrinmash" foreign trade company, which has a licence for selling this kind of production, proposed that 10-20 million cartridges (the so-called untouchable reserve) be taken from the depots of Ukrainian Defence Ministry and sold in the West. The Ukrainian Government has already given a go-ahead for the move.
