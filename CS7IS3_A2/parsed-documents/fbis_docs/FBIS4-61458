"Rakhmonov expressed his wish to come to Moscow to confer with President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin long ago," a high-ranking Russian diplomat told INTERFAX. According to him, the Tajik leader intends to discuss with the Russian premier a package of economic issues. "These will include primarily the prospects for Tajikistan's joining the ruble area. Judging by the information available to us, Dushanbe will accept any conditions advanced by Russia," the diplomat said. At his meeting with Yeltsin Rakhmonov will discuss political problems, he noted. "As far as we know, Rakhmonov would like to discuss with the Russian leader the situation in Tajikistan and on the border with Afghanistan," the official said. The draft of a new constitution was published in Tajikistan recently, INTERFAX's interviewee said. "The Tajik leadership is working on different ways to accomplish reforms, and it would like to secure Russia's support in this respect," he said. On Friday Rakhmonov is to confer with the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey Kozyrev, the diplomat said. The two men will focus on problems connected with the inter-Tajik dialogue, the first round of which was held in Moscow recently. "Russia is not only interested in furthering the talks between the Dushanbe government and the Tajik opposition; it intends to nudge the two sides toward a political solution to their conflict," he said. INTERFAX's interviewee found it hard to say when and where the next round of inter-Tajik talks will take place. "This will depend largely on the special envoy of the U.N. secretary general for Tajikistan, Piris Ballon, who intends to make a tour of the region shortly," he said. "He is likely to choose either Tehran or Islamabad."
