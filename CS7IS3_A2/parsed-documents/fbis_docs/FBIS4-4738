Hata said in a 40-minute meeting with OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye that Japan wants the OECD to offer objective analysis and direction amid the changing international situation, the officials said. Specifically, Hata called on the OECD to provide intellectual support for countries that are trying to shift toward market-oriented economies, such as middle and Central European nations, Russia and China, they said. He told Paye the OECD could provide know-how on democratization of markets, on beefing up investment environment, and on banking systems, they said. Hata pointed out that promoting dialogue with Russia and China is important as the two nations have large populations and will affect the OECD nations, they said. He also voiced expectations that the OECD would promote ties with the Asia-Pacific region, discussions on post-Uruguay Round issues, and make further efforts to solve structural problems, they said. Paye, on a four-day visit from Sunday, said he agrees with Hata's views on the OECD's future role, the officials said. Paye, a French national, told Hata international cooperation is becoming increasingly important as economic interdependence grows while political obscurity increases, they said. He was also quoted as saying it is necessary to study economic problems by linking them with social problems, citing unemployment as an example. Paye is visiting major OECD member nations ahead of the international body's Council meeting in June in Paris. Earlier in the day, he conferred with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and the ministers responsible for trade, labor and agriculture. On Tuesday, Paye is to have talks with Science and Technology Agency chief Satsuki Eda, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno and leaders of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren).
