The change of program is due to the absence of UN Special Representative in Angola Alioune Blondin Beye, who leaves for Cote d'Ivoire where he will attend the funeral of Cote d'Ivoire President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, who passed away on 7 December 1993. UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, who is also attending the Lusaka talks, says the sides have decided to discuss a less controversial topic. Dr. Valentim says the sides might discuss the future role of UN Angola Verification Mission-3. Meanwhile, Alioune Blondin Beye is scheduled to return from Yamoussoukro after the burial of the historic leader of the Ivorian revolution on 7 February. Meanwhile, UNITA and the government reached an agreement yesterday on the composition of the national police. Dr. Valentim described the agreement as important.
