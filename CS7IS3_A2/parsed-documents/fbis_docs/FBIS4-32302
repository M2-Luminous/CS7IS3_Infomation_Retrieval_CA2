During the period under consideration, imports from the Czech Republic were valued at Sk14.3 billion, which represents 30.2 percent of total imports to Slovakia; on the other hand, Slovak Republic exports to the Czech Republic were valued at Sk16.5 billion, which corresponds to 37.9 percent of total Slovak exports. However, these data do not include reexports.

Stefan Condik noted that, in the first quarter of 1994, a trend showing a slowdown of price increases was manifested in Slovakia. According to data provided by the Slovak Statistical Office, inflation grew by a total of 2.6 percent in comparison with December of last year in the first quarter of 1994 and was, to a certain extent, influenced by wage developments. Compared to February, wages in industry increased by 16.3 percent to Sk6,291; wages in the construction industry rose by 15.7 percent to Sk5,919; salaries in trade increased by 10 percent to Sk4,714; and wages in transportation rose 6.7 percent to Sk6,119.

In March, Slovakia had 370,500 unemployed, which is about 14.7 percent of the labor force. Compared with February with an unemployment rate of 14.8 percent, the number of unemployed declined by 5,500 persons. In March, the effects of introducing the import surcharge were felt, and the negative balance of trade increased by only Sk35 million. Overall, the balance of trade for the quarter ended up with a deficit of Sk3.7 billion. During the first three months of the year, Slovakia imported goods valued at Sk47.2 billion, which is 1 percentage point more than was the case for the same period of 1993. Exports amounted to Sk43.5 billion, which represents a 2.6-percent decline when compared to last year. The value of foreign capital in the Slovak economy by the end of March was Sk11.5 billion. In comparison with the last quarter of 1993, this represents an increase of 6.7 percent. The main share in investments in the Slovak economy is still held by Austria (23.4 percent) and Germany (21 percent). During the latest period, the Czech Republic, whose investment share rose to 13 percent, outstripped the United States with a 12.1-percent share. Foreign capital is now part of 5,719 corporations.
