The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the visit will take place in the second half of next April. They said that the meeting will be of some importance at Arab and international levels in view of the international changes and their effect on the region and also because of the peace process and its possible results. The sources added that the Syrian-Iranian summit will also cover the Geneva summit results and President Hafiz al-Asad's talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton on peace affairs and the region, the Gulf, the situation in Iran, and Iran's relations with other states. They said that al-Asad might mediate between Iran and Algeria in an attempt to improve relations. Syrian-Iranian relations are believed to be strategic. They have been allies with special ties characterized by depth and continuity. Iran realizes to what extent these constant relations with Syria have enhanced Iran's relations with the Arab world and especially the Gulf states. President al-Asad's clear pan-Arab policies have succeeded in settling more than one dispute between Arab states and Iran, including the dispute with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] over the three islands and problems in Iran's relations with some Arab states such as Egypt and Algeria. The sources said that President al-Asad will convey to President Rafsanjani Egypt's desire to eliminate the obstacles standing in the way of the improvement of its relations with Iran. The sources further said that the al-Asad-Rafsanjani summit agenda will be full of topical issues, especially regional, Islamic, and international issues, extraordinary developments affecting these issues, and other matters of mutual interest, in addition to the situation in the Gulf, Lebanon, the Palestinian question, and the effects of the separate Palestinian-Israeli agreements on the peace process. On the situation in southern Lebanon, the Syrian and Iranian sides will reaffirm continued support for the Islamic and national resistance for the expulsion of the Israeli forces and the liberation of the south. The summit talks will cover the situation in Iraqi and the position of the Kurds, particularly in view of the recent change in that position. Iran is worried about the main Kurdish parties in the region, especially those which have close links with the West. Iran and Syria have emphasized in past joint statements that what happens in Iraq is an internal affair and something for the Iraqi people to resolve. The two sides will also review Arab-Turkish relations and the tense situation in the Kurdish areas of Turkey. President Rafsanjani has stressed that Iran and Syria are opposed to any violation of Iraqi territorial integrity and Palestinian rights. This will be al-Asad's second visit of its kind to Iran. He visited Tehran in September 1990. President Rafsanjani paid his first visit to Syria as Iranian president in April 1991. He held talks described at the time as very successful. Political observers believe that Syria's participation in the peace negotiations with Israel, which Iran strongly opposes, has not resulted in any Syrian-Iranian misunderstanding and that Iran's position on this is that it is a matter related to Syria's views on the issues of peace and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati has stated that his country would not have a dispute with such states as Syria, with whom it enjoys solid and close relations, over the question of peace agreement. Iran believes that Damascus is coming under massive pressure to sign a peace agreement with Israel, and Iran has told Syria that it is opposed to such an agreement and to anything to do with peace with Israel. President al-Asad has said that both countries share the same views on Lebanon and both have long supported Lebanon's unity. Syrian sources say that President Hafiz al-Asad's visit to Tehran will further enhance Syrian-Iranian relations and raise them to a more special level, particularly in economic and cultural fields.
