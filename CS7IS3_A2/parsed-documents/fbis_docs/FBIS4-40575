"We have no information confirming these reports," a spokesman for the ministry told DDP/ADN news agency today in response to a query. He pointed out that it is "technically extremely difficult" to use foreign fuel rods in Russian nuclear plants. Greenpeace says 123 fuel rods originally intended for use in a fast breeder at Kalkar are to be "disposed of" in Beloyarsk. It said research conducted in the southern Urals reveals that an Essen- based operating firm, Schnell-Brueter-Kernkraftwerksgesellschaft (SBK), a subsidiary of RWE, wants to transport the fuel rods to Beloyarsk for use in the BN-600 breeder, which is regarded as unsafe. Greenpeace bases its report on comments by the chief engineer at the power station. A malfunction at Beloyarsk in early May resulted in a fire in the plant's third reactor which took several hours to put out. Radioactivity did not escape. The 123 fuel rods, which Greenpeace says contain 1.1 tonnes of plutonium, are currently being stored in a Siemens-owned bunker in Hanau under federal supervision.
