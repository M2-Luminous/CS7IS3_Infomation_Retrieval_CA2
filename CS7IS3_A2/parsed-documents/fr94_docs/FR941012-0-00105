FR941012-0-00105 FR941012-0-00011 As stated above, in this paragraph OSHA has eliminated all proposed exceptions to the requirement of maintaining contact with another employee. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, OSHA has eliminated the proposed exceptions for several reasons. First, various State standards do not include an exception to the contact requirement (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;22, 38J, 38K). Second, several commenters supported the proposal that all employees remain in contact and indicated that they do maintain contact with all employees, including employees in single employee assignments, via radio and telephone (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). As a result, these commenters suggested the exceptions may no longer be necessary (See also, Ex. 5&hyph;33). These commenters also reasoned that all employees, including mobile machine operators performing single employee assignments, need a method of summoning help in an emergency. OSHA agrees with these commenters. The Agency believes that the contact requirement will help to provide prompt assistance to all employees who are injured or are otherwise in emergency situations. As discussed above in the Major Issues section, with the advent of radio communication, it is feasible to maintain contact with workers performing single employee assignments. OSHA notes that it is implied in this provision that not only will means for contact be provided, but also that contact will be maintained with each employee. All but one State logging standard require check-in systems to assure that contact is maintained (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 38J, 38K). In addition, several commenters say they have initiated check-in systems to assure that employees working in remote locations are all right. At paragraph (d)(6)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring the employer to account for each employee at the end of the workshift. OSHA has adopted this provision from the pulpwood logging and the proposed standards. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. Several State logging standards also require check-in systems at the end of the workshift to ensure no employees are left in the woods (Ex. 2&hyph;17, 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 38K). Several commenters said that it was not necessary for small felling and bucking crews to be accounted for by anyone other than the crew members (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;63). In response, OSHA points out that nothing in the final rule would prevent the employer from allowing a crew supervisor, for example, to account for the rest of the crew at the end of the workshift. In such cases, the employer is responsible for establishing and enforcing a regular system whereby there is a check on each employee at the end of the workshift. The most important thing is that no employee is unaccounted for at the close of the shift. As with the contact requirement, OSHA believes that this provision will help to assure timely assistance to employees in emergencies. In addition, end of shift accounting offers several other benefits to the employer and employee. First, the employer can remain appraised of the progress made on the job during the last workshift. Second, any hazardous conditions that were not contemplated during pre-shift meetings with employees can be relayed to the employer for dissemination to other employees. Third, unserviceable tools and machines can be reported to the employer so that replacements can be obtained or repairs can made before the next workshift. Therefore, OSHA has retained this provision in the final standard. Several commenters said this provision would interfere with contracting situations when the logger is an independent contractor (Ex. 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;23, 5&hyph;36, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55, 5&hyph;63). However, they did not provide any evidence as to how this provision might conflict with contracting agreements. Signaling and Signal Equipment At paragraph (d)(7)(i) of this final rule, OSHA is requiring that hand or audible signals such as whistles, horns, or radios, be utilized whenever noise, distance or other factors prevent clear understanding of normal voice communications between employees. Paragraph (d)(7)(ii) prohibits the use of engine noise, such as from chains saws, as a means of maintaining contact. These provisions supplement and support the requirement for the maintenance of audible or visual contact contained in paragraph (d)(6)(iii). The proposed rule also contained a contact requirement. However, it would not have prohibited the use of chain-saw noise as a means of signaling. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a requirement similar to the proposed rule. Several State logging standards also prohibit the use of chain-saw noise as a signaling device (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 2&hyph;23, 38K). The Washington State logging standard requires fellers to carry whistles, which are to be used for no other purpose than to summon help (Ex. 2&hyph;22, 5&hyph;7).
