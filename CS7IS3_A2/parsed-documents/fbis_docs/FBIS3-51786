Reina will be taking office on 27 January to replace Rafael Callejas. Reina's government team is a mixture of progressive intellectuals, former university professors, conservative businessmen, and politicians. Guillermo Bueno, a prominent financial administrator and former president of the Honduran Central Bank during military governments, will be Reina's presidential economic adviser and coordinator of the economic cabinet. The intellectuals include Ernesto Paz Aguilar as foreign minister, Hugo Noe Pino as Central Bank president, and Guillermo Molina Chocano as planning minister. The three have not held government or business positions in the past. Juan Ferrera, who until now has served as president of the Honduran Council of Private Enterprise (Cohep), will head the Finance Ministry, and banker Delmer Urbizo will be economy minister. The main economic advisers will be financier Jorge Bueso Arias and Dante Ramirez, former president of the Central American Bank of Economic Integration (BCIE). Even though during his trip to Washington last week, Reina had announced a dialogue with the Armed Forces to appoint a civilian as defense minister, today he stated that this position will be held by Colonel Reynaldo Andino Flores. Reina's government team is completed by former Liberal Party presidential hopeful Rodolfo Pastor as culture minister; German Aparicio, a close political supporter, as transport minister; lawyer Efrain Moncada Silva as government minister; Cecilio Zavala as labor minister; Xenovia de Leon, promoter of nongovernmental organizations, as education minister; and Enrique Samayoa as health minister. Attorney Ubodoro Arriaga will head the National Agrarian Institute (INA). He held that post during the Roberto Suazo Cordova administration (1982-86). The president-elect appointed his brother, Mario Reina, as assistant in the presidential office. "I have sounded out all sectors and this cabinet is what best suits the moral revolution," Reina said.
