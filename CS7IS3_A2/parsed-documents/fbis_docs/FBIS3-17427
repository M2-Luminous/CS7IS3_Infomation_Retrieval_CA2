"Accusing Moscow of forgetting the problem of the use of liquid radioactive waste, the Primorye administration is seeking to put psychological pressure on the Japanese and to get the money from them as soon as possible," the diplomat said. He said the statement was not a surprise for the Russian Foreign Ministry. "The Primorye administration had made it clear even before that it wants on its own to be able to handle the money which the Japanese agreed to provide for the construction of the liquid nuclear waste deposits and reprocessing facilities," the diplomat said. He noted particularly that negotiations with the Japanese on the construction of nuclear waste deposits and facilities for its reprocessing are going on "in a constructive way." "What does not suit the Primorye administration then? -- Perhaps, only the fact that the money will go not directly to it, but through the center, i.e. through Moscow," the diplomat suggested.
