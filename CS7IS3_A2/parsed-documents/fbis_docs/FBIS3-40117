Consequently, substantive advances have been scored in some major fields of reform and opening to the outside world. Early Results Seen From Implementation of "The Regulations" As of the end of June, the "Implementation Methods" were fully inaugurated in every province, municipality, and autonomous region. Of the 28 associated regulations drawn up by State Council agencies, six have been promulgated, four have been countersigned, seven have been forwarded for examination, and 11 are awaiting forwarding for examination. Eight of the 14 rights to manage their own affairs that "The Regulations" confer on enterprises have been largely implemented, and four have been partially implemented, including the right to form partnerships and merge, the right to assign manpower to jobs, the right to make investment decisions, and the right to dispose of assets. Rights that have not been implemented are two: the right to import and export, and the right to refuse the levying of assessments. In this process, which has as its goal the transformation of state-owned enterprises operating mechanisms, many different methods have been newly tried out. One is the active and steadfast running of share system trials, the emphasis of share system transformation being on changing enterprises' operating mechanisms. Second is enterprises' further introduction of the competition mechanism, enhancement of internal management, and intensification of internal reform. Third is the attraction of foreign investment, practicing "grafting," bringing a number of enterprises -- particularly a number of old enterprises -- into the marketplace, and getting a number of enterprises to emulate the operating mechanism used in three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, managing in accordance with customary international practice. New Actions Taken and New Advances Made in Equity Rights System Reform Following the 14th Party Congress, all jurisdictions paid close attention to the systematization of equity rights relationships and reform of the equity rights system, their understanding of the importance of equity rights system reform becoming increasingly clear, and new actions being taken in the following regards. 1) Expansion of the scope of share system pilot projects, selecting nine enterprises for the listing of shares in Hong Kong, and permitting two enterprises (the Shanghai Petrochemicals Main Plant and the Qingdao Brewery) to list shares formally on the Hong Kong Stock Market. 2) Equity rights trading markets have become livelier with each passing day. Today, 25 cities in more than 10 provinces throughout the country have set up or are in process of preparing to set up equity rights trading markets. 3) Pilot projects have begun to be run on "state-owned, civilian-operated," and "publicly owned, privately operated" management systems in small enterprises. Results have been pretty good, and the outlook appears good. 4) Equity rights transfers, enterprise mergers, enterprise bankruptcies, and the individually and privately operated economy developed further. Enterprises' organizational structure was further readjusted. Important Advances in Government Agency Reform and Changes of Functions In order to meet requirements for development of a market economy, the State Council made some neeeded adjustments of the functions of some government agencies this year. State Council government agency reforms are moving ahead across-the board, and will likely be completed before the end of the year. Encouraged by the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, great strides were made, and good results obtained in pilot projects for the reform of local government agencies, which focused primarily on government agencies at the county and township level. Now the scope of these pilot projects has gradually been expanded to include about one-fifth of the counties in the country. Pilot projects for reform of government, prefecture, and municipal agencies have also begun. Inner Mongolia, which is a pilot project province or region for the reform of local government agencies throughout the nation, is running agency reform projects in 86 banners and counties. This is 86 percent of all banners and counties in the autonomous region. So far, it has disbanded or merged 1,559 party, government, and mass organizations in the streamlining of more than 41 percent of agencies. It has also sent more than 100,000 personnel from various official agencies and institutions elsewhere, and it has set up more than 16,200 economic entities of various kinds. Further Increase in Intensity of Price Reform; Greater Speed in Building Markets 1) A new situation has occurred in price reform. More than 90 percent of the nation's provinces, directly administered municipalities, and autonomous regions, more than 280 of its prefectures and cities, and more than 1,900 of its counties have deregulated grain and edible oil sale prices. They have also deregulated, in turn, steel and iron products, and some government-allocated coal. Means of production on which the state sets prices number only 25, or approximately 20 percent of total means of production sales. Only six agricultural products, or 15 percent of agricultural product sales, remain on which the state sets prices. The state sets prices on only two industrial consumer goods, or less than 10 percent of them, and the state sets prices on fewer than 10 percent of total retail commodity sales. 2) With the change from the old to the new system, fine prospects for the building of markets have appeared. A look at commodity markets shows the development of nearly 80,000 country fair markets nationwide doing 353 billion yuan worth of business annually. This is one-fourth of all social commodity sales. There are more than 3,000 wholesale markets of various kinds. They include the preliminary formation of crisscrossing commodity market networks for agricultural and sideline products, industrial wares used in daily life, and the means of production. Markets for key elements have also developed to a certain extent. Some long-term investment markets, short-term financing markets, and foreign exchange regulation markets have been established in some large- and medium-sized cities. Throughout the country, manpower markets, technology markets, real estate markets, securities markets, and information markets have been set up that are developing and operating very well. Further Advances in Moving Ahead With the Establishment of New System Fully Integrated Municipal Reform Pilot Projects Following approval by the State Commission for System Reform, eight cities including Chongqing, Anshan, Changzhou, Wenzhou, Yantai, Yanji, Tangshan, and Tongling have become pilot project cities for completely integrated reforms. These cities are in process of drawing up fully integrated reform plans as a first step in taking the lead in the establishment of a socialist market economy system. Further Appearance of City, Town, and Rural Village Joint Stock System Enterprises 1) City and town joint share system enterprises have developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Liaoning, and the city of Shanghai, as of the end of June 1993, there were more than 5,000 city and town joint stock system enterprises. 2) The large scale appearance of rural joint stock share enterprises has become a major ingredient in rural economic reform that is indicative of the direction of township and town enterprise reform, and that marks another important milestone of major significance in rural reform. Steady Intensification of Foreign Trade System Reform, Further Widening of the Opening to the Outside World, and Improvement of the Investment Climate First is positive advances in import-export system reform and the continued development of foreign trade. Customs statistics show a 4.4 percent increase over the same period in 1992 in total exports and a 23.3 percent increase in total imports for the first half of the year. Second is further development of the externally oriented economy, notably border trade and foreign economic and technical cooperation. The Huang He Economic Cooperation Zone comprised of nine provinces and autonomous regions along the Huang He, namely Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Qinghai Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia uses to the full the advantages of the seacoast, the river, and the frontier. This zone has jointly opened 34 land, sea, and air ports of entry and exit, and it has developed broader international trade with more than 80 countries and territories including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Third is fine prospects for the development everywhere of three kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Statistics from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai show more than 7,600 new enterprises built with foreign investment in the Chang Jiang Delta between January and May 1993, and a contractual foreign investment of $8 billion, which is between three and four times the amount for the same period in 1992. Fourth is continued expansion of the area opened to the outside world. The State Council has recently approved the operation of foreign owned commercial retail businesses in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Dalian, Qingdao and the five special economic zones, and it has issued companion policy regulations. In addition, it has approved 23 cities and counties in Inner Mongolia and Henan as areas open to foreigners, thereby bringing to 919 the number of cities and counties in China that are opening to the outside world. State Council approved economic and technical development zones now number 30. Fifth is the active movement into internal and domestic markets of cities along the Chang Jiang. In-depth Advances in Social Security System Reform 1) New advances have been made in reform of the old age insurance system. Currently, more than 500,000 enterprises of all kinds nationwide, more than 85 million staff members and workers, and more than 17 million retired or separated personnel are enrolled in retirement plans. More than 60 million staff members in twenty-two provinces and cities make individual contributions to basic old age insurance. More than 500,000 staff members and workers in more than 600 enterprises are enrolled in enterprise supplementary old age insurance pilot projects. Sixty-five cities and counties are reforming their basic old age fund calculation methods. 2) Industrial accident insurance system reform pilot projects are expanding steadily. In addition to provincewide reforms in Guangdong and Hainan provinces, more than 390 cities and counties, and more than 6.5 million people in Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangxi, Fujian, Sichuan, Hubei, Henan, and Shandong provinces are participating in industrial accident insurance reform pilot projects. 3) Medical insurance system reforms are being carried out everywhere. More than 80 percent of all enterprises in the country have instituted reforms of various kinds. Further Improvement of Economic Laws and Regulations China has accelerated the economic legislation pace during the year, a number of laws, regulations and documents of a regulatory nature appearing one after another. As of the end of June, the NPC Standing Committee had passed several important regulations such as "Amendment of the People's Republic of China Constitution," the "People's Republic of China Product Quality Law," and "Supplementary Provisions Pertaining to the Punishment of Falsification of Registered Trademark." A number of laws and regulations such as the "Corporation Law," the "Securities Law," and the "Law Against Unfair Competition" will shortly be sent to the NPC Standing Committee for deliberation. During the first half of the year nearly 20 State Council administrative regulations and documents of a regulatory nature were published, including "Interim Regulations on the Issuance of Stocks and Exchange Control," "Unemployment Insurance Regulations for Staff Members and Workers in State-Owned Enterprises," "Regulations on the Placement of Redundant Staff Members and Workers of State-Owned Enterprises," "Peoples Republic of China National Currency Export and Import Control Methods," "State Council Circular Notice on Resolutely Halting Indiscriminate Fund Raising and Greater Control Over Bond Issues," and "State Council Circular Notice on Hastening Grain Circulation System Reform." Some of the circular notices that the State Commission on System Reform drafted titled, "Regulations Controlling Shareholdings by Staff Members and Workers in Directional Capital Raising Shareholding Companies Ltd.," "Checking Irregular Methods Whereby Staff Members of Fixed Collection Ltd., Liability Corporations Hold Shares," "Futures Markets Trial Measures," and "Interim Regulations for City and Town Joint Stock Enterprises," will be issued in the near future. The views of agencies concerned are being urgently solicited on some of these. The pace and rhythm of Eighth NPC Standing Committee legislation will quicken greatly. Plans call for the shaping of an overall framework for a socialist market economy legal system during the five-year plan period. Work on Designing an "Overall Program for the Building of a Socialist Market Economy System" Moving Along Smoothly The State Commission on System Reform is currently working on further revisions and improvement of the "Program." In addition to the aforementioned progress, particularly arresting is the CPC Central Committee and State Council decisions of the past several months on the intensification of reform, and the strengthening and improvement of macroeconomic regulation and control of the national economy, using mostly economic means to solve difficulties and problems that have risen in economic development, which have achieved initial results. They have systematically and completely studied problems in accelerating the building of a socialist market economy system, focusing on the study of coordinated reform measures in the fields of finance and banking, government finance, taxation, state-owned assets control, the investment system, and the foreign trade system. Major reforms have been made in these regards recently. In summary, during 1993, the reform situation throughout the country has been good. It has developed in a healthy way. Some problems do exist, however, principal of which are the following: 1) Unevenness in implementation of "the Regulations." 2) Continuation of the problem of a hiatus between reform and development, some places still failing to concentrate their main attention on the intensification of reform. 3) Mindlessness in the building of markets. Some places care only about the number of markets they build without caring about their quality. Second, market regulation and policy measures lag. The building of markets is not very regularized. It is disorderly and authority is monopolized. Regions and departments act in isolation, and failure to act according to market laws, competition laws, and the laws of value is widespread. 4) Macroeconomic system reform lacks intensity, and the macroeconomic operating environment is becoming increasingly tight. More serious attention must be given to these difficulties and problems. Reform must be further intensified, a socialist market economy system and an economic legal system consistent with a market economy must be built to produce a solution.
