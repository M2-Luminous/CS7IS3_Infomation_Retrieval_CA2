So far there's been only talk of prosecuting low-ranking army officials for such war crimes. Some members of Dutch parliament claim that the worst criminals in former Yugoslavia are not those wearing uniforms but those who put on suits to attend peace negotiations. The special tribunal at the International Court of Justice in The Hague is to start conducting its first trials this year.
