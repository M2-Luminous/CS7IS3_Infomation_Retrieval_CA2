The French premier flies into Beijing for a four-day visit today and is the most senior French politician to visit China since 1989. "China expects Balladur's visit to help push the development of the two nations trade and economic cooperation," said Tong Jiemin, deputy director-general of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec). The Chinese Government always attaches high importance to its business relations with France, a major economic power with high technology, said Tong, who is responsible for European affairs. "We're willing to restore the good economic relations with France that we had before 1989 and we hope the economic co-operation and trade which has already started between the two nations will develop for a long period," he added. Sino-French relations deteriorated in 1992 when the French government approved the sale of weapons to Taiwan, one of China's provinces. Tong said China welcomes French enterprises to join the competition for the lucrative Chinese market with other foreign firms. China is expected to import at least $1,000 billion between now and the year 2000. And Sino-French economic co-operation has a good foundation, especially in energy, transport, telecommunications, chemicals, agriculture and raw materials. "We hope France will continue its exploitation of business possibilities in these sectors as other developed countries have done," said Tong. He promised the Chinese Government will help small and medium- sized enterprises in France to cooperate with their Chinese counterparts. China has 410,000 small enterprises, many of them operating in rural areas, and they have become a major force in the economy. Many small Chinese firms are looking for foreign partners to start joint ventures to open domestic and foreign markets. Bilateral trade between France and China rose 30 percent to nearly $3 billion last year. China's imports of French goods rose 10 percent to $1.64 billion and its exports rose 60 percent to $1.29 billion. Many French companies have pumped money into co-operative projects with Chinese firms as the two nations have begun to trade more. By the end of last year, French companies had invested $889 million in 549 projects in China. Most of the projects are located in coastal areas. Guangzhou Peugeot, a joint venture making cars in Guangdong Province, is one of the largest foreign-invested enterprises in China. It is also the third largest foreign-invested car producer in the country.
