The absence of President Biya at this meeting is linked -- it is generally believed -- to the border conflict that broke out between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula. The points on the agenda of the summit -- to which the heads of state of the border states of Lake Chad (Cameroon, Niger, Nigeria, and Chad) are invited -- include the launching of a campaign "for the safeguarding of Lake Chad" aimed at solliciting the aid of the international community to finance the necessary works that would prevent the lake from drying up. "Up to now, the name of President Biya does not appear on the official list of the heads of state who expressed the wish to take part in the summit," a source from the Nigerian Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed. Cameroon Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuel Libock Mbei, is currently on an official mission to Cameroon, it was learned from that country's embassy, with no more details. The Bakassi Peninsula -- with about 1,000 square km in the Gulf of Guinea -- is rich in natural resources (primarily fish) and is said to contain important hydrocarbon deposits. While seeking a diplomatic solution to that conflict that escalated at the beginning of March, Cameroon and Nigeria deployed troops on Bakassi and Yaounde regularly reports clashes between the two troops.
