This was told today to reporters by Sergey Zotov, head of the Russian delegation. The Latvian side is at the moment acquainting itself with the new Russian proposals. The Latvian delegation believes that the facility should be non-military. Russian representatives, however, oppose that. Speaking about the resumption of the talks in general after yesterday's incident between the leadership of the Vidzeme district of Riga and two generals of the Russian army, Zotov explained that one of the aims of the person responsible for the provocation was to disrupt the talks and to hinder the effort to reach agreement between Latvia and Russia on troop withdrawal. With this, suspension of the talks would have been only in the interest of the person responsible for the provocation. The talks between representatives of the Latvian and Russian delegations on troop withdrawal will continue tomorrow.
