Brothers and sisters, members of the National Dialogue Drafting Committee Conference: For the first time in a half century, the whole world, and those of us in Egypt, feel that we are going through one of the most delicate and difficult stages of transformation in the lives of countries and their people. For 50 years, the world has lived under constant balance of political, economic, and military force. International relations, alliances, and affiliations were organized in a specific manner and there were patterns which drew the lines between friends and adversaries and between common and discordant interests. We then found ourselves, along with all the countries in the world, with the balances of force changed: Enmity turned into friendship and those boundaries were obliterated. Ideologies and concepts which governed half the world for decades changed. Countries which were noted for their domestic stability and leadership abroad were buffeted by strong winds of chaos and conflict. Inasmuch as the trends toward grouping grew in numerous countries, trends toward fragmentation and division prevailed in others. We found ourselves in the welter of a world living through a stage of difficult transition in political and economic systems and international relations. We in Egypt are not living in isolation from what is going on around us, but at the same time we are rebuilding our homeland during one of the most delicate stages of our historical development, a stage that the world perhaps has not seen for centuries. We are seeking to consolidate stability in a world buffeted by disturbance, violence, and the logic of force. We are struggling to build a strong and prosperous economy in a world where the level of inflation, unemployment, and recession is rising. We are choosing a sound course of democratic practice in a world that calls for defense of freedoms while daily it does the contrary, prompting people to lose confidence in its credibility. We are keen on returning security and stability to the Egyptian man and providing him with livelihood and staples at a time when an unholy force of evil killers and agents ally to strike the Egyptian man's life, livelihood, and stability. Nevertheless, we are going through our current stage of great transformation amid domestic challenges, regional signs of concern, and the decline of negative aspects in foreign relations have failed to weaken our resolve, take us back, or prevented us from forging ahead to rebuild modern Egypt, an Egypt that is more stable and secure, more plentiful and prosperous, more cohesive and harmonious, and loftier and leading. The true motive behind my national call to all the sons of Egypt was my deep awareness of the need to provide basic requirements of national rebuilding in Egypt, whether these requirements were political entity, economic structure, social establishment, or cultural values. My goal was to prepare the groundwork so people could launch initiatives, hold dialogues, and exchange ideas. Also so intellectual and academic societies could engage in a comprehensive national dialogue to review the achievements of the past years, to evaluate present accomplishments, and to draw a new map for our sons and future generations at the outset of the 21st century. These ideas were the goals to which I sincerely aspired when I initiated the appeal for a national dialogue. It was not a call for a temporary meeting to merely submit papers and then file them away. It was a call to work out a sound and developed scientific formula to address all aspects of life in Egypt in the 21st century and to specify priorities for national action in light of the requirement of comprehensive development of the Egyptian society in the political, economic, social, and cultural fields. It was a call for a formula to orchestrate the Egyptian resources with all their significance in the regional and international arenas and to safeguard our national security and defend the holy land. Since our intrinsic potential is the true mainstay of our national security, our sound and enlightened moves in the foreign spheres are steered to serve our national interests. The planned management of our international relations monitor events and developments, adjust to changes, increase our friends, contain adversaries and enmities, and deepen cooperation and common interests. In foreign relations, we believe in, and seek, fair peace and firmly confront and deter any danger to our national interests no matter the source. Brothers and sisters, in my speech before the People's Assembly, I outlined the following mainstays for national dialogue: first, the sound understanding of the challenges facing Egypt; second, the meticulous perception of the circumstances that govern our regional and external relations; and third, the clear-cut delineation of the priorities of the national action in the next stage. In my speech on Labor Day, I called for crystallizing the objectives which should be expected from the dialogue. I was quick to warn against repercussions that might surface as a result of the instigators' schemes. These schemes are aimed at making the dialogue deviate from its noble goals by mixing political action with religion so that instigators would not be brought into account. I affirmed that the major objective behind this dialogue is to ensure a basic condition of democracy without slipping into the chaos of ideas or conflict of stances which could threaten the supreme interests of the homeland. I also explained that the sound concept of democracy does not mean that there are no boundaries between the legitimate law-abiding forces and the illegitimate forces that provoke acts of violence and challenge law. I presented our specific concept of these legitimate forces, because they are the forces which seek to establish a clear-cut accord among themselves. The objective of this accord is to safeguard the homeland's interests and to ensure that democracy will never turn into disorder that would cripple the society's energies. I also explained our concept of our democratic experience. I said that democracy is not a mold or a form that could be applied equally everywhere. Every country has its own circumstances, conditions, and experiences that must be taken into consideration. I said that democracy is the course of our life and our irrefutable choice. I also made it a point to outline the following principles of this dialogue: 1. This dialogue must focus on the homeland's basic issues whether they are economic, political, or social issues; 2. It must be above party interests; 3. It must be based on a scientific and realistic concept that would represent the priorities of the national action in Egypt; . It must carefully take into account the homeland's energies and potentials; and 5. This dialogue must never risk the homeland's security and stability. Brothers and sisters, hence, my honest call was made for the sake of conducting a responsible national dialogue. Stability is a guarantee for democracy and there can be no stability in a society overwhelmed by infighting and division. Brothers and sisters, if the freedom of opinion and the interaction of views constitute the essence of dialogue, the participation that is aware of the homeland's rights and which is abiding by legitimacy, its constitutional duties, and national and political principles, will represent the starting point in formulating the scientific concept of future Egypt. Broad participation is the sure guarantee for a rich dialogue. It is also the guarantee for the usefulness and effectiveness of such a dialogue. However, such participation cannot take place without certain basiss to govern its action or criteria to control its tempo. The most important criterion for participation is adherence to the political standards adopted by Egyptian society. These standards have taken root in this society's national conscience and mind. They are the result of this society's historical heritage and experience over hundreds of years and the fruit of its national struggle in its contemporary and modern history, dictated by the nature of the structure of its civilization and geography when, on the area of this ancient homeland, it first established a society that did not know racial, religious, sectarian, or class discrimination. This is a society in which various groups of its citizens have been united since the dawn of time, a society in whose melting pot all trends and religions were fused and held together by the Egyptian weave. There is no room for sectarianism, nor is there any place for fanaticism or class distinction. The second most important criterion for this participation is adherence to the constitutional standards which the Egyptian people unanimously agreed upon when they adopted a republican and democratic system as a style and course for their political life. This system enables the people to rule themselves, gives the law sovereignty, protects freedoms, and sanctifies duties. The third criterion for participation consists of the national standards which are represented by the strength of belonging and loyalty to this homeland; second, the depth of commitment to the goals and significance of public responsibility; and third, the performance of duties to the same extent as adherence to rights. These, brothers and sisters, are the criteria for participation in the dialogue and the political, constitutional, and national standards. There are no restrictions other than what the homeland and society have approved through their historic and cultural experiences. The agreements of the nation, which it has reached through all its actions in its modern history, cannot be violated. The spirit of consensus in the Egyptian nation was a law based on justice, freedom based on commitment and responsibility, a right backed by duties, and a national, social, and cultural struggle which cannot be forfeited or ceded. Within this framework, the national call for participation in the dialogue was made. We made this call to all social forces and economic, social, and cultural institutions that respect legitimacy and adhere to the constitution and law, so that opinions interact and our internal political and social reality is explored to deduce the characteristics of the future. We also made this call so that these forces and institutions can learn from the experiences of others, pinpoint the strengths of other societies and adopt them for themselves; and so that they can see the obstacles and stumbling blocs in the marches of other peoples, thus avoiding them and keeping themselves and Egypt away from such obstacles. The national call was directed at the national and legitimate forces for them to take the initiative to produce action, not be on the receiving end. The future of Egypt is, first and foremost, the trust of its sons, citizens, and generations. It is not a monopoly of the present generation or the ruling party. The national call was addressed to the professional institutions and unions that operate within the framework of legitimacy, and to the research centers, intellectuals, inventors, and the masses of educated people in Egypt. It was not merely a call for participation in decision-making, or formulating a program, or polling an opinion; it was a call for stimulating energies, driving determination, inspiring the minds, and arousing the conscience to give serious and responsible thought to the Egypt of tomorrow and the future. Dear brothers and sisters, all of the above are elements and parties to the dialogue who are taking part in it by expressing their views, offering advice, contributing experience, and voicing their opinion. There are no boundaries separating them from telling the truth. There is nothing to prevent them from being totally frank. Participation with such logic, with this objective, under these conditions, and in this way could in fact be the correct interpretation of a democratic political life in Egypt. Expanding participation based on these criteria and proceeding from these starting points provides the proper guarantees for a national dialogue in which the sides will take part within the constitutional, political, and national regulations. The unions and all the forces of Egyptian society capable of thinking, expressing opinion, holding discussions, and contributing to society will take part in this dialogue. Since this is the nature of this dialogue and its various issues, its various criteria and standards, and the sides participating in it, the committee tasked with preparing the general conference is responsible for translating all this into definite concepts and detailed plans of action. Responsibilities and duties entrusted upon this preparatory committee revolve round many axes. The first axis is to define the legitimate national forces within the political, economic, social, and cultural frameworks that will be participating in the dialogue and which operate under the umbrella of the law and constitution. The second axis is to choose the issues and subjects around which the dialogue should revolve. The third axis is to set and organize the style of action during the conference, be that through holding general sessions, or forming major committees or specialized working groups. In other words, the preparatory committee will define the organizational form of the general conference and the rules governing its measures and discussions. It will also make recommendations at the conclusion of the conference. The preparatory and drafting committee will present its recommendations to the general conference during its first session. Brothers and sisters, there will always be a standard governing all other standards and topping them all. It controls all other criteria and rises above them. This standard is, above all, a sense of belonging to this homeland within its borders, to its history and its heritage; it is a desire to protect its security from evil and its citizens from every harm. I am very hopeful and confident that there will be a great national response in the form of a national call for open dialogue to map out Egypt's future and chart its years ahead. The source of my hope and confidence for this national response is what I have sensed and seen over the past few months. I have noticed large-scale discussion in all clubs and forums, in the media, and in research centers of the philosophy of dialogue and its concepts, its objectives and various issues, its requirements and usefulness, and the various parties participating in it. Irrespective of how correct or incorrect, real or fake, honest or dishonest things are, we have before us today an open book with as many trends as the number of writers who have contributed to it and as many opinions as those who have produced it. Today, we have the responsibility of a historic choice, because today we choose for ourselves inasmuch as we choose for the coming generations. We choose for the present inasmuch as we choose for the future. The start of a national dialogue today is our way of increasing knowledge of the homeland's concerns and mapping out the road to achieve its objectives. The start of a national dialogue today will strengthen confidence in our abilities to govern our own destiny and to plan the programs that will transfer modern Egypt from a rising, developing country into an advanced state taking a leading position among other states in the new world order, the features and landmarks of which are still being shaped and reshaped every day. The start of a national dialogue today will define concepts, control standards, and draw up roles and missions for the homeland and its citizens. Through it, amity will prevail and ideas and minds will meet to promote this faithful country. Brothers and sisters, this in my opinion is the significance and purpose of the dialogue and these are its aims and objectives. With all sincerity I frankly tell you that the call for dialogue was not a reaction to a national dilemma imposed by circumstances--never--or necessitated by modern pressures. Nor was it a transient move to conglomerate parties into what is being called a national front or national coalition dictated by the requirements of what is being termed reconciliation during this sensitive stage we are going through. National dialogue is a sincere national call that rises above partisanship and parties and in which the state, the government, the people, and the whole Egyptian society will melt into one system of national action for Egypt. I frankly tell you that from this purely Egyptian perspective our national dialogue is different from other dialogues in its nature, goals, and motives. Our dialogue derives its roots from a nation that is the best of nations, whose cultural identity has never been erased and whose unique character throughout history has never been lost. God has given this nation a true historic feeling, thanks to which Egypt has never made a mistake in choosing the correct course at the correct time. Our dialogue will grow and prosper in a society whose forces have not fought with each other and whose elements have never quarreled. This society has lived on the banks of the great Nile in unity, cohesion, and harmony. From the political and cultural points of view, it is futile to make comparisons between what is taking place in other societies and what is happening in Egypt when we open a new chapter of new dialogue. The chapters or stages of this dialogue among the Egyptian people have never stopped. The launching of this dialogue begins the regulation of the movement of society in Egypt for the next years. It will help us avoid the past shortcomings that hindered the march of society and will glorify the present achievements that broke barriers and unleashed capabilities. The national call for a comprehensive dialogue on the future of national action in Egypt has its perils, significance, and results. But we must always realize that the dialogue has three objectives: first, to preserve the security and stability of this homeland; second, to establish a balance between the citizens' ambitions and the potentials of the homeland; and third, to secure broad participation in the process of finding solutions to the problems of the society and in decision-making. These three basic objectives represent a broad framework comprising the issues and priorities for national action. In our contemporary world, there are three indispensable elements which nations and homelands need to be strong: national and social solidarity; economic and material potential; and scientific and cultural progress. If these elements are lacking, or if any of them collapses, states blunder and they stumble in their steps; indeed, they retrogress and end up depending on others for security, power, and knowledge, and even for aid and survival. Aware of our need for these three elements, we, in our call for a national dialogue, proposed that the priorities of our national work be as follows: 1. Building a strong and prosperous economy as the center of economic development, and realizing the well-being of the Egyptians as the center of social development. 2. Egypt's youths represent its present and future, and their issues must top the national action's list of priorities. High among these issues are the optimal use of manpower and the ability of the labor market to accommodate all job seekers. 3. The relationship between the people, who constitute Egypt's human wealth and the sources of its development and growth, and the country's natural resources and economic capabilities must be regulated. That is, a balance between man and land must be created so that we can achieve abundance and strength. 4. Culture, education, and science in Egypt represent the triangle of the national project designed to change the face of political, economic, and social life, achieve cultural development in the coming decades, and to establish links between science and society and between education and production. 5. Curative and preventive health care for Egyptians is not only a state service, but an effort to maintain and preserve the dearest and most valuable thing on this good land, namely, the Egyptian man in his childhood, youth, and old age. 6. Modernizing and developing the administration is the key to a successful performance. No matter how generous nature is, resources and capabilities are dissipated if there is no modern administration to design, plan, implement, and oversee. In our modern Egypt, where resources are scarce and population is abundant, we, more than anybody else, need a modern and developed administration and a firm control system. 7. The call to transfer responsibility to a new generation of Egyptian youth does not stem from a mere desire for change or rotation of power, but is a natural response to legitimate hopes for contributions in building the Egypt of the future. Brothers and sisters, the start of the national dialogue opens doors to every sincere Egyptian, to every patriotic person committed to the security of his country and people, to every intellectual knowledgeable of his nation's heritage and the people's values, and to every laborer and farmer sweating and working hard to water the soil of Egypt so that it can produce crops, virtue, and development, and so that Egypt's fields can bloom, its desert and valleys can be built up, and development can reach every spot in this land. This beginning of a national dialogue, brothers and sisters, opens the doors of hope for Egypt's future. We are determined to maintain Egypt's security and stability, and we have sworn to God that we will safeguard the Egyptian citizen's right to a dignified life in which he feels safe about his present and future. We have vowed to shoulder this trust and not to relinquish our responsibility in defending the unity and cohesiveness of this nation and the sacred soil of this homeland. We will remain faithful to our pledge to God and the homeland. Every engagement will be inquired into on the day of reckoning. Peace be upon you.
