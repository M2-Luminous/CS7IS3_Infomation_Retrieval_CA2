You sensationally changed your position in relation to this situation. This happened literally yesterday, as far as I understand it, right? You gave this statement yesterday. What led you to do this, what did the Serbs do to make you believe that they are deceiving Russia, and that it is now difficult to continue talks with them? [Churkin] But I have not changed my position. I believe that I did what was necessary, proceeding from the position that I have been following over practically the last two years. My position was a very simple one. That is that the great Russia -- so long as the Serbs ask for it -- can truly help the Serbs if they travel the path toward peace. We will help to point out that path to them. But if they travel a different path then they cannot expect the great Russia to help them. But I was forced to make this statement, and I made it quite consciously, although in some comments now, especially in Serbia, they are saying it was an emotional one and that Churkin was speaking out, and so on. I was there for nine days and I received the quite distinct feeling that the Serbs are on the brink of a catastrophe, and not only the Bosnian Serbs, but all the Serbs. First and foremost, they will themselves end up in a catastrophic situation, and the whole of the rest of the world would be pushed into very grave events. Of course, I did not reckon that this statement would lead to some kind of turning point in policy, but still, I hope that for many Serbs this statement would make them think carefully, and, apart from that, in the practical sense, I felt that something had begun to move there. [Svanidze] Who made you promises and broke them? Who, in your opinion, deceived you? You have in mind Radovan Karadzic? [Churkin] Well, today I would not really want to name names, but I had the main conversations with Karadzic, although a totally dramatic situation developed on that day when the plane was shot down, and a massive bombardment, as it were, and great difficulties were threatened, and the election campaign was going on there somewhere, and I was, literally, as it were, trying to get a decision from anyone. I rang President Milosevic and talked to other Bosnian Serb leaders. There was even one moment when, in a telephone conversation with President Milosevic, I cried out in amazement: What, am I supposed to proclaim myself president of the Republic of Serbia so as to make a decision, as it were, on the issue? [Svanidze] Vitaliy Ivanovich, you have a reputation with the country's leadership -- and with the president particularly -- for being an expert on the region. What steps do you recommend? Are you recommending that our policy in the region should be radically altered? [Churkin] No. I set out from the position that we would continue to follow the policy of Russia as a great power. [Svanidze] All the same, we have been openly supporting the Serbs. What is going to happen now? [Churkin] I do not agree with that view. Russia was a communications channel for the Serbian side. When the Serbs were saying that the world community did not understand them, and relations between the Serbs and the world community really were complicated, Russia tried to use its unique communications channel, operating in conjunction with other members of the world community. At the same time, since we were taking an objective, balanced approach, we did not only maintain contact with them. Nearly every time I was in Sarajevo I met the Muslim and Croatian leaderships, as well as the Bosnian leadership. We will continue to take the view that if the Serbs find the strength to turn to peace, then Russia will go on playing its part, but if they do not, if this drama goes on and a small group of people, God forbid, manages to drag the Serbian people into disaster, then Russia must not...[pauses] The tail should not be wagging the dog. It is really quite simple. Then we have our own interests and our own positions, too. [Svanidze] If I have understood correctly, then, you are not recommending that we give up on peacemaking efforts in Yugoslavia. [Churkin] Of course not, of course not. I think that it is very important now for us to get out of the crisis in Gorazde. The situation there is like this: The Serbs have only to make one false move in Gorazde or anywhere else on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the thing I have been warning them against will break out. So my conscience is clear. But events may take a different course. I do, in spite of everything, hope that we will manage to settle the Gorazde problem, and then the political efforts will definitely be resumed. We are actively involved with other countries on this. [Svanidze] But if everything does, for all that, follow the scenario that you have outlined -- in other words -- if the Serbs do not change their position, and that leads to the result that you have spoken about -- a tough result -- what will Russia's reaction be? Or is that too hypothetical? [Churkin] The question really is too hypothetical because there are different degrees of toughness. [Svanidze] As a politician, you have scored a lot of points in recent months inside the country -- among the soft and the hard opposition, particularly. Even Zhirinovskiy has left you alone, apparently saying that this is because you are just about the only minister not to sell yourself to world Zionism. Well, now you have changed your position by making such an important statement. Are you not afraid that the credit you have gained will now be lost? [Churkin] Well, I do not take account of credit. I do not see myself as a politician. I have absolutely no political or other ambitions. One thing concerns me: My personal worthiness as a professional and as a person. On the whole, I have had to make decisions two or three times in Yugoslavian affairs that were very difficult. But I always hold that if I get into such a situation, I must make the decision that I believe is needed. Otherwise, why bother? Let someone else do it -- if I am not capable of making serious decisions. So that is the way I work. [passage omitted] [Svanidze] But tomorrow morning, President Yeltsin will find a modest, four-page printed note written by Vitaliy Churkin and approved by Andrey Kozyrev on his desk. It will lay out various possible developments of events in Bosnia and it will give certain political recommendations. The president will have to make a critical decision. [passage omitted]
