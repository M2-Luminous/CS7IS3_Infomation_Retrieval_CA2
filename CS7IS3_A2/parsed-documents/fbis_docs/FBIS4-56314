This was announced by Commerce and Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega. Although the EU has imposed certain restrictions on our country, on products such as bananas, seafood, and fish, Commerce and Industry Minister Ricardo Fabrega said multilateral commercial relations are at a very high level. A ruling is pending in the case of bananas. [Begin Fabrega recording] Within those commercial relations we have some differences of opinion, such as on the topic of bananas. We have established mechanisms of communication, however, and have announced our position. Certain countries of the EU support our stand, and this is being defined by a tribunal. We expect a ruling will favor our decision sometime around October. [end recording] In the case of seafood, Panama will make certain modifications so as to later resume commercial relations with European countries on this product. [Begin Fabrega recording] In the Athens meeting, we held some meetings with ranking EU officials. They explained what gave rise to the problem with seafood in terms of the rules of origin of the seafood. We were able to reach a very satisfactory agreement on such rules. We think that within a very short time our seafood products will enter the European market duty free. [end recording]
