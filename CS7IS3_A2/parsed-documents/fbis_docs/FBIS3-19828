Britain's and Spain's disagreement with the other Community partners over minority blocking rights continued after another day of tense negotiations. The compromise proposals did not work. The next attempt will be made at the weekend in Greece. [Brussels correspondent Julio Bernardez] The struggle of 10 versus two, or the minority blocking votes battle, is still a draw. Nobody has changed their minds. And all are thinking about a solution next weekend in Greece. However Spanish Minister Solana is not optimistic at all. The formal meeting lasted an hour and a half, the time needed for each to outline his position; a position that was already known anyhow. Seeing the result, President Pangalos ended the meeting amid general disappointment. [Begin Javier Solana recording] Spain, as you know, is in favor of enlargement. We are also in favor of finding a formula in the institutional area which will protect our interests, with an efficient mechanism that will work. That is what we have stood for and that is the position we will continue to defend. [end recording] [Bernardez] Delors was disappointed and he has promised that our country will see the fires of hell. France and Germany, however, played a conciliatory role because they know that the alternative is a serious crisis in the European Union.
