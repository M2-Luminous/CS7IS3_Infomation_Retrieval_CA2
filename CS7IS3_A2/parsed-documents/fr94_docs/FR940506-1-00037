FR940506-1-00037 FR940506-1-00012 The Council recommended requiring guarantees equal to the maximum estimated quarterly fee assessment for the upcoming calendar year to secure anticipated fee liabilities, in the form of prepayments, letter of credit, surety bond, or lien on property. NMFS believes that the requirement of such guarantees is premature and could be burdensome to the industry, particularly to smaller enterprises, and costly to administer. Small or marginally profitable enterprises could have difficulty in securing such guarantees. There are irrecoverable costs associated with guarantees such as letters of credit and surety bonds. Some guarantees may be of limited value in ensuring necessary cash flows and achieving the objectives of the Research Plan. Collection could also be difficult to accomplish in a timely and cost-effective manner. Instead, NMFS is proposing a simplified system to encourage timely fee assessment payments by processors that would consist of: (1) Bimonthly billing, (2) semi-annual processor permitting with a requirement that all Research Plan fee assessments must be current before a permit would be issued, (3) a prohibition against processing landings from Research Plan fisheries without a valid processing permit, and (4) a prohibition against delivery of catch from Research Plan fisheries to a processor not possessing a valid processing permit. This system also has the advantage of greatly simplified reporting and recordkeeping requirements for processors and reduced administrative costs for NMFS. The extent of nonpayment of fee assessments, which is inherent in any fee collection system, would be taken into account in determining the fee percentage rate for the following year. The proposed system is designed to minimize such nonpayment. First Year of the Research Plan During the first, or start-up, year of the Research Plan, NMFS would accumulate necessary start-up funds in the Fund. Fees would be assessed against all fishing vessels and U.S. fish processors participating in Research Plan fisheries under the authority of the Council. Processors would be responsible for collecting all fee assessments and for paying them bimonthly. The observer coverage requirements in the Federal Observer Plan and existing State Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands area king and Tanner crab regulations (5 AAC 39.645) would remain in effect during the start-up year. During the first year of the Research Plan (1995), all processors and vessels participating in Research Plan fisheries would pay the full fee assessment. Vessel operators and processors that currently are required to carry observers under the Federal Observer Plan and under State regulations would continue to do so during the first year of the Research Plan. NMFS would issue rebates to those who paid directly for required observer coverage during the first year of the Research Plan. The rebate per standard observer day would equal either the actual payment to an observer contractor per standard observer day or the standardized cost of a standard observer day, whichever is less. A standard observer day is defined as all or part of a 24-hour period that begins at 0001 hours Alaska local time (A.l.t.) and ends at 2400 A.l.t., during which an observer is stationed on a vessel or at a shoreside facility for purposes of complying with observer coverage requirements set forth in the proposed rule at ยง677.10(a). A standard observer day cannot be attributed to more than one vessel or shoreside facility. The standardized cost of a standard observer day would be based on the estimate(s) of the cost per observer day used to calculate both the total cost of the Research Plan and the fee percentage during 1995. Proposed standardized cost(s) will be published in the Federal Register for public review and comment as part of the annual Research Plan specification process set forth at ยง677.11 of the proposed rule. At this time, NMFS anticipates that standardized cost(s) could range between $170 and $265 per day, depending on whether 100 percent or 30 percent observer coverage is obtained. The rebates issued for vessel or processor observer coverage may exceed Research Plan fee payments. However, issuance of a rebate to a processor would be dependent on the processor being current with respect to submitting its fee payments. The rebates would be based on information provided to NMFS by observer contractors on an Observer Coverage Rebate Application (Form FPP&hyph;2). This information would include the number of standard observer days paid for by each vessel or processor and the amount paid for those observer days. The required information would be submitted by each observer contractor within 15 days after the end of each calendar month in which it received payments for providing observers. Initial rebates would not be issued before mid-year, to allow for the collection of sufficient funding for the rebate program. Subsequent rebates for 1995 observer coverage would be issued on a more regular basis, e.g. bimonthly. NMFS believes that a fund equal to approximately two-thirds of the estimated annual cost needed to operate the Research Plan is the minimum amount needed to begin full operation of the Research Plan and to ensure that cash flow is adequate to meet start-up costs. Assuming approval of regulations implementing the Research Plan, full implementation of the observer and fee portions of the Research Plan is anticipated to begin January 1, 1996.
