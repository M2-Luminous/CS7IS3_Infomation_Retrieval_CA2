The code will include forms of illicit conduct not previously classified as crimes or simply viewed as disciplinary problems. Experts from the two institutions say that consideration is being given to the inclusion in the code of such crimes as forced disappearances, torture, and other illicit acts falling into the category of sexual abuse. Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta has appointed two assistant prosecutors to work with the Ministry of Defense on the joint undertaking. They are Mauricio Fajardo, assistant prosecutor for the military forces, and Manuel Corredor, first assistant prosecutor for criminal matters. Sources within the Attorney General's Office said yesterday, for example, that forced disappearance is prohibited by the Constitution, but not classified as a crime in either the Penal Code or the Military Penal Code. For that reason, both prosecutors argue that it must be included in the new code, harshly penalized, and used as a deterrent to law enforcement officers who might commit such abuses. The same sources said that torture had to be classified as a crime because proven cases can only be penalized as personal injuries, when such is the case, or as abuses of authority. The objective is to ensure that these and other issues are studied by the joint commission of the Attorney General's Office and Ministry of Defense, whose prosecutors would be officers from the criminal jurisdiction and members of the general inspectorships of all the Armed Forces. Last week Arrieta sent a letter to General Ramon Emilio Gil, acting minister of defense, informing him that the Attorney General's Office expects a revision, not only of new crime classifications, but also of all matters relating to competencies and procedures in force under the existing Military Penal Code. In the opinion of the attorney general, the letter says, the success of the revision "will not only determine the credibility of military criminal justice. Rather, the military institutions themselves would in addition reap incalculable benefits, in terms of the morale of their members and the trust which civil society has in them, from having an effective administration of justice that deals swiftly and rigorously with the punishable conduct of those who do not deserve to be in their ranks." Scarcity of Attorneys Arrieta explained in his letter to Gil that his Office has a special interest in such a reform, based on a clear policy aimed at guaranteeing respect for human rights. The Office of Attorney General believes that with respect to procedure, for example, the Code should fill vacuums created by a recent ruling of the Constitutional Court eliminating the possibility of naming officers who are not attorneys to defend the accused. The Court ruling, which basically deemed [it] a violation of the right to an adequate defense, forced the military criminal jurisdiction to seek emergency solutions. The courts and the Military Criminal Tribunal, for example, were forced to call upon attorneys from the Public Defender's Office and the legal offices of universities. Even so, the backlog and lack of defense counsel rendered the plan practically inoperative. The Attorney General's Office believes that the military jurisdiction should begin by drawing up a complete record of performance.
