He told a press conference that an Aerospatiale technical team will arrive in Beijing within the next few days to study areas for space cooperation, particularly for satellites. Although China's Long March rocket launcher is a direct competitor to Ariane "we need to work with China and have technical exchanges," he added. Gallois said his group's presence in China did not reflect the company's position in Asia where it sold 35 percent of its exports. China had bought only 43 Airbus aircraft, manufactured by the European consortium in which the French group is a partner, compared with 90 McDonnell Douglas planes and 225 Boeings, its U.S. rivals. He said "we must increase our presence in China and the aim of this trip is to assure the Chinese authorities that we want to invest long-term in this country." Aerospatiale, active in both civilian and military spheres, has an annual turnover of around nine billion dollars, 70 percent from exports. It controls two thirds of Arianespace, has a 38 percent stake in Airbus and 50 percent in a Franco-Italian regional transport plane ATR. The group also manufactures helicopters and tactical and ballistic missiles. Gallois said the turbo-prop ATR-42 was particularly suited for regional operations and ideal for a country like China. He said 150 ATR models had been sold in the United States. A key part for the plane is already being manufactured under licence in Xian, northern China, he said. In cooperation with a factory in Harbin, northeast China, the group was also developing a light helicopter -- the EC 120. The factory has been manufacturing the Dauphin helicopter under licence for several years and has sold more than 100 models in China. Gallois said Aerospatiale was also ready to offer training to Chinese civilian pilots and "possibly" to military pilots.
