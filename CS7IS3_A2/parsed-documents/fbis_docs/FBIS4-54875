This was stated today by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic. Unfortunately the chetniks have not withdrawn. Second, it is (unacceptable) that the United Nations should make arrangements with the aggressor's representatives, and help them transport their tanks from one location to another so that they can go on killing civilians somewhere else. That is why we will demand today that Yasushi Akashi tenders his resignation, Haris Silajdzic added. The decision to demand Akashi's resignation was made today at the session of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency. This demand will be presented to the contact group, which is to arrive in Sarajevo this evening to revive the peace process.
