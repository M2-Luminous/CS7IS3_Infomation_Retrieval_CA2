A BAKHTAR military correspondent reports that as a result of this rocket attack by the militia, a number of our compatriots were also injured and were taken to hospitals for treatment. Similarly, as a result of rocket attacks and the firing of mortar shells into residential areas, which continued during today, much damage has been inflicted on public utility institutions, on residents, and public property. In response to the savage rocket attacks by the militia, the Islamic Afghan Army's artillery delivered crushing blows on the bases of the enenmy in Maranjan hill and Bala-Hesar. As a result a number of the militia were killed and a number of their positions were destroyed. The savage rocket attack by the Golboddin-Dostum militia has no justification but their defeat.
