Lebanese security forces said that the murdered person is Talib Suhayl, an Iraqi oppositionist in exile who had lived in Lebanon for several years. [passage omitted] In London, the "Free Iraqi Council" [FIC], an Iraqi opposition organization, has confirmed that Talib 'Ali Suhayl was a member of the council's Central Committee and leader of the Bani Tamim tribe. It added that he was found dead in his apartment in Beirut the day before yesterday. FIC sources say that early information indicates that Iraqi Government organs were behind the assassination operation. In a statement, a copy of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has received, the council said an armed group stormed Talib Suhayl's apartment and shot him. The council pointed out that the dead man had on several occasions told his family and FIC Chairman Sa'd Salih Jabr about telephone murder threats he had received in recent months from elements belonging to the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Husayn. The statement, signed by Sa'd Salih Jabr, said that Talib Suhayl was forced to leave Amman, his permanent residence, as a result of these threats. He moved between a number of capitals, the latest was Beirut. [passage omitted] Elsewhere, the support office of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued a statement yesterday in which it cited strong rumors about President Saddam Husayn's health. Dr. Hamid al-Bayyati, FIC representative in London, said that circles close to the authorities (in Baghdad) leaked information about Saddam's suffering from a serious illness as a result of which he is confined to bed, and that a team of doctors are supervising his treatment for hysterical nervous fits following which he goes into a coma for many hours.
