The author of the article is Benjamin Weiser, who has written controversial material based on interviews with Ryszard Kuklinski [Polish Army colonel who defected to the United States]. We decided to obtain information straight from the sources. This is what generals, without whose knowledge such a deal would not have been possible, told us. General Florian Siwicki, former minister of national defense: "The Ministry of National Defense did not indulge in weapons deals. This kind of activity was the domain of the Central Engineering Administration, which was governed by the Ministry of Industry. The Ministry of National Defense okayed any contracts prepared by the Central Engineering Administration. I do not remember our selling weapons to the Americans. I probably would not forget such a thing. "I rule out the existence of any deals involving the sale of arms to the United States. Such deals could not possibly have been legally implemented without my knowledge. I know of no cases involving weapons sales to the United States at all. We sold weapons to Syria, Libya, Iraq, Hungary, Bulgaria, and India. At that time, it was implausible to supply NATO member countries. Perhaps there was some kind of smuggling going on. But without concrete details, we cannot express any stance. It is mainly our own Polish-produced weapons that we sold." General Zbigniew Nowicki, former Polish Army chief technical inspector: "When I heard this news, I wondered why we should have sold these missile systems to the Americans if the Americans themselves obtained them straight from Israel following the helicopter sortie into Iraq. "Yes, we did sell Soviet weapons, but these were old tanks, helicopters, and airplanes, and only single units. This took place via the Central Engineering Administration. "It was impossible to sell modern weaponry from one camp to another. We in the Ministry of National Defense might not have known about every single deal. We would certainly have known about the big ones, but I cannot rule out the possibility of some petty smuggling. But it cannot have involved tanks, missiles, or radar equipment. "Perhaps one or two pieces of equipment might have been sold on a trial basis without my knowledge to countries to which we later sent larger quantities of weapons following a government decision. After all, just like today, there were lists of countries to which exports of our defense systems were prohibited. As our main enemy, the United States was on this embargo. "Such a deal could not have escaped the attention of Soviet intelligence, and no government would have risked cutting itself off from new licenses and new USSR weapon systems." General Czeslaw Kiszczak, former minister of internal affairs: "This is the first time I have heard of sales of Soviet weapons to the United States, and I exclude the possibility of such a deal having ever taken place. Of course, anything is possible in this world, but I do not think I could have been ignorant of such an issue. I was too close to General Jaruzelski, General Siwicki, and many generals on the General Staff. It would have been simply impossible for me not to know about it. "Another story is possible, however. We sold many weapons and systems to various countries, and one cannot rule out the possibility that the Americans grabbed part of a consignment somewhere along the way. But I rule out the allegation that we sold the Americans several hundred or several thousand antiaircraft missiles that ended up in Afghanistan."
