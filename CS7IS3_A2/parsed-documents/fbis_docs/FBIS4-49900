The prime minister said the countries would tend to benefit in the long term of their ability to share the wealth through trade and economic interaction with China. He told an international business gathering of the world's top corporate leaders here that the Chinese had now found an answer to their political and economic needs in what they termed the socialist market economy. Dr. Mahathir, who flew here after a successful meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Washington, dwelt at length on Malaysia's early experience in managing its economy and the obstacles it faced, democracy, and China's current economic modernization efforts in his address on the theme "The Socialist Market Economy of the People's Republic of China: An ASEAN Perspective" at the 1994 China summit meeting. He said although he was no expert on China, he had followed with a great deal of interest over the last 68 years of his life as an individual the great events occurring in and around China. He said: I have read substantially about China's last 2,000 years. But I'm by no stretch of the imagination an expert on China. I cannot imagine that I know more about Chinese policy than the Chinese leadership and its wealth of advisors. Nevertheless, he intuitively understood what China was attempting to do, why it was doing it, and how it was going about the entire process of revolutionising its society and building towards a place of pride and comprehensive prosperity for its people in the 21st century. He believed his views were shared by other leaders in ASEAN and East Asia. This was because almost all countries in East Asia were trying to do the same thing in the best way they knew how given the complexities of their own specific situations, the enormous obstacles, and the incredible opportunities before them. Dr. Mahathir said China was right in sticking to its brand of socialist politics while espousing a version of the market economy. This was so because it had managed to avoid the kind of economic and political anarchy the Soviet Union suffered. It is right because it is apparently more successful economically. It is growing and growing very fast, he added. He cautioned the Western powers against being too fearful of a prosperous China. He said although a rich China would spend much more than what it is now spending on its military forces and, thus, [words indistinct], historically, Beijing had not exhibited any consistent policy of territorial acquisitiveness. He added: Its neighbours may have lost some disputed territory, but full invasion and colonisation has not been a feature of Chinese history. This differs very much, of course, from the European record. He said the question of Chinese aggression occupied much of the Western mind because, historically, hegemony and violent or peaceful occupation of territories had always been the West's approach to self-preservation and wealth. As a result, they naturally suspected China of having similar ambitions.
