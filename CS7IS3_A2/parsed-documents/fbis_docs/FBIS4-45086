FBIS4-45086 "jpnea034___94035" JPRS-NEA-94-034 JPRS Near East & South Asia 18 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Tamil Nadu: Political Factions Said Mushrooming Tamil Nadu: Political Factions Said Mushrooming 94AS0311C Madras INDIAN EXPRESS in English 18 May 94 p 5 94AS0311C Madras INDIAN EXPRESS English CSO [Article: "A Variety of Splits"; quotation marks as published] [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Tiruchi--The past one year seems to be a year of splits for some major and minor political parties in Tamil Nadu and the latest one has occurred in the Pattali Makkal Katchi [PMK]. Panrutti S. Ramachandran, who was the solitary MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) elected on the PMK ticket to the assembly in 1991, has been expelled from the party and he launched a new party on Sunday called `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam.' (The `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam' is the second political party in the state to have the portrait of a person in the double colour flag and this party has chosen to have the portrait of saint Thiruvalluvar in the flag. The first political party, perhaps in the whole country, to have the portrait of a person in the flag, was AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam), which had chosen to have the portrait of Anna in the flag from 1972, when it split from the DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam). There is a wind of change sweeping the political scene in the state since October 3 last year. A storm broke out in the DMK in Oct 1993 in the wake of the party supremo Karunanidhi's allegation based on unconfirmed IB reports that the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] was plotting against him to promote the interests of V. Gopalsamy, MP (Member of Parliament). This triggered off a big controversy culminating in the split in the party and leading to the formation of a separate political party `Marumalarchi DMK' last week in Madras. This is the second major split suffered by the DMK since 1972 when MGR quit and formed his own party. The Marumalarchi DMK is making its electoral debut in Mylapore and Perundurai constituencies. The Pattali Makkal Katchi founded by S. Ramdas, a medical practitioner, was split into two with the expulsion of Panrutti Ramachandran. Panrutti and Nellikkuppam Krishnamurthy, a former MLA, have formed the new party `Makkal Nala Urimai Kazhagam.' As a result of the split in the Indian Union Muslim League, the Tamil Nadu unit is also split. The TN unit is now led by AKA Abdul Samad and the splinter group `Indian National League' by M.A. Latheef. Both AKA Abdul Samad and MA Latheef have become the all-Indian general secretaries of their respective parties. There is a mushroom growth of regional parties in the state and it is difficult to keep count of them. One could have an idea of the number of regional parties only when the Doordarshan and AIR (All India Radio) broadcast the messages of political leaders on the eve of important festivals like Pongal, Tamil New Year's Day. A seasoned political leader with three decades' existence in public life humorously remarked that he came to know of the number of political parties in Tamil Nadu only during the Tamil New Year's Day and Pongal when TV and AIR in its news bulletins would broadcast the festival messages of leaders of various political parties. The Congress in Tamil Nadu is having three factions, one headed by Vazhappadi Ramamurthy, TNCC (Tamil Nadu (Indira) Congress Committee) (I) chief, G.K. Moopanar, a senior party leader and K.V. Thangabalu, Union Minister of State for Welfare.
