Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-12JAN94-PLO-U.S. Mainstream Radio Blasts U.S. Role in Peace Talks Reflecting both the PLO's frustration over protracted negotiations with Israel on implementation of the Gaza-Jericho plan and its renewed fears that U.S. policy will ultimately favor Israeli interests, Voice of Palestine (VOP) in Yemen recently carried the harshest mainstream PLO radio attack on U.S. handling of Middle East peace negotiations observed since the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles (DOP) on 13 September. In a commentary on 10 January, VOP charged that Washington is "shirking its responsibilities" toward implementation of the DOP. US policy, VOP said, "reflects the abandonment of responsibilities toward the peace process," and has even "at times impeded rather than aided the peace process." Reviving longstanding PLO charges of U.S. favoritism toward Israel, VOP charged that "allegedly objective U.S. impartiality reflects a favorable response to Israeli wishes." In particular, referring to U.S. peace talks coordinators as "the five rabbis," the commentary claimed that they sought "more for Israel than it wanted for itself." In addition, the commentary implicitly blamed the United States for recent strains in the PLO's relations with other Arab participants in the peace process, charging that Washington has "sought to preclude any coordination among the Arab negotiators." The commentary's appeals for the United States to continue an active role in the peace process suggest that the PLO, despite the evident disappointment with U.S. diplomacy that contributed to its decision to conclude a secret accord with Israel in Oslo, still harbors doubts about its own ability to negotiate successfully with Israel and will, therefore, continue to look outward--primarily to Washington--to bring about a favorable conclusion. The commentary thus warned against what it portrayed as a U.S. misinterpretation of the significance of the DOP. Perhaps, it suggested, Washington had concluded that the accord had resolved Israeli-Palestinian differences "without their [U.S.] intervention and without their having to provide any guarantees." But the U.S. role, asserted VOP, "cannot end" with the Oslo agreement. Implicitly urging the United States to press Israel for concessions, the commentary argued that "It is mistaken . . . to address a major conflict involving peoples' rights and the sufferings of successive Arab generations" on the basis of a belief that "the strong must emerge as the winner because they had the skills required to seize the others' territory and rights."
