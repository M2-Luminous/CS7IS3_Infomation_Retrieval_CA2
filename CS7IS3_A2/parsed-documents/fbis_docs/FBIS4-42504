He is endorsing a power change in Germany and recommends Rudolf Scharping as an unspent force. But the support given by the elder statesman has caused no real joy among the Social Democrats. With his 19 recommendations for the future Federal Government, Helmut Schmidt at the same time provided the Union parties [CDU (Christian Democratic Union)/CSU (Christian Social Union)] with ammunition for its campaign guns. Helmut Schmidt, who is disturbed by the dangerous desire to get fed up with political parties in Germany, reminds us that "all of us together must curb our disappointments and our bitterness." But he has difficulties suppressing his own bitterness. It is directed above all at Helmut Kohl. To be sure, Schmidt does not deny the contributions that his successor as chancellor made toward German unity, but he does give him bad marks for catastrophic mistakes made during the unification process, and he warns in vivid terms against an extension of Helmut Kohl's tenure as chancellor. Key Personnel Are the Most Important In getting even with Kohl and the "exhausted CDU/CSU," Schmidt's political passion flares up, but his support for Scharping remains typically cool. "What we need today at the head of our government is an unspent force. We have it in Rudolf Scharping. This is a man who learned to govern as chief of state of the Rhineland-Palatinate, and who demonstrated there what he is capable of. He is surrounded by capable women and men. They will approach the task together with fresh energy." In a year of decision, many Social Democrats would have wished the praise for the candidate to have been somewhat stronger. This all the more since Helmut Schmidt realizes that programs are for the most part not worth very much later on in the reality of government. What is more important are the actual economic and social conditions for which the politicians have to take responsibility and with which they would see themselves confronted if they take over the government. Most important, however, are the key personnel, especially in the German television industry. Helmut Schmidt's opinion of the second man in the Social Democratic campaign team is cool and objective: "Oskar Lafontaine did not study economics; instead, he is basically a natural scientist; his powers of comprehension, eloquence, and ability to assert himself, are similar to those of Franz Josef Strauss, who likewise had not studied economics but was nevertheless also a good finance minister. One could conceive of Lafontaine's filling this same office in similar fashion." There is a reason for the acceptance of Oskar Lafontaine as a possible finance minister: Lafontaine is the highest political figure in the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] who, for the most, part shares Helmut Schmidt's economic views and is trying to implement these within the party. And yet there will never again be a normal relationship between Lafontaine and Schmidt. Helmut Schmidt did not support SPD chancellor candidate Lafontaine during the campaign in 1990. Instead, in an unauthorized, but at the same time not denied, interview with the Rotterdam newspaper ALGEMEEN DAGBLAD, he even went so far as to say that Lafontaine would lose the Bundestag election and also deserved to lose. He did not forgive Lafontaine his publicized reflections, with Schmidt in mind, about secondary virtues, virtues with which one could also run a concentration camp. The unspent political forces that Helmut Schmidt praises have a difficult time with his 19 recommendations for a future Federal Government. On balance, the recommendations, most of which might have been taken from the report of experts or from the expertise of the economics institutes, are anything but a convincing appeal for change. Helmut Schmidt cautions strongly against further tax burdens, e.g. an increase of indirect taxes such as the value-added tax or the tax on petroleum products, or of the income tax "for higher income groups." Schmidt: "Anyone who aims his sights only at high incomes and assets must ask himself if he wants to trigger still more shifts [of assets] to Monaco, Luxemburg, and other tax refuge countries." For Less Welfare Services He warns: "An ecologically oriented change of our taxation system must take place in stages. It cannot be a positive factor in overcoming the serious acute affliction of our economy." And he also points to the contradiction: If an ecological tax does its job and does, in fact, bring about an environmentally friendly conduct on the part of manufacturers and consumers, it will generate no additional revenues. But if the ecological tax does not result in any additional tax revenues, it will not be possible to lower any other taxes. He calls on the state not only to take more drastic action against [unreported] moonlighting, but also to insure that there is an adequate difference between social welfare services, on the one hand, and the regular lower incomes, on the other--and by no means to do this through raising the lower income groups. He supports a more rigorous interpretation of the reasonableness of a job [offer] and gives his opinion on the second labor market as follows: "For the long haul, the employment societies created by the state in Germany's eastern part and the whole so-called second labor market are not a suitable instrument." In addition, his appeal for a greater spread in earnings will no doubt be opposed by the labor unions and by many Social Democrats: "Especially in commerce, in the crafts, and in services and office jobs of all types, in the large sector in which more than two-thirds of all gainfully employed persons work, in other words, many jobs have been lost as a result of excessively elevating the lower earnings groups. Also the simpler jobs will be needed again in the future." In the closing chapter of his book, Helmut Schmidt, a proponent of a majority-vote system patterned on the British example, discusses the party-political structure of a "fresh government." Helmut Schmidt does not endorse another grand coalition of SPD and the Union--although he credits the grand coalition which governed from 1966 to 1969 with a remarkably good practical performance during the first two years of its existence. Such a grand coalition could come to pass, however, if the voting is highly fragmented. Whoever wants to avoid a grand coalition, thus his election credo, must vote for one of the two populist parties, the SPD or CDU/CSU. His personal wish is for a majority formed by one populist party together with one smaller coalition partner. Aloof Vis-a-vis the FDP Vis-a-vis the FDP [Free Democratic Party], which he wanted to "rake away" in the 1982 election in Hessen, he maintains a position of detachment. He does, however, unlike the Greens, credit it sight unseen with a capability to govern at the federal level. However, contrary to his estimate, the FDP has already firmly committed itself to a coalition with the CDU/CSU. Unless it breaks its word, it can therefore no longer be viewed as a partner for Scharping. Taking the Schmidt formula (one populist party and only one coalition partner) as the basis, this would leave the Greens as a partner. Helmut Schmidt has no serious misgivings about realo-Greens such as Joschka Fischer, but he adds: "The critical factor is whether the Greens will be able to struggle through to a realistic overall political concept, including domestic and foreign policy, and above all including the economic questions." Helmut Schmidt's coalition recommendations leave a feeling of perplexity within a party leadership which has thus far turned a deaf ear to the passionate courtship of the Greens. Thus far, Rudolf Scharping has not discovered a realistic overall political concept among the Greens. Helmut Schmidt may have meant well with his campaign help, but whether it will do the SPD any good will be decided by the voters on 16 October.
