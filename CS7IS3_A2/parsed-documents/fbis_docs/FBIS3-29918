The demonstrators watched two actors perform a parody of the U.S.-South Korean "alliance," wearing cartoon masks of Uncle Sam and the traitor Kim Yong-sam. They attacked the "alliance" as an obstacle to Korean reunification, sang "Yankee Go Home" and chanted "Don't import weapons" and "No to Team Spirit."
