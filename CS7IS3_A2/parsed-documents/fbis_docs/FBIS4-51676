On Sunday, KYODO NEWS SERVICE's telephone poll of 1,000 voters showed that 51.6 percent supported the Hata cabinet. In Monday night's "News Station" program, TV Asahi said 31.9 percent disapproved of the Hata cabinet, launched last Thursday. Just before Hata was elected prime minister last Monday, the TV station conducted a similar survey which showed a 66.8 percent approval rating for Hata's incoming cabinet. During the one-week period, the support rating fell 16.7 percentage points, TV Asahi said. Following Hata's election in the Diet as Japan's 51st prime minister, the biggest coalition group, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), quit the alliance in protest against the swift formation of a large parliamentary group that excluded the SDP. The TV Asahi poll also showed that 54 percent expressed support for the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition while 27 percent disapproved of it. Asked who is at the center of the new coalition, 52 percent named key coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], while 21 percent nominated Hata who is Shinseito head and 4 percent picked former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP). The poll also showed that 54 percent of pollees wanted the SDP to follow its own path, and 32 percent called for its cooperation with the Hata cabinet. Only 10 percent proposed the SDP cooperate with the largest opposition party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Asked how long the Hata cabinet will survive, 44 percent replied around half a year, followed by 23 percent who predicted three months and 18 percent one year or longer. The poll showed 9 percent replied two months, and 2 percent one month. It said 60 percent called for an early general election for the House of Representatives after the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget, compared with 27 percent who did not.
