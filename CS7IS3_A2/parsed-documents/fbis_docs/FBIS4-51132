Such practice is aimed at helping CAAC improve its service. The service improvement campaign which began last year aroused so much concern from various sectors, according to the spokesman Mr Bao Peide [sentence as received]. As the handling capacity of CAAC boosted to some extent, problems including difficulties in buying air tickets as well as serious shortage of service facilities and equipment had been settled to a certain degree. Awareness of market competition and of better service held by various branches of CAAC were strengthened. Frigid manner in offering service, poor access to information on flight, poor service seen in irregular flight schedule, delayed handling of luggage and goods as well as problems concerning damage to and loss of items and fraudulent claims, however, still existed which aroused strong dissatisfaction. Mr Bao added that CAAC was determined to adopt measures to further solve all these problems in a bid to reverse the poor reputation for civil aviation service. It is announced that the measures include inspection on 17 air companies for their civil aviation service and 17 airports which see a heavy flow of passengers. Quality standard and regulations of civil aviation service will be closely examined. Inspectors will be specially hired to achieve this end. The rating of all these civil aviation establishments will be made for rewards and punishments. Distribution of 100,000 assessment cards will be available in order to collect opinion on air service. A lucky draw is possible for the return of the cards. The deputy director of CAAC Mr Shen Yuankang said that the measures were aimed at encouraging civil aviation entities to make passengers and the market their criteria for better service. The spokesman and deputy director Mr Bao Peide said that quality of service offered by CAAC would improve year by year in a bid to enable the aviation establishment in a period of time between three and five years to reach medium- and even high-level in the international community in terms of service offered.
