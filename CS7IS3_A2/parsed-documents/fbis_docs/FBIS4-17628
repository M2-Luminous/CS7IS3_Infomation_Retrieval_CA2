This visit will further deepen equal and mutually advantageous cooperation between the two countries. Our program recorded an interview by our correspondent with Jean-Paul Vezian, extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of France to Uzbekistan. [Vezian, in French fading to Russian report] The official visit of French President Francois Mitterrand to your country, says Jean-Paul Vezian, is considered in France to be very important because this is the first visit by a head of state of one of the EU countries. Today, we know Uzbekistan as a country with an ancient culture and at the same time a young and quickly developing country that values the preservation of peace and provisions for collective and calm work of all the peoples residing in Uzbekistan. We are expecting a lot of development in the social and political spheres, the creation of a democratic and open society, and the implementation of reforms allowing for the overcoming of the crisis situation in the economy inherited from the former USSR. Answering a question on specific examples of French-Uzbek cooperation, Vezian pointed to cooperation in reviving the field of aviation in the country. Uzbekistan is one of the first countries in the region that has introduced airbuses constructed by Europeans for its aviation routes. These are being prepared in France and in Germany. There is a very interesting project for the joint reconstruction of Tashkent airport, which in its current condition cannot meet the increasing demands of Tashkent as a major center in Central Asia. The firm Thompson for example, is carrying out the introduction of radar equipment at Tashkent airport. We are hoping to participate in the development of all spheres of industry, noted Vezian, which will allow Uzbekistan to achieve real economic independence. This is foremost in the fields of oil and cotton processing, and also the food industry. We already have interesting projects for irrigation, construction of textile and oil processing enterprises, the use of cotton for the production of paper, and also public services in various cities of the country. We hope for the successful use here of French firms' experience in the production of food products. In short, we are prepared to support all efforts for the speedy industrialization of the most important areas in the economy. I think that initial successes will be strengthened by the introduction of the national currency, which will strengthen the mechanism for guaranteeing foreign investments. In the final instance it will be these factors that will create favorable conditions for the successful economic development of the country.
