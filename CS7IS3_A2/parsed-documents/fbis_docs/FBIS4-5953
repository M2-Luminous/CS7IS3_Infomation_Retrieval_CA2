After the north was liberated, we continued to use explosives to mine coal and metal ore, quarry rock, and build roads and bridges and hydroelectric projects. Each year, we consume about 10-20,000 tons of industrial explosives. In the past, these were imported mainly from the (former) Soviet Union and China. During the past 5 years, in accord with the policy of coordinating national defense with the economy, military organizations have stepped up research and produced approximately 4-5,000 tons of industrial explosives a year, satisfying some of our needs for such materials. Making full use of the surplus capabilities in national defense production, in the coming years, the volume of production may reach 10,000 tons a year. Many groups of scientific and technical cadres from the Technical General Department, the National Defense Industry and Economics General Department, the Military Technical Institute, and the Explosives Technical Center at the Military Technical Institute who have gone abroad to do research and familiarize themselves with the manufacturing of military explosives have had a chance to view the production of industrial explosives. In many countries, the production of industrial explosives is coordinated closely with the production of military explosives, with those production installations directly subordinate to the military or to industrial ministries. The production of explosives (both military and non-military) involves special techniques, many years of experience, and, in particular, ranks of skilled technical cadres and workers and means of preventing explosions. During the past 5 years, on behalf of the state, the State Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment) has guided research in manufacturing industrial explosives. This has included many state-level topics, an example of which is the KC-03 program. The results of the research are very encouraging, and they have soon been used in production. Almost all of the state-level topics have been allotted to installations in the military, and the topics have been inspected by more than 10 state-level scientific and technical councils with the participation of the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, the Labor Safety Inspection Committee (Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Affairs), the Fire Protection Department (Ministry of Interior), explosives experts from the Science and Technology Department and the Coalimex Corporation (Ministry of Energy), the Mining and Geology College, the Military Technical Institute, the Military Explosives Center [MEC], and the National Defense Industry and Economics General Department. The topics and products inspected include black explosives and slow-burning fuses (Z121), Ammonite AD1 (Z113, Z121), fire conducting line (Z121), lighted and electrical fuse boxes (Z121), TX1 and TZ1A explosives (Z131), TMN 15 explosives (Z115), VEOT explosives (MEC), Zerno 21/79 (Z121), TNT (Z131, Z113, Z115), Watergel TNP1 (MEC), and Watergel TFD 15 (Z115). It is predicted that Watergel TNP2 and gelatin explosives (MEC) will be examined this year. Since 1991, the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment has given the task of building and improving industrial explosives laboratories to the Military Explosives Center and allotted funds to it for this. Today, explosives that are produced domestically or imported from abroad are all inspected at this center, with the exception of safety tests for methane gas and coal dust, which are conducted in the explosion chamber at the Mine Chemicals Enterprise (Coalimex). Military installations have been given permission to manufacture many types of fireworks, sky-rockets, mortars, small firecrackers, ocean rescue flares, sports ammunition, and bullets for hunting rifles to serve the needs of the people and major festivals. As for the national defense industry, the Z131 and Z113 plants plan to import the technology needed to manufacture advanced industrial explosives. This will be imported from several countries. Gelatin explosives first began to be manufactured during the late 1970s in France, Sweden, England, and the United States and have been in common use in the world for the past decade. Sweden calls this Emulite, and China calls this gelatin explosives. Countries refer to this as oil gelatin, because it is composed of two basic compounds: a very thin continuous oil compound around a non-continuous compound consisting of very small drops of an oxygenated saline solution one-tenth of a micron in size having a strong bee-hive structure because of mixing the gelatin agents. Besides this, people have said that as compared with such highly explosive materials as gas bubbles, plastics, and small crystals one-tenth micron in size, gelatin explosives have many advantages. For example, they are very safe, they withstand water well, they are very effective in breaking up rock, they are easy to charge in the mines, they give off little poisonous gas, and so on. Using watergel and gelatin explosives is the path that we must follow in order to gradually replace the older types of explosives such as ammonite, TNT, zerno, and dynamite. Once we are able to produce these domestically, the cost of gelatin explosives will drop greatly (approximately $500 per ton). Today, imports cost about $700-1,100 per ton, depending on the type and the country selling the explosives. For several decades now, the state has had a policy of closely controlling explosives. In 1968, it promulgated Standard 83 KHKT-LDTBXH-NV, which made the science and technology sector -- formerly the State Science and Technology Commission -- and the labor and internal affairs sectors responsible for controlling all aspects based on the functions assigned. Today, the general stipulation in our country is that the production, storage, and circulation of industrial explosives, both within and outside the military, are to be monitored by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment, the State Labor Safety Inspection Committee, and the Fire Protection Department, and things must be done in accord with Explosive Materials Standard TCVN 4586-88 and Decision 237 QD promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission (now the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Environment) on 10 June 1988. In 1994, construction activities need more and more industrial explosives to mine coal, quarry rock, manufacture cement, build railroads and expressways, build hydroelectric projects, and satisfy other needs of daily life. In the face of this situation, we feel that the state should soon conduct studies and establish mechanisms and procedures concerning controlling the production of industrial explosives and, in particular, concerning the supply and distribution of industrial explosives. Steps must be taken to avoid irrational obstacles and having to go through so many unnecessary intermediary steps as at present. Some people think that controlling supply and distribution should be unified in one ministry (the Ministry of National Defense or the Ministry of Energy). Others think that the Ministry of Energy should supply and distribute explosives within the sphere of the coal sector and that the Ministry of National Defense should supply and distribute explosives in the other sectors. These plans are too bureaucratic and rigid. When engaged in buying industrial explosives from foreign corporations including ICI, SNPE, The Bac Phuong TQ Corporation, and the NFC TQ Corporation. We observed that they directly distribute and export the products that they produce without having to go through any intermediary corporation. Based on the specific situation concerning studying, manufacturing, distributing, and controlling industrial explosives in many countries and in Vietnam today, we propose that if the state authorizes a sector to produce or import a product, it should also allow that sector to directly supply and distribute that product. This will reduce unnecessary intermediaries, and reduce the cost of producing coal, cement, ore, and rock and encourage research and the production of many types of essential industrial explosives while still maintaining safety and security. This is because each sector that produces, supplies, and distributes industrial explosives will be monitored by state organizations. We believe that in the coming period, with respect to industrial explosives, new advances will be made in research, production, and use to support the building of our country.
