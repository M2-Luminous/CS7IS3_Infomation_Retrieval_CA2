Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL), the strongest opposition party, criticised the government's foreign policy, arguing that it was not a coincidence that German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Premier John Major and other European politicians have forgotten to include Slovakia among the candidates for NATO membership. He said the reason was the lack of political definition of the government coalition Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS), which have no political partners in Europe. He said the SDL was a suitable partner for left-oriented parties in other European countries, adding that the victory of the left in Poland has not brought difficulties on the international scene. Anton Hrnko, member of the SNS breakaway National Democratic Parliamentary Group, said foreign policy was a continuation of internal policies. It is thus difficult to make a successful foreign policy given the poor credibility of top-ranking Slovak officials, including Premier Vladimir Meciar, he said. Arpad Duka-Zolyomi, chairman of the deputies' club of Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement in Slovakia, speaking on behalf of Hungarian deputies, rejected the accusation of irredentism and of the efforts to question and complicate Slovakia's international position. He described the phrase that the ethnic minority rights in Slovakia are in harmony with international law as meaningless one. Ex-Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR) Milan Knazko voiced disappointment that Slovakia had not utilised the advantages stemming from the peaceful division of the Czechoslovak Federation.
