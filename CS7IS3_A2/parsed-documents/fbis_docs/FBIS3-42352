The official also appealed to authorities not to let down their guard facing the subversive enemy so as to prevent such terrorists from once again sowing unrest among the people. Espichan Tumay further noted that the respectable figure was achieved thanks to the excellent work of the Judicial Branch and military and reported that in 1993, 1,500 reformed terrorists had cooperated with the courts. While observing that the Peruvian people are convinced that positive progress has been made in the fight, he repeated his appeal to civilian, military, and police authorities not to rest on their laurels. "We must understand that terrorism will continue its onslaught because some leaders remain at large. Peace will be achieved only as the result of well-planned, transparent work and while paying respect to human rights," he said. [passage omitted on human rights]
