They briefed the brother president on the results of the conference, which expressed the concerns of the governorate's sons and their aspirations. The conference also stressed the sons' eagerness to preserve unity, democracy, and political pluralism, and called on the leadership to adhere to responsible and serious dialogue in order to end the political crisis that the country is passing through. This crisis has damaged the people's national interests, led by Yemeni unity, and inflicted various forms of economic, social, and psychological suffering on each Yemeni citizen. They also briefed the president on the aspirations and demands of the governorate's sons for accomplishing many service projects to raise the standard of living in the governorate's areas. The president addressed the representatives of the popular gathering, which included their eminence the ulema as well as businessmen, social figures, and representatives of political organizations and parties, shaykhs, and youths. He profoundly welcomed them, and highly praised the national sentiments shown by the governorate's sons who expressed their national eagerness to safeguard the Yemeni unity. He also blessed the results of the expanded gathering of the sons of the al-Hudaydah Governorate. The president reviewed the aspects of the suffering that the Yemeni citizens are passing through as a result of this crisis. He regretted the negative results of this crisis, which were reflected on the community's situation and citizens' life. He said: These results also cracked the community and created an atmosphere for the enemies of unity and democracy, so they may express their grudge against this national achievement that was realized on the glorious 22 May 1990. This achievement is a source of pride for us in the Yemeni homeland and an accomplishment for all Arab unionists and the masses of our Arab and Islamic nation. It also showed us on the international level as giants. However, the enemies of unity and democracy have pooled their resources and efforts to undermine our unity and fragment the one Yemeni family. The brother president added: We are pleased with meeting with the brother sons of the al-Hudaydah governorate, whether ulema, merchants, social figures, or representatives of political organizations and parties, whose initiative embodied their care for national accord. Together, and hand in hand, we will do our best to safeguard unity and democracy, our rescue ship in a violent storm. Salih said: Unity is based on firm pillars, and we must not abandon these pillars. We have tolerated a great deal for the sake of unity in order to rob those who want to exacerbate differences the opportunity of doing so. In order to lead our country away from internecine struggles, we made many concessions in order to preserve unity out of goodwill and out of our sense of national responsibility and so that our people will not face unnecessary difficulties. However, regrettably, some today are trying to foment troubles in society and harden the people's life by escalating this crisis, whose causes and origin are known to our people and which led to the deterioration of our economic conditions and reflected on the general situation in the country. He said: On 22 May 1990, we announced that all the files of the past were closed, and we decided to open a new page in the march of national construction so that all energies would be mobilized to building the new Yemen. However, some are still tied to the past and are thinking in the same old way. They have not gotten rid of this wrong view of things and have endeavored to foment struggles in society under many names, using sugar-coated words. Salih noted that some of the practices have harmed unity, such as instigating parochialism, sectarianism, and narrow affiliations. He said: We always ask our people to owe allegiance to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity and to unite in facing the sectarian hatreds that harm our national unity. He said: Enough tampering with the national economy, enough corruption, enough irresponsibility that leads to social anarchy like the situation of 9 and 10 December 1992. This is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate it. We will fight all kinds of economic, security, and all other kinds of sabotage. The security authorities have been given instructions not to tolerate or be lenient with any saboteurs who practice violence, sabotage, and anarchy, threatening safety and stability in our society. The brother chairman reviewed many developments in our society and noted that unity was realized on the basis of dialogue and equality, without a victor or vanquished and was not an annexation. We are all sons of the same people with equal rights and duties. Salih said: We believed in democracy and held elections, letting the ballot boxes be our arbiters. We must accept the results. It is in the nature of democracy and pluralism that some parties emerge victorious and others defeated. However, some do not accept democracy and work against it if it does not work in his interests. He said: We reject all forms of violence, are against political and mental terror, and oppose all kinds of sabotage. We support dialogue and respect free opinion and the opinion of others, and we will extend our hand to all those in favor of union in order to build new Yemen, a democratic, united, secure, and peaceful Yemen. The meeting was attended by a number of officials accompanying the bother chairman.
