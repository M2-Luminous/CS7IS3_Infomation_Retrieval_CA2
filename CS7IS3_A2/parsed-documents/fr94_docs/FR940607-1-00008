FR940607-1-00008 FR940607-1-00001 12. Section 3.23 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: ยง3.23 Motions. * * * * * (b) Reopening/Reconsideration. (1) The Immigration Judge may upon his or her own motion, or upon motion of the trail attorney or the alien, reopen or reconsider any case in which he or she has made a decision, unless jurisdiction in the case is vested in the Board of Immigration Appeals under part 3 of this chapter. Motions to reopen or reconsider a decision of the Immigration Judge must be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding. Such motions shall comply with applicable provisions of 8 CFR 208.4, 208.19, and 242.22. The Immigration Judge may set and extend time limits for replies to motions to reopen or reconsider. A motion shall be deemed unopposed unless timely response is made. A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion and shall be supported by pertinent authority. Any motion to reopen for the purpose of acting on an application for relief must be accompanied by the appropriate application for relief and all supporting documents. A motion to reopen will not be granted unless the Immigration Judge is satisfied that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the hearing; nor will any motion to reopen for the purpose of providing the alien an opportunity to apply for any form of discretionary relief be granted if the alien's rights to make such application were fully explained to him or her by the Immigration Judge and he or she was afforded an opportunity to do so at the hearing, unless circumstances have arisen thereafter on the basis of which the request is being made. Subject to the other requirements and restrictions of this section, a motion to reopen proceedings for consideration or further consideration of an application for relief under section 212(c) of the Act may be granted if the alien demonstrates that he or she was statutorily eligible for such relief prior to the entry of the administratively final order of deportation. (2) A motion to reconsider must be filed within 20 days after the date on which the decision for which reconsideration is being sought was rendered, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. A party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision and may not seek reconsideration of a decision denying a previous motion to reconsider. (3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4), a party may file only one motion to reopen proceedings and that motion must be filed not later than 20 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, or within 20 days of the effective date of the final rule, whichever is later. (4) The time and numerical limitations set forth in paragraph (b)(3) shall not apply to a motion to reopen filed pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5), or to a motion to reopen proceedings to apply or reapply for asylum or for withholding of deportation based on changed circumstances, which arise subsequent to the commencement of proceedings, in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, or to a motion to reopen agreed upon by all parties and jointly filed. (5) A motion to reopen deportation proceedings to rescind an order of deportation entered in absentia must be filed: (i) Within 180 days after the date of the order of deportation. The motion must demonstrate that the failure to appear was because of exceptional circumstances beyond the control of the alien (such as serious illness of the alien or death of an immediate relative of the alien, but not including less compelling circumstances); or (ii) At any time if the alien demonstrates that the alien did not receive notice in accordance with subsection 242B(a)(2) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1252b(a)(2), and notice was required pursuant to such subsection; or the alien demonstrates that the alien was in Federal or State custody and did not appear through no fault of the alien. (6) When requested in conjunction with a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider, the Immigration Judge may stay the execution of a final order of deportation or exclusion. The filing of a motion to reopen pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (b)(5) shall stay the deportation of the alien pending decision on the motion and the adjudication of any properly filed administrative appeal. 13. Section 3.38 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: ยง3.38 Appeals. * * * * * (b) The Notice of Appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding within 10 calendar days after the Immigration Judge has rendered an oral decision on the record or within 10 calendar days after a written decision has been served in person to the parties. Where the decision of the Immigration Judge is served by mail, the Notice of Appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals of Decision of Immigration Judge (Form EOIR&hyph;26) shall be filed with the Office of the Immigration Judge having administrative control over the record of proceeding within 13 calendar days after the date the decision is mailed. If the final date for filing falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, this appeal time shall be extended to the next business day. A notice of appeals may not be filed by any party who has waived appeal. * * * * *
