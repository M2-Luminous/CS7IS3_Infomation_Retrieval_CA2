The ministry's diplomatic bluebook for 1993 said Japan should make diplomatic efforts commensurate with its international position, adding that Japan's influence has grown not only in the economic arena but also in politics and in global concerns such as the environment and AIDS prevention. The government report, approved by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's cabinet today, said much remains unsettled in the international situation despite some hopeful developments such as peace in Cambodia and the Israeli-Palestinian autonomy accord. It noted that difficulties remain in regional conflicts, including those in former Yugoslavia and Somalia, tension over suspected nuclear weapons development on the Korean peninsula, the sluggish world economy, and confusion in the former Soviet Union. The paper cited the need to strengthen the function of the United Nations and the importance of cooperation among Japan, the United States and Europe which share the common values of democracy and market-oriented economies and whose combined gross national product (GNP) accounts for 70 percent of the world total. United Nations-led peacekeeping activities have become more important as regional conflicts increase; and the success in achieving a Cambodian peace demonstrates the effectiveness of such efforts, the report said. Japan also will continue efforts to improve its assistance to developing nations both in quantity and quality as a way of fulfilling its international responsibilities, the report concluded.
