For instance, Kravchuk criticized the statement of Russian Kremlin Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov who had suggested that development of the Crimean conflict was beneficial for the presidential structures in Kiev since they were interested in postponement of the presidential elections. Kravchuk wondered whether this was a personal point of view of Filatov or the official position of the Russian leadership. Commenting on the recent statement by Russian President Boris Yeltsin who had warned Kravchuk that no force must be used in Crimea, Kravchuk said that the president could warn his own structures but not the president of other state. Kravchuk said that such warning also contradicted "international standards." Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine was acting in accordance with the Ukrainian constitution.
