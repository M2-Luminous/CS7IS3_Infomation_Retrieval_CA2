Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said the government should wait for the proposal to mature and be presented before making any official announcement. He said, however, that the government will not shy away from any responsibility handed down by the Legislative Branch. He stressed that the country's problems are not exclusively economic or financial. [Begin recording] [Escovar] We would first have to see what exactly the scope of these powers will be. It would make more sense for these powers to allow the Executive Branch to deal with all aspects of the crisis, and to attack them with the swiftness and timeliness the nation demands. [end recording] Ramon Escovar Salom pointed out that the proposal came from the Congress and not from Executive Branch. Nevertheless, he said the government cannot refuse to study the idea.
