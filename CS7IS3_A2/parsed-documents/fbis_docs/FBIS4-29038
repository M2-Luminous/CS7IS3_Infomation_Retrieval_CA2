The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen a traveler can carry abroad at 5 million yen, regardless of their destination, but Finance Ministry officials said North Korea could be an exception. "It's possible (to lower the ceiling on yen to be carried by travelers to North Korea) with an interpretation of the law. It could only be (done) with a notice by the finance minister," said an official at the ministry's International Finance Bureau. "We are afraid of being told by the United States and others that the current ceiling hampers the effect of economic sanctions," the official said on condition of anonymity. But an official at the ministry's Customs and Tariff Bureau acknowledged that people going to North Korea via third countries, such as China, could thwart the special measure. Some ministry officials said the impact of lowering such a ceiling will be limited because customs officials estimate the amount of yen a traveler to North Korea carries at about 200,000 to 300,000 yen. Most travelers from Japan to North Korea are among some 250,000 North Koreans living in Japan, many of whom are Japan-born descendants of forced laborers brought over when the Korean peninsula was under Japanese rule between the early 1900s and 1945. The U.S. has asked Japan to stop the remittance of any money to North Korea. Although it is not known how much money is actually sent to North Korea from Japan, trade and banking sources estimate the sum at 60 billion yen a year, including trade bills. In a related development, Japanese commercial banks have stopped remitting U.S. dollars to North Korea, although they have not halted sending cash in other currencies. Bankers say the move is in line with a U.S. law that prohibits U.S. banks from remitting dollars to North Korea.
