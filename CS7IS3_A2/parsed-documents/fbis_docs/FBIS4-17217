The main topic of the talks was, of course, the problem of the settlement in the Near East. 'Arafat emphasized that in spite of all the cosponsors' attempts to breath life into the Near East process, the peace negotiations have failed. The Israeli side is constantly maneuvering and trying to drag out the period for withdrawing its troops from the occupied territories, which, in his opinion, gives extremists from both sides opportunities to undermine the peace process for once and for all. If they succeed in doing this, the PLO leader stated, then complete anarchy and the region's Balkanization are inevitable. On the subject of specific issues, it is necessary to point out that during the talks Boris Yeltsin gave instructions to prepare a Russian-Palestinian agreement on cultural cooperation. It is also not ruled out that the Russian side will assist in the formation and training of a police force in the future autonomous entity. But the problem is, as we know, not only relations between the Palestinians and the Israelis but also the PLO's struggle with such extremist organizations as Hamas. In reply to our question about how 'Arafat intends to find a common language with the radicals if they continue to ignore the peace initiatives, he said that democracy presupposes the existence of various points of view. The PLO leader added that points of view differing from his own with regard to various problems were "not a weakness but a strength."
