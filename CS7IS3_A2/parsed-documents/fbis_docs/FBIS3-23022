What is your assessment of the murder of Mehmet Nabi Inciler and Behcet Canturk, who were Kurds known as godfathers in Turkey? [Ocalan] We could easily state that starting with the murder of DEP [Democracy Party] parliamentarian Mehmet Sincar, these murders of those we could describe as patriotic Kurdish businessmen were done under the direct orders from the highest authority. Nabi Inciler, nicknamed "Inci Baba," and Behcet Canturk were disposed of because of the role they could have played in the Kurdish problem, as they had done in the past. These are intimidation murders aimed at silencing this [patriotic] segment and at encouraging the emergence of a collaborationist segment, such as volunteer village guards, some clan leaders drawn to Ankara, and many such agents. [Gul] The 27 March local elections are approaching. It is expected that the state will conduct large-scale detentions on the eve of the elections. What will be your stance on the elections? [Ocalan] The state is engaged in an "all or nothing" game. It is trying to hold the elections on the principle of the complete destruction of our movement. It is trying to completely disregard the legal foundations. It is trying to reverse a possible referendum situation in Kurdistan. It appears that the state will intensify its activities in this direction. [Gul] What is your assessment of the attack on Zhalah camp and the position of the southern forces [Iraqi Kurdish parties] on this attack? [Ocalan] The Zhalah operation was designed to use the federal government in the south against us or, failing this, to warn that government that Turkey could bomb it out. With the Zhalah operation, the Turkish state is also indicating its "political decisiveness" to resort to bombings if its policy toward the PKK fails. They are resorting to military, political, and diplomatic initiatives. They already did all that was possible in the diplomatic arena. All these initiatives are various aspects of their policy, and indications are that they will further escalate their violence by the spring. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is that we must look at the situation from a wider perspective, assign duties, and prepare our guerrilla force, war effort, introduction of new ideas, enhancement of efforts, and cognizance of defects and assessment of advantages accordingly. It is imperative that we make preparations quickly and move toward implementation. Time is vital for us, too. It is possible to pack the efforts of the past years into these few months. It is possible to achieve as much within the coming months as was achieved during the previous years. At such fast-moving historic times, it is easy to make maximum gains in a lifetime if a proper response is made.
