Khan, commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Navy, said that Pakistan is planning to build war ships in cooperation with China within one year. He said that new submarines are being bought to replace the old ones. The country with which this agreement will be made will also be required to transfer the related technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is endangered by serious foreign threats now. Keeping this in mind, we cannot be negligent about out national defense. The Pakistani Navy especially needs naval war ships and submarines, because India has increased its naval power extraordinarily, much more than it really needs. This clearly indicates that India wants to establish its monopoly in the Indian Ocean and to change it to a "Hindu lake." In addition, India has made so much progress in this area that it can block all trade and naval routes to Pakistan if there is a war. In this era, the importance of technology and modern war equipment has increased considerably. Needs and demands change every few years. But it is deplorable that we have not paid full attention to the Pakistani Navy's needs for a long time. As a result, most of the ships and submarines in Pakistan's Navy are old and useless . The war ships that were leased from the United States of America have been returned. The war ships loaned by Great Britain to replace those do not have all the same capabilities and features. Thus, it is a welcome development that the Pakistan Navy is not only trying to purchase modern war ships and submarines from another country, but also is preparing to build these here under the technology transfer arrangement. In addition, naval war ships will be built with the cooperation of China, which will help Pakistan become self-sufficient in its defense. This will also rid Pakistan of any blackmail efforts for procuring military equipment in the case of a war.
