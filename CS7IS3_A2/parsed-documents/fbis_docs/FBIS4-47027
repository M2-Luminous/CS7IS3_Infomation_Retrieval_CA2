In the range of political parties and movements that did not deprive themselves of the pleasure of expressing their attitude to the Russo-Korean summit, the communists, who did not renounce their principles, could also be heard. Representatives of the now numerous communist parties set up pickets on Tuesday at the building on Aleutskaya Street, 45a, where the consulate general of the Republic of Korea is located, at the very time when a meeting between the Korean delegation and leaders of the kray was beginning in the House of Negotiations on Sanatornaya Street. Grouping themselves under a red flag, the activists passed out their own "Statement" to the staff of the consulate general of the Republic of Korea and also eagerly distributed it to the representatives of the press. The document, which was signed by kray committees--KPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation], RKKP [not further identified], and the VKPB [All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks]--announces a "resolute protest against the slanderous campaign unleashed by certain circles of South Korea," and also expresses "full support of the policy of building socialism in the DPRK." Other documents turned over to VLADIVOSTOK correspondents indicate that the local communists are steadfastly following the course of communist construction in Russia as a whole. Thus, a "Joint Statement of the Political Parties and Organizations of Russia" (from the VKPB to the VLKSM [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League]) and a "Statement" of the Secretariat of the VKPB Central Committee were disseminated under the windows of the consulate general. These very curious texts have a very unambiguous political slant; for example, there are passages like this: "The All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks is proud of the fact that a candidate for membership in the VKPB Central Committee is Captain S.P. Subbotin who, while defending the Korean sky from vultures, executed the first ram attack in a jet aircraft, knocking down 11 American aircraft, of which two were "flying fortresses." Also appearing quite natural in this connection is the expression "full support and solidarity with the heroic Korean people who monolithically united around the Labor Party of Korea headed by the experienced leader Comrade Kim Il-Song..."
