Nearly two-thirds, or 62 percent, of NYD's voters were men. The party had 9 percent men and 5 percent women in its debut election in 1991. A large number of them were young LO [National Federation of Trade Unions] men in large cities. Since the election, 53 percent of these voters have left New Democracy, according to Skop's April poll. Of those who are left and of the new arrivals 2.7 percent are women and 6.5 percent men. Most are between 18 and 34 years old. Many unemployed support the NYD. From now on this party will be governed by three women. That is a Swedish record in female representation at the top of the party, and without sex quotas as well. New Expectations More women in leading positions is usually regarded as a guarantee of altered values in politics. In the case of New Democracy that thesis is being put to a difficult test before the election. New Democracy is the driving force behind several issues that are usually described as typically "hard" or male and where women are generally more cautious. There will be expectations for the NYD troika to outline a female profile on issues such as European Union [EU] membership, nuclear power, no speed limits on the roads, the Oresund bridge, and no to the six-hour workday, which have in fact become issues separating the sexes. NYD's female government could become an alternative in the election for working women who are able to identify with ambitious and intellectual Harriet Colliander, with Siv Bjorkman, an acknowledged skillful negotiator, and self-employed businesswoman Gunilla Anstrup-Persson. If New Democracy is to manage a new parliamentary contract, these three must gather an entirely new electorate among dissatisfied women a bit on the way into their careers, instead of the former Social Democrats and Conservatives who in a "personal election" voted Bert Karlsson and Ian Wachtmeister into the Riksdag. New Democracy can lure these women primarily from the Conservatives, the Liberal Party, and among those who have not been voting. The course shifts that could take place in day-to-day politics will depend more on how dominant Bert Karlsson becomes in the parliamentary group. Ian Wachtmeister intends to stay in the Riksdag all spring; he wants to keep his place on the Finance Committee and that will continue the internal duels within the group between the two factions behind the enemies Bert and Ian. Harriet Colliander is to hold her watchful hand over these two fighting cocks. New Leadership Her leadership will be completely different from her predecessor's. Wachtmeister ended up in conflict with both the parliamentary group and party organizations because he lacked patience with the political haggling. He tried to manage the party the way a company director manages his enterprises. To Wachtmeister marketing politics was the same as selling a new product. If the customers/voters do not want to buy what is offered, the activity must be closed down, according to Wachtmeister. Such a proposal was met with boos from the meeting in Vasteras. It also shows that Ian Wachtmeister does not have serious plans for starting a new party and joining the other political wild cards in this already splintered Riksdag.
