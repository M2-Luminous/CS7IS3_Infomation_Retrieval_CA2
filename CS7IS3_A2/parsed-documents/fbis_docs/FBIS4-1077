He needs to be. The deceptively boyish-looking Congress of South African Trade [COSATU] general secretary is in one of transitional South Africa's more powerful and finely balanced positions. The task at hand is no less than giving birth to a new COSATU for a new South Africa. Unfortunately for him, that's not all that's occupying his time at the moment, with barely a week to go before South Africa's founding democratic election. Shilowa -- who took over from Jay Naidoo when the veteran unionist accepted nomination to the National Assembly -- is tackling two great tasks simultaneously: planning for a strong COSATU under fundamentally altered political conditions, and campaigning at full filt for the ANC in his Northern Transvaal home base. It's not a straightforward role, as is evident from recent prickly exchanges with ANC members on the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]. First, the short-term task: Shilowa says COSATU has sent teams into all 14 of the ANC's regions to bring their organisational capacities to bear in the final electoral push. This started some five weeks ago, it involves senior COSATU people, and weak areas are receiving priority. As far as possible, COSATU leaders are working in the regions from which they hail -- Shilowa is stumping the Northern Transvaal and wowing audiences with his home-boy-made-good, rollicking style of delivery. How does this dovetail with the ANC? "We agreed that COSATU's not running the election campaign," Shilowa says, "but we've got something to offer. We're integrating our campaigning." He and other leaders have been formally deployed by ANC headquarters. The COSATU teams are checking the readiness of specific areas for next week's polling. Shilowa says it's simply a fact that during this key period of the transition, normal business is on hold for COSATU. "We're totally caught up in the process of transformation, and we're shedding leaders to the campaign and later to Parliament and the public sector. No normal organisational work is possible...The major task right now is to ensure an ANC victory." The COSATU campaign initiative is a final push to translate emotional support into actual crosses on ballot papers come next Wednesday. Shilowa says it's all very well if other parties are weak or non-existent in the region but "no shows" at the polls would be tantamount to votes for the opposition. "So we're doing all sorts of things, like addressing people on buses as they travel from Seshego. It's kind of travelling people's forum, where we answer questions. We're not going to just sit and hope that people go and vote themselves." The blitz will continue right up until the eve of the election, says Shilowa. But that's the election, and much of Shilowa's thinking is longer term. "It's not just a case of putting in an ANC government. Then we've got to make a difference to people's lives in his poor region." All of which raises the really big question: having been born in conditions of outright resistance to a hostile State, how is COSATU going to relate to a government which it not only supports, but has actively helped to shape? Aside from the challenge of developing new layers of leadership to replace those denuded by the defeat of apartheid (and the attendant danger that individual unions' interests will begin to outweigh the federation's), this is a profound question for COSATU. It has to fit itself in somewhere between an antagonistic relationship with a new government, and the sweetheart-union syndrome. Shilowa has presented to his organisation a document entitled "Towards developing a long-term strategy for COSATU", which focuses on four key points. -- What are the implications of operating under a sympathetic government? Shilowa points out that COSATU has been "skilled into opposition politics, based on demands rather than joint projects with the State. But the Reconstruction and Development Programme is a joint document which carries obligations and responsibilities for both government and us. We will not be there opposing it clause by clause, we'll be working towards its implementation." -- How will COSATU's membership be fully serviced in the new South Africa? Shilowa says that until now COSATU has attracted members on two grounds -- its ability to win bread-and-butter gains, and its political position. "The reality is that we'll soon have a legitimate, democratic government, openly elected. It has the legitimacy to take actions, although obviously in consultation with other stakeholders. So the second, political, role begins to fall away. We therefore have to concentrate on servicing the needs of our membership, and already since 1992 we have faced complaints about gaps developing between grassroots membership and the various levels of leadership. If we can't address that, we're doomed as an organisation." He adds that the new COSATU will be confined to one constituency, and "won't want to speak out on everything. We'll be alive to broader political issues, of course, but it will be a more classical trade union role." -- How independent will COSATU be? Shilowa says many people misunderstand trade union "independence": "It's not the same as non-alignment -- we are aligned, but concerned that programmes (to benefit our members) are implemented on their behalf. There's a perception that our leadership is more politically oriented than trade unionist, and that's unfair. Our political involvement has benefited the union movement. COSATU must not allow itself to become a conveyor belt or sweetheart. Now we have put candidates in the ANC -- we don't take the non-aligned view, but ask what they can do to implement the programmes." -- Will COSATU overstretch itself? Shilowa says the federation has become involved in "too many forums. That's been necessary, but it's not for ever because we don't have the capacity and the resources to sustain it. Our priorities are the National Economic Forum and the National Manpower Commission, and we think they could be combined. There'd be two chambers, one macro-economic and the other dealing with labour market issues. We'd be represented directly there, but not necessarily in all the other forums. COSATU needs to conserve and redirect its resources and energies in future." I put the proposition directly: it's not just a new South Africa we're going to have to develop, but a new COSATU too. Shilowa's in full agreement.
