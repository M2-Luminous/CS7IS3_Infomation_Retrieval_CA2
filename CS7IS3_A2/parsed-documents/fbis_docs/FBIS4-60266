Its importance lies not only in the fact that it is a deterrence which will bring about justice and prevent any deviation and corruption. Its real importance lies in the fact that it is an affirmation of the democratic system, the people's authority, and a real application of the jamahiri theory. It will also help the society to correct itself if and when it deviates. If the political power is a dictatorship, like most political systems in today's world, society's fight against deviation and its will to correct itself can only be expressed through violence, that is, a revolution against the political system. [passage omitted] And here lies the importance of the Cleanup Bill: Now the Libyan people can, when it feels that there is a deviation or even a corruption, meet at the basic people's congresses and issue the necessary legislation which will eliminate any deviation and correct any direction. We should meet democratically and calmly at our basic people's committees in a comfortable manner and issue the necessary laws and decisions which will correct any deviation, regardless of its seriousness. And that is what has actually taken place: The Libyan people felt that there have been deviations by individuals, which could be far reaching, and decided that such a matter warranted the intervention of the people's authority to carry out a correction. The Libyan people passed, through the people's congresses, the Cleanup Bill, which has given rise to the cleanup committees. As far as I am concerned I think that such a step was a historical and a very important one in the application of the theory. Without democracy and without the law we will be at the mercy of adventures; democracy will be jeopardized and all our gains will be threatened by undemocratic and illegal initiatives by some selfish individuals which will lead to further serious deviations. Therefore, to protect freedom and gains, the democratic project must be a legal one. It is only a democratic one if it is based on the people's authority. The law must be issued by a people's authority. And this is what actually has taken place. The Cleanup Bill is an opportune law. It is here because every citizen has felt the need to enact such a bill. It is for the first time that a bill has stipulated that public property is sacred, protected, and safe, and that no-one should harm it or exploit it illegally. This new legal doctrine did not exist before; only private property used to sacred. The latter was, however, a right concept which has been abused. [passage omitted] Public property, the property of the whole people, was not sacred until this moment... [pauses] ... until this bill is enacted. No one used to talk about public property. Public property used to be ownerless, a matter which opened the doors for theft and the appetite of thieves. Now the Libyan people can dot the i's and cross the t's by meeting at the people's congresses and enacting this law with its free will and stating that public property is sacred and protected. It must not be exploited and should only be used in accordance with the stipulations of the law. This used to be said about private property which used to belong to entrepreneurs, profit takers, usury takers, and greedy people. Once the Cleanup Bill is enacted, everyone should thereafter bear in mind that public property, which belongs to the whole people, is sacred. Anyone who harms it should have his hand amputated in accordance with the law because he is a thief. [passage omitted containing indistinct portion] If there is one thing that the Libyan people have done which confirms the authority of the people, preserves achievements, supports freedom, and bars the way to any conspiracies and deviations, it is the Cleanup Bill. This is a democratic achievement. Of course this law considers illegal gain to be theft and theft means cutting off the hand. Hands will indeed be cut off after this law is implemented. As they used to say, those who lived in the town before you, if someone weak committed theft, they would apply the hadd punishment [loss of hand] to him. But if a nobleman committed theft, they would let him go. No. Those whose hands will be cut off will be noblemen and those who are not noblemen. All people are alike whether noble or not. Establish your building on justice so that the building does not fall down on you. No-one should think that he is above the law which prescribes the amputation of the hand. Any citizen of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriyah will be affected by this law. [passage omitted] Of course this law is a very serious law. It reaffirms the true people's authority. It also reaffirms that corrections are being made in accordance with the laws in force. It is a very serious one, however, because it encompasses everything [words indistinct] and applies to everyone. [passage omitted] This law is double-edged: if you register the things you have stolen you will be brought to account, and if you do not register them you will be brought to account twice, a double theft: First, you stole and second you hid what you stole, and this is considered as second theft. [passage omitted] Had it not been for this bill there would have been a revolution against a revolution. However, thanks to this bill and to the Libyan people's free will there is a revolution inside a revolution. Because the matter is so serious, we are trying to give some respite to the Libyans, who did not expect this law to be enacted, did not think that anyone would make them accountable, and did not think that their hands would be cut off one day. [words indistinct]. I would like to say here that before we [word indistinct] and we start cutting off the hands of those thieves, who have been fiddling with public property, we should try to give them a warning. God says no one should be punished before a warning has been sent to him. We are giving them a good respite which is also a warning that hands will actually be cut off. This warning and good omen I am giving will last for the period of launching the cleanup committees and announcing its officials. This time we will alert people but after that the cleanup bill and the cleanup committees will be in force constantly. There will be no warning, what is permitted is clear and what is prohibited is clear. [passage omitted] Whoever takes the initiative and registers anything he has hidden will not be subjected to [words indistinct] by the cleanup committees. So if someone takes the initiative and immediately registers everything he possesses, he can be assured and should not fear anything. Some people might tell you, now that you have registered your possessions you will have to talk to Mu'ammar al- Qadhdhafi later. Do not worry, go on and register, say indeed I have three farms of which only one is registered and I want to register all of them. When you register the three of them and you are questioned afterwards by the cleanup committees and the people's court on the way and in which you had acquired the three farms, there will be two possibilities. Either you acquired them in a legitimate in which case they will remain yours, or if you acquired them in an illegal way, then the farms will be taken from you without your hand being amputated provided your are abiding by the [words indistinct]. [passage omitted] If they discover goods with you which you have not declared, then you will be considered as a thief and your hand will be cut off. You will lose the goods and your hand will be cut off as well. But if you go straightaway, declare your goods, say that you have hidden things, a hidden factory, farm or home, or hidden money or animals and you say: I want to register them now and ask me how I got them. In this case, even if you had acquired things in an illegitimate manner, your hand will not be cut off, and I am responsible for this. They will bring you to account, and perhaps they will recover the goods from you without hand cutting. This is if you take the initiative of declaring everything you own. This is number one, and let he who listens tell whoever is not listening. He who takes the initiative of paying the due excise duties and taxes which he was avoiding will not be asked questions and will be cleared of accusation. [passage omitted] All the Libyans who know [words indistinct] lazy, [word indistinct], making evasive tactics. As of today, he will considered as [word indistinct] of a revolution, so as to be able to escape from the accusation of theft and [words indistinct]. This is number two. Number three concerns applicants for a licence [to trade]. Anyone engaged in any activity without a license, and [word indistinct] the cleanup committees, is regarded as a thief because he engages in an activity which brings him an income, but he does not pay excise duty or tax, and anyone not paying excise duties and taxes is considered as a thief and the retribution is the severing of a hand. This includes those selling in the streets and [words indistinct], let alone other actitivities. Those called suitcase traders or middlemen need a license. What I am saying is this: Anyone engaged in an activity which he deems useful, including charlatans who claim to make amulets to cure people from being possessed by the devil, should have a licence for which he pays tax. [passage omitted] Anyone who is engaged in a trade at home or in the street without a license, anyone transporting goods likely to be bought or sold on a vehicle, any economic activity, small or big, without a licence will lead to those engaged in them being considered as thieves, in accordance with the law [words indistinct], and his hand will be cut off. To be saved from the severing of his hand he should from today obtain a license. [passage omitted] In the end, whoever takes the initiative and confesses to carrying out an activity forbidden by the cleanup law, do we forgive him or not? [passage omitted] If they confess before the cleanup committees reach them, we will pardon all the people who are currently selling dollars and dinars in the black market. [passage omitted] But if someone continues to deal in the black market, or in smuggling or things which we do not currently know about -- but he knows them -- but if we find them, it will be considered a case of theft and his hand will be amputated. [passage omitted] Someone might come and say: Before you arrest me and amputate my hand, you should know that I have been doing this job [words indistinct]. This will then be a [word indistinct] confession, he will be considered a wise, responsible man who repented; this repentance will [word indistinct] what preceded it and as a consequence this person will not be questioned by the cleanup committees. Apart from this case, this law is like a sword. [passage omitted] The secretary of the General People's Committee for Justice says it will be preferable to allow a deadline sufficient to give people the chance to repent, t6o give back their ill-gotten possessions and settle their situations. [Addressing officials at the meeting] So, issue an announcement and allow the deadline you consider to be reasonable and sufficient. Very good and all the best of success.
