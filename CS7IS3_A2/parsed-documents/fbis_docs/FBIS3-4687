FBIS3-4687 "dreas040__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-040-A Document Type:Daily Report 1 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Continued Watch on DPRK Nuclear Issue Noted OW2802050094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2802050094 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] At talks with the United States, North Korea agreed to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect its nuclear facilities starting on 1 March. The government spoke highly of this decision and said: "The decision prevented the current situation from intensifying and no economic sanctions will be taken against North Korea," (according to a Foreign Ministry source). However, to earn time, North Korea has been taking various measures such as delaying the issuance of visas to IAEA investigators, even after the 15 February agreement with the IAEA on accepting inspections. Because of this, the government intends to watch future developments on the nuclear issue carefully. The focal points at issue will be the shift to high-level U.S.- DPRK talks and DPRK-ROK negotiations to be held in the future. However, at the Diet session Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa stressed: 1) Special inspections by the IAEA on the two facilities which were not included in the DPRK's list of nuclear facilities; and 2) implementation of a North-South joint declaration on denuclearization, are indispensable. Therefore, the government has not changed its stance, saying: "It is far from a complete settlement and Japan will keep watching the situation to ensure North Korea fulfills its responsibilities," (according to a government source). Since there is no prospect of resuming Japan-DPRK negotiations on the normalization of diplomatic ties, which Japan has been calling for, the government may make efforts to solve the problem with "indirect support," and ask for China's cooperation while maintaining contact with both the United States and South Korea.
