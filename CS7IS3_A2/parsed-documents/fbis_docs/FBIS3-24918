This warning was given today by General Joao de Matos, chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, who urged the population to arm themselves because the war is far from over. [Begin Matos recording] My hope is that the Angolan people will be on their guard and that they will arm and organize themselves in preparation for very difficult times, because UNITA will continue waging war. [end recording] Joao de Matos further stated that there has been no progress whatsoever at the peace talks and that UNITA is only using them to play for time. [Begin Matos recording] We in the Armed Forces are beginning to lose our patience. The negotiations have been going on for so many months, and we in the Armed Forces note that there has been no significant progress. Despite statements to the contrary that have been made, all that is happening in Lusaka is mere propaganda. Now, for example, UNITA has agreed to resolve the question of the police force, but, in our opinion, this was basically and solely because the UN Security Council was about to meet. Now UNITA will continue to play its game, to play for time, until the next Security Council meeting. [end recording] Joao de Matos was speaking to reporters prior to departing for Brazil where he will be negotiating arms supplies for the Luanda government.
