Secretary of Defense William Perry handed down instructions that include sending tactical aircrafts to South Korea within a day or two at outbreak of war, and the U.S. Air Force in Korea was ordered to increase its artillery and other supplies as backup, the paper said. Only one of the three U.S. Air Force battalions stationed in Korea, comprised of 24 F-16s, can carry laser-guided bombs, according to the paper. The U.S. decision to be prepared for armed conflict on the Korean peninsula was based on South Korea's physical distance from the United States and lacking scale of the U.S. forces there, it said. Perry was quoted as saying that the United States will watch for another four to six weeks whether North Korea will allow international nuclear inspections before pushing for economic sanctions. The paper went on to say China opposes a U.N. Security Council resolution, recommending instead a statement issued by the council president. Washington could agree to the idea if the statement clearly indicates possibility of sanctions if North Korea ignores the warning about inspection demands, the paper said.
