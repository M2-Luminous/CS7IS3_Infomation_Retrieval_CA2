"A personal meeting between the presidents of the two countries after a new constitutional and political reality has emerged in Russia is very important," he said. Stankevich believes that until recently the United States had supported the most radical variant of economic reform in Russia. However, the "October-December crisis" (October revolt and December 12 elections which he also considers as a crisis) has shown that such variant has clear-cut social limits. Judging by many statements of American officials, the United States is ready to introduce considerable changes in its relations with Russia and stop supporting radical reform based on shock therapy, he added. Stankevich stressed that such corrections will constitute the subject of discussions during President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit.
