Sir Robin's admission contrasts starkly with statements by Governor Chris Patten and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd that the door to talks with China remains open. Two weeks ago, Chief Secretary Anson Chan also implied the time for negotiations with China on political reform was over. She said stringent time constraints dictated that the constitutional reform process had to be completed soon. In Beijing yesterday, Sir Robin said that China's conditions for a resumption of talks on political reform were impossible to meet. China has demanded that Britain nullify constitutional reforms already endorsed by the legislature, and withdraw the reform package gazetted on 25 February. The arrangements for this year's district board elections, and next year's municipal and Legislative Council polls need to be on the statute books by the end of July. Sir Robin said Britain could not simultaneously fulfil its obligations in implementing fair and open elections and meet China's pre-condition for more talks. Although the British wanted to reach agreement with China on political reform, it did not seem "it was going to be possible", he said. Conceding the talks were over, and in the light of statements by China's Foreign Ministry that the non co-operation on political reform would affect other transitional issues, Sir Robin again warned Beijing against trade discrimination. He said any discrimination against British firms for political reasons would not be compatible with the deal on economic relations and trade between the European Union and the Chinese government. Meanwhile, China's most senior bureaucrat dealing with the territory, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu Ping, yesterday lashed out at Britain for attempting to play down the Beijing decision to dismantle the territory's political system after 1997. Mr Lu accused Britain of misleading Hong Kong people by pretending this would not happen. The prospect of the three tiers of government in Hong Kong straddling the transfer of sovereignty was "pure imagination", he said. "We Chinese are people who mean what we say. "And as we have said we will set up a second stove, we must do it," he said. A commentary published yesterday in the official CHINA DAILY continued to accuse Britain of being hypocritical over Hong Kong's democratisation. It accused the British of being "die-hard colonialists...day-dreaming of playing tricks to obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong after 1997". Mrs Chan yesterday reiterated the British side had never accepted Chinese demands, before or during the Sino-British negotiations, not to put constitutional reforms before the legislature without the approval of the Chinese government.
