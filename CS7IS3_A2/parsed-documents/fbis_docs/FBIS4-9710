The Progressive Convergence Front [Frente de Convergencia Progresista, FCP] headed by Deputy Luis A. Mauro came in second, the New Society [NS] faction headed by Carlos Martini came in third, and the Democratic Alliance [AD] faction headed by Basilio Nikiphoroff came in last. Seventy-two percent of voting tables had been counted by midnight. The partial results continued to show who the clear winner of the EN internal elections held nationwide on 27 March was. The vote count gave the MIE 52.6 percent of the votes, followed by the FCP with 22.5 percent, the NS with 10.6 percent; and the AD with 8.7 percent. In a relatively calm atmosphere, other than some charges of irregularities in the voter registration lists, the EN elected the members of the party board, the coordinating board, grass-roots delegates, and district coordinators. With the MIE's victory, the ruling EN faction reasserted its hegemony both in the capital and the country's interior by a wide margin over its opponents. For its part, the FCP, headed by Deputy Luis Alberto Mauro, came in second before the NS headed by Febrerista Revolutionary Party [PRF] leader Carlos Martini. Contrary to the atmosphere that prevailed during the last part of the election campaign (marked by strong accusations among the movements), no conflicts took place on 27 March beyond the usual complaints about the voters lists. With an electorate that concentrates 68 percent of its potential in the metropolitan area, the leaders of the several factions that ran for election on 27 March agreed in pointing out that from now on the EN's main challenge is to gain time. It must be pointed out that the participation rate in the elections ranged from 35 to 40 percent. Attendance was more enthusiastic in the metropolitan area than in the interior, where the greatest absentee rates where registered.
