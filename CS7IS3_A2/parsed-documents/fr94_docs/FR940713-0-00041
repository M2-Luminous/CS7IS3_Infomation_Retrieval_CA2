FR940713-0-00041 FR940713-0-00019 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 74&hyph;14; Notice 90] RIN 2127&hyph;AE79 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection; Seat Belt Assemblies AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule, technical amendment, date for early optional compliance. SUMMARY: On April 15, 1994, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection, and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 209, Seat Belt Assemblies. It gave manufacturers of replacement seat belt assemblies intended for use only in specifically identified motor vehicles a choice of two means of providing information about the seating positions and vehicle models for which the assemblies are appropriate. The information may be provided either on the assembly itself or in the installation instruction sheet required to accompany the assembly. The final rule also provided that the labeling requirement does not apply to two types of seat belt assemblies when they are installed as original equipment in a new motor vehicle. The final rule is effective October 12, 1994. General Motors (GM) petitioned for reconsideration, requesting that manufacturers be allowed to delete information that will no longer be required now instead of waiting until October 12, 1994. This notice provides the requested relief. DATES: The amendments to Section 571.208 (49 CFR 571.208) and Section 571.209 (49 CFR 571.209), published at 59 FR 17992, April 15, 1994, continue to be effective October 12, 1994. Seat belt assemblies and vehicles manufactured before October 12, 1994, may voluntarily comply on July 8, 1994, with those rules instead of the requirements currently in effect. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Daniel S. Cohen, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NRM&hyph;12, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;4911. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 15, 1994, NHTSA published a final rule amending Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection, and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 209, Seat Belt Assemblies, to allow manufacturers of all replacement seat belt assemblies intended for use only in specifically identified motor vehicles a choice of two means of providing information regarding the seating positions and vehicle models for which the assemblies are appropriate (59 FR 17992). The information may be provided either on the assembly itself or in the installation instruction sheet currently required to accompany the assembly. The final rule also narrowed the applicability of the labeling requirement so that it does not apply to two types of seat belt assemblies when they are installed as original equipment in a new motor vehicle. NHTSA amended Standards Nos. 208 and 209 because the new requirement will provide manufacturers more flexibility in the manner of providing installation information without decreasing the likelihood that belts will be correctly installed. The final rule is effective October 12, 1994. On May 2, 1994, General Motors (GM) petitioned for reconsideration of the April 15 final rule. Specifically, GM requested an amendment to the effective date to allow manufacturers to begin now to delete information that will no longer be required. In the absence of this relief, the manufacturers will have to continue providing the information until the October 12, 1994 effective date. Prior to October 12, 1994, Standard No. 209 will continue to specify three different sets of requirements for the provision by manufacturers of replacement seat belt assemblies of information regarding the vehicle models and seating positions for which the assemblies are appropriate. The standard requires some seat belt assemblies to be labeled, some to be both labeled and accompanied by an installation instruction sheet, and some simply to be accompanied by an installation instruction sheet. A complete discussion of which requirement applies to which type of belt can be found in the April 15 final rule. The April 15 final rule replaced these three different sets of requirements with the single provision described above. Since the April 15 final rule was intended to ease the burden on manufacturers, by providing manufacturers with more flexibility and deleting redundant requirements, the agency is adopting the requested amendment. NHTSA finds for good cause that this final rule can be made effective immediately. This final rule imposes no duties or responsibilities on any party. Manufacturers may continue to comply with the current requirements until the previously established effective date of the April 15, 1994 final rule. As an alternative, this final rule gives manufacturers the option of complying instead with the requirements of Standard No. 208 and Standard No. 209, as amended by the April 15, 1994 final rule, which will become effective October 12, 1994. Accordingly, under the authority of 49 U.S.C. 322, 30111, 30115, 30117, and 30166, and the delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50, the amendments to Section 571.208 (49 CFR 571.208) and Section 571.209 (49 CFR 571.209), published at 59 FR 17992, April 15, 1994, continue to be effective October 12, 1994. Seat belt assemblies and vehicles manufactured before October 12, 1994, may voluntarily comply on July 8, 1994, with those rules, in lieu of the requirements currently in effect.
