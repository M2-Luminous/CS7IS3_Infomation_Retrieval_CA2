FR940414-1-00069 FR940414-1-00010 The estimated facility-level impacts associated with each of the regulatory options are discussed below and presented in Table 4. In addition, estimated worst-case employment impacts are provided. For a projected facility closure, all employment at the associated facility is assumed to be lost. In estimating employment losses, facilities projected to convert their pesticide product lines to formulating, packaging, or repackaging of alternate products are treated as closing their PFPR lines entirely. All production and non-production employment associated with PFPR is assumed to be lost. In fact, some or all PFPR employment at such facilities might be retained. Demand and production might shift to non-pesticide products, unregulated pesticides, or to pesticides for which compliance is less costly. The assumption that all PFPR production is lost is therefore a worst-case assumption. The examination of whether compliance costs are greater or less than five percent has not been used to assess employment impacts. As discussed above, this impact measure is assumed not to lead to an operational change. Under Options 1, 2, and 3 all of the moderate impacts were projected on the basis of a comparison of post compliance return on assets for PFPR activities with a return assumed to be achievable in alternative business activities using the same capital equipment (i.e., based on projection of line conversions). Therefore, employment losses associated with moderate impacts at these facilities are accounted for. For Options 4 and 5, over 85 percent of moderate impacts are projected based on the ROA comparison. Therefore, most moderate impacts are associated with an employment loss. i. Impacts of Option 1. There are 578 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 1. One hundred twenty of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 458 were analyzed as candidates for a line conversion, a more moderate impact. 5 A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 1 are estimated to be $79.0 million and $32.6 million, respectively. An estimated nine Subcategory C facilities are projected to close due to compliance with Option 1. One hundred seventy-one facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst-case, to be 437 full-time equivalents (FTEs) as a result of the estimated impacts. 5 As described above, PFPR/Manufacturing facilities, and facilities that obtain more than 25 percent of their revenue from PFPR were analyzed for possible closures, and all other facilities were analyzed for possible line closures. ii. Impacts of Option 2. There are 558 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 2. One hundred thirteen of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 445 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 2 are estimated to be $66.1 and $27.9 million, respectively. One facility is projected to close due to compliance with Option 2. One hundred seventy facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 426 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts. iii. Impacts of Option 3. There are 558 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs. One hundred thirteen of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 445 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 3 are estimated to be $66.1 and $27.9 million, respectively. 6 One facility is projected to close due to compliance with Option 3. One hundred seventy facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 426 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts. 6 Note that the compliance costs projected for Options 2 and 3 are identical because both options are based on the same technology. For simplification and because the technology is essentially identical the costs are presented to be identical. In reality Option 3 costs could be lower than Option 2, because sampling data indicate that facilities which do treat wastewater for recycling back to the facility do not need to achieve the same degree of pollutant removal from the wastewater that would be required to comply with numeric standards. iv. Impacts of Option 4. There are 558 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 4. One hundred thirteen of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 445 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 4 are estimated to be $18.4 and $286.5 million, respectively. Seven Subcategory C facilities are estimated to close due to compliance with Option 4. One hundred ninety-three facilities are estimated to incur moderate impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 1,113 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts. v. Impacts of Option 5. There are 578 Subcategory C facilities that are estimated to incur costs under Option 5. One hundred twenty of these facilities were analyzed for possible facility closure and the remaining 458 were analyzed for line conversions. A comparison of annualized compliance cost to facility revenue was conducted for all Subcategory C facilities. The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 5 are estimated to be $21.0 and $360.2 million, respectively. Seven Subcategory C facilities are projected to close due to compliance with Option 5. Two hundred seventeen facilities are estimated to incur moderate economic impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 1,173 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts.
