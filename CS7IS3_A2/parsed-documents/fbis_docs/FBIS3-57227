Taking part in it are more than 600 representatives of the regional organizations of political parties and movements, entrepreneurial and industrial structures, foundations and public organizations from Odessa, Poltava, Sumy, Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Zhytomir, Nikolayev, Kiev, and other cities of Ukraine. One of the co-chairmen of the bloc, Volodymyr Hrynyov, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of the "Nova Ukrayina" [New Ukraine] association, emphasized that the goal of the future strong parliamentary coalition, which the bloc expects to reach at the March election to the Supreme Council, should be order and the market in Ukraine. He believes that ways toward this lie in privatization, improvement of the financial system, establishment of equal economic relations with Russia, changes within the authority institutions, and the priorities of the private sector. The conference is planned to approve an appeal of the Hrynyov-Kuchma bloc to the citizens of Ukraine on the election eve and a "Declaration on the goals and principles of the activity of the Interregional bloc of reforms." The four fundamental provisions of the "Declaration..." envision the following: priority of human rights and freedoms, creation of a civilized market society in Ukraine on the principles of private ownership of land and the means of production, refusal from any attempts to build a state with national and ethnic priorities, refusal of the policy of confrontation with Russia and other CIS countries. Also, the conference delegates will take part in the work of the "Kharkov Business Assembly."
