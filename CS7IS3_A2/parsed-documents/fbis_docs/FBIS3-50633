According to unofficial reports, at least 200 people were killed in the fighting but it is estimated that there could be more bodies scattered in jungle areas and in the cities, but access to these sites have been denied to reporters. The Mexican Army closed the roads that link Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, with San Cristobal de las Casas -- where the insurrection began on Saturday -- because the rebels are approximately 16 km from Tuxtla Gutierrez, military sources told EFE. The Armed Forces established a general headquarters outside Tuxtla Gutierrez and are keeping all entry into the city under very close surveillance. In addition, these forces are totally occupying Chiapa de Corzo, one of the main tourist zones, which the rebels could use to enter the area. Sources close to the Army noted that 25 rebels were captured and that "Commander Marcos" (who headed the attack on San Cristobal de las Casas) could be among them. [passage omitted]
