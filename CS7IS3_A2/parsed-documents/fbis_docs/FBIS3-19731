The government spokesman also said that police will publish a sketch of the person within the day. President Glavkos Kliridhis will raise the issue of Yeoryiadhis' murder with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative on Cyprus, with whom he is having a working luncheon at the Presidential Palace now within the framework of the proximity talks for the confidence-building measures. President Kliridhis this morning asked police for a report on Yeoryiadhis' murder as well on the recent arrest of four foreign students in the yard of the Omeriye Mosque in Nicosia. Responding to correspondents' questions before his meeting with [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas this morning in the occupied areas, on whether he agrees with the view that Yeoryiadhis' murder was aimed against the talks process, Clark said he did not know the details of the tragedy and that he did not wish to comment. Asked whether he considers the murder as a blow to the confidence-building measures, Clark expressed the conviction that progress on the measures can continue. He also expressed regret over Yeoryiadhis' murder but repeated that the process will continue. The government spokesman said Yeoryiadhis' murder is part of the Turkish Secret Services actions that aim to hurt the movement for Kurdistan. He also said it cannot be ruled out that another aim of the murder is to hurt the talks on the Cyprus issue. Responding to a question, Kasoulidhis said Yeoryiadhis' murder affects the climate of the talks. The spokesman also said the government will show the necessary response to the needs of the victim's family in such cases. The political parties issued statements blaming Ankara for the murder. The political parties condemn with disgust the cowardly murder and call on the government to make every effort to solve it. They also repeat the solidarity of the Cypriot people with the struggle of the Kurds. [passage omitted]
