First he met NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner. For more details, we go over to a telephone report by Aida Shehu: [Shehu] The meeting expressed a common concern over the situation in the Balkan region, and [it was noted] that the attention of the international community is concentrated on Bosnia at a time when it is evident that the problem of Kosova is a key problem, and that without resolving it there can be no solution to the regional crisis. At the meeting concern was also expressed over the division of Bosnia, because, it was said, this division favors the aggressor and creates premises to set up new states through force. The meeting also focused on the increasing expansion of relations between Albania and NATO, a concrete sign of which is the signing of the PFP initiative. The Woerner-Berisha meeting lasted for about 30 minutes. In the presence of the North Atlantic Council, President Berisha gave a speech before signing the PFP agreement. After expressing his thanks to the North Atlantic alliance for the invitation to our country to cooperate as a partner, Berisha stressed that he was confident the decision to further cooperation with the former communist European countries taken at the NATO summit in January this year constitutes a historic step in the life of our continent and the whole international community. NATO is now the only military alliance in our part of the world that, because of its moral values and military potential, has the indisputable responsibility for peace, security, and European stability. NATO is today the only great hope to cure Europe and the international community from the Bosnian (?penitent) syndrome. Later, President Berisha stressed that as a country fully interested in stable peace in the region. We [Albanians] should stress that over the last 20 months, developments at a military level, together with the many defeats of the negotiations, clearly testify that dividing Bosnia is a hopeless option to end the war and establish peace. The time may have come to replace it with another option that respects the principles of preserving Bosnia's integrity, the right of the people to turn back to their centuries-long hearths, and does not reward the aggressor. President Berisha said that, though the defense of these principles seems difficult at first sight, he thought this was the only way to establish peace and it was many times more productive than the acceptance and implementation of contrary principles. President Berisha reminded those present that one of the great knots of the present Balkan crisis is undoubtedly the problem of Kosova. There should be no solution to the Balkan crisis without solving the Kosova issue. That is why Berisha asked them that the question of Kosova, which could at any moment trigger a Balkan war, be accorded the proper gravity and the dimensions that it possesses. For this reason, he said, I consider it very important to link sanctions on Serbia to the situation created by Serbia in Kosova, to dispatch UN monitors to the province, and to exert pressure on Serbia so as to start negotiations with the legitimate representatives of this province within the framework of the Geneva conference, as well as to make a clear inventory for the return of all the violently seized institutions and to solve its status by respecting the human and national rights of 2 million Albanians who live in their ancient territories. President of the Republic of Albania Sali Berisha signed the PFP agreement at 1045 [0945 GMT] in the presence of the North Atlantic Council members.
