Why this haste, and what do we expect from this step? [Martonyi] First about the haste. The idea of the application for membership first emerged when former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall visited Brussels. Unfortunately, the association agreement came into force later than we had expected because of the delay in the process of ratification. Finally, it came into force on 1 February, which put the issue of full membership on the agenda. The other element of all this is that work on an expert level has been going on for a long time and we have drawn up the government's integration policy. It was clear from the beginning that, in this integration strategy, one of the questions -- although not necessarily the most important one -- is the timing of the application for membership. All I am really trying to say is that this process started a long time ago, and domestic political considerations had nothing to do with it. I can state this very definitely. In our view, this application has to be submitted now. We would lose at least two years if we waited until 1996, when the inter- governmental conference on the future of the Union is held. We must not do this, the deadline of the year 2000 is very important for us. We have always emphasized that the association agreement was a stage on the way to full membership. If we do not continue on this road, and stop at an intermediate stage, then I am convinced that we will find ourselves in an unfavorable situation in 2001-2002. [passage omitted] [MAGYAR NEMZET] Was the selection of the timing influenced by a subjective element, namely it seems that the current French minister for European affairs [Alain Lamassoure] seems to be more positive about Hungarian membership than his predecessors? [Martonyi] Indeed, as far as I know, Lamassoure was the first one to verify in the press the Hungarian intention to submit the application for membership. He also said -- what we also know -- that the Central and Eastern European countries have to be placed on an equal basis politically, but the political, economic, and legal criteria of membership have to be defined. It will be possible to differentiate between the candidate countries on the basis of these criteria. This is the essence of Lamassoure's view. In my view, this is basically favorable for us. [passage omitted] [MAGYAR NEMZET] Can we hope that, after the association agreement becoming effective and submitting our application for membership, our integration into Europe can be speeded up in other areas, too? [Martonyi] This is indeed an important connection. In addition to what we have already mentioned, it also has to be seen that one of the roles of the membership application is that it forces both sides (us and the Union) to face up to our historical responsibility. We can do one thing, namely force the other side to make decisions and to give answers. This is something that is very important. If we want to gain the status of official candidate, then we force the European Union to give an answer. We feel that we can also contribute to the thought process that has now begun in preparation for the 1996 conference, and the subject of this is what kind of Europe we want: A more united, efficient, and democratic Europe, or are we envisaging a different kind of integration. At the moment, the debate is on what status the European Union's associate members should have in the West European Union. I always say that we have to try to further the whole process, and rather than forging ahead as an arrowhead, we want to move forward along the whole front. Therefore, I believe that we have to see the connections between the various goals. Unfortunately, we also have to mention that, here and now, in the Eastern European situation, the elements of unpredictability and uncertainty are present and only certain indications of these have surfaced for the time being; and I believe that this whole issue is also a factor that speeds up integration. The Balladur plan can also be one of these factors. One of the reasons I say that we would like a united Union is because I believe that this is the only solution to the Hungarian national dilemma: On one hand, transferring a significant part of national sovereignty to the Union and a broader application of subsidiarity on the other, which can also help increase the independence of local communities. This has preconditions, and a long and slow process is needed here because Eastern-Central Europe cannot forget its history and tensions overnight. In my view, the Balladur plan has a chance if it tries to help in this. This is very difficult and has to face many obstacles and mistrust, and this includes the Hungarian side. Naturally, we are also afraid that the plan will finally change in such a way that it loses it original essence, namely that we have to find a solution to the national minority issue by listening to the minorities and allowing national minority rights to prevail. This is the essence of the issue. In addition to this, we can also talk about everything. The success of the plan will not depend on us. Undoubtedly, if the Balladur plan is implemented, then this will be a step towards EU membership for all countries. [MAGYAR NEMZET] Which institution will coordinate the Hungarian actions toward the Union after the application is submitted? How will we attune our economic and other legislation with the European Union's legal provisions? [Martonyi] We already have the answer to this, namely Law No. 1 of 1994, which announced our association agreement, contains a second and a third paragraph stating that, on one hand, the associate agreement has to be taken into account when making international agreements and, on the other -- and this is more important -- the requirements of coordination and conformity with the Union's laws have to be taken into consideration in all future Hungarian legislation. As an institution, I believe that the basic responsibility belongs to the Hungarian Parliament. A parliamentary decision is needed to submit the membership application -- from a legal point of view, this is actually the initiation of an international agreement. This undoubtedly comes under Parliament's sphere of authority. Parliament will also have to decide on specially important issues in the future. In addition to this, the executive power is responsible for carrying the whole process, in cooperation and coordination with Parliament and its committees. Statements of a domestic political nature have indeed appeared in the press. I am asking all participants -- if I may put it this way -- not to create a domestic political issue out of this, on either side. This is a fundamental interest and it has to be completed; if it is supported by all parties then it is everyone's merit and responsibility, and it should be accepted with a near unanimous parliamentary decision. I note that this would also be very favorable for the assessment of the application because we have always presented this as a national consensus. I believe that we have been justified in doing so because we have always agreed on the essence of this issue with all parties.
