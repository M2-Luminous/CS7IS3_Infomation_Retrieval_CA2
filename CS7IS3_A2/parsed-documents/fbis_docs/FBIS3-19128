Are you the biggest loser of the day? [Wulff] I do indeed believe that the Christian Democratic Union [CDU] is the loser. We have lost 5, 6 percent. However, I do want to say at this point that I take responsibility for this defeat -- that goes without saying. I am the top candidate. [passage omitted] [Announcer] This really is the worst result -- we have to have a close look at the figures -- in almost 30 years. This is indeed a huge defeat for you personally. I remember you saying before the elections that you tried to represent the young, the new, the renewed CDU. Was not this what the voter wanted? [Wulff] I think the process of renewal has to continue. We were popular in certain groups of the population and put on great election campaign events. We now have to continue to fight, to work, and I want to do this in the state parliament in particular, also as leader of the opposition in order to have a different basis from which to start out next time and to win. We are of course convinced that our policies are the right ones and that this federal state needed a new start. We did not get the votes required for this, so we will go into opposition and be a good opposition. [Announcer] How much blame for this defeat goes to Bonn? [Wulff] In the last elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hamburg, and Brandenburg we lost 10 percent of the vote and we have lost around 5 percent here. That is quite a change. We managed to keep the Republikaner out of parliament which is a great success. In Hamburg almost 8 percent of votes were for the right-wing extremists. We kept the Statt [Instead] Party quite small because we have renewed ourselves as an established party. Thus, we have some positive signs from this election result. But the climate necessary to bring about this turnaround was lacking. [passage omitted] [Announcer] But you will be going to Bonn sometime, of course. It is said you once put your foot down there. Will you do that again? [Wulff] We think we can see some improvements in Bonn, also over the last eight weeks. This was not expressed in the election result, but when I see how things have gone with the nomination of Roman Herzog, nursing care insurance, and changes in bad weather payments yesterday and the day before, then I have to say that Bonn supported us greatly in the end, so thanks also to Helmut Kohl, Peter Hintze, and others in Bonn, who fought like Frau Merkel, Herr Wissmann here, a great thing. So we also have support in Bonn, to whom we owe our thanks.
