However, in a few years the EEA is in danger of being undermined when four of the five countries mentioned are to become full members of the EU. The EEA dethrones the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which made the United States, Canada, and Mexico into a large market, as the biggest market in the world. NAFTA may be bigger in terms of surface area, but the EEA has a larger population, larger production, and a larger share in world trade. The EEA has 372 million inhabitants compared with NAFTA's 360 million. The EEA has a joint GNP of $7,500 billion (270,000 billion Belgian francs [BFr]) compared with NAFTA's $6,770 billion (BFr244,000 billion). The EEA exports $3,878 (BFr140,000) per inhabitant, compared with $1,683 (BFr60,500) in NAFTA. Originally the aim was that all seven countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) should join the EEA. But the Swiss voters decided otherwise in a referendum at the end of 1992. The treaty had to be quickly adapted to accommodate Switzerland's dropping out and be ratified again. In addition, Liechtenstein, which has a customs treaty with Switzerland, was also unable to join for the time being. Somewhat ambitiously, the EEA is sometimes called the biggest single market in the world. However, the current negotiations on Norway, Sweden, Finland and Austria joining the EU make it clear that EEA membership is still some distance from EU membership. First, the EFTA countries involved have no representatives in the European institutions, they do not take part in decisionmaking procedures within the Union and are adopting nothing of the Union's political ambitions. But, on the strictly economic level, integration does not go so far as within the Union. Agriculture and fishing are outside the EEA agreement; the free movement of goods between the Union and the EFTA countries can be limited for reasons of public safety or public health and there is no joint trade policy. Restrictions continue to apply to the purchase of real estate and direct investment in the EFTA countries. But the EFTA countries are adopting the EU's rules on free competition. They are setting up their own "Supervisory Council," which is to ensure that rules of competition are respected. From now on the five countries will also be involved in the preparation of new EU laws. For these reasons many observers see EEA membership as merely an interim step to full EU membership.
