FR940719-1-00025 FR940719-1-00009 Many comments indicated that the agency's proposed justification for eliminating the consideration of alternatives was improperly based on an assumption concerning the limited availability of upland alternatives. These comments stated that the consideration of practicable alternatives is site-specific, and therefore a categorical exemption, especially for an area the size of Alaska, cannot be made. Several comments cited examples of where practicable alternatives to discharging dredged or fill material into wetlands exist in Alaska or publications that stated that such alternatives exist. A number of comments indicated that there are opportunities for compensatory mitigation in Alaska. One comment stated that the low wetlands loss rate does not make it exceptionally difficult to restore historic wetlands and that the hydrology of the State does not make restoration any more difficult in Alaska than in other States. Other comments stated that because compensatory mitigation may include enhancement activities, it should not be ruled out merely because there may be limited sites available for creation and restoration. One comment cited a project conducted by Ducks Unlimited and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game in which ponds were apparently created in muskeg wetlands to increase the value to waterfowl nesting. Another comment stated that existing literature shows many ``arctic specific'' methods available to enhance certain tundra habitat and that there are a number of ``success stories'' for enhancement on the North Slope. After reviewing these comments, EPA has concluded that the proposed rule, by allowing discharges of dredged or fill material into wetlands without any analysis of whether less damaging, practicable alternatives were available or without requiring any compensatory mitigation, regardless of its practicability, would have resulted in adverse impacts to wetlands in Alaska. EPA has concluded that existing mitigation requirements to avoid wetlands losses and to compensate for unavoidable impacts where practicable are sufficiently flexible to consider the fact that avoidance and compensatory mitigation may not be feasible in certain cases. EPA believes that the definition of ``practicable'' affords discretion and flexibility to the Corps to craft case-specific decisions that effectively consider highly diverse environmental, economic, and geographical conditions, including those found in Alaska. Therefore EPA believes that the proposed rule's categorical elimination of the avoidance and compensatory mitigation requirements for discharges in Alaska is not warranted. The EPA/Army Mitigation MOA, which clarifies the Guidelines mitigation requirements, recognizes that avoidance and compensatory mitigation might not occur on every proposed permit action. The MOA contains qualifying language that states that avoidance and compensatory mitigation may not be practicable in areas where wetlands are abundant. Moreover, in January 1992, EPA and Army issued a clarification to the Guidelines and the MOA with respect to Alaska which emphasizes that ``[w]here there is a high proportion of land in a watershed or region which is wetlands, it is likely that avoiding impacts to wetlands will not be practicable depending on project size and other logistical considerations,'' and ``that there are areas, including many locations in Alaska, where it may not be practicable to restore or create wetlands; in such cases compensatory mitigation is not required under the Guidelines.'' EPA believes that the record of the Section 404 program in Alaska relative to requiring mitigation demonstrates the flexibility of the regulations to reflect the circumstances of the State. This flexibility has resulted in the requirement of compensatory mitigation in only approximately 4% of all individual permit approvals in Alaska. In Fiscal Year 1993, the Alaska District Corps authorized the filling of 1,092 acres of wetlands while only 226 acres of compensatory mitigation were required. Existing Regulatory Flexibility A large number of comments addressed the issue of whether existing regulations, beyond the specific issues of practicable alternatives and compensatory mitigation, are sufficiently flexible to allow appropriate development in Alaska, while ensuring necessary resource protection. Roughly half of those comments asserted that existing regulations are flexible enough, while the other half asserted that they are not. Some comments stated that wetlands regulations are cumbersome and do not recognize the extent of low and moderate value wetlands in Alaska. Some also stated that wetlands regulations hinder development. Other comments cited Corps Alaska District permit statistics to support assertions that the regulatory program is already flexible enough_or ``too flexible'' according to some comments_to accommodate permit applicants. Many comments argued that wetlands regulations are no more burdensome in Alaska than in any other State. Another comment noted that Alaska, as one of the fifty States, should be bound by the same laws and regulations as everyone else. Other comments added that in addition to the low denial rates for individual permits, the existence of general permits for a variety of activities demonstrates additional regulatory flexibility.
