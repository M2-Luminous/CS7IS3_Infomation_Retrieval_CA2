Almost a third of the components of the single engined JAS are made in the United States, and because of this Washington requires veto rights for each individual export deal. Bjorck describes this as unfair saying Sweden cannot accept a system that puts its interests subordinate to those of the United States. He added that companies in Sweden's defense sector would look at European alternatives for the plane unless Washington relaxed its policy.
