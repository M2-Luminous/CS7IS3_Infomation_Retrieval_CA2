FR941007-1-00045 FR941007-1-00008 571.208 Standard No. 208, Occupant Crash Protection. * * * * * S4.1.5.1␣ Front/angular automatic protection system. * * * * * (b) For the purposes of sections S4.1.5 through S4.1.5.3 and S4.2.6 through S4.2.6.2, an inflatable restraint system means an air bag that is activated in a crash, other than an air bag that can be deactivated by a manual cutoff device permitted by S4.5.4 of this standard. * * * * * S4.5.2␣ Readiness Indicator. An occupant protection system that deploys in the event of a crash shall have a monitoring system with a readiness indicator. The indicator shall monitor its own readiness and shall be clearly visible from the driver's designated seating position. If the vehicle is equipped with a single readiness indicator for both a driver and passenger air bag, and if the vehicle is equipped with a cutoff device permitted by S4.5.4 of this standard, the readiness indicator shall monitor only the readiness of the driver air bag when the passenger air bag has been deactivated by means of the cutoff device. A list of the elements of the system being monitored by the indicator shall be included with the information furnished in accordance with S4.5.1 but need not be included on the label. * * * * * S4.5.4␣ Passenger Air Bag Cutoff Device. Passenger cars, trucks, buses, and multipurpose passenger vehicles may be equipped with a device that deactivates the air bag installed at the right front passenger position in the vehicle, if all of the conditions in S4.5.4.1 through S4.5.4.4 are satisfied. S4.5.4.1␣The vehicle has no forward-facing designated seating positions to the rear of the front seating positions. S4.5.4.2␣The device is operable only by means of the ignition key for the vehicle. The device shall be separate from the ignition switch for the vehicle, so that the driver must take some action with the ignition key other than inserting it in the ignition switch to deactivate the passenger air bag. Once deactivated, the passenger air bag shall remain deactivated until it is reactivated by means of the ignition key. S4.5.4.3␣A telltale light on the dashboard shall be clearly visible from all front seating positions and shall be illuminated whenever the passenger air bag is deactivated. The telltale: (a) Shall be yellow; (b) Shall have the identifying words ``AIR BAG OFF'' on the telltale; (c) Shall remain illuminated for the entire time that the passenger air bag is deactivated; (d) Shall not be illuminated at any time when the passenger air bag is not deactivated; (e) Shall not be combined with the readiness indicator required by S4.5.2 of this standard; and (f) Shall be adjustable to provide at least two levels of brightness, one of which is barely discernable to a driver who has adapted to dark ambient roadway conditions, and shall not be adjustable under any driving condition to a level that is invisible. S4.5.4.4␣The vehicle owner's manual shall provide, in a readily understandable format: (a) Complete instructions on the operation of the cutoff device; (b) A statement that the cutoff device should only be used when a rear-facing infant restraint is installed in the front passenger seating position; and, (c) A warning about the safety consequences of using the cutoff device at other times. * * * * * Issued on October 3, 1994.
