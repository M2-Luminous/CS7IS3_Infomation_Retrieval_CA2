The article is entitled: "Sullivan, the CIA, and the Splinter Groups: Alliance To Fabricate Lies." It refers to a highly secret document issued by the U.S. Interests Section here in Havana. JUVENTUD REBELDE also published the full text of the document. According to Baez Delgado, the document, which is addressed to the CIA among other addressees, is indisputable evidence not only of the lies and falsehoods dreamed up and disseminated against the Cuban Revolution, but also of the absolute cleanliness and justice that have always characterized us. Baez Delgado adds that throughout the past 35 years Cuba has time and again stated that in this country there has never been a murdered, tortured, or missing citizen. This truth no one can deny, as no one can deny that here no one is under arrest for political reasons, but only for crimes against the Revolution, and that the so-called dissidents are only cheap CIA and U.S. Interests Section puppets. According to the article, those who dedicate their lives to the ideas in which they believe neither persecute or imprison because of those ideas, as the CIA and the U.S. Interests Section have done. Those who believe in principles respect those principles. Those who fight for the dignity and honor of men will never be their executioners but will be their most faithful defenders. Joseph Sullivan, head of the U.S. Interests Section, knows this very well, although he may dare to say so only secretly. Let us pay special attention to some of the sentences of this document, which, in ambiguous phrases, and considering the author and addressees, comes to an unavoidable conclusion: In Cuba there are no violations of human rights. This was not said by Fidel Castro; it was admitted by Joseph Sullivan. The document includes unreliable cases, unverifiable documents or evidence, cases that are not congruous in certain aspects and which are of interest only to the United States. The general unreliability of the cases and the recognition of the economic rather than the political factor as the essential cause of emigration prove the above points. The moral status of the members of those splinter groups stands out in the document. According to Baez Delgado, the leaders of those little groups peddle written guarantees like trinkets; they perpetrate fraud; they accuse one another and violate among themselves the most fundamental human rights, in addition to biting the hands that guide and feed them. Moreover, Sullivan's document only adds further questions to the arguments that various U.S. Presidents have advanced all through these past years to intensify their policy of blockade against Cuba and makes the backward and ruthless individuals who are trying to defeat us through hunger look like liars. According to the article, those who are trying to emigrate by entering embassies that happen to represent countries with which we have the best relations are also disappointed. No one with such objectives should violate the diplomatic missions of any country, much less if those embassies are not committed to any agreement to grant asylum. Among these candidates for emigration, none has had any political problem. The U.S. Interests Section document has finally unveiled this trick. Sullivan's call to the CIA for help is very eloquent. The document states that given the expressed CIA interests in the human rights issue, and its growing participation in and growing knowledge of the different human rights groups, we suggest closer cooperation with the U.S. Interests Section in accordance with our common objectives. This shows, Baez Delgado adds, that the police of the unipolar world have run out of steam and bullets. The moral bullets of the Revolution have once again demonstrated that they have a much longer range. The small island of Indians is once again giving a lesson to the North. Only a quarter of a century ago, they looked down on us; now they respect us. On 28 June 1987, referring to the human rights issue and to the imperialist anti-Cuban campaign, Fidel Castro said: In our struggle against tyranny, we have been educated to repudiate and hate any use of violence against a prisoner; and those values have led us to victory. Those values have maintained us here, and history will see that this truth is written. Baez Delgado ends his article by saying that history has once again proven that we are right and if, in their confusion or arrogance, the CIA, the State Department, the Immigration and Nationalization Service, and Sullivan himself deny the existence of the document and say that it was fabricated by the Cuban Government, they should be aware that the Revolution has never made up a document and that its honesty has always been irrefutable. Caught redhanded, it is natural that their position is uncomfortable and embarrassing, Baez Delgado's article concludes.
