[Occhetto] If we form the next government we will do so on the basis of an agreed platform, and we will not form a government with anybody who wants to include a tax on treasury bills in the platform. Do you also want to know why? Because we believe that taxing treasury bills would be a mistake, would discourage investment, and would disrupt the state's finances. As a result of all this, we have no intention of taxing treasury bills. [Panara] What about NATO, which [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti is saying Italy should leave? [Occhetto] This debate about whether we should stay in NATO or leave is really old hat. [Former Communist Party leader] Berlinguer himself, however, said that NATO was an umbrella organization to protect freedom. On Monday [28 February] we will be going to Brussels to meet NATO's top officials. At this meeting -- the first of its kind -- we will be discussing global problems and NATO's role in solving them. [Panara] What is your opinion of Bertinotti? [Occhetto] Clearly, the battle waged by Communist Renewal is closely linked to party issues. If they think that they will win votes in this way -- which I very much doubt -- let them carry on as they please. [Panara] Even if the votes that they may win by doing so were considerably fewer than those they may cause the progressive coalition to lose? [Occhetto] I trust that this will not be the case, because we still have the capability to speak to the country at grassroots level. We are a real presence, as shown by experience in the last few days. We have seen that wherever there are real men made of flesh and bone, the electoral lists are successfully, but where there are only TV spots and hot air, they are unsuccessful. [Occhetto ends] Occhetto cuts short: "Look here, this electoral campaign can be described as Occhetto versus [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, not Occhetto versus Bertinotti." We went on to discuss the issue of the restructuring of industry, a process capable of causing massive redundancies. "We are in favor of defending productive activities at any price," Occhetto said. "We want to defend each citizen's right to work. The time for a purely defensive battle has come to an end; we are now aiming to enable people to move from one job to another, without increasing the public debt, but rather, by mobilizing private funds and the state's existing resources."
