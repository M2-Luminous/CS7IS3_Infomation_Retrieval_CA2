If it is not our own, it is a foreign one. What kind of an army should the Polish Army be, to avoid having foreign troops stationed in the country? After all, we border three powerful neighbors. [Kolodziejczyk] I think I should state first of all that we are past the Warsaw Pact stage, where we were ascribed the role of a second-order force. Compared with contemporary needs, the logistics department, supplies systems, engineering troops, and everything that was supposed to secure high maneuverability in the operational space up to and including the Pyrenees has been developed excessively in our Army. The situation changed when the Warsaw Pact was dissolved and the Soviet Union collapsed. Overnight, the countries of the former Warsaw Pact found themselves without any concept of their own security policies. Many options were debated, including three fundamental ones: One was neutrality; a second was what President Walesa called "Eastern NATO," meaning some alliances without the Soviet Union; and the third was a very clear pro-NATO one that, in the beginning, we did not know how to deal with because it envisioned that, all of a sudden, we are to leave one alliance in order to join another. [POLITYKA] So what kind of an army should we really have? Who should it defend us against? [Kolodziejczyk] It will be an army of a defensive nature, but, at the same time, it will be characterized by mobility and flexibility in terms of the command process, and it will have three fundamental types of armed forces: Land Forces, with their own command structure, which we did not have before in a formal sense. What has been known as military districts up to now, will, as time goes by, take over the role of military administration, and they will deal with preparing a defense system and with training regional troops. A second component of the Army will consist of the command structure of the Air Force, and, finally, the command structure of the Navy, which, generally speaking, will maintain the form it has had heretofore. At this stage, we have about 248,000 soldiers, even though, according to treaties, we are allowed to have as many as 288,000, plus we are planning further reductions. These will be necessary because of our financial situation. We also share the view of the Germans, who are also cutting the size of their Army, that, in this day and age, the number of troops is not as important as the weapons these troops have at their disposal. This would reduce the expense of maintaining the troops--which currently reach as much as 65 percent of the National Defense Ministry's [MON] budget--and instead, allow us to spend more on modern and incredibly costly equipment. It is true that a contemporary aircraft is capable of replacing a few or even a dozen or so aircraft of the previous generation, but the price of such a new aircraft is shocking: Take for instance the French Mirage 2000, which costs about $60 million, or a modernized version of the U.S.-made F-15, which has a price tag of about $100 million. If we are thinking seriously about our membership in the Euro-Atlantic security structures, we cannot just boast about the level of training provided to the troops but must also catch up with NATO's technical standards. [passage omitted] [POLITYKA] Do the Sejm and the government not understand the needs associated with the country's security? Or is it perhaps a game of interests that the Army is simply losing? [Kolodziejczyk] In this situation of shortages in the budget, strong pressure groups and interest groups have emerged that have even lead to a breach of the Budget Act by ordering MON to purchase 300 billion zlotys' worth of Iryda aircraft. It is a dangerous precedent, and it is good that the president decided to file a lawsuit over Article 36 of the Budget Act with the Constitutional Tribunal. [POLITYKA] So why do you not have your own lobbying group in parliament, Mr. Minister? [Kolodziejczyk] The answer is simple. As a man who was designated by the president to serve in the prime minister's Cabinet, I am not loved by the coalition, whereas, when it comes to the opposition, they do not apply such distinctions, and, by acting against the interests of the coalition, they also act against me. [POLITYKA] Would you receive better treatment in the process of budget designing if MON were not a presidential ministry? [Kolodziejczyk] It is not all that bad with my cooperation with parliament. There are reasonable people there who, even if they do not know much about Army issues and are guided by logical thinking only, have a favorable opinion about us. On the other hand, people who used to work in MON before, currently have views that amaze me. [POLITYKA] So the coalition regards you as a president's man, the parliamentary opposition regards you as a coalition minister, and extraparliamentary opposition regards you as a representative of the old, postcommunist military cadre. [Kolodziejczyk] Unfortunately, this kind of labeling does exist, but it is a question of approaching defense issues through political games and personal ambitions. We are still not successful in overcoming those phenomena. The blame for such labeling is to be attributed to all political orientations, and even the Army itself is not free of it. [POLITYKA] Does the opposition currently have a competitive concept of the development of the Armed Forces? Are these ideas worth debating, or is it just a case of teasing the minister? [Kolodziejczyk] I have not come across any coherent concept like that. The extraparliamentary opposition is almost completely absent from the debate--apart from Romuald Szeremietiew's writing, which appears from time to time, and which is nothing new, anyway. When it comes to the parliamentary opposition, they exploit some decisions that are made, for the purpose of political games and making excessive complaints. Let us take the first example that comes to mind: the issue of subordinating the military special services to the chief of the General Staff, who is responsible for designing operational plans and who therefore must have the necessary instruments for that purpose. And that does not mean abandoning supervision over these services--on the contrary. I have set up an office for special services, which, on the minister's behalf, formulates general tasks stemming from the country's defense policies and controls the implementation of these tasks and the necessary expenditures associated with them. [POLITYKA] So, if you have your own concept, should you not be defending it publicly? [Kolodziejczyk] But I do defend it in cases in which I am attacked. I think that an overwhelming majority of the Sejm National Defense Committee has taken a positive stand on my concept. Sejm Deputies Janusz Onyszkiewicz and Bronislaw Komorowski are surprising exceptions in that regard; they should know better than the rest how the mechanism functions. But they are the ones making a great fuss that the current minister is abandoning his power by relinquishing everything for the sake of the chief of the General Staff of the Polish Army. They also say that the old ways are coming back. Well, the opposition is often guided by immediate political interests, and it postpones real arguments until "better times." It is a tactical maneuver that is applied not just in this country. There have been similar accusations concerning changes in the educational services, but it is precisely Sejm Deputy Komorowski who has built this huge apparatus of people, many of whom are incompetent, ignoring the fact that a majority of forces should be directed to the troops, which is where the educational work is taking place. The role of MON's educational department should be limited to programming educational work, cooperating with other ministries, establishing good rapport with the mass media, maintaining contact with veterans and youth organizations, and, finally, supervising the implementation of fundamental principles of educational policies among the troops. In other words, the cap should fit the head. Unfortunately, what we are dealing with here is a scout burdened by a huge rucksack--a bureaucracy that is excessive compared with common sense. Our philosophy boils down to melding the Army and General Staff structures that are being modernized with programming/supervision structures that are not too elaborate and that constitute an efficient element of a system of democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. We are widely using the experience of Western countries that have been applying mechanisms that have stood the test of practice. To question such a concept and to make the accusation that the minister, a former military man, is trying to reverse the wheel of history by trying to reconstruct the old arrangement must be regarded as a flagrant abuse, which results also in a conviction among the cadre that the "war at the top" is an obstacle to solving the enormous problems the Army is facing. [POLITYKA] You have been criticized for your unwillingness to place orders with the domestic arms industry. There is even talk that you are the industry's gravedigger. [Kolodziejczyk] These accusations only demonstrate the power of the industrial/trade union lobbying groups in the arms industry. For us to be able to start cooperating with the industry in a normal way, these lobbying groups must simply be brought down.... To go back to the ill-fated Iryda, the point of view of the Mielec plant is this: to maintain what we already have, based on the MON budget, without any initiative or creativity on the part of the plant itself, and to continue, the philosophy is, in case of problems in drafting a budget, to force MON to find funds for the purchase of Mielec products, including by strikes, even in cases where the equipment offered by the plant does not meet the quality standards expected by the Army. [POLITYKA] Still, there must be some objective criteria that would indicate whether an aircraft is of good or bad quality? [Kolodziejczyk] The manufacturers are well aware of these criteria because they have already negotiated for a lowering of the criteria. This does not facilitate the competitiveness of Iryda on international markets. I am still hoping that the Mielec plant will deliver to us the product we have ordered before the end of this year, while the plant's management will come to understand that we are not just an ordinary customer--as it used to be in the past--but a demanding partner. That is exactly the position taken by the Swidnik plant, with which our cooperation continues to improve. [POLITYKA] Maybe they lack not so much goodwill or skills as they do money? [Kolodziejczyk] I would not like to analyze this that deeply. That is the business of the trade and industry minister, as well as of the plant's management. Still, I do know that the Mielec plant could have saved itself by accepting an order for a series of large transport planes for delivery to the United States. So far, they have decided not to use the opportunity for reasons that are completely beyond me and that--I hope--a special institution established for that purpose will soon clear up. To recap, people working in our arms industry must get it into their heads that the times when the Army purchased equipment and arms "just to follow an order" are long gone, never to return. Currently, the very limited state funds designated for defense purposes must be spent with great caution, and I mean purchasing equipment approximating world standards. [POLITYKA] The Polish Army is equipped with arms produced primarily according to Soviet technology. How does one go about solving problems with overhauls, spare parts, lubricating oils, engine oils, and specialized ammunition? Does this not further contribute to our dependence on others, as well as to our helplessness? [Kolodziejczyk] There are indeed problems, and they are one of the main reasons justifying the Visegrad Group's continued existence. Recently, this was responsible for extending the scope of cooperation to cover Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Romania. All of these countries and ourselves are in the same type of situation. Currently, we cooperate with anyone who could be of help in maintaining our military equipment at the highest possible state of readiness. It is a kind of military cooperative of self-assistance among colleagues that, with some amount of goodwill, could, through the coordination of research and implementation work, minimize the cost and reduce the time needed for technical modernization of the Armed Forces of the countries concerned. We are trying very hard to convince our partners about this concept, but, unfortunately, so far we have not scored much success. So, for the moment, we must manage on our own. [POLITYKA] In which types of arms could we specialize? [Kolodziejczyk] Take, for instance, radiolocating equipment, short-range rockets, or helicopters. We also do not hide the fact that our rifles are good and much cheaper than similar weapons. [POLITYKA] Does "Partnership for Peace" open the door for us in terms of Western technology? [Kolodziejczyk] If the program is indeed a direct path into NATO, then it must be associated with access to Western standards and technology. Unfortunately, Western thinking is very much dominated by inertia, especially in the context of our sense of a shortage of time. A game is in progress in which Russia is the first on the list to push the break pedal. In that country, changes in mentality are occurring at an incredibly slow pace, and there continues to be deep frustration and a yearning for imperialism. We approach "Partnership for Peace" very seriously, but, if it turns out that it is a dead-end street, we will withdraw immediately. [POLITYKA] How will you be able to tell if it is a dead-end street? [Kolodziejczyk] If the initiative is limited to only joint measures within peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, while the remaining measures, which would render us closer to NATO structures, get mired in fruitless debates, this will be a clear warning signal that we are taking part in a game without stakes. We will only be able to tell at the end of this year--that is to say, after an analysis of the legacy of this year's joint military maneuvers--what the real intentions of our partners from Brussels are. I hope the net result will be beneficial to us. [POLITYKA] Is there a conflict between you as minister and the chief of the General Staff regarding who is in charge of the Army? Such views are indeed expressed in the press... [Kolodziejczyk] I deny such accusations. In the ministry I am in charge of, subordinates do not argue with their bosses. But, what is happening is that General Wilecki and I, as well as others, have been conducting a debate based on a partnership concept, but I must confess it is heated at times and concerns the issue of making the management of the country's defense system rational. Because of Poland's aspirations, the system should take into account mechanisms in operation in NATO countries. [POLITYKA] Is General Wilecki's concept different from yours? [Kolodziejczyk] I think it is, even though he never clearly articulated that. The point is that the military, without its own will or guilt, was maneuvered into a dispute about the country's political system. The debate on the structure of managing the country's defense system must lead to a preliminary solution, and it must happen before the constitutional debate: What type of a state system is there supposed to be in the country? Will it be a presidential system or a parliamentary/cabinet one? All that makes the solution to problems that are significant to the Army more remote. It also delays the parliamentary debate of defense issues and slows down work on laws that are of crucial importance to the Army. This game into which the Army unfortunately has been drawn does not serve the state's interests. [POLITYKA] Personnel policies are also part of the democratic supervision over the Armed Forces. What is the story with the process of building a civilian sector within MON? A graduate of the National School of Public Administration has complained to us that the Army showed no interest in him because the vacancies in the civilian sector must be kept for officers who are leaving basic service and are being transferred to the reserve. [Kolodziejczyk] Meanwhile, I am just now looking for a candidate for chief of the Personnel Division, and, God, I hope it will be a civilian! As of today, we can absorb 30 graduates of the school you mentioned into MON, but nobody wants the jobs because of the low salaries. That is also a factor slowing down the "civilianization" of the Army. [POLITYKA] Recently, Colonel Rozbicki, your press spokesman, wrote a piece for GAZETA WYBORCZA on the topic of the Army. The way the case ended up was that a scandal erupted, and he was dismissed... [Kolodziejczyk] That is because he presented himself as writing on behalf of the minister, but he had not discussed this with me. In the article, he questioned the disarmament treaties concluded by Poland. It was a case of arbitrary behavior and abuse on his part. [POLITYKA] But he also wrote that his views reflect the opinions of a large portion of the officer cadre... [Kolodziejczyk] Nobody has done any research on this. [POLITYKA] At a recent meeting in Brussels, the issue of Kaliningrad and the troops stationed there was discussed again. Is it your feeling that Russia is trying to evade a neighborly discussion on defense issues? [Kolodziejczyk] Absolutely yes. What is happening is that a superpower whose position was once significant but that is currently going through major problems is demonstrating sulkiness. Poland is the most active country in its efforts to join NATO. For that reason, among others, Russia has a sick obsession about us because it thinks we are the ones who are leading others down the road to NATO, and Russia thinks we are doing this against the interests of those countries. Our Russian neighbors do not want or cannot understand that NATO is going through a deep transformation--from a military bloc to the foundations of a common security system that is emerging on our continent. I also regret the fact that bilateral relations, despite our openness, are not as good as those with our remaining neighbors. Minister Grachev has been saying for some time now that his agenda is filled with events and that is the reason he cannot come to Warsaw. And I say to that: That is your mistake because we must sit down and explain to each other some arguments, exchange reasons and opinions, and jointly look for mutually beneficial solutions. But I hope that now that Russia has joined "Partnership for Peace" there will be a better climate for our mutual relations to develop better. [POLITYKA] We thank you for the conversation.
