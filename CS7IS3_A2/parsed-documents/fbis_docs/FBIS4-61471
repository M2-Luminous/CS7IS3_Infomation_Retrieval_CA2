It was hoped that the combat operations would be suspended on the eve of the meeting the speakers of the parliaments of the disputing countries will have. That would give an opportunity to the sides to exchange views on what has to be done. Regrettably, however, those who cherished that hope have been disappointed. The relatively peaceful situation along the front lines lasted only 24 hours. Azerbaijan's military forces have resumed their intensive military operations in the confrontation areas in the NKR. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters Press Service has disclosed that Azerbaijan's military units have maintained their attacks against various parts of Mardakertskiy Rayon. The NKR military units not only obstructed their attacks in the clashes in the vicinity of Chayly and Karmiravan but also placed several heights under their control. Azerbaijan's military units were forced to withdraw to their positions after suffering many casualties. Attacks were launched from the military bases in [words indistinct] today. The NKR defense forces have successfully rebuffed the onslaughts. Using military vehicles, Azerbaijan's military forces tried to penetrate the NKR lines close to Agdam yesterday morning. However, they failed in their attempt. Their onslaughts were obstructed. The advancing units were forced to retreat. It is common knowledge that the neighboring republic's leaders are convinced that sending their young men to die is the only way to remove the economic crisis in Azerbaijan. However, that republic's leaders and reactionary forces are well aware that resolving the dispute through the use of armed force is impossible. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's military forces have maintained their provocative activities on Armenia's border. They intensely fired on Armenia's northeastern border with artillery units last night and today. The defense positions and residential areas close to the border in Noyemberyanskiy, Idzhevanskiy, Tavushskiy, and Krasnoselskiy Rayons were fired on with heavy artillery units and Grad rocket launchers. The attacks have caused damage. Our military units were forced to launch retaliatory operations. Two of Azerbaijan's military aircraft flew over the border for reconnaissance purposes and disappeared in the direction of the Khanlar locality in Azerbaijan at about 1800 yesterday. However, the enemy was not satisfied with that provocative action. Two enemy infantry groups launched an attack on Berkaber in Noyemberyanskiy Rayon at 2200. A wave of intensive artillery fire preceded their attack. Armenia's border troops forced the Azerbaijani units to retreat after suffering many casualties. No one was hurt on the Armenian side. Meanwhile, the Armenian fighters clashed with another enemy group close to Aygehovit in Idzhevanskiy Rayon. Azerbaijan's troops were attacked and forced to retreat. There were dead and wounded on both sides.
