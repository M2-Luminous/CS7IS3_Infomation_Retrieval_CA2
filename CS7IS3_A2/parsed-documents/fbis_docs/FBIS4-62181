Officials at the Russian Defense Ministry said his Ministry had several times asked North Korea to accept a Russian expert's witness of the disintegration of a discarded Russian submarine delivered to them last December. But, North Korea has not affirmatively responded, they said. Western sources here said North Korea seems to have already begun disintegrating the submarine. "As they reject a Russian expert's presence, there is the strong possibility that they may recycle the submarine for military purpose," the sources said. They said that despite North Korea's rejection of such witness, the Russian Pacific Fleet has decided to deliver more discarded submarines to North Korea. Last November, North Korea signed a contract with Russia for the purchase of 12 discarded Russian submarines for use as "scrap." The contract provides for a Russian expert's witness of the disintegration of the submarines delivered so as to dispel the possibility of them being recycled militarily in North Korea. One of the submarines was delivered to North Korea last December and a North Korean tugboat is presently in Vladivostok preparing to tow another.
