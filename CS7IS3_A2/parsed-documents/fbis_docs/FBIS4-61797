He announced that a document has been prepared and will be sent to Mr. Isakov; this document is, so to speak, an indirect response to the letter sent just the other day by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to our head of state Algirdas Brazauskas. "We have some doubts as to whether the Russian side has correctly understood our objectives regarding military transit from Kaliningrad Oblast via Lithuanian territory. We merely expounded these orally at the meeting in Moscow without handing over the text of the appropriate document. In the letter addressed to Mr. Isakov we have now expounded Lithuania's official position on this issue," V. Bulovas said. Explaining the essence of Vilnius' position on the problem of military transit, the Lithuanian ambassador said that for the time being the Seimas has not adopted an appropriate law and the republic's authorities are certainly not hindering the transportation of the Russian troops and weapons that are being withdrawn from the former GDR, thereby acting on the basis of bilateral agreements. He also announced that at the present time a statute on the transportation of dangerous military freight via Lithuania is being prepared for adoption. "We are not hiding the fact from Russia that in preparing this document we are consulting with specialists from other countries, and when the plans are ready we will discuss them with Russian experts." The ambassador had difficulty in naming a date for the next meeting between the Lithuanian and Russian Federation delegations. Among other things, this will deal with certain transit conditions and also the coming into force of the agreement on reciprocal granting of most-favored-nation trading status signed by the premiers of the Russian Federation and Lithuania in Vilnius last November. The agreement is vitally important for the republic because Russia is Lithuania's principal economic partner, but Moscow is putting forward more and more conditions, linking its implementation, for example, with demands for guarantees from Vilnius that it will ensure the normal economic activity of Kaliningrad Oblast. "Lithuania does not intend to take any measures that would damage the oblast's economy. However, if Russia henceforth intends to pursue a policy of `time-wasting' in implementing the treaty, thereby pushing us -- whether deliberately or not -- into the embrace of the West, Lithuania will take appropriate measures," V. Bulovas said. "We have invited one of the Russian foreign minister's deputies to Vilnius, and I hope that Mr. Isakov will accompany him. It is then entirely possible that a date for the next round of talks can be set. Even though I believe there is inadequate `groundwork' for such a meeting. But we will reach agreement with Russia sooner or later: There is a desire for agreement on both sides," V. Bulovas stressed in conclusion.
