He expressed his worries in two messages. In the first message dated 18 June and addressed to His Excellency Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK, the king said there was a threat to Democratic Kampuchea in Phnom Penh. For this reason, he believed it was preferable for the PDK to withdraw its representatives from the capital, because he feared that accidents might happen to PDK representatives. If accidents did happen to PDK representatives, he said, there would surely be a serious problem. In the same message, King Norodom Sihanouk added that he would continue to have good relations with the PDK. In another message King Norodom Sihanouk demanded that the two-headed government avoid doing anything harmful to PDK representatives and that it give the latter sufficient time to prepare for their departure. Observers have noted that the king was worried because he understood that should the two-headed government harm PDK representatives in Phnom Penh there would be serious consequences both at home and abroad. At home, there would be a collapse of and an apathy in the process of national reconciliation and the entire nation and people would never forgive the traitors -- the communist Vietnamese puppets and the two-headed elements -- for that. As a result, there would be a traumatic situation in which the king himself would no longer be able to play any mediating role in the settlement of the problem. This was the main cause of the king's worries. Moreover, observers have agreed that the PDK office in Phnom Penh was closed because the communist Vietnamese, their puppets, and the two-headed government were afraid of the Cambodian masses and they were trying to exercise the powers of their fascist, dictatorial regime. However, the more fascist they become, the sooner their suicide.
