The charges are based on a ruling issued by Judge Milton Juica. Juica established that Stange and five other Carabineros officers failed to help clear up the slaying of three Communist leaders in 1985, better known as the decapitations case. On 31 March Judge Juica sentenced three former Carabineros members to life imprisonment for the triple killing. He also sentenced to up to 18 years in prison 12 other former Carabineros members and one civilian. All of them were members of the now defunct Carabineros Intelligence Directorate (Dicomcar), a kind of secret police. [passage omitted]
