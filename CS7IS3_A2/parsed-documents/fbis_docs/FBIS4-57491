Several diplomats accredited to Port-au-Prince say they do not favor a foreign military intervention in Haiti to dislodge the military rulers. Let us listen to Mirlene Joanis. [Begin recording] [Joanis] The four countries that claim to be Haiti's friends asserted once again at the residence of Prime Minister Robert Malval that the rumors of military intervention are unfounded. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti William Lacy Swing reaffirmed the intention of the United States to carry on with the negotiated, diplomatic path. [passage omitted] [Venezuelan Ambassador Elsa Boccheciampe] The Venezuelan ambassador to Haiti has the same opinion as the little Friends of Haiti. "We are part of the group of friends; we make decisions; and we share the opinions of the group of friends." [Joanis] French Charge d'Affaires (Philippe Seltz) says: We just support a deployment of MINUHA [the United Nations Mission in Haiti]. But is the decision, made jointly by the military rulers and some parliamentarians, not a slap in the face of the international community? (Seltz) thinks Haitians are sovereign in their country and they can do what they want. [(Seltz)] "The Haitians are sovereign and [words indistinct]." [Joanis] If Haitians are sovereign, why is the French charge d'affaires at the Malval residence? [(Seltz)] "It is simply because he invited us to come today. In fact, as he told you, we talked about issues relating to the university. He wished to know our viewpoint on certain proposals. When the legitimate prime minister asks me to visit him, I do so, just as my colleagues in the diplomatic corps would." [Joanis] As for Canadian Charge d'Affaires (Louis Robert D'Aigle), Canada is still on the diplomatic path for restoring democracy. [(D'Aigle)] "Here we maintain the same hope, the (?conviction) that the crisis will be resolved in the general interest of the Haitian people as they expressed it in (?1987)." [Joanis] "[words indistinct] President Aristide will no longer officially be president." [(D'Aigle)] "Listen, we will see at that moment. It is perhaps... [pauses] Politically, 12 months is an eternity. We must always, we are going to support all efforts aimed at restoring constitutional order." [Unidentified reporter] "Canada does not favor a military intervention in Haiti?" [(D'Aigle)] "[words indistinct] expressed himself very clearly about that. We have thought about adopting complete sanctions, which will undoubtedly be enforced this weekend. We will see at that time." [Reporter] "Mr. Ambassador, are you optimistic about a possible return of President Aristide to the country?" [(D'Aigle)] "I have an optimistic nature." [Joanis] Within the scope of the negotiated diplomatic path, (William Gray), who replaces Mr. Pezzullo in the Haitian crisis, will arrive in Haiti next week. Does this emissary intend to meet either with the military rulers or with the de facto government? Mr. Swing does not know. [Swing] "I do not know yet. I do not know [words indistinct]. I did not talk about that. I do not know what the agenda upon his visit to Haiti will be. I do not know." [Joanis] Whereas the Haitian crisis has reached a watershed with the installation of Attorney Jonassaint to power, the four countries that say they are Haiti's friends have stuck to their positions. They have the same speech. The speech is not renewed. Everyone is wondering what the country's democratic future will be. Observers are very worried. But Prime Minister Robert Malval has no reason not to believe in the good intentions of the international community. [Malval] "I have no reason not to believe in them. In October, I expressed the reproaches I had to level at the international community." [Jonais] The friendly countries, the little Friends of Haiti have taken a clear stand. For the time being, they are not favorable to the idea of military intervention. They favor instead a total and complete embargo, a sanction that will be effective as of 22 May. [end recording]
