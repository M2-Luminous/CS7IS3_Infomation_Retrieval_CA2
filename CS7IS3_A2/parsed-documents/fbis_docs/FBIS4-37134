However, he said that both sides are aware that the situation is very serious and that the Yemenis could lose control of the situation if matters continue as they stand and if the war is not brought to an end quickly. Brahimi told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his stopover in Amman that the reality of the past four years has created very difficult conditions, and that the failure of the attempts to secure a solution over these years has made matters more difficult. The international envoy defined three phases for his current mission: First, the two parties must be convinced that the fighting will lead to nothing but ruin and destruction, and that its continuation would cause the Yemenis to lose control of the situation. Second, after everyone reaches this conviction, they must be convinced that the solution lies in dialogue and that reaching an understanding through dialogue is the only way to resolve the Yemeni crisis. Third, if the first two steps are achieved and the two sides sit at the negotiating table, certainly every party is going to bring its conditions with it...and we will talk about it then.
