Juppe urged that a study group be set up by the four in Geneva in the next few days. The French minister said the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which was declared a safe haven by the United Nations, was now under Serbian control. His statement came as the town was under renewed heavy Serb shelling after tanks rolled into the enclave on Sunday. Juppe added that France favoured "neither abandonment nor escalation." He said the Geneva study group proposal aimed at defining a common approach to apply pressure jointly to relaunch peace negotiations.
