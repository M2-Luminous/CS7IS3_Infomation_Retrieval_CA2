Robert Gillette briefed Dlhopolcek on the situation that has developed as a result of the decision made by Roman Hofbauer, minister of transport, communications, and public works, concerning the termination of the agreement between the former Federal Ministry of Communications and Radio Free Europe. During the discussion Frantisek Dlhopolcek said that under the totalitarian regime the RFE was a symbol for the Eastern bloc states and one of the few sources of free information available to citizens living in these countries. But the situation has changed since 1989 and that is why we need to seek new forms of addressing the listeners. RFE broadcasting should adapt to this, too.
