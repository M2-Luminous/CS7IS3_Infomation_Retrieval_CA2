Some 1,500 influential scientists and social activists from over 50 countries worldwide are expected to attend the conference, launched by the Pacific Science Association, said Zhou Guangzhao, the association chairman. Zhou, also president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that the congress will focus largely on more than 20 subjects, including population explosion, resources crisis, environmental deterioration, continued development, South-North cooperation, social sciences, medical sciences, culture and art. The Chinese Government is keen on the congress, the first to be held in China, Zhou said. The founding congress took place in Hawaii in 1920. He said that the congress will display to the world the great achievements which an ever-opening China has scored in scientific, technological, cultural, educational and many other spheres. It also will promote scientific and technological cooperation and exchange among countries in the Pacific region. The Pacific science association is a multi-discipline non- governmental international academic organization, of which China is a founding member. According to Zhou, the scale and influence of the Pacific Science Congress has actually gone far beyond the Pacific region. Scholars and representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Finland and some other European countries as well as from many island countries in the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean are expected to take part in the eminent science congress. Many international research programs, organizations, academic exchange and government institutions, as well as prominent individuals have shown interest in the subjects to be covered by the congress. Some will speak at the congress as special guests, Zhou said.
