He met with its commander, Colonel Jan Cmilansky, and with the Division's corps of commanders. During their discussion, he briefed them on the current situation in the Slovak Army. The defense minister said, among other things, that the number of personnel in our Army should be reduced to 46,667 by November 1995, in accordance with the Vienna Agreements. "For this reason, procedures have to be adopted to ensure that the state's defense capability is not weakened. This is also necessary because the Army has already been reduced by 32 percent due to its division following the breakup of Czechoslovakia." At a meeting with reporters, Kanis said, in connection with the Army's professionalization, that "preparations are already under way in this regard. Professionalization is proceeding in the two mechanized battalions in Bratislava, and it will be enough to professionalize 390 noncommissioned officer posts in order to make a significant positive change."
