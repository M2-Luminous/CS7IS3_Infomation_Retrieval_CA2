According to Akhba, the key issue is the deployment of forces solely in the buffer zone. The clause in the agreement on the deployment of troops in the conflict zone, unexpectedly for the Georgian side, was presented by representatives of Russia, the UN, and the European Union. In the opinion of Georgian delegation members, the Abkhaz version of the settlement of the conflict suits the UN, the European Union, and Russia, because should CIS troops rather than UN forces enter the conflict zone, the issue of financing the troops will automatically be resolved as the CIS states and Georgia will have to undertake this task. According to some analysts, Georgia's signing of this document could exacerbate the domestic political situation in Georgia. Talks are continuing in Moscow.
