During six hours of questioning Mr Major, who became Foreign Secretary in July 1989, then Chancellor before succeeding Lady Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1990, denied any role in for formulating, considering amending or interpreting policy on defence exports to Iraq. He said he had not been told of an alleged relaxation of guidelines on military exports to Iraq until November 1992 after the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial. He still did not accept that any relaxation had been put into practice. Mr Major said he had not been involved in the decision in 1990--by which time he was Chancellor--to investigate and later prosecute three Matrix Churchill executives. That was a matter for Customs, not ministers, he added. He said he had not been briefed about the operation of the guidelines on exports to Iraq and Iran when he became Foreign Secretary in July 1989. During his three months at the Foreign Office the issue had arisen only once, when the Cabinet rejected British Aerospace's plans to sell the Hawk trainer aircraft to Iraq. Asked if he knew that following the Iranian fatwa on Salman Rushdie, civil servants operated stricter export rules for Iran than for Iraq, Mr Major said: "Neither at that stage nor later was I involved in formulation of the guidelines, consideration of the guidelines, amendment of the guidelines nor interpretation of the guidelines." When Miss Presiley Baxendale, QC [Queen's Counsel], counsel to the inquiry, returned to the issue, Mr Major replied: "We have been dancing around this point for some time. You're asking me to make a judgment at a distance and not a judgment at the time. "With great respect I don't think that is a judgment I should make. I think that is a judgment for the inquiry." Lord Justice Scott told Mr Major that the inquiry knew that the rules on exports to Iraq had been relaxed. Mr Major said: "Well, I don't know that and I didn't know that." He had not known of any discussion on changing the guidelines until he had been at No 10 for two years. "The first time I was aware they had been looked at and a change considered was on Nov 13, 1992, when I received a memo from my private secretary to that effect. " Then, amid the flurry of political and media inquiries following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill case, he had ordered "a massive search of files" to establish what he had been told. "One of the charges at the time was that, because I had been Chancellor, because I had been Foreign Secretary, because I was Prime Minister, I must have known what was going on in the undergrowth." A memo from Mr Stephen Wall, then his private secretary, mentioned a meeting between three junior ministers--Mr Alan Clark, Mr William Waldegrave and Lord Trefgarne--in December 1988 at which the wording of the guidelines was revised. Mr Major marked the passage in the memo with a cross. "It's my cross on the paper because that is the first time I knew of it." Days later further research by Mr Nicholas Bevan, then a senior Foreign Office official suggested the revised version of the guidelines had not been put into practice. Senior ministers were uncertain about how to respond to the barrage of parliamentary questions facing them. Having by now announced the Scott Inquiry they decided against further statements to Parliament. Mr Major said: "There was a great deal of uncertainty over what had happened over the 1988 wording. Had it been implemented or had it not? I couldn't know which was right. It is very dangerous to respond to Parliament when there is a doubt." As Chancellor from 1989-90 papers relating to a Cabinet-level meeting on the future of trade with Iraq were circulated to his private office. The meeting, chaired by Mr Hurd in July 1990 weeks before the invasion of Kuwait, decided to relax controls on defence exports to Iraq. Mr Major said he did not see the papers nor attend the meeting. They were passed to a junior minister. As Prime Minister, issues concerning the Matrix Churchill prosecution were raised with him. Whitehall was concerned about the possibility of ministers setting a precedent by appearing as witnesses. The usual practice was for civil servants to represent them. Mr Major said he sought the Attorney-General's advice and was told that Mr Clark and Lord Trefgarne should appear at the trial if called. The use of public interest immunity certificates in the case was the first time he had come across them in practice, said Mr Major. He had not inquired about the contents of the documents they covered and was not involved in the decision to sign them. Later he and Mr Hurd agreed that if the certificates were overturned and sensitive documents were released to the defence, it would not be right for the Government to try to stop the trial. The inquiry was adjourned until later this week.
