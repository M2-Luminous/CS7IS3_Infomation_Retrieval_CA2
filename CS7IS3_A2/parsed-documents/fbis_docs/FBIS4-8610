According to Serb intelligence sources, Muslim forces have engaged about 15,000 soldiers of the 7th, 2d, and 3d Corps, as well as parts of the Sarajevo Corps, in their attacks from the direction of Kakanj and Vares, Mt. Zvijezda, and Olovo. According to an assessment by Serb military sources, the objective of the comprehensive Muslim operation is to capture the Nisici plateau, to take control of the Nisici-Srednje and Olovo-Sarajevo roads, and to break through the lines in Ilijas and Vogosca, which would enable them to link their forces from central Bosnia with those from Sarajevo.
