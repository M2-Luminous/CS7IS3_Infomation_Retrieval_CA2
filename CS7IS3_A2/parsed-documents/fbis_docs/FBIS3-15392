Mr. Brazauskas viewed the visit of the head of the Romanian state to Vilnius as a good opportunity to get first-hand information about the situation in the two countries and to exchange opinions about their efforts aimed at European integration, in the European structures of collective security. The Lithuanian president reasserted that our countries were the first ones that signed the Partnership for Peace accord in Brussels at the end of January. The basic political treaty between Lithuania and Romania that will be signed in Vilnius will elevate the bilateral relations to a higher level, Mr. Brazauskas mentioned and added that so far, no broad cooperation plans have been achieved, but such intentions might be favored by the signing of the treaty. In this respect, the Lithuanian president mentioned the interest of his country in building a north-south highway, which will be called Via-Baltica and will cross Romania. Our country that is neighboring the Black Sea and Lithuania neighboring the Baltic Sea also have mutual interests in making appropriate use of harbors and ensuring maritime access from both countries to those harbors .
