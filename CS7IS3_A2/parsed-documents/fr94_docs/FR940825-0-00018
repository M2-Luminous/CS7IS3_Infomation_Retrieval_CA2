FR940825-0-00018 FR940825-0-00004 In conjunction with a relaxation of the maximum limit for individual Form 773 contracts, REA imposed the $400,000 limit. This was intended to limit a borrower's and REA's exposure to risk in the event of a dispute involving one or more of the newly-allowed $200,000 outside plant Form 773 contracts. REA believes the increase in the limit for individual outside plant Form 773 contracts is appropriate, and believes that some maximum annual limit is needed to protect borrowers and REA from the potential risks of using this simple contract for complicated projects. In response to the comment regarding large borrowers, REA has changed the maximum annual limit to allow the limit to exceed $400,000 under certain circumstances, to permit large borrowers to perform up to 10% of the prior year's total cost for outside plant construction, under the Form 773 contract. It is not REA's intent for the Form 773 contract to be used in lieu of the Form 515 contract for most major projects. In response to the concern that the maximum annual limit would be consumed by outside plant construction, thereby requiring borrowers to forego other valid uses of the Form 773, REA has established separate, mutually exclusive annual limits for four categories of construction: Outside plant, central office equipment, special equipment, and buildings. As to the concern that REA's maximum annual limit would cause construction to be performed under the Form 515 contract, and that the Form 515 is more complicated and expensive, REA responds by agreeing that the Form 515 contract is much more complicated that the Form 773 contract, but disagreeing with the suggestion that construction costs are higher under the Form 515. REA intended for the Form 773 contract to be used only in situations of limited risk. REA took the idea initially for the Form 773 contract from telephone operating companies who had developed similar, simple contracts, for use only for small projects. The Form 515 is necessarily more complicated, but it has enabled the rural telephone industry to build plant of exceptionally high quality at costs that over the years have compared favorably with plant costs of far larger companies with much more purchasing leverage. This is largely because the Form 515 facilitates competitive bidding of outside plant construction, which is a fundamentally difficult task. In response to the suggestion that construction under the Form 773 is less expensive than construction under the Form 515, REA's experience over the years indicates that the reverse is true. However, no specific studies had been performed to compare these costs, so REA has performed a comparison. REA randomly selected 30 Form 773 contracts that had been performed between 1992 and 1994. This sample included only contracts that had been closed and found to meet all REA requirements. Very small projects were excluded from the list. REA then contacted borrowers to obtain additional information on the work included under the contracts, since that information is not routinely provided to REA. To make a valid comparison, REA discarded from the sample all contracts which did not represent reasonable cross sections of construction units, for example, contracts for road boring, or splicing. Interestingly, only six of the original 30 Form 773 contracts covered general outside plant construction projects which, if proportionally enlarged, would be comparable to typical Form 515 contracts. Costs of these projects were compared to standard mile costs for their states, which are based on average competitively-bid contract costs. The costs for three of the six projects were near the standard mile costs, the cost for one project was approximately 30% over the standard mile cost, and the costs for the remaining two projects were over twice the standard mile costs. These results illustrate one of REA's main concerns with the Form 773 contract. Some projects are performed at reasonable cost. Other projects are performed at costs which may be reasonable under certain circumstances. But some projects, in this small sample one-third of the projects compared, are far above the standard mile costs normally experienced. Under the current limits for individual Form 773 contracts, REA would not be concerned about these higher-than-average costs because such small jobs would not have a significant financial impact on a borrower or REA's security interests in a borrower. However, under the higher individual contract limits proposed by REA, the impact of several higher-than-average cost jobs could be significant. REA therefore has set limits in the final rule, but those limits have been designed to resolve the concerns of most commenters.
