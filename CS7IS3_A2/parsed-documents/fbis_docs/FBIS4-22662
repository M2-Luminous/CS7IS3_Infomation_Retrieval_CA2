To an extent, their appearance can be explained by the fact that the firm is trading in an area which has been one of the mainstays of the state's income. A HOLOS UKRAYINY correspondent wanted to get information from the horse's mouth, as they saying goes. I dialed the number of the First Deputy Executive Officer Oleksandr Ivanovich Nezdolya, and heard from him: "You are a little late, since I have been just appointed deputy industry minister. With your permission, I would like to introduce you to the new manager, Vyacheslav Zhyhun, deputy executive officer and chairman of the board of the shareholding group. After I expressed regret at not being able to speak to the person who had been present at the creation of the firm, Oleksandr Ivanovich, surprisingly, graciously agreed to a three-way conversation. As a result, I offer to the attention of the readers an interview which I recorded with both the former and the current managers of shareholding group (SG) Ukrayina, Oleksandr Nezdolya and Vyacheslav Zhyhun. [Pysanska] Please tell us about the structure of your shareholding group? [Zhyhun] SG Ukrayina was formed on the foundation of state enterprises with the participation of foreign capital. [Nezdolya] You see, our firm was created in December 1992, when in Ukraine a rapid decline of economic activity was underway, including in the foreign trade area. The government was trying to find a way to stop this decline. At the time, many enterprises were allowed to sell their output in foreign markets. Due to the lack of pricing information and marketing, as well as the presence of both honest and shady partners, a lot was sold but only a small portion of the proceeds found its way to the state foreign exchange treasury. Naturally, this could not go on indefinitely. In those circumstances, the managers of five plants, with the consent of their labor collectives and the support of the Cabinet of Ministers, formed SG Ukrayina. Those are enterprises which produce mineral fertilizers-- concern Styrol in Gorlovka and production association Azot in Severodonetsk, Cherkassy and Dneprodzerzhinsk--the Odessa port and Donetsk metallurgical plants and conglomerates Kryvorizhstal and Zaporizhstal. As founding enterprises, they own 65 percent of statutory capital. On the one hand, the SG's task was to use its funds to maintain stability at the enterprises and in industry. On the other hand, it had to fill state orders and fulfill state contracts. Thus, hard currency obtained for fulfilling state contracts went entirely to the state currency fund, while funds which came from filling state orders were used to buy raw materials and equipment. Not just for the shareholding plants but for enterprises of the chemical and other industries. [Zhyhun] The founding of SG Ukrayina in that economic situation did not take place because one person or a group of people wanted it. Oleksandr Ivanovich has already listed the main reasons prompting the government and management to take this step. I want to focus attention on the fact which few remember: one of the main tasks of SG Ukrayina was to support the severely ailing and weakened chemical industry. It was an industry which enjoyed steady demand in foreign markets. In no circumstances should that industry have been allowed to decline because of the sharp rise of energy prices. In fact, the use of funds from the SG's export operations to purchase raw materials, equipment and packaging for the chemical industry helped prevent further weakening of strong enterprises and a collapse of weak chemical plants. [Pysanska] In effect, SG Ukrayina has become a powerful monopoly. [Zhyhun] It is not so. The firm sold only 60 percent of its shareholders' output, which consists of ammonium carbonate, ammonia, ammonium nitrate, pig iron and rolled steel. At the same time, Kryvorizhstal and the Donetsk metallurgical plant sold their products independently. Since the foundation of the shareholding group, a total of $173 million worth of output has been sold, and $76 million worth of products has been purchased for Ukrainian industry. This includes raw materials, equipment and chemicals to protect agricultural crops, the purchase of which, incidentally, helped double the crop. The remaining funds went to purchase equipment, packaging and raw materials for the SG's founding shareholders. [Pysanska] There was a major scandal about those purchases. In particular, you were accused of purchasing environmentally unsafe pesticides. [Nezdolya] After a thorough investigation by law enforcement organs, the case was dropped due to the lack of evidence of criminal activity. [Pysanska] It is said the SG Ukrayina is engaged in dumping, i.e., it is selling at artificially low prices. [Zhyhun] It is impossible. First, we are being constantly monitored by the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. In addition, we are working with foreign firms which have experience in world markets. Selling at artificially low prices would have been unprofitable for us as well as for them. [Pysanska] At the start of the discussion you mentioned that SG Ukrayina is an entity formed on the foundation of state enterprises with the participation of foreign capital. So, among its founders there is also a foreign company. Is true that it is the notorious Syabeco? [Nezdolya] It is true, as is the fact that the head of the SG Ukrayina managerial board is Syabeco owner Borys Birshtein. Incidentally, that firm's share of the shareholders' capital is 35 percent. Accordingly, it receives dividends amounting to slightly more than one third, minus 5 percent (after taxes and current expenditures), which SG Ukrayina charges as a commission for acting as an intermediary in foreign trade. I must state that Syabeco has not done any harm to our country. Nothing but good. With full responsibility I can attest that Mr. Birshtein is a decent, enterprising human being endowed with a considerable brain. If the government of our country had specialists such as he, we may not have wound up where we are now. When SG Ukrayina was being formed, the country had no funds to launch it. Syabeco gave us credit. [Pysanska] How much? [Nezdolya] Sufficient for us to function. You know, when good money is being made, all sorts of rumors start around it. Of course Borys Birshtein is not a do-gooder. He has come to Ukraine to make money. But he is not here to steal and run away. In 1993, he gave us $20 million at a minuscule interest rate to buy chemicals for crop protection. He is currently looking for an opportunity to buy natural gas from Russia. This means the livelihood for factories and for the people who work there. Here is an honest partner. [Zhyhun] In addition, as for our relationship with Syabeco, on the request of people's deputies it was investigated by the tax inspection and the appropriate Ukraine State Security (USS) organs, who found neither violations, nor abuses, nor any other fraud on the part of that firm. Moreover, Mr. Birshtein is not only a businessman but a person to whom the fate of our country is not indifferent. He did not come here to rob us but to teach us how to trade at a civilized level, and to establish strong business ties which would continue to grow and create profits for both sides. Besides, Syabeco is helping our country in a very difficult hour. Borys Birshtein and his partners, unlike many others, are not waiting until we start living better. Believe me, this is the proof of the solidity of the firm, and its good, long-term intentions. [Pysanska] You have mentioned the USS. I have information that its organs control SG Ukrayina. You, Oleksandr Ivanovich, are--what?--a general of that service? [Nezdolya] There is no secret about it. Do not beat around the bush: I am indeed a USS general. [Pysanska] So, the USS is now selling mineral fertilizers? [Nezdolya] Who told you that? I have not signed a single contract but only acted as an operational liaison with the government, informing about the situation in the foreign markets and foreign companies which do business with us. However, had in 1992 enterprise directors independently entered the international market without proper experience, their lack of skills would have harmed Ukraine and caused a shock among their foreign partners. Our responsibility is to protect economic sovereignty of our country and its security in this area. There is a great need for this, since today hundreds of firms come to Ukraine, many of which do not really exist. They promise a gold mine, earn a quick buck and disappear without a trace. [Pysanska] And there is no other way aside from involving special services? [Nezdolya] I understand what you want to say. But our work is not surveillance and eavesdropping. We must protect productive industry sectors, join the civilized world and establish market relations. We must find the end-user, in order to reduce the number of intermediaries. Yet, we lack experience and skills. So, let directors learn. SG Ukrayina has a new type of managers working for it, ones who have studied to trade in the international market, both at home and abroad. Our job will be to combat mafia structures and corruption. There is a difference between honest money making and robbery. [Pysanska] Excuse me, there is this cynical joke: you cannot defeat mafia in Ukraine; you can only lead it. [Nezdolya] To think like this is the beginning of an end. But no matter what you say, we are protecting the country's economic independence. Ten other special export entities have now been set up along the same lines as SG Ukrayina. I am convinced that all this disorder and stealing of state property which still goes on here exists only because everything is cheap: both raw materials and labor. We, conversely, should become rich and expensive. Today, SG Ukrayina is still learning to trade. Nevertheless, it has already performed a great service to the state. It is important to understand how useful such entities will be if they establish themselves in the world market, develop a system of export and import operations and obtain the necessary working capital. It should be noted that the activities of such entities are constantly being monitored by law enforcement organs--Ukrainian ones, too. I am convinced that the future--at least the immediate future--belongs to such entities. There is no other way for us.
