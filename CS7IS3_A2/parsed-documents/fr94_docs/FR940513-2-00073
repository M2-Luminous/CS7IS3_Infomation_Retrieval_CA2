FR940513-2-00073 FR940513-2-00039 Although research can identify critical issues and evaluate alternatives, it seldom addresses the practical, hands-on decisions that accompany the design and establishment of a statewide system. The definitive textbook or curriculum on how to build state home and community-based care infrastructures has yet to emerge. This priority area is based on the conviction that AoA can best facilitate the development of state home and community based infrastructures by supporting the exchange of accumulated knowledge, expertise, and hard-earned lessons. Accordingly, AoA is soliciting applications to design and administer a capacity-building/mentoring program in home and community based care. The goal of the capacity-building/mentoring program is to assist States in the development of home and community-based care infrastructure by: (1) using the expertise and knowledge of State and Area Agency on Aging staff who have demonstrated leadership in creating innovative systems in their States; (2) drawing from other pertinent areas of knowledge and experience (e.g. the establishment of Medicaid waiver programs, Independent Living Centers, etc.) and; (3) providing peer consultation to States whose leadership has a commitment to improving their state system and recognizes the need for technical assistance. Applicants must present an overall agenda and set of activities/approaches for conducting the project over a three year period, as well as provide a detailed first year plan for how the capacity-building/mentoring program will be developed, organized, and implemented. Applications must specify the mechanisms that the applicant intends to use to promote the hands-on exchange of expertise and peer consultation. These mechanisms could include but are not limited to sabbaticals, conferences, partial placement, on-site job placement, intergovernmental transfers, and other innovative techniques. Applicants should bear in mind that in order to accomodate both the needs of States receiving peer consultation and of those providing peer consultation, multiple approaches or mechanisms will most likely be needed. In justifying their proposed courses of action, applicants should also demonstrate how these activities are designed to maximize the funds available to accomplish the stated goals. AoA expects to fund one capacity-building/mentoring program in home and community based care with a federal share of approximately $300,000 per year for three years. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is October 7, 1994. Any public or private non-profit agency or organization is eligible to apply. However, the applicant must have extensive knowledge of home and community-based care systems and the ability to identify key capacity-building needs regarding state infrastructure, to select and recruit exemplary State and Area Agency on Aging staff to provide peer consultation, to match States with the appropriate peer consultants, and to coordinate all arrangements. The applicant selected will be awarded a Cooperative Agreement for a three-year project period. AoA and the organization/institution selected will work cooperatively to design and implement the capacity-building/mentoring project. Each year AoA and the grantee will negotiate a scope of work with relevant time tables and objectives. The project shall have a director with an appropriate background and qualifications relevant to aging and disability, long term care, systems development, and policy studies who shall devote a minimum of 50% of his/her time to this position. 1.3 Aging and Disability: Models for Coordinated Service Systems The ongoing debate about health care reform, long term care and disability are clear indicators of the need for the aging, disability and rehabilitation communities to work more closely together. The Administration on Aging seeks proposals from State and Area Agencies on Aging, State agencies serving the disabled, Tribal organizations, and national organizations and providers to examine the issues and establish models relating to the coordination of services for the frail elderly and the disabled, a promising recent development in several state systems. Over the past few years, the Administration on Aging has established working relationships with organizations such as the Administration on Developmental Disabilities and the National Institute for Disability and Rehabilitation Research of the Department of Education to better serve older adults with disabilities and their families. This priority area will extend these ties to the grass roots, state and local levels. A recent analysis of information from State Agencies on Aging indicates that at least eighteen State Aging Agencies have some policy or program management responsibility for the disabled. The Administration on Aging wishes to further explore potential opportunities for interaction, coordination and joint partnerships between the aging network and the disability community. Proposals submitted under this priority area relate to the development of a coordinated service system. Proposals must include evidence of collaboration between the aging community and network of organizations serving the disabled. Joint applications may be submitted. Coordinated Service Systems There seems to be a fairly common assumption that specific programs for the disabled and the elderly, which were established under separate legislation, are quite different from each other even though the policy objectives for the two target groups have some similarities. Programs for the elderly promote maximum independence through access to a comprehensive, community based service delivery system. Programs for the disabled place high value on enhancing personal autonomy, promoting consumer choice and supporting independence. An examination of the similarities between the two programs raises speculation regarding ``turf'' issues and the legislative mandates regarding advocacy for the two constituent groups. In the interest of making programs more responsive and cost effective, a very different environment exists for strategizing about how to use available resources more effectively. The aging network preference for a ``non-medical'' model of home and community based long term care may raise some concern as to whether clients of the two programs have comparable needs. Some may view programs for the disabled as too closely tied to the medical or health care system. Another factor in this equation is how will an aging disabled population, which benefitted from rehabilitation programs initiated in the 1970s, affect demand for aging services as the disabled grow older.
