Ortega told the rank-and-file it is necessary to restructure from committees within departmental municipalities all the way up to the National Assembly. He said if it is necessary to make changes in the National Directorate to recover the trust of members, it should be done. Ortega added that from now on, the FSLN's work must focus on paving the way to returning to power in the 1996 elections. He said Sandinists cannot allow outsiders who want to take advantage by pretending to be possible candidates because it is very dangerous and the rank-and-file must remain vigilant. Ortega told Sandinists gathered in the [words indistinct] the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua that they should support the transportation strike because the government's economic measures are affecting the cost of living. He said violence should be avoided. He mentioned a communique, which has been attributed to an organization of rearmed individuals who call themselves the armed division of the drivers, and he said that this can be viewed as a provocation. Daniel Ortega categorically rejected the presence of the U.S. DEA in Nicaragua. He said the DEA's actions of interdiction operations against cocaine traffickers violated Nicaragua's sovereignty. In addition, Ortega noted that the DEA's actions are very dangerous because at any moment, there might be up to 20,000 armed men in Nicaragua under the pretext of pursuing drug traffickers. In the case of Juan Pablo Cruz Laguna, Ortega accused the government of Honduran President Rafael Callejas of lying and being an accomplice. Ortega said that when Callejas came to Nicaragua, he already knew who had murdered Cruz Laguna, and Ortega criticized President Chamorro's government for decorating Callejas.
