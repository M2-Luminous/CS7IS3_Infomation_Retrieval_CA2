Once the period of national mourning over Colosio's death has passed, the PRI national directorate will hold a meeting in the next few days to nominate a new candidate for the 21 August presidential elections. According to an unwritten rule in the Mexican political system, the outgoing president, in this case Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has the prerogative of personally choosing or, as it is popularly known, "hand picking" the candidate who will replace him as president. The names of two PRI politicians were mentioned in the beginning from among the possible candidates. The PRI politicians along with four other contenders lost the nomination to Luis Donaldo Colosio on 28 November: former Mexico City Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis and former Education Secretary Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon. The other initial contenders, including Finance Minister Pedro Aspe, may not run for office because the Constitution specifies that a candidate cannot occupy a government post in the six months preceding the elections. Surprisingly, Camacho Solis excluded himself as a possible candidate on Thursday when he emphatically declared that he does not aspire to become president of Mexico after attending the vigil for the assassinated candidate at a mortuary in the Mexican capital. Camacho Solis, former mayor, foreign minister, and current peace commissioner in Chiapas thus reiterated what he said on Tuesday before Colosio's murder when he publicly denied any aspirations as a presidential candidate, thus ending extensive speculation in that regard. Nevertheless, Colosio's unexpected death revived rumors of the subsequent appointment of Camacho Solis as the PRI's substitute candidate. His rivalry with the murdered candidate, however, increased the ruling party members' rejection of the peace commissioner following the murder. Given Camacho Solis' self-exclusion, Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon now appears the most serious contender for the position left open by Colosio. Zedillo was the murdered PRI candidate's campaign manager. Considered a "dark horse" in the PRI convention in November, the 42-year-old Zedillo is known as a brilliant public official who is extremely competent in economic matters. He holds a doctorate from Yale University in the United States. Salinas de Gortari appointed Zedillo programing and budget minister on 1 December 1988, a post at which he successfully transformed the budget deficit into a surplus and substantially increased government social expenditures. After his appointment as education minister in January 1992, Zedillo became the center of a national controversy that forced him to withdraw two new history text books after broad circles rejected the revision of sensitive passages on Mexico's history and present situation. Although Zedillo has a great deal in his favor to be chosen the new PRI candidate, the scarce popularity of this timid, introverted man seems to work against his aspirations. His very discreet public conduct has contributed to the enigma surrounding his personality.
