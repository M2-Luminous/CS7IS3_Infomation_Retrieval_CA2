The troop movements, the largest reported from the area since 1989, appeared to be concentrated around the Tibetan border with India. The Tibetan government-in-exile reported yesterday that 30,000 soldiers in three divisions of the People's Liberation Army had been moved from inland China into Tibet. One division had moved from Lanzhou in Xinjiang and two from Chengdu in Sichuan. The influx would nearly double the normal troop garrison in Tibet, estimated at around 50,000 four years ago. According to the reports, the movement began in late March, matching reports from tourists in Yunnan Province that a large contingent of troops accompanied by helicopters had been seen around April 1 moving towards southern Tibet from Dali in northern Yunnan. Western government sources confirmed that there were large-scale troop movements going on in Tibet. There has been no visible troop activity in the Tibetan capital Lhasa and troop movements appeared to be focused on the sensitive border areas of Drayul and Dromo which face India's northeast frontier in Arunachal Pradesh, according to the government-in-exile. In Lhasa, officials were said to have been compiling lists of military reservists and of people under the age of 40 who have done military service. Procedures at road checkpoints have been tightened and one Tibetan arriving in India said that, from early this month, police checkpoints on the road from Lhasa to the border have been taken over by the military. Increased security controls are expected in China in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square killings on June 4 and to U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision on China's most favoured nation trading privilege in less than five weeks.
