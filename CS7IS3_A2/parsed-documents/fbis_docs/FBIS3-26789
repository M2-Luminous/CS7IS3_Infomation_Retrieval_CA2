Speaking at a UN Security Council session on Bosnia, France Ambassador to the United Nations, Jean-Bernard Merimee, said "the conflict has now reached a turning point, which we should all be aware of." Interpreting the NATO decision on Bosnia adopted on February 9, the ambassador said the decision essentially aimed to have heavy weapons placed under UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) control within 10 days, and "those weapons positions that had not been withdrawn would be subject to air strikes." He said the decision had the sole aim of providing the United Nations with the means of implementing the decisions of the Security Council. The first priority, he said, was to lift the siege of Sarajevo, begin its demilitarization and progress towards placing that city under temporary UN administration. The ambassador said France shared the objective put forward by Russia on placing Sarajevo under UN administration, but that must not interfere with the recent NATO decision. However, he said, his government was fully prepared to support all efforts to achieve peace through negotiations, and "the time has come for us all to come out in favor of peace."
