The Crimean Supreme Soviet is continung its work in Simferopol. Our correspondent Yevgeniy Novikov reports. [Novikov] At the morning session the deputies were addressed by Viktor Mirak, deputy chairman of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. He said that during the night of 19-20 May there was a telephone conversation between [Crimean President] Yuriy Meshkov and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Viktor Mirak said that no mutual understanding was reached during the conversation. Therefore, Yuriy Meshkov asked that the deputies be told that at the session it would be expedient to continue discussion of the question of restoring the 6 May 1992 Crimean Constitution. Meshkov, himself, is not present at the session. According to some reports the Crimean president is on a visit to the Kuban [Russia's Krasnodar region]. After hearing Viktor Mirak's report, the deputies began discussing the question of restoring the Crimean Constitution. The Crimean Tatars group announced that it would not take part in the voting on restoration of the Crimean Constitution, giving as their reasons that this could exacerbate relations with Ukraine. Nevertheless, the 1992 Crimean Constitution was restored by a majority vote. This Constitution declares the Republic of Crimea as an autonomous state constructing its relations with Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements. This decision by the deputies caused a storm of applause from a well-attended rally taking place outside the Crimean Supreme Soviet building. After a break for dinner, the session will continue its work. [Announcer] I would add that a message from Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was read at the session. In the message the head of state demanded that the Crimean deputies should unconditionally implement the provisions of the Ukrainian law on delimitation of powers between the bodies of state power of Ukraine and the Crimean Republic.
