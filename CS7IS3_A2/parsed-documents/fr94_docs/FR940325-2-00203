University Cogeneration, Inc., (31&hyph;904) University Cogeneration, Inc. (``University'') 4464 Alvarado Canyon Road, San Diego, California 92120, has filed an application for an order declaring it not to be an electric utility company under section 2(a)(3) of the Act. University is a California corporation and is primarily engaged in the business of designing, developing, owning, operating and maintaining, either directly or indirectly, industrial energy projects that are qualifying facilities (``QFs'') as defined by the Public Utility Policies Act of 1978. University wholly owns the Chula Vista Cogeneration Project (``Project'') located at Rohr Industries in Chula Vista, California. In addition to owning the Project, University serves as general partner in two California limited partnerships, each of which owns a QF in California. The Project is a 9 megawatt, combined-cycle, gas-fired facility and is currently operated as a QF. Rohr Industries (``Rohr'') serves as the steam host for the Project and purchases approximately 90% of the electric output from the Project. The remainder of the output is sold to the San Diego Gas & Electric Company. It is stated that gross annual sales from the Project were $4,031,852 in 1991, were $3,571,584 in 1992, and will be approximately $2,891,000 in 1993. University states that Rohr, the steam host for the Project, has recently decreased its steam requirements, thereby placing the Project's QF status at risk.
