He also warned him that he cannot "be constantly throwing life belts to a government intent on drowning; there are not enough life belts." Aznar made these statements at the closing session of the Madrid New Generations regional congress, at which he pledged to continue with "the same line of responsibility," although he warned: "My responsibility is also to make it clear that I cannot be devoting myself every day to plugging the leaks of a government which is constantly springing them." The conservative leader said that the government "cannot be criticized for what it does but rather for what it does not do," because since the elections it has done nothing. "I regret that, following the general strike, the government has no appraisal, is not appraising this, accepts no responsibility, and is saying nothing." "Gonzalez has evaded his responsibility for too long, like [Deputy Prime Minister] Serra or the economy minister, who is as if he did not exist; I believe that he has taken a decision not to exist politically," Aznar said. The People's Party chairman pointed out again Felipe Gonzalez' inability to reach a social pact, when he has always presented this as a prerequisite for beginning the country's economic recovery. Disappointment In the People's Party chairman's opinion, "the government's inaction since the last general election is causing among the public a deep feeling of disappointment and dejection which makes pressing and necessary the change proposed by the People's Party, a view which more Spanish people are approaching each day." In view of this situation, he asserted that the People's Party will continue with its policy of dialogue and consensus with all the economic agents, because the best solution for the country is a major agreement in order to pull through. "Let everybody forgo what he must forgo in Spain's interest -- both the employers' organization and trade unions," Aznar asked. "Emerging from the crisis," he added, "requires everybody's efforts and all Spanish people's responsibility, but never from a partisan viewpoint but by regarding this as the major national task remaining to be performed by us." In the People's Party chairman's opinion, "it is absurd, and from the viewpoint of our international image, grotesque, that those who voted for Felipe Gonzalez in June should be staging a general strike six months later." He warned that the People's Party will continue with its responsible policy, because the solution is not to play more or less rough but to offer a path of hope to the majority of Spanish people, who are very disappointed. "I prefer to give the Spanish people hope, rather than a dissatisfying, merely critical exercise," he said. He also had a message for the Catalan and Basque nationalists, whom he told that "there is no territorial interest which deserves to be defended at the cost of Spain's general interest." Aznar wound up his speech at the closing session of the Madrid New Generations congress by warning that the day of political change is near, but he pointed out that that day will not be a mere change of ruling party but a national task of Spain's recovery which transcends the People's Party and requires not a party but a national effort. People's Party Blueprint He reiterated that the People's Party blueprint is the only solution "for the economic, social, and ethical transformation of Spanish society." Last, he exhorted young people to take part increasingly actively in that task of change, because "in the rising generation lies the driving force to promote a new outlook in the country's leaders and citizens." The meeting was also attended by Mayor of Madrid Jose Maria Alvarez del Manzano, who called on the People's Party youth in this autonomous community to work diligently and demandingly and to do everything possible to ensure that the People's Party leader becomes prime minister, "because he deserves it."
