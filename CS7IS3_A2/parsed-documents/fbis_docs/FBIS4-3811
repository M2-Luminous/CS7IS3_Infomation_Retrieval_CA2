A general meeting of personnel of these two work teams was held today, during which Vice Premier Zou Jiahua made a mobilization speech. He said: The current economic situation in China is generally good, with the national economy maintaining rapid and sustained growth momentum. However, a number of contradictions and problems remain in the economic life, and the most prominent one is the excessive rise of market prices and escalating inflationary pressures. The causes of inflation and price rises are many. An overextended scale and chaotic management of investments in fixed assets and failure to exercise macroeconomic control and regulation over market prices following the lifting of price control are two very important factors. To step up the effort to solve problems existing in the investment of fixed assets and in price control is a top priority task for curbing inflation and checking excessive price rises. He said: The purpose of organizing the two work teams to conduct general price and investment inspections in various localities is to help them more effectively and comprehensively implement the principles, policies, and measures formulated by the party Central Committee and the State Council. To ensure the success of the inspections is of great importance for implementing the central authorities' guidelines on the overall interests of this year's work, and for the accomplishment of the various tasks in reform, opening up, and economic development. Outlining the requirements for the general inspections, the vice premier pointed out: Attention must be paid to the key areas as well as inspection in general in both prices and fixed asset investments. In order to obtain a thorough grasp of the situation, it is necessary to conduct comprehensive checks in line with the guidelines and requirements of the State Council's relevant documents. The key areas of the general price inspection are, first of all, wanton price hikes and frauds against customers on basic daily necessities, grain and edible oil in particular; second, activities of monopolizing various trades to drive up prices and to obtain staggering profits from major capital goods such as rolled steel, electricity, coal, petroleum, and chemical fertilizers; and third, unauthorized increases in public utility and service charges and collection of fees without authorization. The general investment inspection should be focused on strictly controlling newly launched projects. Meanwhile, attention must be focused on the source of funds for construction and on concentrating funds to ensure key projects, including screening and inventory of projects under construction as well as progress in suspending and postponing projects; on the availability of funds for key construction; and on the sources of self-collected funds and whether such sources are legitimate. He said: In conducting general inspections, the work teams should go down to the grass roots to analyze typical cases, obtain firsthand information, and solve deep-level problems. They should reflect on things as they really are without covering up or hiding contradictions and problems. They should perform duties honestly, seek no personal privileges, and observe party and state discipline. They should set a good example in fighting corruption and promoting clean government, and should work concertedly to ensure the success of inspection. The State Council has instructed the State Planning Commission to work together with the relevant departments in conducting the general inspections. It is understood that the leading group on general price inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning Commission; deputy leader Luo Zhiling, vice minister in charge of the planning commission; and members who are senior officials from the planning commission, the Ministries of Supervision and Finance, the People's Bank, and the taxation, auditing, industry and commerce administration, and technology supervision departments. The leading group on the investment inspection consists of leader Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the planning commission; deputy leader Guo Shuyan, vice minister in charge of the planning commission; and members who are senior officials of the planning commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank, the Ministry of Supervision, the National Development Bank, and the State Statistics Bureau.
