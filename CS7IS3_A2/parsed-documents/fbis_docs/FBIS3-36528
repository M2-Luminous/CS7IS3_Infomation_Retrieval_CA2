Latvia lacks money to build and arm its company in the projected Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion and begin a higher-level cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance. Currently, it is important to clear out which countries would like to cooperate with Latvia to tackle the mentioned problems, Miodle said. This work could be done by a Latvian permanent envoy to NATO. Real cooperation is even more important than simply assistance, Miodle noted. The cooperation should be oriented toward Latvia's eventual NATO membership. Commenting on the Brussels visit, Miodle said NATO officers primarily wanted to know what Latvia concretely expected from Partnership for Peace and how realistic were declarations by Latvian leaders on their country's intention to join the program. The Latvian Defense Ministry delegation toured Brussels Feb. 2-3 at an invitation by NATO. During the trip, the group visited NATO, NATO Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in Europe and the North Atlantic Assembly.
