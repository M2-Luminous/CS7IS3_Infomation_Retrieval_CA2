Topal by S. Fedorova; place and date not given: "The `Gagauz Budget' Could Be Called Regional"] [Text] The election campaign in the republic has introduced disagreements to the South, previously united in its positions. The decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy District Soviet to participate in the elections for a new Parliament of Moldova has evoked an angry response in the administration of the region. The local soviets were dissolved in connection with this document. The Supreme Soviet of the region, however, whose position coincides with the policy of its leadership, has been preserved. Nonetheless, there has been movement in the dialogue between Komrat and Chisinau. It is the economy that is prompting this primarily. The Bujak steppe, whose main income was and remains agriculture, under the conditions of isolation has been condemned to quite a meager existence. It is the understanding of this that is the basis of the decision of the Chadyr-Lungskiy deputies. Our interview with Stepan Topal, chief of the administration of the region, deals with the new situation in the southern districts and the progress of the dialogue with Chisinau. [Fedorova] If it is no secret, the essence of your last meeting with Moldovan President M. Snegur. On whose initiative did it take place, incidentally? [Topal] It dealt with a settlement of relations concerning the budget. A year ago we raised the question of the region's own budget and payments into the republic coffers. Unfortunately, the Ministry of Finance did not settle this problem. We then independently voted our own budget in the Parliament. Payments to Moldova's coffers have been made punctiliously. We understand that payments for health care and the defense of the state, since we are a part of it, and so forth are necessary. A year has passed, we have come to think differently; there has been some change in this respect in Chisinau also, and there is hope that we can come to some arrangement. This, therefore, was followed by the proposal that the two parties sit down and talk out the current problems. The response, though, was as follows: Your budget is illegal. But a fact is fact, and we have been in existence for three years now. If you do not like the wording "Gagauz budget," you can call it a regional budget. We want monies for our own needs to stay here in the region. [Fedorova] Are you encountering what is being called a financial blockade of the southern areas? [Topal] I would speak, rather, about an economic blockade. What is meant by this? Agreements between the Government of Moldova and our farms on the supply of agricultural products (grain, milk, meat, tobacco, sunflower seed, and so forth) were signed at the start of the year. In exchange the appropriate departments undertook to supply us with energy resources. We are fulfilling the government order, but we have received only 50-60 percent of the promised fuel. As a result 10,000 hectares have gone unplowed. [Fedorova] Considering the situation in Chadyr-Lunga, can it be said that the opinion of the Gagauz in respect to the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Moldova is unequivocal? [Topal] The leadership's decision is unequivocal. There is the decision of the Parliament on nonparticipation in the elections prior to the Moldovan leadership's settlement of the Gagauz issue. We held rallies in the villages of Chadyr-Lungskiy District, and they confirmed our decision. [Fedorova] But the district soviet went on record with a different decision, nonetheless.... [Topal] Half the deputies of the district soviet are Bulgarians. Their position is different from ours. But we believe that they are wrong in deciding for the Gagauz in this instance. This was the reason for the subsequent edict on the dissolution of the local soviets. [Fedorova] In counting on continuing the dialogue with Chisinau, what will Komrat defend? Can it agree to a culturally autonomous formation and the relative economic independence of the region, toward which, generally, current realities are pushing it? [Topal] We will talk about a federation for we need some political guarantees in the future. Life is no worse for European countries formed according to this principle. [Fedorova] Nonetheless, some things are changing. The retransfer of the Bujak battalion to the command of the Moldovan Ministry of Internal Affairs points to this. Gagauz guardsmen will now, as far as we know, be called carabinieri.... [Topal] This decision was connected with the need to somehow legitimize the armed formations, and to socially protect the officers. The carabinieri will be formed from local inhabitants, and the candidates for brigade commander will be recommended by us and approved in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moldova. This formation will uphold public order. [Fedorova] Who will finance it? [Topal] The local budget. [Fedorova] The local police operate according to the same principle: They are composed mainly of Gagauz, but come under the jurisdiction of the district department of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs. [Topal] Yes, the principle of dual subordination will operate. [Fedorova] You recently returned from Turkey, but were, I believe, heading for America.... [Topal] The purpose of the trip had, indeed, been the United States, to which I had been invited to an assembly of Turkic peoples. Chisinau would not draw up a visa for America so I went to Istanbul, hoping to get one there. But here I had to change my plans since it was explained to me that putting together the requisite papers takes quite some time. After several meetings with our students in Turkey and members of the Turkish Parliament and also with the Red Crescent mission, therefore, I came home. [Fedorova] Does the Red Crescent mission mean possible humanitarian assistance? [Topal] Yes. We received such in the spring. They promise further assistance. [Fedorova] Are there any investments of Turkish entrepreneurs in the Bujak steppe? We were counting on this here a year ago even.... [Topal] Not as yet. Unless we count several private bakeries built in Komrat, Chadyr-Lunga, and Vulkaneshty. But there has been cultural assistance. Our students are being taught in Turkey, and their grants are being paid by the Turkish Government. We are being helped with literature and textbooks. [Fedorova] Is this assistance being rendered on the basis of the intergovernmental Moldovan-Turkish agreements? [Topal] Yes. [Fedorova] At what level is Komrat in contact with Chisinau? [Topal] Vice Premier Oliynik and the ministers of internal affairs and security have been here. Although there are no planned negotiations, there have been meetings with the top leadership. Very soon there will be a meeting with M. Snegur, I believe. We have proposed it.
