ACTION: Decision concerning petition for reconsideration. SUMMARY: On June 3, 1992, EPA issued a final rule revising 40 CFR part 61, subpart R, the National Emission Standard for Radon Emissions From Phosphogypsum Stacks (57 FR 23305, June 3, 1992). The Fertilizer Institute (TFI) filed a petition seeking reconsideration of the 1992 rule pursuant to Clean Air Act section 307(d)(7)(B). This notice sets forth the Agency's decision concerning the TFI reconsideration petition. EPA has decided to partially grant and to partially deny the TFI petition for reconsideration. EPA will reconsider 40 CFR 61.205, the provision of the final rule which governs distribution and use of phosphogypsum for research and development, and the formula in 40 CFR 61.207(d). EPA will publish a separate Federal Register notice convening a proceeding to reconsider these provisions shortly. EPA is denying the remainder of the TFI petition. In this notice, EPA summarizes the principal remaining objections by TFI. EPA also explains why these objections are not of central relevance to the outcome of the rule and therefore do not constitute a basis for reconsideration.
