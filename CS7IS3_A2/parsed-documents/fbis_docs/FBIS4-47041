No more than 10-12 percent of these engage in production. The rest conduct commercial activity or exist purely on paper--so that they can be "on hand" in case the tax climate in Russia warms up. Under the current conditions foreign investors do not see any point in creating any productions of any kind in St. Petersburg. Promises from the federal government to grant exemptions to enterprises in which foreign capital participates have not been kept. But the number of joint ventures, including of a production profile, is growing. For example, a joint venture has been created for construction of a plant for producing mini-electric power plants and a plant for producing cigarettes under licenses. They will begin to work if the tax burden is lightened. At the same time it is expected that there will be a reduction of the activity and possibly the elimination of a number of joint ventures of a trade profile engaging in the delivery of imported food. The new customs payments introduced effective 1 July (announced in the spring) will make food deliveries disadvantageous since even the least expensive foreign products, taking customs payments into account, will be priced too high for the city's rank-and-file residents.
