In his opinion, other reasons for this suspension would include the fact that Chisinau is preoccupied with the settlement of the Gagauz problem and that the results of the presidential elections in the Ukraine are awaited. Litskai declared that Moldova speculates on Dniester's financial difficulties. Dniester cannot obtain from Russia the coupons printed there, thus causing an acute crisis of cash. According to him, Russia declared that it would send the coupons to Tiraspol when an agreement between Chisinau and Dniester leaders is signed. Litskai pointed out that the Tiraspol leadership insisted for three weeks that Snegur meet Smirnov, but it received no answer. He said that nevertheless, the prospects of settling the conflict are favorable and gave as example the signing of an agreement between Russia and Tatarstan. According to him, the contribution of Russian and CSCE mission mediators to the settlement of the conflict has been substantial and constructive. Nevertheless, Moldova will be a potential enemy for Dniester, as it fortifies its armed forces and refuses to demilitarize, stated Litskai.
