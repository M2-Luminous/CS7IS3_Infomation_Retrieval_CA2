The two countries, however, are likely to agree on Japanese Government procurement and insurance industry reforms by the time Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Bill Clinton meet in Naples, they said. The two state leaders are scheduled to meet in Naples for the annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial nations which is to be held July 8-10. "Japan wants to make further efforts and create a better atmosphere by then to make the U.S. side feel hopeful in concluding the automotive negotiations in September," the sources said. As for Japan's macroeconomic policies, another focal point in the series of talks to create a new framework for bilateral trade, the sources said negotiations look likely to take more time. They added, however, Japan will accelerate its efforts to bring in line domestic opinions on such macroeconomic aspects as tax reforms and increasing public works investment, with one source saying Hata needs to show Japan's basic plan to Clinton.
