FR940810-2-00132 FR940810-2-00077 3. On an ongoing basis, the directors of the Funds, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor each Fund for the existence of any material conflicts among the interests of the classes of shares. The directors, including a majority of the independent directors, will take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The Adviser and the Distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the directors. If a conflict arises, the Adviser or the Distributor, each at its own cost, will remedy such conflict up to and including establishing a new registered management investment company. 4. The Shareholder Service Plans will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders need not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule 12b&hyph;1. 5. The directors will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the directors to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. 6. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be paid in the same amount, except that Plan Payments and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by that class. 7. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes have been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert''). The Expert has rendered a report to applicants, filed with this application as Exhibit C, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the applicants that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following a request by the Funds (which the Funds agree to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff, upon the written request for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on the policies and procedures placed in operation,'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 7 above, and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7 above. Applicants agree to take immediate corrective action if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.
