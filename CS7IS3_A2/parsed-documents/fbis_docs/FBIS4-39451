As was especially stressed recently at hearings of the U.S. Congress, only about 200 million dollars have been used of the 3.2 billion dollars that were allocated to us since 1985 specifically for economic and technical aid. If we focus on Russia, that figure is 140 to 150 million dollars. The scheme by which this money comes to us in Russia and to other countries of the former Soviet Union is fairly simple: the AID. The agency will earmark credits; to be more exact, it will give grants to appropriate U.S. firms. The latter will send their specialists and consultants here, who work with our organizations, departments, individual enterprises, lawyers, and other people. In particular, a considerable bulk of such grants and credits has been sent to us as aid to develop our voucher privatization. The interesting thing is that, since most of this money is paid to U.S. firms, consultants, specialists, and technicians, it means that the money, in fact, remains in the United States. Say a consulting firm or some specialists arrive in Moscow or in another town of Russia. Incidentally, they have enormous perks and privileges since they have astronomic daily allowances by our standards. They will stay in a luxury hotel, paying 200 or 300 dollars a night. They arrive on a first class or business class flight. In other words, the main bulk of the money--or a considerable proportion of the money allocated to us--stays in their pockets and is spent in these nonproduction areas. The U.S. State Department recently evaluated the first privatization period in our country. It noted our successes and failures. It also noted where we have reserves [rezervy]. I would like to draw your attention to one particular shortcoming that was stressed by the State Department. From its point of view, too many shares of privatized enterprises remain in the hands of the workers and managers of these enterprises. Why is this bad? Because the workers and managers of these enterprises have no capacity any longer to improve production. They will primarily take care of themselves and will not resort to measures such as mass layoffs. Naturally, they will spare no effort to preserve their jobs and to ensure bearable living standards for themselves. The second stage of privatization is going on now. As far as I understand it, the agency has already earmarked some credits and grants to U.S. consulting firms, including Price Waterhouse. These companies are already busy trying to accomplish what has not been accomplished during the first stage. What is now left for us to do is to wait until the State Department takes stock of this stage and tell us what we did well and what we did badly. I think, however, that we will be able to see this for ourselves quite soon.
