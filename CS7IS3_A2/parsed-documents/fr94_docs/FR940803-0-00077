FR940803-0-00077 FR940803-0-00023 33 CFR Part 160 [CGD 94&hyph;027] RIN 2115&hyph;AE82 Notice of Hazardous Conditions AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is amending the rule that requires notice of hazardous conditions. The amended rule will clarify the conditions requiring notice and the parties responsible for providing notice; it will eliminate any confusion that might exist in determining whether a particular incident is reportable and, if so, by whom. It should forestall another disaster such as the derailment of a passenger train near Mobile, Alabama, in September 1993. DATES: This rule is effective on August 3, 1994. Comments must be received on or before December 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to the Executive Secretary, Marine Safety Council (G&hyph;LRA, 3406) [CGD 94&hyph;027], U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC 20593&hyph;0001, or may be delivered to room 3406 at the same address between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. The telephone number is (202) 267&hyph;1477. The Executive Secretary maintains the public docket for this rulemaking. Comments will become part of this docket and will be available for inspection or copying at room 3406, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lieutenant John P. Sifling, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G&hyph;MPS&hyph;3), (202) 267&hyph;0491, between 7 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Request for Comments The Coast Guard encourages interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written data, views, or arguments. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identify this rulemaking [CGD 94&hyph;027] and the specific section of this interim rule to which each comment applies, and give the reason for each comment. Please submit two copies of all comments and attachments in an unbound format, no larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, suitable for copying and electronic filing. Persons wanting acknowledgment of receipt of comments should enclose stamped, self-addressed postcards or envelopes. The Coast Guard will consider all comments received during the comment period. It may change this rule in view of the comments. The Coast Guard plans no public hearing. Persons may request a public hearing by writing to the Marine Safety Council at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'' The request should include the reasons why a hearing would be beneficial. If it determines that the opportunity for oral presentations will aid this rulemaking, the Coast Guard will hold a hearing at a time and place announced by a later notice in the Federal Register . Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Lieutenant John P. Sifling, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, and Mr. Patrick J. Murray, Project Counsel, Office of the Chief Counsel. Regulatory Information This rule is being published as an interim rule and is being made effective on the date of publication. The Coast Guard has determined that it would be contrary to the public interest to delay publication of this amendment, which clarifies existing law, imposes no new regulatory requirements, and involves no significant change in policy. For these good reasons, the Coast Guard finds, under 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(3) and (d)(3), that both notice and public hearing on the notice, before the effective date of this rule, are unnecessary and that this rule should be made effective less than 30 days after publication. Background and Purpose The derailment of the Amtrak Sunset Limited, a passenger train, on September 22, 1993, with extensive injury and loss of life, resulted in a study by the Coast Guard entitled Review of Marine Safety Issues Related to Uninspected Towing Vessels . This study, conducted jointly by the Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services (G&hyph;N) and the Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection (G&hyph;M), provided the Commandant of the Coast Guard with a number of recommendations to enhance safety in the towboat industry. (Persons may review this study at the office of the Marine Safety Council at the address under ``ADDRESSES.'') One of these recommendations called for ``a regulatory project to amend 33 CFR 160.215 to clearly indicate that the required notice of a hazardous condition includes a hazardous condition caused by a vessel or its operation even when the hazardous condition is not on board the vessel.'' The Commandant concurred, and directed the Division of Port Safety and Security (G&hyph;MPS), Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, to initiate the recommended regulatory project. On March 2, 1994, the Coast Guard announced [59 FR 10031] a public meeting to help guide the project. On April 4, 1994, the meeting occurred. Discussion of Rule This interim rule amends the existing rule in one editorial and three substantive ways. First, it revises 33 CFR 160.203, Definitions, to redefine ``hazardous condition.'' Second, it revises 33 CFR 160.215, Notice of hazardous conditions, by including among reporting-criteria for hazardous conditions, along with any such condition actually aboard a vessel, any caused by the operation of a vessel. Although current §160.203 defines such a condition as any ``that could adversely affect the safety of any vessel, bridge, structure, or shore area *␣*␣*'', the Coast Guard suspects potential for confusion regarding the responsibility for giving notice under certain circumstances. This confusion might arise from current §160.215 itself, which prescribes notice only ``whenever there is a hazardous condition on board a vessel [emphasis added].'' The Coast Guard is concerned that owners, masters, agents, or persons in charge (or, from now on [see below], operators) might misinterpret this to cover such a condition aboard a vessel and yet not one that adversely affects, as the definition specifies, the safety of other vessels, bridges, structures, or shore areas, or the environmental quality of ports, harbors, and navigable waters of the United States. Third, this rule adds the term ``operator'' to the list of those responsible for giving notice. Often, a vessel is owned by one company but operated by another. An operator must bear responsibility for the action of its employees_particularly with regard to foreign vessels, where the master and crew are not licensed in the United States. Making ``operator'' explicit will clarify the operator's responsibility for giving notice of hazardous conditions. Fourth, this rule supplies a parenthetical cross-reference to the requirement of a less-urgent but more-detailed written report whenever the hazardous conditions involves a ``marine casualty'' within the meaning of 46 CFR part 4. Regulatory Evaluation This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11040 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This finding rests on the determination that this rule clarifies an existing requirement and does not place any new requirement on the public.
