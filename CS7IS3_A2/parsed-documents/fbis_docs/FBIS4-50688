Zhou Yongshun, deputy political commissar of the Xinjiang Military District, chaired the meeting. Fu Bingyue, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, read the Lanzhou Military Region's order that conferred the title of "Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction" on the Fourth Company of the certain regiment. The Fourth Company of the certain regiment, established during the war of resistance against Japan, is a military unit with a glorious history and fine traditions. During the competition of military techniques held by the Xinjiang Military District in 1964, it won gold medals in contests of all the five major military techniques at evening training sessions, including a 100-percent mark for outstanding shooting performance at night. It was known as the "Nocturnal Tiger Company." Under a new historic period, it has carried forward our army's glorious traditions; has earnestly implemented President Jiang Zemin's general requirements that "all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily. They must have a fine style of work, maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support"; has conscientiously pursued the "Program on Developing Military Grass-Roots Units"; and has accomplished remarkable results in building the company in an all-around manner. In the past six consecutive years since 1988, the company has been commended as an advanced unit and advanced company that fulfilled its requirements; and has won a collective's third-class meritorious award in the past consecutive six years and a collective's second-class meritorious award in one year. In 1992, the Xinjiang Military District named the company as a "Pacesetting Company in Grass-Roots Construction." Pan Zhaomin, deputy political commissar of the Lanzhou Military Region and political commissar of the Xinjiang Military District, attended and spoke at the meeting. He urged all Xinjiang military units to launch extensive campaigns to comprehensively learn from the Fourth Company so that more heroic collectives similar to the Fourth Company will appear in Xinjiang's military units. At the meeting, Fang Denghua, deputy commander of the Xinjiang Military District, read the Xinjiang Military District party committee's "decision on launching campaigns to learn from the `Model Company in Grass-Roots Construction'."
