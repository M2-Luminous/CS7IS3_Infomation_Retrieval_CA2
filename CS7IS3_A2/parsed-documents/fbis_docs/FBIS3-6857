Gen Wimon was apparently upset about Gen Chawalit's remark on Friday that another military coup d'etat cannot be ruled out. Asked about conflicts between the Senate and the Lower House of Parliament over proposed charter amendments, Gen Chawalit said that soldiers would be first to come out if they felt the country is threatened. However, he denied having said this the next day. Speaking at Don Muang Airport on his return from India, Gen Wimon said that people should not take any notice of what Gen Chawalit says. He said Gen Chawalit is afraid of his own shadow and tends to have nightmares. Deputy House Speaker Thawin Phraison said he is optimistic that Thai soldiers will not stage another coup, because if they did the country would greatly suffer. Mr Thawin, who is a Phalang Tham Party (PDP) executive, said he was "stunned" by Gen Chawalit's remark, which was also heavily attacked yesterday by a meeting of about 200 Confederation for Democracy (CFD) members from across the country in Bangkok. Key CFD members said Gen Chawalit should make more constructive comments. Somsak Kosaisuk, a CFD leader, said Gen Chawalit should not have made such an ambiguous remark. "I don't think soldiers will (stage another coup), because they are patriotic. "They would not do something that would damage the country, and even if they did, they would be opposed by all democracy-loving organisations," he claimed. Dr San Hatthirat said there should be no more coups because military leaders have shown a clear commitment to democracy. The best way of preventing a coup is government decentralisation, he added. Dr Weng Tochirakan said that although Gen Chawalit has the right to make such remarks, he should be more helpful. "I think that no matter how bad a problem is, it should be solved through democratic means. Nobody should talk about a coup carelessly. "If there is another coup, people all over the country would oppose it. Thailand's past coups have done enough damage to the country. There should be no more," he said. Gen Chawalit was army chief prior to joining the Chatchai Chunhawan government briefly as deputy prime minister. [passage omitted]
