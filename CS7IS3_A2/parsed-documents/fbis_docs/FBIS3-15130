In the Finance Ministry's estimate, by the end of the year the budget deficit will go down to 10.2% of the gross domestic product. The federal budget's revenues will be 7 times greater than last year, the basic sources of revenues being taxes, whose share in the gross domestic product will amount to 12.7% compared to 10.3% in 1993. Hard-currency revenues and foreign-trade payments are estimated at $6.1 Bn [Billion]. The basic sources of hard-currency revenue are export and import duties and income gained from the centralized credit. Spending is estimated at 25.1% of the gross domestic product, compared to 21.0% in 1993. Financial support for the territories will represent the biggest spending item (13.4%). The growing financial support for the territories is due to a new system of relations between the federal budget and the budgets of Russia's constituent members. Expenditures for the repayment and servicing of the state debt will also increase to 10.5%. The share of defense spending will practically not change -- 37126.0 Bn rubles (20.4% of total expenditures). Spending on social, cultural and research programs will amount to 2.2% of the gross domestic product. Compared to 1993, the federal spending on social and research programs will increase 3.6 times. The report also contains the main indices for 1993. Last year's spending stood at 34.1 Tn rubles (75.1% of the adjusted budget). By January 1, 1994 the state budget deficit amounted to 17 Tn rubles (10.5% of the gross domestic product). The deficit was covered at the expense of the gold and hard-currency reserve (5.1 Tn rubles). Due to nonpayment of taxes and other payments to the state, the spending items had to be reduced by 8.5 Tn rubles. The report says that for the first time in many years there was a growth of the population's real incomes. The average income grew about 11 times while prices rose 9.4 times. This is proved by the wage and salary increases in dollar terms. The average salary grew 3 times and stands at about $100.
