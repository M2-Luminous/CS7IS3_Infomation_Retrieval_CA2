Antonio Rios made this statement, noting that the CTV will maintain this position as long as the measure helps combat speculation. Rios disclosed that he will deliver to the president a document containing the conclusions reached by the CTV after an assessment of the country's political, economic, and social situation, specifically in light of the workers. In this regard, Rios noted that the document includes several recommendations made by the CTV in the face of the crisis. The recommendations include fighting inflation, better public services, the guarantee of a comprehensive social security system, and the creation and protection of jobs --jobs that should be the key issue in the permanent dialogue among the government, management, and organized labor. [Begin Rios recording] We feel that the suspension of guarantees is good for workers and the people because they do not have to worry about speculation or an increase in the inflation rate because the government had to utilize its resources to cover the deficit. These deficits are being created while the government solves problems such as those presented by Banco Latino or other banks that might require its attention. [end recording] In terms of the CTV stand on an increase in the minimum wage, Rios reiterated that it should be closely linked to the prices of the basic food basket.
