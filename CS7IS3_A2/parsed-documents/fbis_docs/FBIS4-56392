UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali expressed "great interest" in the Brazilian cooperation. The Itamaraty and the Armed Forces General Staff are analyzing the request. Brazil will probably prefer to concentrate its help to the United Nations in Angola where it has more interest in the field of foreign policy and trade. The Brazilian battalion will probably have three infantry companies and one mechanized company to transport the troops. In the last few days, the Argentine Government consulted its Brazilian counterpart about the possibility that the two countries jointly offer a naval unit comprised of three patrol ships to the United Nations. According to an Itamaraty source, the presence of the Brazilian battalion in Angola would be important "to advance the peace process in Angola as well as to confirm Brazil's contribution to preservation of international peace and security." The United Nations has great interest in Brazilian cooperation in Angola, particularly because the two countries share a common language.
