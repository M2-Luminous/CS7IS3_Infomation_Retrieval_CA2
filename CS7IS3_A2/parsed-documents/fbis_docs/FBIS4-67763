It has been learned that a Japan-proposed plutonium research project to be undertaken at the ISTC remains shelved after the United States opposed it. The United States is believed to have opposed the project with the aim of keeping both Japan and Russia from engaging in plutonium research; the U.S. opposition is likely to cause a problem for Japan which has promoted the plutonium research project under an international framework. The Japan-proposed project is composed of two research areas: the development of a new-type fast breeder reactor which uses lead instead of sodium as a coolant, and research on group separation of radioactive waste. Japan has proposed promoting the plutonium research project in response to Russian hopes; the Japan Atomic Power Research Institute and other Japanese research institutes are to cooperate with the project. The ISTC held its first session of the Board of Governors from 17 to 18 March in Moscow. The U.S. Government notified the Japanese Government just prior to the session that "it objects to any project to promote Russia's use of plutonium." As reasons for objecting to the project, the U.S. Government is said to have cited: (1) its concern over Russia's lax management of nuclear materials; and (2) the inconsistency of the Japan-proposed plutonium research project with the U.S. policy of pursing nuclear nonproliferation. In response, the Japanese Government has notified the U.S. Government: "Given the objective of establishing the ISTC to prevent Russian scientists and engineers in charge of handling plutonium from emigrating, it is inappropriate not to undertake plutonium-related research projects." The first session of the Board of Governors held in March did not take up the Japan-proposed plutonium research project for discussion, and withheld adopting other research projects in question. However, the first session decided to undertake 23 research projects unrelated to plutonium. The cost of those research projects is estimated at approximately $12 million. The next session of the Board of Governors scheduled for June is set to adopt additional research projects; the Japanese Government plans to consult with the U.S. Government about the bilateral dispute over the Japan-proposed plutonium research project. Some government officials take the view that Japan will have to conduct a partial review of the plutonium research project to ensure its smooth undertaking.
