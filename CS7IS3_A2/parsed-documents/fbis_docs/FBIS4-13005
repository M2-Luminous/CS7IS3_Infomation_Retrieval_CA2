Satellite receivers went up on rooftops of Tehran and other big cities with amazing speed in the last two years. The use of these dishes, in and of itself, does not constitute a reprehensible act, and can even be considered useful in disseminating news and information on a global level. The disturbing aspect of this mass communications device, however, is that it is being used by the West to gradually and subtly dilute non-Western cultures and change the prevailing social, political, and cultural standards of the Third World. The controversy is not confined only to Western and non-Western countries. Europe is up in arms against American films and television programs that have saturated the European screens and air waves. France is considering putting a limit on showing U.S.-made films and programs on French television, following the failure of American distributors to voluntarily cut down their imports to Europe. The Islamic Republic is justifiably concerned with the possible negative effects of this phenomenon and is currently debating the best way to counter it. Other Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, have already decided to ban satellite dishes. But the cultural invasion problem will not be resolved by the physical removal of satellite receivers, because smaller and more powerful satellite antennae are being built and it would be next to impossible to detect them short of searching every household in the country. Officials charged with the task of finding the solution to this problem should first find out when the new and undetectable satellite dishes will reach our markets. If it takes more than three or four years, then passing legislation banning the device may work for at least a few years in keeping unwanted programs from entering our households. But if it turns out that the arrival of small antennae in our market is only a matter of a few months, then the physical removal of the existing dishes will serve only to destabilize the society and will contribute to a general feeling of uncertainty among the law abiding citizens of the Islamic Republic. The long-term and logical way to combat cultural invasion is to improve domestic production of films and radio and television programs, thereby removing the incentive to watch Western products. After successfully averting the West's cultural invasion through producing internationally marketable programs, we can export our religious values, culture, and art through the same medium of communication to the rest of the world. The natural target of Western media moguls who own these global networks are the younger generations of the Third World population. Iran should invest in this same generation by providing them with a proper education which will emphasize the richness and beauty of our culture and Islamic heritage that throughout our history has acted as an antidote to poisonous foreign cultural invasions.
