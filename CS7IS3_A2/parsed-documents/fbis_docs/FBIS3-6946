The country's Muslims and Croats have signed a pact creating a new federation within the former Yugoslav Republic. The Bosnian Serbs, who control 70 percent of Bosnia, refused to be in on the deal. Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans says peace cannot be fully restored without the active participation of the Serbs. Senator Evans said Australia hoped the Serbs would join the Croats and Muslims in concluding a comprehensive agreement to settle the conflict in Bosnia.
