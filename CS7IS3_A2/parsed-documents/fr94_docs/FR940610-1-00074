At a minimum, beginning with School Year 1998&hyph;99, school food authorities shall meet the nutrition standards established in §210.10(a) for reimbursable meals. (i) Beginning with School Year 1998&hyph;99, State agencies shall evaluate compliance with the established nutrition standards over a school week. At a minimum, these evaluations shall be conducted once every 5 years and may be conducted at the same time a school food authority is scheduled for an administrative review in accordance with §210.18. State agencies may also conduct these evaluations in conjunction with technical assistance visits, other reviews, or separately. The State agency shall assess the nutrient analysis for the last completed school week to determine if the school food authority is applying the methodology provided in §210.10 (k) or (l), as appropriate. Part of this assessment shall be an independent review of menus and production records to determine if they correspond to the analysis conducted by the school food authority and if the menu, as offered, over a school week, corresponds to the nutrition standards set forth in §210.10(a). (ii) If the menu for the school week fails to meet any of the nutrition standards set forth in §210.10(a), the school food authority shall develop, with the assistance and concurrence of the State agency, a corrective action plan designed to rectify those deficiencies. The State agency shall monitor the school food authority's execution of the plan to ensure that the terms of the corrective action plan are met. (iii) If a school food authority fails to meet the terms of the corrective action plan, the State agency shall determine if the school food authority is working towards compliance in good faith and, if so, may renegotiate the corrective action plan, if warranted. However, if the school food authority has not been acting in good faith to meet the terms of the corrective action plan and refuses to renegotiate the plan, the State agency shall determine if a disallowance of reimbursement funds as authorized under paragraph (c) of this section is warranted. (2) Assurance of compliance for finances. Each State agency shall ensure that school food authorities comply with the requirements to account for all revenues and expenditures of their nonprofit school food service. School food authorities shall meet the requirements for the allowability of nonprofit school food service expenditures in accordance with this part and, as applicable, 7 CFR part 3015. The State agency shall ensure compliance with the requirements to limit net cash resources and shall provide for approval of net cash resources in excess of three months' average expenditures. Each State agency shall monitor, through review or audit or by other means, the net cash resources of the nonprofit school food service in each school food authority participating in the Program. In the event that net cash resources exceed 3 months' average expenditures for the school food authority's nonprofit school food service or such other amount as may be approved in accordance with this paragraph, the State agency may require the school food authority to reduce the price children are charged for lunches, improve food quality or take other action designed to improve the nonprofit school food service. In the absence of any such action, the State agency shall make adjustments in the rate of reimbursement under the Program. (3) Improved management practices. *␣*␣* If a substantial number of children who routinely and over a period of time do not favorably accept a particular menu item; return foods; or choose less than all food items/components or foods and menu items as authorized under §210.10(e)(4)(ii) or §210.10a(e), poor acceptance of certain menus may be indicated. * * * * * (c) Fiscal action. *␣*␣* State agencies shall take fiscal action against school food authorities for Claims for Reimbursement that are not properly payable under this part including, if warranted, the disallowance of funds for failure to take corrective action in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. *␣*␣* (1) Definition. *␣*␣* Fiscal action also includes disallowance of funds for failure to take corrective action in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. * * * * *
