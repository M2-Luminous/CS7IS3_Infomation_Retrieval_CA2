The thieves, who fired their weapons at Carabineros officers as they fled, seized 15 million pesos. Eight Lautaro Group members tried to simultaneously hold up two banks on the corner of Suecia and 11 September Streets. However, they only managed to hold up the Santander Bank. The presence of Carabineros on the corner prompted the group planning to hold up the Citibank branch a few meters away to flee. As they fled, the delinquents fired their weapons at a group of policemen travelling in a patrol van. Once again a woman was seen firing a machine gun. [passage omitted]
