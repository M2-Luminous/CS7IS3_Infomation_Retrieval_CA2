ACTION: Extension of comment period; close of record. SUMMARY: The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) recently supplemented the record concerning the notices addressing changes to the Federal respirable dust program for coal mines. The mining community has requested additional time to review this information and to prepare their comments. MSHA is extending the period for the public to submit post-hearing comments on the February 18, 1994, notices which address: (1) The use of single, full-shift respirable dust measurements to determine noncompliance under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program; and (2) the joint finding by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be measured accurately over a single shift. DATES: All comments and information must be submitted on or before November 30, 1994. Commenters are encouraged to send comments on a computer disk with their original comments in hard copy. ADDRESSES: Send comments to MSHA, Office of Standards, Regulations, and Variances, Room 631, 4015 Wilson Boulevard, Arlington, Virginia 22203. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA, (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 1, 1994, (59 FR 38988), MSHA published a notice in the Federal Register extending the time for post-hearing comments on the February 18, 1994, notices (59 FR 8356 and 8357), from August 5, 1994 to September 30, 1994. In that notice, MSHA also stated that based on comments received at the public hearings held in July 1994, (59 FR 29348 and 59 FR 34868), and in response to specific requests, the Agency would supplement the record with additional information.
