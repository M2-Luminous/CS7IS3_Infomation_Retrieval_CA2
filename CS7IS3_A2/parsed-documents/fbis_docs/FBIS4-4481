The stopgap budget, effective the same day, was to be enacted Thursday but approval by the House of Councillors was delayed over opposition demands to summon a witness in connection with stock transactions done in the name of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's father-in-law. The upper house budget committee had deadlocked since Thursday evening after the opposition Liberal Democratic Party demanded that a stock consultant, who has said the stock deal was Hosokawa's, be summoned to testify before the Diet as an unsworn witness. Hosokawa said it was conducted by his late father-in-law. The ruling coalition had rejected but finally accepted the opposition demand Friday. Shozo Fujiki told reporters Wednesday that he arranged a 418 million yen loan for an aide of Hosokawa's from a stock investment company to help finance the purchase of 300 shares of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) in 1986 just after NTT went public. The prime minister denied allegations that he personally had a hand in the 1986 purchase of the NTT shares. The provisional budget was submitted to the Diet last Tuesday, approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday and was sent to the upper house the same day. Deliberations by the lower house on the full budget have yet to begin because the LDP and the Japanese Communist Party are refusing to participate in the budget debates due to dissatisfaction with Hosokawa's explanation concerning 100 million yen he says was a loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking group. The provisional budget earmarks 2.78 trillion yen in spending on public works, about 30 percent of outlays included in the full budget, to finance works carried over from fiscal 1993 and to cover the roughly estimated amount usually necessary during the first 50-day period. An outlay of 14 percent is included as a minimum requirement for labor, operating and other administrative expenses to keep the government functioning. Among other major expenditures, the provisional budget allocates 2.20 trillion yen in social welfare spending from 13.48 trillion yen in the full budget, and 3.65 trillion yen in tax grants to local governments from the full 12.76 trillion yen. On the revenue side, the ministry estimates 3.83 trillion yen during the 50-day period, including 1.22 trillion yen in tax income and 2.47 trillion yen from bond issuance. To cover the estimated revenue shortfall of 7.23 trillion yen, the ministry plans to raise funds by issuing short-term treasury bills. The 50-day provisional period is the second longest in postwar history -- matching those in fiscal 1987, 1989 and 1990 when Japan also compiled stopgap budgets.
