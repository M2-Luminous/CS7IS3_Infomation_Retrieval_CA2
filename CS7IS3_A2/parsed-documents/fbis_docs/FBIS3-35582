During the meeting in the Quirinale Palace he said that Russia considers Italy as its priority and reliable partner on the European continent. This was reported by a well-informed source in the Russian delegation after the meeting. Viktor Chernomyrdin noted that the confidence of contacts between the leaders of the two countries has risen which allows them to introduce new elements of partnership and to attach more dynamism to Russian-Italian ties. He also said that Moscow attaches big importance to a forthcoming visit by Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, to Italy in July 1994 in connection with his participation in a G-7 meeting in Naples. Speaking about the bilateral economic ties the Russian premier said that the government of the Russian Federation intends to undertake maximum efforts to creat a favorable climate for foreign investors among whom, he believes, Italian partners are, as before, in the forefront. During the meeting he spoke out for extending cultural ties between the two countries and for improving their contractual basis. Viktor Chernomyrdin expressed his gratitude to the Italian people for supporting Russian reforms in this difficult time. Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin also met with representatives of Italian business circles in Rome. In the headquarters of ENI [Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi], a major Italian state fuel concern, the Russian Premier replied to journalists' questions. He expressed the hope that fruitful Russian-Italian economic cooperation will "serve to step up the pace of reforms in Russia." Viktor Chernomydin also reported that several other projects were discussed today besides the recent Gazprom-ENI contract, which he considers to be "the contract of the century in terms of its significance for Russia and Italy." "We would very much like ENI to step up its work not only in the oil and gas sphere, but also in such spheres as chemicals and foodstuff production. The task which I set during this meeting will stir the management of the company to further cooperation, the development of which should not be delayed any longer," he said. The joint development of oil and gas fields in the Barents Sea and on Yamal were among the projects which Viktor Chernomyrdin said were discussed today.
