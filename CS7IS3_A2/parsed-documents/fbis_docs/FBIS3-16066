As was reported earlier, Alexander Denisov was detained by Estonia's security police in the city of Johvi due to unauthorized possession of weapons and staying on Estonia's territory without appropriate documentation. On Friday leaders of the organization Russian National Unity appealed to the Estonian Embassy in Moscow to free Denisov and send him to Russia. Mari-Ann Rikken pointed out that as the question concerns a criminal case, the request had been handed over to the Interior Ministry. Siigart Holger, deputy general director of the security police, reported that during the interrogation Denisov, who formerly lived in Estonia, declared that he fled from Russia because he was afraid of persecution for participation in the events of October 3-4 in Moscow. Estonia views Denisov as a criminal and a trial is now being prepared, said Siigart Holger.
