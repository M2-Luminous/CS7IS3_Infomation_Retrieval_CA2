Chairing the Consultative Committee meeting of the Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers in New Delhi, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao said the Chemical Weapons Convention is nondiscriminatory in its approach. This is the reason for which the verification methods adopted in the convention are compared favorably with similar efforts in the direction of disarmament. Mr. Narasima Rao emphasized that India is not making any chemical weapons and it has nothing to hide. He said India plans to train its chemical industry in a such a way that they are able to protect their commercial secrets while undergoing the inspection process.
