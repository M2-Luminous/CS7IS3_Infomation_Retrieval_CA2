ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: The State of Washington has applied for final authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed the State of Washington's application and has reached a decision that the State of Washington's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Thus, EPA is granting final authorization to the State of Washington to operate its expanded program, subject to the authority retained by EPA in accordance with the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984. EFFECTIVE DATE: Final authorization for the State of Washington shall be effective November 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia Springer, U.S. EPA, M/S: HW&hyph;107, 1200 Sixth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98101, Phone (206) 553&hyph;2858. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 to RCRA (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260&hyph;266, 268 and 270. B. State of Washington The State of Washington initially received final authorization on January 31, 1986. The State of Washington received authorization for revisions to its program on November 23, 1987 (52 FR 35556, 9/22/87) and on October 16, 1990 (55 FR 33695, 8/17/90). On January 12, 1994, the State of Washington submitted a program revision application for additional program approvals. On March 30, 1994, EPA published a proposal to approve the State of Washington's application for program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.21(b)(4). EPA has reviewed the State of Washington's application, and has made a final decision that Washington's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA is granting final authorization for the additional program modifications to Washington's hazardous waste program. Attachments 1, 2, 5, 6, 8&hyph;17 and Appendices 1&hyph;4 of the State's application are provided for information only.
