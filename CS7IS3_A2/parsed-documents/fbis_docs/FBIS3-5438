According to Battambang's provincial police, some 50 Khmer Rouge soldiers from Divisions 320 and 450 attacked the position in the Prey Khpos sector for half an hour. At the same time, 30 other Khmer Rouge soldiers occupied the government forces' positions in Ampil Pram Daeum Commune for a few days. Two other positions in this commune and the Commune of Kdol Ta Hen also came under attack from Khmer Rouge forces. Ampil Pram Daeum and Kdol Ta Hen were attacked three times by the Khmer Rouge last January and February. The current activities of the guerrillas appear to be acts of banditry which have caused great losses in human life and property to the local population.
