Mr. Juppe left last night, initially flying to Zagreb. There he will notably meet with Croatian President Franjo Tudjman. Juppe and Leotard will today visit Sarajevo where a meeting is planned with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. This visit comes after Wednesday's [9 February] decision by NATO to give the Serbian forces 10 days to lift the siege of Sarajevo or be subjected to air strikes. The Foreign Ministry's communique added that Mr. Juppe will express the "firmness and determination" of Paris to "enforce the ultimatum issued by the Atlantic Alliance and which France had demanded. At the same time, France, in agreement with its allies, still subscribes to the need to do everything possible to restart the diplomatic process which must make it possible to find a political solution to the conflict." The Foreign Ministry said that Mr. Juppe had discussed the visit with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd. All France's other European partners have also been kept informed. Today's visit to Sarajevo by Foreign Minister Alain Juppe and Defense Minister Francois Leotard is a symbol of France's desire to persist in the determination expressed by NATO on Wednesday and to stress the unaltered priority: Beyond the warnings, the ultimatum, and possible sanctions by air strikes, the aim is still to push for negotiations between the three warring factions and therefore to create the conditions required to restore peace through diplomatic channels. On this fundamental point, Paris and Washington have happily taken the same line. While pressure must continue to be put on the Serbs (and on the Croats) at the cost of real risks for the UN troops on the ground, France and America have finally reached an agreement on the issue of intensifying efforts of persuasion for the Bosnian Muslims. In Sarajevo Alain Juppe will certainly work along these lines in his meeting with President Izetbegovic. Nonetheless, until the NATO ultimatum expires on 21 February, we can expect to see an escalation in the delaying tactics originating equally from Belgrade, Pale, and Moscow. There were already initial signs of this yesterday. Moreover, everyone still remembers the flurry of more or less successful diplomatic initiatives between December 1990 and January 1991 that tried to avert war breaking out with Saddam Husayn. This time, Paris at least considers that the it stands strong in the Bosnia dossier and that the determination of the West should not be caught out. While Alain Juppe firmly stresses that it is "Sarajevo first," he has still not forgotten the rest of Bosnia: central Bosnia, Tuzla airport, and the Srebenica enclave. However, while Sarajevo takes priority, the Bosnian capital seriously risks being the exclusive focus of attention for observers. This means that, on the scattered front lines many threats and temptations will still remain open to all sides. The Muslims, for example, may well be tempted to profit from the new situation and provoke their enemies as they have done in the past. The Serbs could let themselves be caught up in an accelerating logic of reprisals. The same goes for the Croats. Finally, there is the difficulty of checking the implementation of the NATO requirements on the ground, always assuming that no serious incidents occur between now and 21 February to trigger NATO's intervention mechanism. Unless there is a dramatic turn of events, the West has therefore entered into a rigorous logic of dissuasion and determination. In any event, the chosen path is paved with many stumbling blocks and serious uncertainties.
