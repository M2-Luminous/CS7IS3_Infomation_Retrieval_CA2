The country was on the verge of an acute crisis, but a means of accord was found then nonetheless. Regrettably, it was later cut short by the hard-line stance of both sides -- that is how I regard the political events of the past year. And that is why I am convinced that it is not enough to make commitments, you have to know how to carry them out. I also apply that to myself. And that is what I expect of others too. We have a Constitution. However anyone looks at it, it has been adopted and is in force. And I think that not only the rights but also the duties of citizens, including officials and including in connection with the signing of the Treaty on Social Accord, should be observed. Not only in the political but also in the economic sphere. The state must make concrete pledges to formulate ways of escaping from the crisis. I am profoundly convinced that if we do not find ways of stabilizing the economy, ways of financial recovery, if we do not overcome the paralysis of the financial-credit system, this treaty may remain a pipe dream. Accord in society depends on the position of huge social groups of the population, and if we do not succeed in halting the impoverishment of the very poor, it will be fairly hard to actually secure accord. I think that the treaty is the first step toward our getting away from last year's tragedy. Confrontation is hopeless. I think that both those who subscribed to and are yet to subscribe to the treaty and those who do not sign it should all realize the responsibility they bear. It is not a question of each one of us, it is a question of Russian citizens and Russia.
