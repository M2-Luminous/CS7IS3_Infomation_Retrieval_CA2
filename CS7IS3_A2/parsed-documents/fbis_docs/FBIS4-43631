In a statement over the telephone carried live on Bayrak Television while the count was in progress, Hakki Atun, DP leader and prime minister, said that it is very satisfactory that the municipal elections were held in a democratic atmosphere. Expressing the belief that democracy will be further consolidated in the wake of these elections, Atun noted that the new candidates will serve the people in the best manner in cooperation with the government. He pointed out that the existing draft bill granting more autonomy to the municipalities will be enacted as soon as possible, adding that the local administrations should increase their financial resources to this end. Municipalities should offer the best service, and the new bill will modernize their structure, Atun remarked, stressing that the government will support the newly elected local administrators in every possible way. In a statement to TAK [Turkish Cypriot News Agency], Atun declared that the local election results will not affect the coalition government. Atun underlined that there is no reason for the election results to affect the government. Noting that his party is participating in municipal elections for the first time, the DP leader said: We chose the candidates democratically, and we must respect the results. Also in a statement over the telephone carried live on Bayrak Television, Ozker Ozgur, RTP leader, state minister, and deputy prime minister, declared that the RTP is emerging from the local elections as the first party. Interpreting the outcome as evidence of the Turkish Cypriot people's support for the policies of the RTP, Ozgur remarked that this is also related to the party's performance in the government. Ozgur said that he expected these results because the RTP ministers in the government worked hard and established a good dialogue with the people over five months. In reply to a question, Ozgur declared that the results will not affect the composition of the government and added: We must continue the efforts toward solutions to all our problems together with our people both on the local and general level. Pointing out that his party emerged successful from the local elections, Ozgur said that this is the victory of democracy. Ozgur also said that democracy has entered an irreversible process in north Cyprus. NUP leader Dervis Eroglu, in a statement to Bayrak Radio and Television, described the local elections as a success for his party. Expressing the belief that the results will relay a message to the coalition parties, Eroglu said: Given the pressures applied both before and during the elections and the current economic difficulties, our people will undertake certain actions. He said that the NUP was successful despite this being the first time it participated in elections as the opposition. Eroglu charged that pressure was applied during the elections and expressed the hope that such incidents will not occur in the future. Noting that the country is currently experiencing an economic crisis, Eroglu said that nothing is being done or proposed to resolve these problems. He added: The people, however, are making their own decision and are finally achieving the results they want. CLP leader Mustafa Akinci announced that he will resign as party leader. In a statement on Bayrak Television in connection with the election results, Akinci declared that he made this decision in order to allow the full rehabilitation of the party. Akinci explained that he was unable to implement this decision, [word indistinct] Akinci said. He congratulated the newly elected candidates. Akinci noted that as a deputy in parliament, he will contribute in every possible way to the contemporary, productive, and democratic development of municipalities. Assessing the local elections, Akinci also said that although the CLP increased its votes in several areas, it was unable to receive sufficient votes to win the mayoral posts.
