FR941116-1-00027 FR941116-1-00007 Due to additional information received after the adoption of revisions to Reg 7 in September, 1989, the State reconsidered its regulation of coal tar under Section 7.XI. (Use of Cutback Asphalt). In revisions submitted on August 30, 1990, Section 7.XI.D., covering coal tar, was deleted. Regulation of coal tar is not covered by the CTG for cutback asphalt use; EPA believes that it is not needed to meet the RACT requirement of the CAA. 3 3 Under section 193 of the amended CAA, States cannot delete control requirements in effect prior to enactment of the amendments unless the modification ensures equivalent or greater emission reductions of the same air pollutant. By this same submittal, the State has submitted additional control requirements that more than compensate for any greater emissions that may result from the deletion of the coal tar regulation. In this action, EPA is proposing to approve the State's VOC definition as submitted in the 1989 and 1990 revisions to Reg 7. However, on February 3, 1992, EPA published a revised definition of volatile organic compounds (57 FR 3941). The definition excludes a number of organic compounds from the definition of VOC on the basis that they are of negligible reactivity and do not contribute to tropospheric ozone formation. The State's definition excludes some, but not all, of these compounds. Therefore, the State's definition of VOC provides for the regulation of some compounds which are no longer considered VOCs by EPA. In light of EPA's most recent definition of VOC, EPA will not enforce against sources for failure to control the emission of compounds that are exempt from the federal VOC definition. EPA has informed the Region VIII States of the revised definition of VOC and will request that future SIP revisions reflect the most recent federal VOC definition. Based on the above revisions, EPA believes that Colorado has met the ozone RACT requirement of the CAA as it applies to the Denver-Boulder metropolitan area. Colorado has corrected its RACT rule deficiencies regarding enforceability. This action was previously published as a Direct Final Rule on June 26, 1992 (57 FR 28614). This Direct Final Rule was withdrawn on August 12, 1992 (57 FR 36004) as EPA Region VIII received a letter, dated July 16, 1992, from William Owens, Executive Director of the Colorado Petroleum Association (CPA), to Jeff Houk of EPA Region VIII, expressing adverse comments. These comments will be considered by EPA during the comment period, along with any other comments that are received on this proposed rule. II. Proposed Action EPA proposes to approve Colorado's Ozone SIP revisions, submitted by the Governor on September 27, 1989, and August 30, 1990. These revisions consist of amendments to Reg 7. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State Implementation Plan. Each request for revision to any State Implementation Plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A., 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review. The Agency has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act enacted on November 15, 1990. The Agency has determined that this action conforms with those requirements irrespective of the fact that the submittal preceded the date of enactment.
