During his visit to London, Sosa seized the opportunity to meet with representatives of the British private and public sectors, as well as with the media, in what could be considered an instructive offensive aimed at projecting a clearer image of the country's prevailing situation. He announced IMF President Michael Camdessus will visit Venezuela in late June, adding the country has enough reserves to pay for 11 months worth of imports and to meet foreign debt obligations. During his meeting with media representatives, Sosa not only delineated the economic measures the country is taking; he also listened to and answered questions, stressing "the distortions that can be made due to a lack of information and preconceived notions." He left the doors open for future consultations. The finance minister added: "The possibility that Venezuela has to achieve self-sustained economic growth requires time, despite good intentions and determination; this time must be used to invest in political stability and social justice." Sosa also reported the British company Baywater will sign an agreement with the Venezuelan Government to repair the metropolitan aqueduct, which will not only regulate the water supply to Caracas but will also constitute a large boost for the "Venezuela Project," through which the British private sector will invest more than $2 billion in the country.
