FR940930-2-00219 FR940930-2-00073 2. The creation of multiple classes does not present the concerns that section 18 was designed to address. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings, affect any Fund's existing assets or reserves, nor increase the speculative character of any Fund shares. The Funds' capital structures under the proposed arrangement will not induce any group of shareholders to invest in higher risk securities to the detriment of any other group of shareholders since the investment risks of each Fund will be borne equally by all of its shareholders. 3. Mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to each class of shares in a Fund. Further, (a) Since each class of shares will be redeemable at all times, (b) since no class of shares will have any preference or priority over any other class in the Fund, and (c) since the similarities and dissimilarities of the classes of shares will be disclosed in the Funds' prospectuses, investors will not be given misleading impressions as to the safety or risk of any class of shares, and the nature of the shares will not be rendered speculative. 4. The Funds' capital structures under the proposed arrangement will not enable insiders to manipulate expenses and profits among the various classes of shares since all the expenses and profits of a particular Fund (except the different fees of any Plan applicable to a class of shares, any higher incremental transfer agency fees, Class Expenses attributable to a class of shares and any other incremental expense subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to a particular class which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order) will be borne pro rata by all the shares of the Fund, irrespective of class, and all shareholders will have equal voting rights except with respect to matters pertaining to the Plans and related agreements. The concerns that a complex capital structure may facilitate control without equity or other investment and may make it difficult for investors to value the securities of the Funds are not present. 5. The proposed arrangement will permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs. Moreover, owners of each class of shares may be relieved of a portion of the fixed costs normally associated with investing in mutual funds since such costs would potentially be spread over a greater number of shares than they would otherwise. Applicants' Multiple Class Conditions Applicants agree that the order of the Commission granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: 1. Each class of shares of a Fund will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of that Fund, and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences among the various classes of shares of the same Fund will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the different distribution, service, and shareholder servicing fee payments associated with any Plan relating to a particular class of shares and any other costs relating to the implementation of such Plan or any amendment thereto (including obtaining shareholder approval of such Plan or any amendment thereto) which will be borne solely by shareholders of such class, any incremental transfer agency fees attributable solely to a particular class of shares of the Fund, and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class and which shall be approved by the Commission pursuant to an amended order, (b) voting rights on matters which pertain to the Plans, except as provided in Condition No. 15 below, (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares, (d) the designation of each class of shares of the Fund, (e) the differences in the conversion features of each class of shares, and (f) any differences in Class Expenses of each class of shares. 2. The Board of Trustees of each Fund, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will approve the Multiple Distribution System for a particular Fund prior to its implementation by such Fund. The minutes of the meetings of the Trustees regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the Multiple Distribution System will reflect in detail the reasons for the Trustees' determination that the proposed Multiple Distribution System is in the best interests of both the Fund and its shareholders.
