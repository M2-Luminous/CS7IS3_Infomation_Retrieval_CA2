Writing in the 10 January Paris daily LIBERATION, Boniface asserts that NATO is a "unique forum" for consultation among the Western democracies, remains the "best guarantee" for a continued U.S. presence in Europe, and exerts a "limitless attraction" on the former Warsaw Pact countries. According to Boniface, NATO remains the only multinational defense organization in Europe with the required infrastructure, logistics, command and control, and imposing force. Nevertheless, he expressed doubts about the benefits of rejoining NATO's integrated command, suggesting that allies would be more receptive to French policies if France assisted the development of a genuinely European defense identity. He observes that the "complementarity" between a European defense identity and NATO was endorsed at the 1991 NATO summit in Copenhagen and reaffirmed at the NATO summit in Rome later that same year. Boniface calls for a redistribution of roles within NATO because of NATO's shift from purely military to political and security missions, coupled with what he perceives as a gradual disengagement from NATO by the United States. The United States should share control with Europe, Boniface believes. In the future, the Alliance's main military mission will be crisis management and peacekeeping. However, U.S. "reservations" about military intervention in Bosnia are "not encouraging" in this respect, Boniface contends, since NATO is powerless to act when the United States declines to take military risks. The December 1992 decision by France to participate in NATO peacekeeping operations, he contends, should be seen in that specific context and should not necessarily be interpreted as a first step to a return to integrated military structures, Boniface concludes. French Reintegration Possible Commentator Alain Duhamel writes that, while France's 1966 decision to "remove the tricolor troops" from a NATO "totally dominated by the United States" had a "solid foundation" at the time, this "old" doctrine could soon be replaced by a "search for influence through solidarity" (LE POINT, 8 January). Changing circumstances call for such a shift, Duhamel believes, citing the situation in Russia, Bosnia, elsewhere in East Europe, and the perceived U.S. "retreat from the Old World." France is in an "ideal" position to influence a redefinition of NATO, Duhamel contends. France's nuclear capability and influence in Africa gives Paris the clout to argue for a "bipolar" equal division of NATO's political, military, and financial responsibilities between the United States and Europe. In Duhamel's view, this would place NATO on a more realistic footing, lead to greater autonomy within NATO for the European contingent, and assist the development of large-scale European military units composed exclusively of professional troops. It could also foster the growth of a competitive European defense industry, Duhamel believes. Under this arrangement France would probably rejoin an integrated NATO military command under a European general staff and thus bring about, through different means, the Gaullist dream of a "new equilibrium" for NATO, Duhamel concludes.
