Vavilov, St.Petersburg; UDC 621.373:535] [Abstract] An unstable resonator is proposed for the LIT-100 commercial YAG:Nd laser. The active medium of this laser consists of two cylindrical YAG:Nd rods 100 mm long and 6.3 mm in diameter, a thermal lens being induced in each. They are now placed each inside a single-lamp ellipsoidal reflector-luminaire and each pumped with a 24 A - 150 Hz current supplying a power of 5.5 kW. These luminaires are very energy-efficient but, owing to multimode radiation emission by the active medium, they form a widely divergent radiation beam. Stable resonators in the form of long planar cavities minimize the beam divergence, but with an attendant loss of power caused by distortions of higher orders than those due to formation of the thermal lenses in the active medium. Unstable resonators operating on the negative branch of the stability curve are known to minimize the beam divergence with minimum energy loss. Two variants of such a resonator have been designed and tested. The telescopic resonator providing an M= -1.7 magnification has a cavity formed by two concave mirrors with respectively 0.67 m and 0.4 m radii of curvature, the latter having a 3.6 mm diameter. The focus of each mirror coincides with the focus of the nearest to it thermal lens, the two thermal lenses having the same focal length and the distance between them being equal to twice that focal length. This resonator forms a radiation beam similar to that formed by a ``cat's eye'' reflector and not much better than that of the LIT-100 laser. The other resonator has a cavity formed by two plane total-reflection back mirrors and an exit mirror with a hole smaller than 6.3 mm in diameter. The image of this hole, formed by the two thermal intracavity lenses, coincides with it and the radiation beam thus exits through it with hardly any loss of power. Such a resonator with self-imaging of the exit hole rendered the best performance when its critical dimensions were: 1. diameter of exit hole d= 5.2 mm, 2. focal length of thermal lenses f= 1 m, 3. distance from focus of the thermal lens before the exit mirror to the nearest back mirror L= 0.74 m. With this resonator the laser delivered a power of 160 W (80 W per rod) in a beam with a 1.6 mrad divergence angle (at 86% maximum intensity level). Figures 3; tables 1; references 6.
