He made important statements about the peace dialogue in this state. Camacho said that the outlook has changed; peace should not involve a restoration of the status quo but the solution of the political-military problem. It should also involve an orderly and institutional leadership in the countryside, he added. Camacho said that we must implement the necessary measures to effect peace in Chiapas, but this should not be the result of a conventional negotiation of the conflict. He said that there are many beliefs and issues that still trouble the residents and undermine peace in Chiapas. The commissioner said that Chiapas residents must analyze these beliefs and issues. He added that changes must be made--for example, changes to the Penal Code. Camacho said that we must open a formal negotiation process by ensuring that the conditions that are established will enable the parties involved to reach the goal. He said that the government and local leaders must make legislative changes, but only Chiapas residents should determine which changes must be made. Camacho added that the most important thing at this time is to ensure that united efforts in this state will achieve security, justice, and democracy. We now know who will be the mediator; that is, the direct contact between the special commission for peace and reconciliation headed by Manuel Camacho Solis and the Zapatista National Liberation Army [EZLN]. That person will be Bishop Samuel Ruiz. Camacho said that Ruiz is a valuable and highly respected person in the state and was proposed as mediator by the EZLN. He will be the direct link in the process to determine whether the interlocutors that the EZLN selected are valid and whether peace can be negotiated with them, Camacho added: [Begin Camacho recording] The EZLN, via public communiques, has proposed Samuel Ruiz, the bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas, as mediator. I think that the bishop's participation in this process, along with the other Chiapas bishops, will be important. Any idea or proposal received through Ruiz will be immediately considered. As I said upon arriving in San Cristobal, it will take some time to restore peace in Chiapas. If we managed, however, to turn into a clear political concept the efforts of the civilian movement for peace, the unification of Chiapas residents to achieve security, justice, and democracy, state and municipal institutions, the decisions of the federal Executive Branch, work in communities and organizations, pastoral reconciliation messages, open and objective information, the efforts of the churches, and the role of the Congress of the Union what seems impossible could become reality. [sentence as heard] [end recording] Camacho added that only the combination of everyone's goodwill, intelligence, and honesty will prevent the outcome of this conflict from resembling those that have harmed other countries in Central America. He said that at this time peace must be built via specific dialogue. Ruiz gave thanks for this responsibility, which he described as a very heavy burden we must shoulder. He added: I will try to reconcile my pastoral duties with my mediator duties.
