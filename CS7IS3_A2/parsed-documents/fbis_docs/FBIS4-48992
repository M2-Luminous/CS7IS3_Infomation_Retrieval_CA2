After all, when General de Gaulle had the French Embassy in China transferred to the mainland in 1964, it was Taipei that severed relations. How things change! While Taipei still claims, as does Beijing, that it is the "only legitimate government" of the whole Chinese territory, pragmatism prevails in the capital of the non-Communist island, whose government is urging France to remain "realistic." In essence, the Taiwanese regime wants to put an end to the Manichean tradition of many Western countries, which in their relations with the Chinese world tend to choose either for Taiwan or for mainland China . Such is the underlying message of the statements to LE MONDE by Taiwanese Foreign Minister Frederick Chien, who appeared surprisingly serene following the first concerns after the normalization of Franco-Chinese relations. "The aim of the (French) prime minister's visit (to mainland China) was not to damage relations between France and Taiwan. Accordingly, I think that we shall maintain the same relationship as we did before Mr. Balladur's trip," he said. However, Taiwanese feelings were hurt by two aspects of France's new policy. First, in its 12 January joint communique with Beijing, France acknowledged for the first time the PRC point of view that Taiwan "is an integral part of China." The joint communique of 1964 on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Paris and Beijing had been more restrained, leaving Communist China free to interpret it the way it saw fit, but expressing no agreement on the part of France. Only in a recent text -- of a purely technical nature, since it referred to air connections between France and the two rival Chinese capitals -- has France acknowledged Beijing's position. Intertwined "While there is only one China," Mr. Chien notes, "it is unfortunately divided into two political entities. The PRC rules over the whole mainland territory, and the Chinese Republic rules over Taiwan as well as the Quemoy, Pescadores, and Matzu islands. These are the jurisdictional boundaries of the two entities. We sincerely hope that France will be realistic enough to accept this fact: The PRC's claim of sovereignty (over Taiwan) is not based on today's de facto situation." Besides, he adds, this has been going on for 45 years: "You may have a visa for mainland China, but you will not have any use for it here!" Another cause for disappointment for the Taiwanese has been the return of the notion--expressed by, among others, [French] Foreign Minister Alain Juppe before Mr. Balladur's visit to mainland China -- that the Taiwanese market (20 million people) is a tiny one compared to that of the mainland (1.15 billion people). "Look at per-capita income figures: $350 on the mainland, compared with $10,000 here. The PRC is not as large a market as Mr. Juppe seems to think it is." Mr. Chien does not mention what many French businessmen and economic experts have been anticipating: Ultimately, unless tensions between Taiwan and the mainland become worse than what they currently are, Taiwanese entrepreneurs and financiers will play a key role in many industrialization projects on the mainland. They think that this at least is a trend that can no longer be ignored, since the two economies have become so intertwined that 30-year-old views of the two-headed Chinese world have become anachronistic. This is a fact that should be taken into account during the upcoming visits to the two Chinas of [French] Foreign Trade and Industry Minister Gerard Longuet: One to Beijing, where he has promised to head an industrial mission, and one to Taipei, where he is to inaugurate a French industrial high-technology exhibition in July. Seeing how the Chinese police went about harassing people during Mr. Balladur's trip to the mainland, the true magnitude of the "Chinese challenge" is becoming apparent for French exports to both Chinas.
