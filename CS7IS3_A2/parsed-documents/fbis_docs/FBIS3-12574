Well-informed Libyan sources yesterday described the visit to Algeria by Major al-Khuwaylidi al-Humaydi, envoy of the Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, and his talks with President Liamine Zeroual as "positive and fruitful, especially with regard to returning matters to normal between the two countries." Major al-Humaydi, the first senior Libyan official to visit Algeria since the September crisis last year, has always maintained strong ties with Algeria and Tunisia, even at the most critical times. A severe crisis erupted between Algeria and Libya following a speech delivered by Col. al-Qadhdhafi at the beginning of last July, in which he announced his willingness to mediate between the regime in Algeria and the Islamic Salvation Front's leaders, whom he described as friends of his. [passage omitted] Well-informed sources have told AL-HAYAH that the Libyan envoy's talks with senior Algerian officials resulted in important agreements as regards eliminating the causes of the previous escalation, first and most closing the Algerian base in al-'Ujaylah to the armed Libyan opposition, suspending media campaigns between the two countries, and reactivating bilateral relations. The same sources said that Algeria, which took over the leadership of the Arab Maghreb Union from Tunisia last year, is seeking to improve relations with neighboring states and to eliminate the causes of tensions inherited from the former regime. It is also eager to contribute to ripening regional conditions for the convening of the Maghreb summit, which has been postponed indefinitely, in order to consolidate its leadership of the union and reactivate its institutions. Observers believe that the revival of Algerian-Libyan relations is an important step toward eliminating the causes that have so far prevented the convening of the Maghreb Presidential Council's sixth session in the Tunisian capital.
