In press statements he made in Tunis today on developments in Yemen, 'Amr Musa added that the unity that was established based on the agreement of both sides cannot be imposed by force. The various parties must show actual commitment to the Security Council resolution on the Yemeni crisis. If the fighting continues, however, it will destroy all of Yemen. 'Amr Musa clarified that adherence to the cease-fire in Yemen is not mere talk; it should be respected in word and deed. He said the continued fighting and strikes against installations, despite declarations that both parties adhere to the cease-fire, means they reject the Security Council resolution. Answering a question on the statement the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] foreign ministers issued the day before yesterday on events in Yemen, 'Amr Musa said the statement contains important results and expresses the frustration with events in Yemen. He added that it was only natural to hold a GCC meeting, because the situation in Yemen cannot be ignored and left the way it is. Musa affirmed that the solution to the crisis in Yemen is respect for the Security Council resolution and the cease-fire in Yemen. Moreover, the forces must be separated from each other and dialogue between the various parties must start.
