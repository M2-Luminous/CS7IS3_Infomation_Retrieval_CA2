"My peace-making initiative -- to meet with Ingush President Ruslan Aushev on 2 April -- aims at finding ways to reach peace and accord between the peoples of the two Republics and work out principles and mechanisms of implementation of the presidential decree `on the procedure for returning refugees and displaced persons to the places of their permanent residence in the Republics of North Ossetia and Ingushetia,'" Galazov said. In an interview with ITAR-TASS, Galazov said that there has been no official response from Ingushetia so far. Meanwhile, North Ossetian Government and parliament have set up a working group to hold talks with the Ingush side in the city of Terek on 29 March to decide on the venue of the summit meeting, its agenda and composition of the official delegations. The working group is headed by Vice-Prime Minister Georgiy Dzhigkayev. Galazov confirmed that the Ossetian side had thoroughly studied the package of documents concerning the mechanism of implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's decree on refugees. The documents lay a legal foundation for normalising relations between the two nations and restoring peace and accord in the region. Galazov stressed that the situation in the zone of the state of emergency remains complex, but is controlled by the Russian peace-keeping troops and North Ossetian law enforcement bodies.
