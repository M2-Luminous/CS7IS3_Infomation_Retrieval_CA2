FBIS3-50007 "dreeu014__a94013" FBIS-EEU-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Paper Denies New Rules Threaten Independence AU1401194994 Prague CTK in English 1607 GMT 14 Jan 94 AU1401194994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Prague, Jan 14 (CTK) -- The articles on appointment of LIDOVE NOVINY editors, included in the agreement on the position of editor-in-chief, violate the law and were therefore never valid. Therefore, it is not true that the agreement was violated by the adoption of the new internal rules and procedures, Josef Kotrba informed CTK today. Kotrba, chairman of the Board of the LIDOVE NOVINY joint stock company, was reacting to a series of declarations by Jaromir Stetina, who resigned as LN editor-in-chief on Wednesday [12 January]. He said that the new internal rules and procedures, accepted by the LN Board of Directors recently, violated two essential documents -- the editorial statute and the agreement on the editor-in-chief -- which guarantee the independence of the paper. According to the new rules, the top editors of the staff are not appointed by the editor-in-chief, but by the director of the company, and the editor-in-chief is not subordinate to the Board, but to its chairman. Kotrba's declaration said that the Board of Directors, composed entirely of the original shareholders of the LN joint stock company and the employees, explicitly declared that the new rules did not contradict the statute of the editorial staff. LIDOVE NOVINY was founded in 1893 as a liberal daily. Banned by the communist regime after it seized power, it started reappearing in 1988 as a dissident publication. Last November the Swiss press company Ringier purchased a majority stake in the paper, whose circulation is around 100,000 copies. The declaration also mentioned that the paper's independence was not threatened at all since it was guaranteed by an editorial board statute which can be only changed by a general meeting of the shareholders with a nine-tenths vote.
