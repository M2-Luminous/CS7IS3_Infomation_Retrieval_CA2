The report suggests that the Kuwaiti oil tanker firm's current management leaked to a Kuwaiti newspaper a report prepared and submitted to the Cabinet, dealing with past conditions at the company. It had been decided the Cabinet would forward it to the public prosecutor, but the company protested and held back from publishing it. The text of the report follows: Hard Currency Indebtedness The official Kuwaiti News Agency attributed to the governor of the Kuwaiti Central Bank additional information about the level of preliminary compliance with Law 41/93, which deals with hard currency indebtedness. The numbers attributed to the governor give a picture somewhat different from those we had printed as of last week, which relied on what the minister of finance had stated immediately after the conclusion of the time limit for compliance with the law on 31 March 1994, [a discrepancy] which may be due to the delay in the checking and analysis of the statements. The governor says that there are 10,323 agents subject to the law, with a total balance of indebtedness of 6,294 Kuwaiti dinars [KD]--nearly KD703 million more than the number of bonds issued. He attributes this discrepancy to several conflicting processes, as the bonds were issued at a higher value to banks including interest on the balance of indebtedness from 1 August 1990 until 31 December 1991, but the balance of indebtedness is greater than its coverage of debts, to which are added the allocations collected by banks from 1986 until 1 August 1990 and discounted from the value of the bonds, plus the balance of debt clearance, amounting to KD900 million. These are political and non-professional debts paid from the public treasury through some major investment companies. The governor says that "debt measures have been concluded for a total of 3,651 agents (those who paid immediately); this is 35.4 percent of the whole, with a balance of KD71 million in debts, 11.3 percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt balance per agent of about KD195,000. On the other hand, nearly 3,503 agents have not documented their manner of debt settlement and violated the provisions of the law; this is 34 percent of the total, with a debt balance of nearly KD209 million, or 3.3 percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt balance of nearly KD60,000. This shows a crucial disparity from what the minister of finance had said (KD900 million). This means KD3.169 billion, or nearly 85.4 percent of total indebtedness, with an average debt balance of about KD1.7 million." In brief, there are nearly 6,820 agents complying with the law, representing nearly 66 percent of total agents, with a balance of KD6.085 billion in debts. An over-all view, in terms of averages, makes it possible to say that most of the agents complying with the law have average debts. It is they who paid up immediately. The smallest number of them complying had small debts, benefiting most from the law. As to lack of awareness or special circumstances, especially the rebate of consumer loans, one notes that those with large indebtedness complied with the law when they provided documentation in the limited time. Undoubtedly some of them are betting on time and the chance for changes in the law. Kuwaiti Oil Tanker Company One of the local newspapers has published a secret report that seems to have been submitted to the cabinet before the case was to be forwarded to the public prosecutor's office. It is clear that it had been prepared by the company's present management. The management sent the newspaper an advertisement, which the newspaper refrained from publishing, thereby confirming its truth, to some degree. We believe it is an unfortunate step on the part of the company, if one assumes such reports to be public information of which it is the right of all people to form a public opinion, both in terms of the extent of its effect, with other cases, on the past, present, and future of the country, or as a result of circumstances and the time in which they occurred. What makes this report unusual is that it presents the documents and computer printouts used in the embezzlement we mentioned last week, such as buying at higher than the value, domination of management decisionmaking, choosing the team, money laundering through paper companies, and secret accounts. There must be verification, and action to deny the connection of two banks in which the government owns a majority share, and whose names appear in the report. We do not think they had any role in what happened. A third bank was also named, in which one of the two banks owned shares, and which was supported by the Kuwaiti Government during the period of occupation. Perhaps one of the distinctions of the case is that it was discovered by coincidence, either through the neglect of some officials involved in the seizure of all the company's documents linked to the case, or by way of one of the bank officials intruding, through either curiosity or courtesy, with questions about the drop in the level of operations activity. Perhaps this is certain evidence of the failure of internal and external monitoring agencies, and individual authority in management, whether in political or administrative terms, or in terms of the oil sector. What the tanker company officials failed to do in destroying the bonds, the officials of the Kuwait Investment Office in London succeeded in doing, as did the management of the Torras Group in Spain. Despite all the evidence recorded in the report, which cannot except any of the accused, the consitutional court is now looking into the competence of the ordinary courts to try one of the ministers due to the ordinance of a law the Cabinet adopted in 1990. In terms of political immunity, and in light of what has come before, and apart from the verdict of the constitutional court, one would assume that the government will take the initiative to do everything in its power to pursue trying the officials, and the other authorities will do their utmost to achieve this goal.
