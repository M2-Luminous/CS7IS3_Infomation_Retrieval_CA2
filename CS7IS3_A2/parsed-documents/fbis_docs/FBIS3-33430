The principal leaders of the bloc who are currently in Washington, officially invited the members and political allies to join the party's leadership in its new position. In a letter addressed to the legislators in favor of the return of President Aristide, the bloc is inviting them to reunite, to close ranks in order to pursue together the struggle for democracy. This letter is addressed particularly to Senator Yvon Gislain and two FNCD deputies who approved a first plan for a solution to the crisis, siding with some legislators from the opposition. One FNCD ally, Deputy Samuel Madistin, who severely criticized the plan supported by the Americans and the United Nations also rose up against the initiative of the legislators without a mandate who are trying to involve the Legislative Branch as a whole. Deputy Madistin ascribes this plan to a vast international plot. [passage omitted]
