The Majles met yesterday morning chaired by Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Nateq-Nuri and the deputies from the cities of Salmas, Tehran, Minab and Mashhad gave speeches. Then the speaker of the Majles gave a speech in which he condemned the crimes of the bloodthirsty Serbs against the defenseless Muslims of Bosnia and Hercegovina, which was printed in yesterday's issue. Then the Majles took up its agenda, the details of which are printed below. Fathollah Reza'i, Deputy From Salmas The members of the Council of Ministers, by increasing the rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power, are themselves taking a step down the road to increasing high prices. Reza'i, deputy from Salmas, was the first preagenda speaker at yesterday's open Majles session. In his speech he commemorated the martyrdom anniversary of Professor Motahari and offered congratulations on Teacher Day and Worker Day. He said: Every moment and everywhere in the world where the cries to heaven of freedom-loving people are to be heard, as in the Muslim nations of Sudan, Somalia, and in free countries such as Nicaragua and Panama, the unworthy and inadequate UN policymakers, in collaboration with the world's plundering nations led by criminal America, are busy mercilessly suppressing and killing the freedom seekers in those countries. He discussed the slaughter of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the criminal Serbs, and in other parts of the world. He said: Unfortunately the Muslim nations, with their silence, are consenting to these crimes. Only the Islamic Republic of Iran, with the prophetic leadership of its exalted leader, has responded positively to the cries of the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina and other freedom-seeking people, and is revealing their oppression in a world full of infidelity and atheism. He added: In this wide world, has anyone ever asked the secretary-general whether human rights are invoked only to defend murderers and international smugglers? In visits to the camps for Azeri refugees run by the Red Crescent in Parsabad, I saw for myself the depth of the plot. According to the existing statistics, more than 1 million defenseless people are refugees from their own countries. The Red Crescent has more than 53,000 of these people in its care in Azerbaijan, where it is treating them with Islamic concern and kindness. Continuing, the deputy from Salmas expressed thanks for Dr. Vahid Dastjerdi's management of the Red Crescent. With regard to the problems and difficulties in his electoral district, he mentioned the importance of the geographic position of the Salmas Plain, and noted that preliminary studies on the possibility of doing a water exploration project in the Salmas Plain were done in the years 1348-1351 [21 March 1969-20 March 1973] by engineers from the former Yugoslavia. Studies on the reservoir dam, the power plant, the diversionary dam and the irrigation and drainage network were completed through the end of phases I and II. In the year 1357 [21 March 1978-20 March 1979] construction began on the plain's irrigation and drainage network, and the work stopped after nine months. He issued memoranda to the officials in charge concerning the creation of a labor market and confronting and resisting the cultural invasion caused by the country's strategic, political, and cultural composition and by its geographic social composition. He mentioned unemployment as one of the problems of the people of the region and noted: The activation of tens of television channels in the region has caused individuals to be pierced by the sharp spear of the West's cultural invasion. I implore cultural officials to take basic steps to create sound recreational areas. Reza'i discussed the spoilage of some agricultural crops due to the lack of conversion industries in the region. He asked officials to take steps to provide guaranteed purchases of agricultural crops. Increasing and multiplying inflation and high prices for various goods and items needed by the public have placed the oppressed nation in the grip of a vise. The members of the Council of Ministers must come to the aid of this nation. They must not increase the high prices themselves by raising the rates for mail, telephone service, water and electrical power instead of anchoring inflation and solving the problems of high prices. He asked for help from the minister of health care, treatment and medical education to open the Salmas hospital, and from the minister of education and training to solve the problem and determine the status of residential areas in the vicinity of educational areas, and to pay the profit differentials on loans. 'Ali Movahedi-Saveji, Deputy From Tehran The government has not made the proper decisions concerning the control of prices of goods and materials and dealing with those who sell at high prices. The second preagenda speaker was Movahedi-Saveji, deputy from Tehran. In his speech he discussed the events of Ordibehesht [21 April-21 May]. He said: Although the enemies of the revolution, especially in the current century, have set out to destroy the Muslims, now in Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia and Herzegovina and in other nations and regions we see that world imperialism and domestic despots are attacking Muslims with propaganda, pressure, and severe torture in order to suppress their faith, their desire for Islam, and their religion. He then added: There are two factors in the glory, greatness, and progress of Islam and the Muslims. As long as these two factors exist among the Muslims, no danger or enemy can destroy them. One is awareness, and the other is jihad and struggle for faith and belief. Although in Bosnia and Herzegovina we are witnessing the most savage aggression, crimes, and genocide against the Muslim people of that region, ultimately Islam will cast its shadow in that region and throughout the world and the Muslims will be victorious. The deputy from Tehran then discussed domestic issues. He said: While I fully support the government, its work has been naive and insufficient in some areas. One of these issues is the struggle against selling at high prices. It would be possible to set prices in the proper way for all goods and materials and there could be a system and control. I myself go to the square and to the market to buy what I need to live. You also know that there is no problem with shortages of goods and materials. The problem is the government's failure to control and supervise the prices of goods. He emphasized: Unfortunately, sellers have been left to their own devices. A piece of fruit has a certain price in the main square in Tehran, but the prices in stores are up to double that amount. This is a question of weak management. It is a problem of lack of leadership, making the proper decisions concerning prices and dealing with the criminals who sell at high prices. We know of individuals who have put tens of millions of tumans in their pockets in less than five years with just a little fruit stand, and have bought 40- to 50-million-tuman homes right here in Tehran. I strongly protest the economic policies, and especially the issue of price controls. I say to the government, even if you intended to test to see if the prices had found their true levels, enough is enough, because the test itself has failed. Seyyed 'Ali Mirkhalil, Deputy From Minab Basic thinking must be done concerning inflation and high prices. The third preagenda speaker was Mirkhalil, deputy from Minab. During his speech he discussed the fact that we must stand up against all the plots without ceremony. He said: We know that America is plotting. It has opened a second front, where it is making mischief in the country with paid and unpaid agents. However, with God's grace, America has gotten nothing but shame and defamation. He said: With America's disgraceful defeats in Somalia and Haiti, the oppressed people must realize that American invincibility is nothing but a myth. He then said: It is clear that the government has done less in Minab, Rudan, and Jasek than it has done in other parts of the country. These areas have the least amounts of piped water, electrical power, suitable rural roads, schools, treatment centers, and health clinics. The number of rural areas with electrical power can be counted on the fingers of one hand, and a great many villages are completely without electrical power, water, rahnema'i schools, or treatment centers. The speaker added: God knows what happens to children and indigent patients, with the air and water pollution and the distance of up to 10 hours from the hospital. Are we willing to spend even one day in that deprived villager's place, where patients die from the heat and on impassable roads? The government must not be satisfied merely with getting reports from the relevant organizations, making trips in the winter and on New Year's, stopping at Qeshm Island and then going back to Tehran. They should come in the summer and see Jasek and the desert, where water is supplied by tanker trucks. This is surprising. What happened to these people's share of all that government iron, construction materials, housing loans, and other credits that were distributed? According to the people themselves in these rural areas, no official has been there and nothing has been done to solve their problems. Do some officials even know how to pronounce the names of these villages? He thanked the speaker of the Majles for voting to provide electrical power to 100 rural areas. He said: The work of the reconstruction crusade in providing electrical power to 100 rural areas will be reminiscent of the splendid operations of the dear crusaders at the war fronts, and that will keep alive the atmosphere at the fronts. I ask the deputies and the Ministry of the Reconstruction Crusade to help with the full implementation of our electrical power service project. He noted that the government must make every effort to establish the security expected by the people. He said: The existing situation does not provide the security that is expected and satisfactory for the people. I ask the minister of the interior either to provide the region's security himself or to assign responsibility for the area's security to the revolution guards. Security is not a development project that can be done next year if not done this year. If an innocent person is killed due to naivete and if the Ministry of the Interior does not make a decision to reinforce the region's security management, won't the minister of the interior have to answer to God and the people? He then discussed the nation's economic problems. He emphasized: Basic thinking must be done about inflation and high prices. We must get out of this current price situation and give attention to the principle of price control. If the government does not put the brakes on this speeding machine of high prices, is it clear what it will do to the low-income people? The government must do more to employ the local manpower that is knowledgeable, able and concerned, and in some cases it must refrain from treating them unkindly. Mirkhalil called for an investigation into the reasons for the region's deprivation and unemployment, and he noted: The sea is a divine blessing. The government must invest to make maximum use of this blessing and to eliminate unemployment and false occupations. Among the problems in his electoral district he cited the lack of water in the area, the failure to dredge existing estuaries, the lack of a university, the unusability of the road from Jasek to Bashagerd and the lack of a hospital, and he asked for solutions. Qadiseh 'Alavi, Deputy From Mashhad The Muslim nation of Iran is completely prepared to support and help the Muslims of Bosnia. The final preagenda speaker was Ms. 'Alavi, deputy from Mashhad. She offered congratulations on the birth of Imam Reza (peace be upon him), and she discussed the willing response from the public to the leader's call for support of the Muslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. She said: At this time endless oppression is supported by the United Nations, and wickedness and bloodletting have reached the point where the Serbs are attacking safe zones. [passages omitted on Serbian activities] He called on the exalted leader to issue an order forming an Islamic United Nations. The question, remains, how long will Iran remain a member of this lying, deceptive organization, which so far has done nothing to defend Muslims and the real rights of humanity? Of what benefit is it to Muslims when this organization's secretary-general stands by while children are killed in the wombs of their mothers and women and children are being attacked, when Gorazde, which was a safe zone, is transformed into a killing ground for innocent women and children, while he just watches and lowers his lip? What is the benefit of cooperating and continuing relations with elements whose state of mind is obvious and whose character is weak? What policy have the government leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted in this regard? I ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, what is the need for us to remain in an organization whose secretary-general's hands are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent Muslims? Isn't it time for the Muslim nations to protest all this injustice and oppression by forming a free United Nations and getting out of the yoke of imperialism and exploitation? The Muslim nation of Iran is entirely ready to rush to the aid of the Muslim nations of Bosnia and Gorazde, and the women of our Islamic society are certainly waiting for the exalted leader's order to support the people of Bosnia. Ms. 'Alavi said: The women deputies in the Majles, representing all of society and especially the women, have declared and are declaring that they have any kind of readiness necessary to answer the divine call from the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution to support the tormented people of Bosnia, and especially the women and children of Gorazde. In conclusion, she discussed the attempted assassination of the temporary Friday Imam of Mashhad, and she issued a memo in this regard to the relevant officials. Legislation Amendment of Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was continued consideration of the report from the first consultation of the Judicial and Legislative Affairs Commission concerning the Bill on Note 5 of the Law Appending Five Notes to the Law on Conditions for Choosing Judges. This bill provides that "the chief of the judicial power may select women who have the qualifications for Ministry of Justice judges approved 2/14/1361 [4 May 1982] and they may be hired as judges to serve as counselors to the court of administrative justice, the special civil courts, examining magistrate, assistant public prosecutor, managing the supervision of minors, and practicing in legal and other offices with judicial positions." After this bill was discussed and studied by the deputies, Mr. Nateq-Nuri spoke in support of the principle of the bill. He said: The question being discussed in this bill is legal counsel, not judicial practice. Counsel has not been prohibited in Islam. We must not indulge in the limited thinking that we should even prohibit counseling by women. In the special civil court, where most of the family issues are discussed, the women have many problems, which they cannot explain to men. The best help for them is women who know the law. The speaker of the Majles then said: What is the problem with doing this? Aren't mobilization members serving as court bailiffs? If the mobilization sisters encounter a situation, they notify the judicial power and they pursue it. Thus the same research judge (consultant) will also serve the purpose at the same place. What is the problem with this? What is the meaning of all these slogans and talk in defense of women at the podium, if we reject this bill? Is rejection of this bill a defense of women's rights? Mr. Nateq-Nuri discussed the fact that if this bill provides for judicial activity for women, the Guardian Council will reject it. He said: In view of the fact that the bill's second consultation is before us, some of the problems can be resolved in the details. Among the points for discussion on this bill is its rejection by the Judicial Affairs Commission. The commission expert mentioned the reasons for rejecting the bill. During a speech he said: Because the Law Eliminating the Positions of Examining Magistrate and Assistant Public Prosecutor has only recently been passed in the Majles, the new position called "research judge" has been created in which women can serve and the position of counselor in the special civil courts has also been eliminated, therefore, a bill cannot now be brought to the Majles that violates a recently enacted law. Therefore, opposition to this bill is not opposition to the work of women graduates in judicial law, it is due to the elimination of the jobs of examining magistrate and assistant public public prosecutor. Then the general form of the bill was put to a vote and approved. Amended Izmir Protocol The second item on the agenda was the report from the Foreign Policy Commission concerning the Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol Bill, which was approved by the deputies. Article 1: The Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol between the governments of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey, dated 21 Esfand 1355 [11 March 1977], as an amendment to the Amended Izmir Treaty Protocol dated 28 Khordad 1369 [18 June 1980], consisting of 18 paragraphs and including new members of ECO (the republics of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan) and other aspects implemented, which was signed by the Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, and the Republic of Turkey in Islamabad on 7 Azar 1371, corresponding to 28 November 1992, is approved as a supplement and authorization is given to add it. Amendment to Majles Internal Guidelines The next item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Internal Guidelines Commission concerning the Motion To Append One Note to Article 146 and One Note to Article 148 of the Majles Internal Guidelines, of which Article 1 was approved. Article 1 1 - The following note is appended to Article 146 of the Majles Internal Guidelines: Note: The specialist commission is required, at the time it invites the minister involved and the deputy or deputies with the question or questions, to also invite the Articles 88 and 90 Commission to send a representative to the specialist commission, and if the Articles 88 and 90 Commission announces the need, all the negotiations and documents requested must be given to this commission. 2 - The following note is added to the Article 148 of the Majles Internal Guidelines as Note 2: Note 2: At the request of the Articles 88 and 90 Commission, the grace period in the above article may be extended to a maximum of two months. Amendment to Law Establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran Aviation Organization The report from the second consultation of the Motion to Amend Articles from the Law Establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran Aviation Organization was the final item on the agenda, continued consideration of which was postponed to the next session.
