FR940607-2-00008 FR940607-2-00006 [A&hyph;570&hyph;834, A&hyph;549&hyph;810] Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Disposable Pocket Lighters From the People's Republic of China and Thailand AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vincent Kane (202) 482&hyph;2815 for the People's Republic of China (PRC); or David Boyland (202) 482&hyph;0588 for Thailand, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Important Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC, 20230. INITIATION OF INVESTIGATIONS: The Petition On May 9, 1994, we received a petition in proper form filed by the BIC Corporation (``petitioner''), the sole U.S. Producer of disposable pocket lighters. Petitioner filed supplements to the petition on May 23 and 24, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, petitioner alleges that imports of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC and Thailand are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that such imports are materially injuring, or threatening material injury to, a U.S. industry. Petitioner states that it has standing to file the petition because the BIC Corporation is an interested party, as defined under section 771(9)(C) of the Act, and it is the sole domestic producer of disposable pocket lighters. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, it should file a written notification with the assistant Secretary for Import Administration. Scope of Investigations The Products covered by these investigations are disposable pocket lighters, whether or not liquefied hydrocarbon, or a mixture containing any of these, whose vapor pressure at 75 degrees fahrenheit (24 degrees celsius) exceeds a gage pressure of 15 pounds per square inch. Non-refillable pocket lighters are imported under subheading 9613.10.0000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). Refillable, disposable pocket lighters would be imported under subheading 9613.20.0000. Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written descriptions of the scope of these proceedings are dispositive. United States Price and Foreign Market Value_The People's Republic of China Petitioner based United States Price (``USP'') on a 1994 sale made on a packed, c.i.f., duty-paid, delivered basis to a U.S. purchaser of disposable pocket lighters from the PRC. Petitioner deducted ocean freight, marine insurance, commission, harbor maintenance fee, and customs processing fee from this price to arrive at an f.o.b. value for the imports. Petitioner contends that the foreign market value (``FMV'') of disposable pocket lighters subject to this investigation must be determined in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, which concerns non-market economy (``MNE'') countries. The Department has determined the PRC to be an NME, within the meaning of section 771(18)(A) of the Act, in previous cases ( see e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Sebacic Acid from the PRC, May 31, 1994 (59 FR 28053)). In accordance with 771(18)(C) of the Act, that determination continues to apply for purposes of this initiation. In the course of this investigation, parties will have the opportunity to address this NME determination and provide relevant information and argument on this issue. In addition, parties will have the opportunity in this investigation to submit comments on whether FMV should be based on prices or costs in the PRC consistent with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act ( see Amendment to Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value and Amendment to Antidumping Duty Order: Chrome-Plated Lug Nuts from the People's Republic of China, 57 FR 15052 (April 24, 1992)). In this case, petitioner provided two alternative approaches for determining FMV. In the first approach, in accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, petitioner attempted to base FMV on the NME producers' factors of production valued in a market economy country at a comparable level of economic development. Petitioner, however, was unable to obtain information on the factors of production in the PRC. Therefore, petitioner used its own factors of production. In valuing the factors or production, petitioner used India and Pakistan as surrogate countries. For purposes of this invitation, we have accepted India and Pakistan as surrogates because their economies are at a level of development comparable to the PRC's. ( See Memorandum to David L. Binder, Director-Division II, Office of Antidumping Investigations from David P. Mueller, Director, Office of Policy, dated August 1993, regarding non-market economy status and surrogate country selection, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Department of Commerce.) Also, there is evidence on the record that India is a producer of comparable merchandise, as required by section 773(c)(4) of the Act. When cost information was not available in either of these countries, petitioner valued the factor using its own costs. In accordance with section 773(c)(1)(B) of the Act, petitioner's FMV consisted of the sum of values assigned to materials, labor, energy, and overhead. Petitioner adjusted certain factor values for inflation. Pursuant to section 773(e)(1) of the Act, petitioner added to the labor and material costs, and general expenses, the statutory minimum of eight percent for profit.
