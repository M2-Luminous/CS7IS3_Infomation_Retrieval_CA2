This was revealed by the China Labor Development Communique, jointly issued here today by the Labor Ministry and Statistics Bureau. Liu Guanxue, spokesman for the Labor Ministry, quoted the communique as saying that in 1993 the country's total payroll reached a record 477 billion yuan, a rise of 21.1 percent over 1992. After allowing for price rises, the actual increases in the workers' total payroll and their average per capita annual income were 4.3 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The spokesman attributed the rise to the reform of enterprise operational mechanism and to the ongoing reform of the state's wage distribution system, which now cover 18,000 enterprises and 14 million workers across the country. An elastic wage plan, the core of the current wage distribution reform, has been carried out in 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. The plan is designed to set the total payrolls in light of the economic efficiency targets of various localities.
