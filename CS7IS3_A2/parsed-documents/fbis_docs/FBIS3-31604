That was what President of the Republic of Kosova Dr. Ibrahim Rugova precisely declared to reporters at his news conference held today. For further details, let us follow a report from Prishtina by reporter Mehmet Haziri: [Haziri] President Rugova highly assessed his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other U.S. high-level officials. Rugova said that President Clinton expressed his deep concern over the situation in Kosova and gave his support to a political and peaceful solution to this problem. President Rugova considered his visit to the United States important also for the fact that all his interlocutors in the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Congress highly assessed the peaceful policy followed by the parties and the Albanian people in Kosova to achieve independence. Confronted with a reality of violence and apartheid in Kosova, which has recently intensified with raids and massive arrests of Albanians, draconian punishments in trials, and threats to destroy the Academy of Sciences and Arts of the Republic of Kosova as the only scientific institution that had so far worked in its own halls, President Rugova asked the international community to undertake a preventive action to stop the Serbian violence that has swept all segments of life in Kosova. Despite the NATO ultimatum to interrupt the destructive operations of the parties in Bosnia, the international community does not dare to divert its attention away from Kosova, Rugova pointed out. He considered the trials held in Kosova as trumped-up political charges, now obsolete even in the former communist countries, which aim to discredit the peaceful policy followed by the political leadership and the Albanian people of Kosova. Asked by Serbian reporters how he assesses the newest Russian initiative to unblock Sarajevo, Rugova answered that the Russian initiative is good as long as this will be supported by the Serbian party. Asked to comment on several articles in the Serbian press on the alleged cracks in inter-Albanian relations, based on the results of the last congress of the Party of Democratic Prosperity, President Rugova was categorical that no discrepancies exist between Tirana and Prishtina and him and Chairman Berisha. We hope that even the problems within the Party of Democratic Prosperity will be expeditiously overcome through a pure cooperation and reciprocal tolerance. President Rugova also answered other questions by reporters.
