Consequently, sources of the National Foreign Trade Council [Conacex] and the National Association of Mexican Importers and Exporters warned that the Commerce and Industrial Development Secretariat [Secofi] will not begin negotiations until after federal elections take place in Mexico. Between June and September, the governments of the three countries will seek to correct NAFTA administrative deficiencies because there are bureaucratic hitches that still hinder the trade of products, representatives of local and U.S. chambers added. Businessmen also stated that the month granted by the Secofi to producers to conduct consultations and make the necessary studies is not enough. Since October 1993, the Mexican, U.S., and Canadian Governments agreed to convene a new negotiation on NAFTA sections under Article 302, part three of the agreement. Government representatives from the three countries held talks on the process from the latter part of 1993 until 23 May 1994, the date on which the list of 157 products they decided to include in the first round of negotiations was published on the Official Gazette and the U.S. Federal Register. The list is a compendium of the proposals made by the private sectors of the three countries. Mexico seeks the expeditious elimination of tariffs for over 90 products, the United States for 47, and Canada for 31. The U.S. list was the most modified because it dropped down to 47 products, after the United States had announced, last March, its intention to change schedules and tariffs for over 600 line items. Private sector sources revealed that Mexico has maintained higher tariffs for many products of U.S. interest, and underscored that the counterpart should keep in mind that the differences between the economies of the commercial partners were supposed to be reflected precisely in the schedules agreed upon for the elimination of tariffs. To the contrary, the number of tariff reductions that Mexico would like the United States to implement in an accelerated manner seeks to dismantle the protectionist mechanisms in force in that country, because the United States has not carried out a "unilateral liberalization." The resolution published in the Mexican Official Gazette indicates that within the month following the publication, Mexican productive sectors will determine which products with lower tariffs benefit Mexican businessmen. Sources consulted said then that two weeks after investigations conclude, Herminio Blanco, under secretary for international trade negotiations of the Commerce and Industries Development Secretariat, is expected to meet with U.S. and Canadian counterparts Rufus Yerxa and John Weekes, respectively, for a "give and take." Since 23 May, representatives of the local chambers of products involved expressed their opposition to a process to eliminate tariffs. Within Conacex and ANIERM, businessmen have emphasized that the month designated for consultations is not enough and that it is rather hasty since NAFTA has only been in effect for five months. The businessmen explained that, in addition to confusion among industrialists who have not recovered yet from the shock caused by the implementation of NAFTA, the political situation Mexico is currently facing is too precarious to implement an accelerated elimination of tariffs. The anonymous sources anticipated that the Mexican Government will not engage in any negotiations until after the 21 August elections. "These are difficult political times, and the Mexican business sector is in no shape to conduct negotiations, a source added. However, they mentioned that representatives of the sectors involved in the process will have to ask Secofi for an extension. Meanwhile, representatives of U.S. and Mexican industrial chambers stressed that, thus far, U.S. and Mexican authorities will try to solve and eliminate the bureaucratic problems that hinder foreign trade. Such topics as paperwork and excessive bureaucracy will be reviewed. Problems classifying products into line items have occurred in both the United States and Mexico, because each country has a different set of regulations. The use of certificates-of-origin and place-of-origin regulations constitute nontariff obstacles that have hindered trade in North America.
