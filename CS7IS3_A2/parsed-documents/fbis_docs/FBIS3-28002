Commission chief Kan Kato told reporters that "almost 90 percent" of the advisory tax panel members reaffirmed at an afternoon meeting that the timing and rate of a consumption tax increase must be spelled out in the same tax reform law that cuts income tax. Kato also rejected proposals to decouple the two measures but issue a government statement that the consumption tax would be raised later to pay for the tax cut. Asked about the reported plan, Kato said, "I think we would not be able to accept it." He repeatedly stressed that the two issues must be dealt with explicitly to elicit the support of the people and said a vague handling of the matter would be "hiding" something from the people. The result would be "uncertainty and unease" among the public, which could damage the economy, Kato said. The issue of linking the income tax cut and an increase in the consumption tax rate has torn at the governing coalition, which must settle the matter to fashion the economic stimulus package that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has promised to announce Thursday. The largest coalition member, the Social Democratic Party, opposes raising the 3 percent consumption tax, while the Finance Ministry insists that the two must be linked by law. Kato, a Keio University professor, noted that Hosokawa has vowed to respect the commission's recommendations on the tax issue and said he trusts the prime minister will do so. He said it is mistaken to think that raising the consumption tax would hurt the economy. Simulations show that consumption picks up on "last-minute demand" as implementation of the tax hike approaches and that even if it declines temporarily after the hike, consumption recovers within a half year, he said. Public support for the consumption tax has increased since it was introduced five years ago and the need for structural reform must be explained clearly to the public, Kato said. The current prolonged recession is structural, not cyclical, and this would be a good time for structural reform, including revamping the tax system, he said. Kato said the panel would probably meet again Friday and Monday but that it has largely determined the "direction" of its final fiscal 1994 tax reform report, which is to be issued Tuesday.
