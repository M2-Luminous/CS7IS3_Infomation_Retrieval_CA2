1Because data necessary to classify some hospitals by category were missing, the total number of hospitals in each category may not equal the national total. Hospital-specific data and discharges data are from FY 1993, and hospital cost report data are from reporting periods beginning in FY 1992. 2This column illustrates the changes in FY 1995 payments due to the elimination of the separate rural standardized amount by adjusting the rural amount to equal the other urban amount, in accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act. 3This column displays the payment impacts of the recalibration of the DRG weights and classification changes, based on FY 1993 MedPAR data, in accordance with section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act. 4This column shows the payment effects of updating the data used to calculate the wage index with data from the FY 1991 cost reports. 5This column displays the effects of the changes to transfer policy. It compares payments under our current policy with those resulting by changing the per diem methodology and revising the definition of transfers to include cases going to excluded hospitals or units. 6Shown here are the combined effects of geographic reclassification by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board (MGCRB). The effects shown here are exclusive of payment changes from FY 1994 to FY 1995, and therefore do not factor into the percent changes shown in Column 7. 7This column displays the impacts of the outlier change in accordance with section 13501(c) of Pub. L. 103&hyph;66. 8This column shows changes in payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. It incorporates all of the changes displayed in columns 1 through 6. It also displays the updates to the FY 1995 standardized amounts, change in hospitals' reclassification status in FY 1995 compared to FY 1994, the effects of the higher DSH payments for urban hospitals with 100 or more beds and rural hospitals with 500 or more beds, the elimination of the Medicare-dependent, small rural hospital provision, and the difference in projected outlier payments from FY 1994 to FY 1995. The sum of the first six columns plus these effects may be slightly different from the percentage changes shown here, due to rounding errors and interactive effects.
