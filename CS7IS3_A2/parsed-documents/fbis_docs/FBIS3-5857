He added that "he would avoid relying on either of the big powers for weapons supply," and made it clear that Malaysia will continue to purchase weapons not only from the United States but also from a number of countries, including Russian-made MiG fighters. He also emphasized the necessity of expanding multilateral dialogue to prevent conflicts. He made it clear that he would request from Japan the knowhow and money for maintaining the security of the Malacca Straits. As for foreign relations, including those with the United States and Europe, the defense minister stressed that "ours is based on mutual respect." He made reference to press reports on suspected scandals involving Malaysian Government leaders in such projects as the British export of weapons and construction of power plants developing into the economic sanctions against the United Kingdom. He said, "I do not intend to apply pressure on mass media but I have to give signals that unfounded slanders against foreign leaders cannot be tolerated." With reference to guaranteeing security, he said: "Modernizing outdated defense capabilities is a priority for the security of Malaysia, situated in a geopolitial location surrounded by wide seas. It is not intended to respond to specific threats but is a due conclusion of logic. Modernization of armaments is different from expansion of armaments." At the same time, he made a point of emphasizing independence in choosing armaments and techniques by saying "you cannot rely on outsiders for security." As for the kind of the next-generation fighter planes for which hot contests have been waged by U.S. F-18's and Russian MiG-29's, he made it public that MiGs are included as a future choice. Leading Defense Ministry officials present at the interview said: "It is based on the policy of avoiding reliance on one country in weapons purchases." In the meantime, the defense minister said: "Security must be dealt with in a broad sense, including economy, psychology, sentiments, and welfare and environmental problems as well as from a military point of view. It is rather dangerous to think of filling the power vacuum caused by post-Cold War changes of the big powers. Importance must be attached to the maintenance of good relations, with emphasis on economy, with all countries." Based on that viewpoint, he pointed out "the importance of preventive diplomacy based on military [preparedness]." He placed a high value on ASEAN's first security forum to be participated in by Japan and the United States and so on in late July at Bangkok by saying that "it shows that trust is being built up." As for the Asia Pacific Economic Council [APEC], he said, "We will join in so far as it does not incorporate ASEAN or institutionalize it." He said that "he believes that Prime Minister D.S. Mahathir bin Mohamed will participate" in the APEC summit to be convened in Jakarta at the end of the year. With reference to China, he "hopes for it to continue policies to encourage foreign investments for its economic modernization and does not anticipate security problems, at least for a short while." He added: "But I understand that China has lingering domestic problems. I am closely following what movements the Chinese leadership will make after Deng Xiaoping and on the modernization of armaments, including the introduction of long-range bombers and aircraft carriers." As for Vietnam, he said: "Now is the time for her to share the development and prosperity of Southeast Asia," welcomed "her restored relation with the United States," and made public that he intends to lead other nations in assisting her participation in ASEAN. With regards to Japan, he looks forward to more contributions to the area in economic, technical, and medical fields and asked Japan to "share efforts in maintaining security" in the Malacca Straits. As for the East Asia Economic Council being promoted by Malaysia, he asked for Japanese agreement by saying: "I am waiting, although I have not obtained any new indication." At the same time, he indicated that he would press for more opening up of markets by saying: "The Japanese markets are very important to our country in the course of pursuing industrialization." Defense Minister Najib -- number three man in UMNO [the United Malays National Organization], a national organization of Malays as well as the ruling political party. Son of the late Razhak, the second prime minister after independence. After graduating from a British university he served in important government posts. Though young at age 40, he is regarded as the man of influence next to Prime Minister Mahathir and D.S. Anwar bin Ibrahim, deputy prime minister and finance minister.
