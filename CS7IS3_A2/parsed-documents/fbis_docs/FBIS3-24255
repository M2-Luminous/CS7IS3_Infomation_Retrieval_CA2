However, this does not mean that there are no politicians who ascribe a paramount role to the content of the message. An analysis of the "compatibility" of the positions of the president and parliament, conducted by Sergey Glazyev in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, is an example of this. Glazyev not only comes to interesting conclusions, but he also shares some of the optimism of the president's message--not in an assessment of the economic situation, but in Boris Yeltsin's arrangement of priorities and in the spirit of the message, which, in his opinion, makes it possible to hope for constructive cooperation (the chairman of a Duma committee thinks that the most important priorities are the conduct of an active structural policy, the stimulation of the formation of financial-industrial groups, a mechanism for real control over state property and the creation of institutions of social partnership, and reform of the tax system). The president's message on economic policy priorities that was presented last week to the Federal Assembly is very close to the recommendations that were developed by the economic policy committee in parliamentary hearings on 10 February, believes Sergey Glazyev. Although, in his words, there are several rather serious differences between the position of the president and parliament. In particular, there is a serious difference in the assessment of the current state of the economy. The president is far more optimistic. "One of the main theses of the message which relates to the economy states that we have moved away from the edge of the abyss. As for our conclusions, which we made on the basis of materials of the government and independent experts, for us it is evident that we have entered into a state of catastrophe. Perhaps the situation in society obliges the president to come out with optimistic positions." One other difference, according to Glazyev, is the need to depart from stereotypes in explaining the economic difficulties as a fight between the supporters and opponents of reform. "The hearings in the State Duma have shown that there is no kind of `class struggle' around the most important directions of economic policy." However, Sergey Glazyev thinks that it is much more fruitful to examine the "positive" theses of the report, which propose specific measures for the resolution of problems and not only an assessment of today's situation. For example, the report sets the near-term task of developing a law that clearly establishes the rules of functioning of state organs, first and foremost of the executive authority. But the Duma is also seriously troubled today by the absence of any kind of responsibility for the management of state property. "The committee for the management of state property is engaged in everything but the administration of state property--in fact, tasks for the effective administration of state property have generally dropped out of the spheres of interest of the government. The main task is considered to be the distribution of state property, regardless of whether it is effective or not and whether it is economically justified. State property does not bring incomes, and even its privatization in 1993 and 1994 gives a figure that is surprisingly close to zero. In addition, the state, instead of receiving incomes from its property, increases the tax burden, suppressing economic growth and the private sector, for the sake of which, by the way, privatization is being conducted." It is for these reasons that the Duma is now engaged first and foremost in the development of the laws "On Public Property" and "On the Administration of State Property." It is important in these laws to clearly establish the responsibility of the government for the implementation both of functional tasks (such as, for example, support of the infrastructure) as well as tasks in the income sphere. "The further spontaneous squandering of property simply is impermissible under conditions of a sharp reduction in the income part of the budget, and we hope that order will finally be brought to this sphere in 1944, as well as to the sphere of distribution of state credits and export quotas." The very same thing concerns the presidential position on replacing an authorized right by a notifying right. "There is probably not one businessman who would not severely criticize bureaucratic arbitrariness in the resolution of entrepreneurial activity. State interference has to be justified from a position of economic effectiveness." In the law that the Duma is preparing, according to Glazyev's words, it is the notifying principle that will become the basis of economic activity so that the development of small business would be the norm (by making penetration of the market easier), and state regulation would concern only public interests and the guarantee of legality. What is more, this task, in the opinion of the chairman of the committee for economic policy, can be evaluated even more highly than privatization. There are many enterprises that it makes no sense to privatize--they are not efficient, and they cannot avoid bankruptcy and readjustment. Nonetheless, the government will have to be concerned about them. Far more important is the formation of new enterprises that emerge straight off according to the laws of the market. In the last two years, this sector of work was abandoned--naturally, instead of a market system, we acquired an extremely confused system of property relations, which is rather reminiscent of the Yugoslav model. The Civil Code also has the very same coincidence of priorities, Glazyev believes. "The absence of reliable legal principles at the micro level today is the main obstacle to rationalization of all of economic life: The lack of necessary mechanisms of responsibility leads to chaos at the micro level, which also gives rise to `macro chaos'--inflation, nonpayments, and the like." The Duma is ready even to apply the Civil Code in parts. "It should be acknowledged that in many ways the law enforcement organs are passive with respect to the fight against unfair competition, deception, illegal advertising, and corruption--this is associated in part with problems in legislation." The fact that this problem was highlighted in the president's message speaks not only of the logical coincidence of positions, but also of the significance of this problem." In Glazyev's opinion, however, it is not only the legislative "holes" that are to blame for the passivity of law enforcement organs, but also simply the careless fulfillment of responsibilities. Such as, for example, the continuous advertising of the export of capital, and other violations of legislation. "When I was still working for the MVES [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations], I made inquiries of the MB [Ministry of Security] regarding the suppression of advertisements of criminal activities in the mass media, but I did not receive anything intelligible from there." In the section "On Personal Security," Glazyev sees much that is similar, especially in the guarantee of health services. "Practically all of the parties in the Duma note the need to form a rational system of compulsory medical insurance." This also concerns the involvement of Russian enterprises in the production of modern medicines. "I introduced a proposal to prohibit the allocation of state resources for the import of equipment that is produced in Russia, but I did not find any support," says Glazyev. The expenditure of taxpayers' money should be for investment in economic growth in the country. When, owing to this money, a stimulation of imports occurs, this, in Glazyev's opinion, cannot be justified either from a common-sense standpoint or from the standpoint of economic theory. "We intend to make amendments to the law `On Supplies of Products and Commodities for State Needs,' which will limit opportunities for using state budget resources for the purchase of foreign goods, thereby bringing our rules into conformity with world practice." Although, in Glazyev's opinion, this concerns not only the central, but also the regional budgets. An example of this are imported luxury cars, whose purchase is made by regional organs of authority against a background of slogans about support for domestic producers. According to the section "On Federalism," there is also much that is in common: In the words of the former minister, the Duma will work on the law on demarcating tax payments, legislation on local self-government, and the guarantee of territorial justice--all of this is in the plan of priority legislative work. The sole difference with the president's message is here--the harsh attitude toward treaties between the Federation and its subjects. According to Glazyev's information, many in the State Duma think that such treaties are dangerous. "The treaties signed with a number of subjects of the Federation in 1992-1993 became the basis for disintegration processes and demands for privileges and concessions in trade policy and in foreign economic activity, which it is impossible to do if, of course, we view Russia as a state with a single economic space (as the president does in his message). In my opinion, this development of internal treaty processes should be avoided." The Duma will unquestionably support the process of review of privileges of individual territories that infringe on the rights of other regions and their populations. "However, the need for this, it was stated in the president's message, does not in any way attach to the recent edict, for example, concerning Kaliningrad Oblast." Yeltsin's proposal on tax reform coincides with the positions of many Duma deputies. "The president's message talks about the fact that rent can become an important source of incomes. This is one of the conclusions of the economic conference that was considered in the Duma and which consists in the need to increase the role of rental payments in the incomes of the federal and regional budgets." Many theses and corresponding recommendations on parliamentary relations are contained in the section "Toward a Social State Through a Market Economy." "This, naturally, is an increase in investment activity and the need to conduct a structural restructuring. We also intend to adopt the laws `On Foreign Economic Activity,' `On State Scientific-Technical Policy,' `On Non-Commercial Organizations,' and `On State Support of Small Business'--I already spoke earlier about several other congruences." In Glazyev's words, the Duma will support the reform of the account system in the Central Bank. In particular, an examination will be made of the laws "On Banks and Banking Activity" and "On the Central Bank of Russia." "The thesis contained in the report concerning the FRS [Federal Reserve System], of course, needs serious analysis and detailed deciphering, because there could be absolutely different models of organization behind the words `Federal Reserve System'--both in the configuration of the reserve banks and in their mutual relations." The thesis on the need to establish financial-industrial groups aroused Glazyev's particular attention. In Glazyev's opinion, this is the only realistic method today of overcoming the break between the industrial and banking sectors. "In 1992-1993, the banking system developed separately from industry, and it financed trade. The further parallel existence of capital and industrial enterprises is simply impossible. This is first. Second, the privatization program has led to a break in many highly technological production chains, both vertically and horizontally. The result was an increase in the sources of inflation at a micro level. We did not achieve the elimination of monopolism in the economy, but then we lost control, because we took the path of breaking up the monopolistic enterprises. Acceleration in the creation of FPG's [financial industrial groups] is not only a necessary condition for achieving competitiveness for Russian products on the world market, but also for the achievement of macro-economic stabilization. This point of view is shared by a majority in industrial and in scientific circles--and it finds complete understanding in the State Duma." But if this thesis of the presidential message is followed, then, as Glazyev thinks, "We will have to make a lot of changes in the state privatization program. If the government conducts the policy of the president, then it must go along with these changes. We await a more considered approach to privatization this year, and we hope that this work will move in contact with the Federal Assembly (in accordance with the law, privatization programs should have the status of federal laws, and not presidential edicts)." In Glazyev's opinion, in the part on the redesign of the tax system, it is possible to ascertain almost a complete congruence both with the position of the economic conference and with the recommendations of the parliamentary hearings. The same applies to the remarks of the president on the support of science-intensive industry. "Those spheres of the scientific-industrial complex that could become the support of our economic growth are the ones today that are the most exposed to destructive tendencies." In this sense, the differences in the evaluation of the situation in the country are quite fundamental for Glazyev. He thinks that the irreversible "de-industrialization" of the country is already moving at full speed: "We will not be able to reestablish much of the science-intensive production, and we have already lost substantial reserves of future economic growth. The reckoning is literally in months--if emergency measures to support science-intensive industry are not adopted in the near term, then we could lose the prospect of growth or even a partial restoration for all time--we will enter the zone of a prolonged structural depression with the absence of any kind of growth for a decade." Glazyev thinks that the passivity of the government is "simply incomprehensible." For example, it is not known to this day, however, whether the program for the support of science-intensive exports, which was expected since the middle of 1993, is included in the budget message for 1994. The same applies to the president's initiative on social partnership. The Duma, according to Sergey Glazyev's words, is ready for constructive work with the government to which a "majority in the State Duma can render support in exchange for a clear and reasonable program for leading the economy out of the crisis." Thus, the memorandum of accord, which the Duma adopted in a package with the decree on amnesty, contains a decree on the need to conduct "roundtables" on economic and social policy "for the purpose of developing a national accord on the main directions of economic policy." However, Glazyev thinks that not everyone in the apparatus of the executive branch is ready for this. The former minister notes the characteristic refusals of the president's administration to give a basis for the edicts that were submitted for review by the Federal Assembly. "Apparently, it is necessary to bring order in the president's administration in the sense of implementing the political line of the chief of state"--Glazyev hopes that since the president's message came out, there will be fewer possibilities for sabotage among the workers of the administration. "If, of course, the leaders of the administration of the president this time treat the line of the president seriously and do not replace it with their own interests." Glazyev thinks that for today the main problem is implementation of the coordinated priorities of economic policy, in which the Duma will assist the government in every possible way. However, in his opinion, the monitoring functions of the State Duma should also not be forgotten and, based on the task of their implementation, the Duma also requires publication of the government program--the "Workers' Program" that exists today for the implementation of priorities established by the president and the State Duma is obviously inadequate. According to Glazyev, the government program should include not only a list of decrees that must be adopted without fail, but also specific indicators and parameters for the desired condition of the economy of the country, and also the planned indicators for those departments that are engaged in the management of state property. Glazyev also believes that a system of monitoring the results of the economic policy being conducted should be provided.
