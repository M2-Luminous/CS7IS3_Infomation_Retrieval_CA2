The date is May 30. A "check date," May 15, was agreed upon in the talks with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin, Klaus said, adding that in case of problems the two premiers would speak over the phone on May 16 in order to remove the obstacles. The agreement does not mean that the Russian debt, worth some $3.4 billion, will be paid back "starting tomorrow or the day after tomorrow," Klaus noted. "The agreement means a written acknowledgement of the debt and establishment of clear relations and clear schedule of the payments," he added. The debt will be partly repaid on the basis of the principles of the "Paris Club of creditors," the rest by deliveries of goods and through Czech participation in Russian privatization. Klaus admitted that the Czech Republic had been striving for collecting the debt by other means than through the Paris club which comprises economically advanced countries. "We had hoped for a long time that we would be able to find other ways of payment, not being viewed as the rich West to which payments are made belatedly. I have to admit these dreams were unrealistic," Klaus said. Klaus said he had not discussed security issues with President Boris Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin.
