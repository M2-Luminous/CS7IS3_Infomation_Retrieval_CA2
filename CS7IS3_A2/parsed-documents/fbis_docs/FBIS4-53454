Asked to clarify Sakigake's political stand, Masayoshi Takemura (hereinafter Takemura) says: "As I said during my Diet speech, we have responsibilities to fulfill because we worked with the Hosokawa administration in preparing the budget and enacting the laws. Therefore, we will act as a ruling party and cooperate with them as far as the budget and the laws are concerned, at least during the current Diet session." He adds: "However, as far as the Hata administration's new policies are concerned, we will carefully study them and make a decision as to whether or not we will support them. We will act as a wholesome opposition party close to the ruling parties. You can say we are an opposition party because we will be assuming a stand opposing the government in some cases and supporting it in others, depending on the issue at hand. We will act in conjunction with the ruling parties during the current Diet session and become a wholesome opposition party after that." On the possibility of summoning former Prime Minister Hosokawa to the Diet to testify on the issue of his loan from Sagawa Kyubin, Takemura says that it may be inevitable. At the same time, Takemura also says that as a member of the former Hosokawa administration, he hopes that Diet testimony will be avoided. Asked how Sakigake will respond if the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) brings up a no-confidence motion in the Diet, Takemura answers: "We still have not thought that far ahead." He says his party will not be interested in a no-confidence motion until the budget and the bills are approved." On the issue of general elections, Takemura says: "We should complete the redrawing of electoral districts as soon as possible. I think the Diet should be dissolved after we form a new election system." Turning to the issue of tax reform, Kuroiwa asks Takemura if his party is against the idea of increasing indirect taxes. In response, Takemura explains the need promote tax reform to cope with an aging society. Kuroiwa then asks whether Sakigake attaches importance to relations with the United States. Takemura answers: "Of course we attach importance to relations with the United States. We cannot destroy the framework of our political and economic ties and military alliance with the United States." Asked whether Sakigake thinks Japan should cooperate with the United States in imposing sanctions against North Korea without waiting for a UN decision, Takemura says that it is not a good idea to talk about this issue on the basis of assumptions. He continues to say: "Frankly speaking, I think that without China, our diplomatic or military policies toward the DPRK will have no effect." Asked if Sakigake will form close ties with the LDP, Takemura says that his party will seek cooperation with the LDP in wide- ranging areas. He also says: "Our understanding is that the reorganization of the political world will be realized by involving the DLP."
