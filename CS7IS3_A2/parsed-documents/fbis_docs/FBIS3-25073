The cabinet members and he discussed the devaluation of the CFA franc. The cabinet members used the opportunity to express their desire to embark upon a new policy of diversifying our economy through the transformation of our raw materials locally. They suggested that the government should abandon extravagant projects and concentrate on agricultural and rural programs. For more details, let us listen to Patrice Nziengui, minister of communication, posts, and telecommunications in charge of relations with the assemblies and spokesman of the government, as he reads the communique issued at that meeting: [Begin Nziengui recording] Under the distinguished chairmanship of his Excellency El-Hajj Omar Bongo, president of the Republic and head of state, a cabinet meeting was held today at the usual meeting room of the Presidency of the Republic. Before discussing the items on the agenda, the prime minister and head of government briefed the cabinet on the National Assembly plenary session held on 2 February which was devoted to the devaluation of the CFA franc. The prime minister's address to the National Assembly had three goals: To inform the legislators about this very important matter, namely the devaluation, to take stock of their views on the issue, and to reaffirm the government's determination to harmonize relations between the government and the National Assembly. The prime minister expressed satisfaction with the frank cooperation demonstrated by the legislators. In view of the importance of the issue and its disastrous effects on consumption and the purchasing power of Gabonese nationals, the government stressed the need for a policy oriented toward local production which should be beneficial for our economy. In this regard, the cabinet made it a point to reaffirm its determination to embark upon a policy of diversifying our economy through the transformation of our raw materials locally, in particular in the fields of timber production and agriculture. The government will also abandon extravagant programs and rather increase rural agricultural projects. Concerning compensatory measures suggested by France, the government noted with satisfaction that [words indistinct] has called on the government to work towards the total cancellation of Gabon's bilateral debt. Also, the parliamentarians made concrete proposals which are now being examined in the various ministries. Examining the problem of price increases, the cabinet reaffirmed the need to ensure the respect of the measures earlier adopted. As part of compensatory measures following the devaluation of the CFA franc and upon the proposal of the minister of finance, the cabinet adopted a draft bill prohibiting any increase in the cost of transactions effected in the CFA franc as a result of the devaluation. This decree stipulates that prices fixed in agreements or contracts will remain unchanged after devaluation. Consequently, any increase in costs not provided for in transactions, and in particular for reasons connected to the change in the parity of the local currency, is forbidden. This decree became necessary in order to prevent speculation by owners of property and buildings who, in their desire to take advantage of the change in parity of the CFA franc, may be tempted to revise sales contracts that have been legally agreed upon.
