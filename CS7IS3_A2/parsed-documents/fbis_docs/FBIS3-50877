Indians and peasants arriving in San Cristobal are being placed in a relief shelter called Don Bosco. The National Human Rights Commission has asked the San Cristobal Municipal Government and the state and federal governments to set up shelters immediately. It is expected that more families will arrive in San Cristobal during Friday evening and Saturday. In Tuxtla Gutierrez, near Chapa de Corso, military checkpoints supported by the Federal Highway Patrol have increased their search of vehicles. Schools in San Cristobal de las Casas and other cities near the war zone are still paralyzed. Mexican Army vehicles have started leaving San Cristobal to take supplies to the war zone. The supplies will be distributed in affected towns, which are calling for water and food in order to survive. In Tuxtla Gutierrez, the capital of Chiapas, 14 detainees were turned over to the Attorney General's Office. Also in Tuxtla, at least 48 bodies were exhumed from San Marcos cemetery vaults. The bodies were considerably decayed. Rubber gloves and face masks were found at the cemetery as well as numbers that had been assigned to the bodies. Combat between the Army and the armed groups occurs primarily during the evening and morning. Trucks with vegetables circulated between San Cristobal de las Casas and Tuxtla Gutierrez on Friday. The Indian communities in Chiapas Heights are the primary vegetable suppliers for the state capital and San Cristobal. The only way to San Cristobal de las Casas is through Tuxtla. There is no other way, because the other highways are closed and the war zone is isolated.
