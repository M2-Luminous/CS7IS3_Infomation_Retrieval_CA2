[Scharping] The fear of the Central and East European states that they will once again be dominated by Moscow as in the past must be taken seriously. The supreme goal is security. Therefore, it is useful to give states such as Poland, Hungary, and Czechia, and perhaps even Slovakia and others, a security policy prospect by using the existing instruments of NATO and CSCE. [Koch] Can this be done overnight? [Scharping] No, one must also take the legitimate security interests of Russia and the other CIS states into account. We must not give any cheap excuses to the nationalist, partly fascist, and in any case antiwestern and antidemocratic forces in Russia. Therefore, this will have to be a step-by-step process, which particularly must not ignore the economic side. There are large markets for us in the East. [Koch] Should Russia also become a NATO member in the long run? [Scharping] I think Russia's accession to NATO is not realistic from today's point of view.
