FR940527-0-00093 FR940527-0-00028 Item XXI_Four Ton Dolly Jacks This revises and converts the interim rule, published as Item XXVII in DAC 91&hyph;5, to a final rule. The interim rule implemented section 9108 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Appropriations Act. DFARS section 225.7018 and the clause at section 252.225&hyph;7033 were added to restrict purchases of four ton dolly jacks to U.S. manufacturers. DFARS section 225.7018 is revised to limit this restriction to Fiscal Year 1993 funds. This restriction does not appear in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act. Item XXII_Coal and Petroleum Pitch Carbon Fiber DFARS section 225.7020 and the clause at section 252.225&hyph;7034 are added to restrict purchases of coal and petroleum pitch carbon fiber. This implements section 8040A of Public Law 102&hyph;172 and section 9040A of Public Law 102&hyph;396. Item XXIII_Antifriction Bearings This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXVII of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule with no revisions. The interim rule moved the restriction on antifriction bearings from DFARS subpart 225.71 to DFARS subpart 225.70 because it is now a statutory restriction based on section 832 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act. Section 832 restricts acquisition of antifriction bearings through FY 1995. Item XXIV_Subcontractor Payment Complaints On September 27, 1993 the Director of Defense Procurement issued to the Military Departments and Defense Agencies, a memorandum discussing the actions to be taken to address complaints by subcontractors of nonpayment by a DoD prime contractor. Recent General Accounting Office and DoD Inspector General reviews have caused concern that this matter is not fully understood in all locations. Copies of the memorandum should be obtained through normal management channels. Item XXV_Supplemental Cost Principles DFARS section 231.100&hyph;70 is revised to narrow the prescription for use of the clause at section 252.231&hyph;7000, Supplemental Cost Principles. The cost principles in DFARS do not apply to contracts with educational institutions. Item XXVI_Penalties for Unallowable Costs This revises and finalizes the interim rule issued as Item XXXIV of DAC 91&hyph;5. The interim rule revised DFARS section 231.70 and the clause at sections 252.231&hyph;7001, Penalties for Unallowable Costs, to implement section 818 of the Fiscal Year 1993 Defense Authorization Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;484). Changes between the interim and final rule include: _Sections 231.7000(a) and 252.231&hyph;7001(b)_Insertion of the word ``indirect'' between the words ``unallowable'' and ``costs'' to clarify that the penalties apply to unallowable ``indirect'' and not ``direct'' costs. _Section 231.7002&hyph;1(b)_Added ``administrative'' to the types of penalties which may be imposed. _Section 231.7002&hyph;5(c)(1)_In the parenthetical, inserted the words ``the types of controls required for'' to make the waiver available to contractors which do not formally participate in a DoD sponsored self-governance program. _Section 252.231&hyph;7001(e)_Inserted the words ``allocated to this contract'' to make it clear that the penalty is not based on the total amount of unallowable costs in the indirect costs proposal. Item XXVII_Reduction in Progress Payment Rates This is an interim rule issued by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;009 on November 18, 1993 to implement Section 8155 of the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Appropriations Act (Pub. L. 103&hyph;139). Section 8155 requires the Department of Defense to reduce the customary progress payment rate for large businesses from 85 percent to 75 percent for solicitations issued on or after November 11, 1993. This includes awards to large businesses under foreign military sales contracts. The rule revised language in DFARS section 232.501&hyph;1 and the clause at section 252.232&hyph;7004. It also revised Table 32&hyph;1 at section 232.502&hyph;1&hyph;71 to preclude the use of flexible progress payments in contracts resulting from solicitations issued on or after November 11, 1993. Item XXVIII_Overseas Severance Costs This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXXII of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule without change. The interim rule added DFARS section 237.171 to establish the criteria and conditions for agency waiver of the cost limitations at section 231.205&hyph;6 and it added clauses at sections 252.237&hyph;7020 and 252.237&hyph;7021. Item XXIX_Legislative Lobbying Costs This item converts the interim rule published as Item XXXIII of DAC 91&hyph;5 to a final rule without change. The interim rule added DFARS section 231.205&hyph;22(a) to make unallowable the costs of preparing any material, report, list, or analysis on the actual or projected economic or employment impact in a particular State or congressional district of an acquisition program for which all research, development, testing and evaluation has not been completed. Item XXX_Incremental Funding of Fixed-Price Contracts This interim rule was issued by Departmental Letter 93&hyph;008, effective August 23, 1993. The rule added a new subpart at DFARS section 232.7 to establish specific situations where incremental funding of fixed-price contracts would be appropriate. The clause at section 252.232&hyph;7007, Limitation of Government's Obligation, identifies procedures for incrementally funding the contract and requires the contractor to provide the Government with written notice when the work will reach the point at which the amount payable by the Government, including any termination costs, approximates 85 percent of the funds currently allotted to the contract. Item XXXI_GAO Bid Protest Procedures This final rule removes the detailed GAO protest procedures at section 233.104 from the DFARS. Comparable language was added to the FAR as Item XVII of FAC 90&hyph;16. Item XXXII_Certification of Contract Claims This revises and finalizes the interim rule issued as Item XXXVI of DAC 91&hyph;5. The interim rule revised DFARS subpart 233.70 and the clause at section 252.233&hyph;7000, Certification of Claims and Requests for Adjustment or Relief, to implement section 813 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;484). Changes between the interim and final rule include: _Section 233.7000(a)_Insertion of the words ``or request'' after the word ``claim'' in section 233.7000(a)(1); insertion of the words ``who is authorized to bind the contractor and'' after the word ``individual'' in section 233.7000(a)(2); and an editorial at section 233.7000(a)(2)(ii). _Section 252.233&hyph;7000_In the certification language, deletion of the word ``and'' after the words ``knowledge and belief''; and revising the last portion of the certification to read ``duly authorized to certify the claim on behalf of the contractor.'' Also, in paragraph (d) of the clause, insertion of the words ``who is authorized to bind the contractor and'' after the words ``signed by an individual.'' Item XXXIII_Fixed Price Development Contracts DFARS section 235.006(b)(ii) is revised to clarify the requirement for USD(A&T) approval of the Government's prenegotiation position before negotiations begin and of the negotiated agreement with the contractor before it is executed. Item XXXIV_Basic Agreements DFARS section 235.015(b) is amended to delete the reference to the Office of Naval Research as the central DoD activity for negotiating basic agreements. This reflects the fact that DoD no longer requires a single DoD activity to perform this function.
