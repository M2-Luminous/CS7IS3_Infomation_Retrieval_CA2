He added that the parliament had, after all, the right to change the Basic Law and that this was no reason to threaten it with dismissal. Tadeusz Mazowiecki also said he was not in favor of changes to the Constitution because this situation concerned a dispute between the ruling coalition and the president. A proper constitution should be set up once and for all, declared the UD leader.
