Thus, they went so far as to consider the Elipton a sonic weapon, a biological weapon, and even a microwave weapon, while the true nature of this military-technical system was lost in the general cacophony. Elipton is a weapon system based on gravitational interference. After the last catastrophic earthquake that shook Yerevan, U.S. military analysts revealed two strange things: The catastrophe, which seemed to be a natural one, occurred at a "providential" moment to halt Armenia's autonomist tendencies and it also offered the Soviet political-military authorities a good pretext to liquidate the Armenian nuclear power industry, and thus impose an acute energy dependence on that central republic; the second element refers to the fact that early-warning satellites recorded an orbital "double lightning," which preceded, by a very short time, the earthquake. That was an unmistakable sign of the detonation of a small-size nuclear load, contravening all currently valid international treaties. It was easy to draw conclusions: The Soviets have discovered a way to trigger earthquakes. Ten months later, using a rocket launched from an F-15 fighter-bomber (ASAT system), the United States managed to intercept, for the first time, a low-orbit satellite. The system was allegedly designed to destroy Soviet spy satellites, but actually it was the sole efficient defense to counter the use of the Elipton over U.S. territory. However, certain rumors had already reached the ears of the mass media -- it was the time when many people believed in an imminent and catastrophic reactivation of the San Andreas fault, some sources even held it possible that "half of California would sink into the ocean," as a consequence of a devastating earthquake. The advantages of the Elipton are obvious: It is a discreet weapon, and any accusations can be brushed off by saying it is a "phantasm," provided that it is used by daylight, so that its lightning could be camouflaged by the sun's natural light. It is quite significant, that merely three days after Zhirinovskiy's extremely allusive statement regarding the Elipton, the Geophysical Institute of the Russian Academy organized a news conference on the issue of seismic weapons, although no one had explicitly talked about such a thing. That news conference seems to be rather the result of panic. The Russians did not know precisely to what extent Zhirinovskiy, the former GRU [Soviet Military Intelligence] agent, had divulged about the Elipton, and they assumed that Western journalists were at least aware of the exact nature of that weapons system and the name of the person coordinating the program, which, as it later turned out, was not the case at all. During this news conference they claimed that in fact the Elipton does not exist at all: "Earthquakes cannot be triggered except in the places where nature has already prepared them," said the official statement, which, as a matter of fact, was quite precise. The statement actually confirmed previous information about the existence of the Elipton-type weapon systems and about their nature, and it also offered an exact description of the way in which they work. The Hammer [as published] triggers earthquakes wherever there is accumulated tension in the ground, which can be unleashed by a minimal variation of the gravitational acceleration. Thus, they can trigger earthquakes -- the magnitude of which, it is true, is very difficult to predict -- in areas in which over the past 1,000 years there has not been any seismic activity at all. The Romanian state is directly vulnerable to weapons such as the Hammer or the Hole [as published] that are part of the Elipton program. Important industrial centers of our country and vital establishments of our defense industry are situated in valley areas such as Tara Barsei [central Romania, where the Carpathian Mountains turn], in which the triggering of catastrophic tornadoes could cause enormous damage to our industrial infrastructure. Moreover, owing to the existence of the seismic area in Vrancea [north-eastern Romania], the possible use of Hammer-type weapons there would cause a catastrophe in Bucharest, considering the current precarious state of the buildings in our capital city. Such weapons might be used in the near future if a geopolitical conflict breaks out as a consequence of the unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania or of our country's active integration within NATO. No methods are known to counter such weapons. However, one could count on warning signs offered by attempts to use them, which fail owing to insufficient precision.
