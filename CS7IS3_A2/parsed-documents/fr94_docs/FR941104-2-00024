FR941104-2-00024 FR941104-2-00017 [Docket No. RP95&hyph;21&hyph;000] Southern Natural Gas Company; One- Year Status Report October 31, 1994. Take notice that on October 27, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing a one-year status report as required by the Commission's September 3, 1993 order in Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;10, et al. Southern states that the filing reports on (1) Southern's progress in implementing intraday nominations, and (2) the operation of its penalty waiver provision during the first year of operations. Southern states that it is making a transportation tariff filing today in a separate docket which will implement intra-day nomination procedures effective December 5, 1994. Southern's report also discusses the systemwide and shipper-specific penalty waivers granted during its first year and concludes that the waiver provision operated effectively to avoid penalizing Shippers who were trying to take appropriate actions, but incurred penalties as a result of late or faulty information. Southern states that copies of the filing will be served on parties to Docket Nos. RS92&hyph;10, et al., and all shippers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions and protests should be filed on or before November 21, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
