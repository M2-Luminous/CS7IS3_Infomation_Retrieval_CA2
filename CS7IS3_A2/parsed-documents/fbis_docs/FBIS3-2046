Speaking at a national conference on poverty elimination, which was attended by Premier Li Peng and other senior Chinese leaders, Jiang said that the most important experience which China has gained from its progress in past poverty reduction is the shift of the poverty alleviation policy from merely material aid to comprehensive social and economic development strategy in poor areas. Practice shows that a poverty reduction strategy which is market- oriented, relies on advancement of science and technology and exploitation of local resources, will not only provide enough food and clothes for the poverty-stricken people, but also a way to prosperity, said Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). He described the shift as fundamental and said it should be continued in a long period of time to come. Elimination of poverty and common prosperity is the basic requirement of socialism and reflection of the advantages of a socialist system over others, he noted. He pointed out that capable cadres should be selected and all walks of life should be mobilized to help poor areas. The party leader also stressed the need for local people's self- reliance and arduous efforts in the nationwide poverty reduction drive. Premier Li Peng said that it was an unshirkable historical responsibility of communists of his generation and people's governments of all levels to eliminate abject poverty by the year 2000, solving food and clothes shortages for the 80 million poor. The plan is a strategic measure to gradually narrow the gaps between China's developed east and the developing west, he said. The premier said that coastal areas and large and medium-sized cities, which have become relatively rich, should be encouraged to help the poor areas. The central government should give adequate financial support to the poor areas, said Li. He added that priority should be given to the poor areas when selecting a location for important investment projects. The premier also spoke of the need to rationalize the pricing of raw materials and primary products, which will benefit the poor areas that are rich in resources. Earlier, State Councillor Chen Junsheng announced on Monday at the meeting that the ambitious seven-year poverty reduction plan includes raising the annual net income of the majority of the 80 million people. According to the plan, China will begin from this year to improve infrastructure construction in poor areas, solving drinking water shortages for the people and their domestic animals, making electricity available to most poor towns and connecting remote areas with national or regional road networks. As part of the plan, China will improve the cultural, educational and public health levels in backward and poor areas, wipe out illiteracy among the young and middle-aged population, offer professional training to grown-ups and hold the natural population growth rate under the official limit. "The realization of the plan will be of great significance. It will mean that the rights to subsistence of the Chinese people, who account for one-fourth of the world's population, will have been secured," said the state councillor, who is in charge of agriculture as well as China's poverty reduction efforts. Most of the 80 million people are in remote mountain regions, rocky regions, loess plateau areas and remote deserts. During the 1986-1992 period, poverty was eased among about 45 million poor people, an average of 6.8 million each year. He disclosed that China will increase its investment in poor areas and has designated 582 counties as priority targets for poverty elimination. China's poor had decreased from 125 million in 1986 to 80 million in 1992.
