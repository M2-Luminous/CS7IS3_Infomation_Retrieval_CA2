The women who have blocked 34 military staff and 16 army vehicles since March 31 in the village of Hadzici are demanding the release of their husbands, held captive by mainly Moslem Bosnian government troops. The convoy from the French Second Battalion was travelling from Sarajevo to Split when it was held up in Hadzici, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of the Bosnian capital. "They are in constant contact with their unit, either in person or by radio, the situation is very calm and they are not at risk," Lieutenant Colonel Richard Pernod, spokesman for UNPROFOR in Sarajevo, told AFP. Top-level negotiations to free the convoy were continuing Wednesday after a week of fruitless talks. UNPROFOR civil affairs chief for former Yugoslavia Sergio Vieira de Mello tried to find a breakthrough Tuesday when he met Nikola Koljevic, deputy leader of the Bosnian Serbs, in the Serb headquarters at Pale near Sarajevo. But Koljevic said the Pale authorities had no real control over Serbs in Hadzici, UNPROFOR spokesman Rob Annink said Wednesday, adding that Mello believed the convoy would be released soon.
