The chief event of the visit will be the signing of a contract under which Russia will supply "MiG-29" fighter aircraft to Malaysia. The signing ceremony for the contract is scheduled to be held on Tuesday. Oleg Soskovets will also meet with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday. Acting Foreign Minister Abu Hassan Omar, who received the Russian delegation at the airport, told ITAR-TASS in an interview that the Malaysian side sees the contract as one link in a chain of broader cooperation with Russia in different spheres, including the military one. According to the minister, the "MiG" contract will act as a catalyst in the development of Malaysian-Russian-business ties. Stanislav Filin, deputy director-general of the state-owned arms and military equipment export-import company "Rosvooruzheniye", told ITAR-TASS that the work on the contract had taken two years. The deal is worth 550 million U.S. dollars. The first "MiG" will be delivered in April, 1995. The full consignment of 18 aircraft will be shipped to Malaysia within 11 months. In collaboration with Malaysia, Russia is expected to set up a technical centre for servicing the planes. The contract also provides for training Malaysian pilots in Russia. According to the contract, 25 per cent of the planes' cost will be paid with supplies of palm oil with the right of export to third countries. Meeting Malaysia's wishes halfway, the Russian side has made changes in the fighters' instrument system. In particular, a navigation apparatus working on frequencies used in south-east Asia will be installed in the aircraft.
