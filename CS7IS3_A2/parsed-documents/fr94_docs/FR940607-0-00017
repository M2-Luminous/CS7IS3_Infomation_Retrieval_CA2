FR940607-0-00017 FR940607-0-00007 Example 2. Taxpayer B receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). B pays the amount of the proposed deficiency and files a claim for refund. B's claim is disallowed and a notice of proposed disallowance is issued by the District Director. B does not request an Appeals office conference and the District Director issues a notice of claim disallowance. B then files suit in a United States District Court. B cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because, although the District Director issued a notice of claim disallowance, the Internal Revenue Service did not issue either a notice of decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals or a notice of deficiency. Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that after B files a claim for refund and receives the notice of proposed disallowance, B requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. No agreement is reached with Appeals and the Office of Appeals issues a notice of claim disallowance. B does not file suit in District Court but instead contacts the Appeals office to attempt to reverse the decision. B convinces the Appeals officer that the notice of claim disallowance is in error. The Appeals officer then abates the assessment. Because a notice of claim disallowance issued by Appeals is a notice of the decision of the Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals, B may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after the receipt of the notice of claim disallowance (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. B cannot recover the costs incurred prior to receipt of the notice of claim disallowance because they were incurred before the administrative proceeding date. Example 4. Taxpayer C receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). C files a request for and is granted an Appeals office conference. At the Appeals conference no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. The Office of Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. Upon receiving the notice of deficiency C does not file a petition with the Tax Court. Instead, C pays the deficiency and files a claim for refund. The claim for refund is considered by the Internal Revenue Service and the District Director issues a notice of proposed disallowance. C requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. C convinces Appeals that C's claim is correct and Appeals allows C's claim. C may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred on or after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date), but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. Example 5. Taxpayer D receives a District Director's Collection Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. D requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Upon consideration, Appeals upholds D's position. D cannot recover reasonable administrative costs because the costs were not incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date. Example 6. Taxpayer E files an individual income tax return showing a balance due. No payment is made with the return and the Internal Revenue Service assesses the amount shown on the return. The Internal Revenue Service issues a notice and demand for tax pursuant to section 6303. E contacts the Collection Division (Collection) regarding E's outstanding liability. No agreement is reached with respect to the timing of E's payment, and Collection issues a notice of intent to levy pursuant to section 6331(d). Prior to the levy, E enters into an installment agreement with Collection. The costs that E incurred in connection with the notice and demand were not incurred in an administrative proceeding, but rather in a collection action. Accordingly, E may not recover those costs as reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and the regulations thereunder. Example 7. Taxpayer F receives a District Director's Collection Division (Collection) proposed assessment of trust fund taxes (Trust Fund Recovery Penalty) pursuant to section 6672. F requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals considers the issues and decides to uphold Collection's recommended assessment. Appeals notifies F of this decision in writing. Collection then assesses the tax. Pursuant to section 6672(b), within 30 days after the notice and demand is made, F pays the minimum amount required to commence a court proceeding, files a claim for refund, and furnishes the required bond. Collection then considers and disallows the claim. Appeals then reconsiders the claim and reverses its original position, thus upholding F's position. Appeals then abates the assessment. F may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the receipt of the original decision of Appeals (the administrative proceeding date) that Appeals was upholding Collection's recommended assessment, but only if the other requirements of section 7430 and the regulations thereunder are satisfied. F cannot recover costs that are attributable to any procedure or other action before Collection prior to filing F's administrative claim for refund. ยง301.7430&hyph;4 Reasonable administrative costs.
