But the institute said that the figure of 3.3 percent was the lowest for a calendar year since 1987, when it had been 3.4 percent. Half of the EC countries met the inflation criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union for meeting targets for economic convergence. These countries were Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Britain, France and Belgium. Under the treaty, the annual rate of inflation must not exceed the average of the three lowest rates by more than 1.5 percentage points. But Sweden and Austria, which are negotiating to join the Community, did not meet the criteria. Inflation in Sweden was 4.8 percent and in Austria it was 3.5 percent. Two other candidates for membership are Finland, with inflation of 1.5 percent, and Norway with 1.8 percent. The inflation rates for the 12 months to December were: Belgium 2.7 percent (from 2.4 percent in December 1992), Britain 1.9 percent (2.6 percent), Denmark 1.5 percent (1.5 percent), France 2.1 percent on a provisional basis (1.9 percent), western Germany 3.7 percent (3.7 percent), Greece 12.1 percent (14.3 percent), Ireland 1.5 percent (2.5 percent), Italy 4.4 percent (4.6 percent), Luxembourg 3.6 percent (2.9 percent), the Netherlands 1.7 percent (2.9 percent), Portugal 6.4 percent (8.5 percent), and Spain 4.9 percent (5.3 percent).
