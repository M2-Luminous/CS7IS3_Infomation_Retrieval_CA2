Some indicators of the activity of subunits in the struggle against economic crimes, which I will cite below, attest to this. While internal affairs organs exposed 617 crimes associated with the theft of money by misappropriation or abuse of one's official position and 76 cases of bribery in 1992, they recorded 4,258 crimes, including 2,076 cases of theft---1,337 of which were theft on a large or very large scale--and 164 cases of bribery in 1993. As shown by experience in exposing cases of bribery in the banking system, apart from consultation and technical assistance, the role of banking employees who took bribes most often involved the acceptance of fictitious payment documents. Criminal associations which have penetrated the banking and entrepreneurial business have skillfully taken advantage of the banking system's failure to adapt to the conditions of a market economy and the inadequacy of interbank settlements, putting hundreds of billions of rubles into circulation with fictitious payment documents in the 1991-1993 period. In 1993 alone, about 70 operations investigation groups came to the main administration from various regions in Russia to work on criminal cases involving use of the banking system for the theft of money. We have analyzed and singled out a number of factors which make it possible to carry out the shady transactions on such a large scale. One of the most important factors is the poor supervision of commercial banks by the NTsB [National Central Bureau [of Russian Interpol]]. Evidence has been acquired in specific criminal cases that in a number of instances, the persons who organized the actions to enter funds with fraudulent documents were bank employees, and sometimes even the managers of those banks which were experiencing a "credit shortfall" and had a huge debit balance. A special role in the financial machinations belonged and continues to belong to the numerous structures in the market economy established by and registered to fictitious individuals, utilizing fictitious documents. In most cases, substantial amounts of money have been stolen and "laundered" under the cover of fictitious enterprises. The GUEP [Main Administration to Combat Economic Crime], in interaction with the GUVD [Internal Affairs Main Administration] of the city of Moscow, has exposed a criminal group of 25 persons which opened more than 30 current accounts for more than 3 billion rubles in Moscow commercial banks, using fictitious registration documents and false passports. It turned out that the funds in enterprises' current accounts were used primarily to obtain foreign exchange. According to our information, no less than one-third of the 2.63 billion U.S. dollars sold in the Moscow Currency Exchange in 1992 and the first quarter of last year were acquired with funds stolen beforehand in false remittances. Later the criminals concluded contracts with foreign firms for the delivery of commodities which did not come to Russia, as a rule. This is how currency is being drained to other countries. The plan is very simple, but there is no mechanism to provide a reliable deterrent to deliberate criminals or laws which provide for specific physical persons to be held responsible. Analysis of available materials on foreign economic activity shows that numerous organizations and enterprises which make advance payments to pay for imports are not submitting documents in the established procedure to authorized banks to confirm that commodities are entering Russian territory. Many of them say the reason for nondelivery of goods is the unfairness of the importers, but according to our information, these foreign economic transactions are often fictitious in nature. The Law "On Currency Regulation and Currency Control in the Russian Federation" stipulates the responsibility for conducting currency operations in violation of the established procedure and for failure to submit the appropriate documents to currency control organs. But in our view, the criminal laws in force should also stipulate the responsibility for concealing currency income received from foreign economic activity or understating its amount and failing to observe the established requirements for it to be legally brought into and taken out of the country.
