A local news agency reported that Lanusse has been under arrest at the Military Hospital since Saturday [14 May]. Army Chief-of-Staff Lieutenant General Martin Balza ordered Lanusse's detention, which will extend until May 25, said the sources. Lanusse asserted last week during a cable television programme that the governments of former General Juan Peron and the current Justicialist administration were "the most corrupt" he had known. The retired general--who headed a three-man ruling junta from 1971 to 1973--also said that Balza should not have taken a personal interest in the alleged murder of recruit Omar Carrasco at a military base in Neuquen. His opinions are said to have been taken into account by the Army's top brass in ordering the arrest.
