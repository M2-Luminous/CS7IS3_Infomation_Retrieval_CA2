He said that the northern Yemeni troops have damaged the infrastructure in south Yemen and made thousands of Yemenis homeless. In a statement to the Saudi newspaper AL-YAWM published today, al-'Attas expressed total amazement over the announced number of losses among the northern troops, which was put at 613. Al-'Attas wondered whether this figure can be reasonable [words indistinct], given the use of various kinds of mass destruction weapons. Al-'Attas welcomed the final statement issued by the Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council, saying that this statement reflects the GCC members' eagerness to safeguard the security and safety of the Yemeni people in particular, and those of the region in general. Al-'Attas affirmed that Sanaa has no control over the cease-fire decision [la tamluk qarar waqf itlaq al-nar]. That is why it has procrastinated over the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution, which demanded an immediate cease-fire, and failed to honor it since it was announced the evening before last. Al-'Attas noted that the international recognition of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] will make Sanaa observe a cease-fire. He added that some 60,000 persons have been killed, while the number of people made homeless has exceeded 100,000.
