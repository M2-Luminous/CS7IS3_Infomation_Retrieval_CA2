After the meeting of CDU Presidium and Executive Committee, Kohl told journalists in Bonn on Monday [14 March] that Wulff had conducted an excellent and dedicated election campaign and had achieved an excellent personal election result. In the CDU's leading bodies everyone thinks that Wulff should consistently use his opportunities in the group leadership in the Lower Saxony Landtag. Kohl admitted that the decline in the number of votes for the CDU by 5.6 percent is a "serious loss" for his party. It "is no consolation" that the predictions were even worse. "This is a defeat." Concerning the results achieved by the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], Kohl said the fact that FDP land chairman had changed his statement on the coalition a few days before the elections was certainly one of the mistakes that threw the FDP out of the Landtag. In the view of the CDU chairman, the election result as a whole refuted the "stupid talk that the Germans are all on the point...of refusing to vote." The predictions of an attitude of refusal were wrong. The predictions of an end of the large people's parties are similarly incorrect. It is highly gratifying that the Republikaner remained far below their own expectations with only 3.7 percent, Kohl stated.
