Answering an INTERFAX-Ukraine question about the Crimean situation, Kravchuk said that "flexible policy should be used in Crimea. We could regard Crimea as an economic experiment provided that the economic autonomy of Crimea was brought into line with the Ukrainian legislation." Kravchuk said that "thus far, the Crimean president has not issued a single economic decree. Moving the hands on the clock will not make the economy work for reforms." (INTERFAX Note: The Crimea switched to Moscow time as of March 27). In Kravchuk's view, "the Crimean president flagrantly violates the legislation of both Crimea and Ukraine. Meshkov believes that there is nobody between himself, the people and God. This policy is dangerous and I am waiting for it to come to an end." In Kravchuk's view, Meshkov's entourage "continuously provokes the Crimean president against Ukraine." Kravchuk was confident that experience will show the lie in the speculations that Kiev obstructed progress in Crimea. The president emphasized that regions should enjoy the largest possible economic latitude. He did not rule out the possibility that political institutions might result from an economic experiment in the four Donets-Dnieper regions. Kravchuk thought, however, that "full-fledged federalization" would be premature because it would threaten the unity of the state. He said that hopes for a fast solution to all problems was the biggest folly since independence. Kravchuk thought that there was "no Zvyagilsky government as such because it was the government inherited from Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma. I am not ashamed of this government because it has just started specific economic reforms such as privatization and monetary reform." Kravchuk thought that the monetary reform was dependent on the availability of a currency stabilization fund and on the help of the International Monetary Fund. He thought that foreign countries could have provided more aid to Ukraine.
