The threat in a communique distributed in the occupied territories came a day after a suicide bomber from the HAMAS armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and wounded 45 at 'Afula. That was just the first of five major attacks to come on Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30 Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, HAMAS said. "We are calling on settlers to evacuate now so no one will be able to accuse us of killing civilians," the communique said. "Our al-Qassam units will shell their homes with rockets that we have received recently. Everyone knows we keep our word." HAMAS called on "shopkeepers and the people to stock up with foodstuffs because an atmosphere of war will prevail in the near future." The statement also urged PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to halt negotiations with Israel for one year. "Our units will force Israeli leaders to evacuate their soldiers and settlers from Gaza, Jericho and Hebron without any conditions as a first step to liberating the whole of the West Bank and strip," HAMAS said. "We will guarantee Arafat's position as president if he agrees." The communique noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until the traditional Moslem day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron slaughter to carry out the bombing in 'Afula, northern Israel.
