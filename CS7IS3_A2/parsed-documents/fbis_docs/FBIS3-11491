[Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Now that the elections are near, do you think this will delay the U.S. Congress in approving MLAT? We have not yet received any answer to that effect. [Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino] I am leaving for Washington on Wednesday to have some bilateral conversations with U.S. State Department officials and some congressmen. I have requested an appointment with Senator Helms, the undersecretary of state for Latin American Affairs, and the secretary of the Panama Canal Commission Board of Directors to officially talk about topics of mutual interest. This treaty is obviously one of these topics. I do not see why our electoral process should interfere with the Senate approving the treaty, which should be an urgent issue because of the importance of the document to the bilateral mechanism that it establishes between our two governments and both nations' goals for the fight against drugs. [Reporter] Apparently the U.S. Government is not aware of that urgency because there has not been any reply so far. [Mulino] I would not say that about the U.S. Government. The government as such, the executive branch, did what it had to do: negotiate and sign the treaty. [Reporter] Is it the Senate then? [Mulino] It is in the hands of the Senate, and it is up to the legislative branch to do its work. That is precisely the purpose of my visit. I am going to talk with them; explain that we are interested in it becoming a mechanism that will very shortly become law. We will exchange the documents whereby both senates [as heard] ratify it, and then we will proceed to implement it. I think it is a very effective and good measure for collaborating in the fight against drugs and similar crimes. [end recording]
