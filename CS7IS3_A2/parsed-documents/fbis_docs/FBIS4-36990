The Lok Sabha adopted the bills yesterday which were approved by the Rajya Sabha earlier. The civil aviation minister, Mr. Ghulam Nabi Azad, said the new legislation provides for the setting up of designated courts for speedy trial of hijacking and other related offences. Bail will not be granted without hearing the prosecution. Another salient feature is that the burden of proof will be that of the accused in cases where arms and explosives used for hijacking are recovered. The center can now delegate the investigative powers to any of its agencies instead of the local police. The Lok Sabha has also passed the Human Organs Transplantation Bill seeking to regulate removal and transplantation of human organs. Already passed by the Rajya Sabha, the bill received support from all sections of the house and was adopted with certain official amendments in line with some of the recommendations of the select committee of the house. Replying to the debate, the deputy minister for health, Mr. Pawan Singh Ghatewal, said with the passage of the bill other states would follow suit to enact their own laws. He said such provisions are now available in the states of Maharashtra, Goa, and Himachal Pradesh. Participating in the discussion, members welcomed the measure but cautioned the government to ensure that the provisions of the bill should not be misused by unscrupulous elements for illegal trading in human organs. The house also passed the New Delhi Municipal Council Bill yesterday along with some amendments. The proposed council will have 11 members besides a chairperson. The council includes three MLAs [Members of Legislative Assembly] and the MP representing the New Delhi area. Later, the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die. The house sat late last night to pass six bills. The special session which was summoned to consider the electoral reform bills ended ahead of schedule as the government did not introduce the Constitution Amendment Bill regarding electoral reforms.
