The order notes that the reorganization is being carried out in order to confirm the principle of one-man command. Military policemen will be placed into the composition of motorized rifle units, the directorate has been disbanded, and the armament and equipment are being transferred to other units. It is interesting that the republic's National Guard remains beyond the control of the Georgian Ministry of Defense. National Guard personnel were the main striking force of the coup of winter 1991-1992, as a result of which President Zviad Gamsakhurdia was removed from power.
