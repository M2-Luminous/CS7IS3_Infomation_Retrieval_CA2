Vojko Plevel reports that he met with Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this morning: [Begin Plevel recording] After yesterday's meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman and two meetings with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, President Kucan also met with Israeli Prime Minister Yithzaq Rabin this morning. The two exchanged views and assessments on the current international situation, especially the circumstances in the Middle East and in the Balkans and, naturally, in Europe. They both agreed that the belief that the mere collapse of the Berlin Wall would resolve the situation in Europe proved to be an illusion and that we need to further strengthen our efforts to assert democracy as an alternative to war, as well as equality of smaller and less developed nations. Russia remains the biggest puzzle, to which recent events can attest. Regarding bilateral contacts and possibilities for their strengthening, President Kucan after these talks assessed that with the Israeli partners he found understanding and interest for Slovenia that exceeded a mere bilateral interest. They have also shown an interest to intercede on behalf of our economic and political interests in their international contacts, especially where international policy is being decided and where they are present because of their specific position. They also fully support our efforts for integration into Partnership for Peace, which they, just like ourselves, assess as preparation for a new collective security system in the world. President Kucan will end his visit to Israel this afternoon with a speech at the 4th international forum in Jerusalem. [end recording]
