Social Fund loans are the hope to achieve this dream and security. In order to spare young graduates and craftsmen the worry of searching out ways to obtain these loans, we shall review both the terms for obtaining loans and the documents required. Before going to the Social Fund, one must first define the specific type of project that you want to establish and have a suitable place available in which to carry it out, either within or outside the Cairo Governorate, where the fund's loans are to be spent to purchase tools, equipment, and production requirements. After that, you go to the Social Development Fund's Secretariat General if you are a resident of the governorates of Cairo, al-Jizah, al-Fayyum, al-Shariqiyah, or Alexandria. If you are from another governorate, you go to the nearest Social Fund office subordinate to your governorate. There are 10 regional offices in Ismailia, which serve the youth of the governorates of Ismailia, Port Said, Suez, and North and South Sinai. There are also the Shibin al-Kum office, covering al-Minufiyah Governorate; the Aswan office to serve the citizens of Aswan, Halayib, and Shalatayn; the Qina office to cover the Qina and Red Sea Governorates; the al-Mansurah office to serve the youth of al-Daqahliyah, Damietta, and Kafr al-Shaykh; the Asyut office, covering the Asyut and New Valley Governorates; the al-Minya office, serving the young people of al-Minya and Bani Suwayf; the Damanhur office, to meet the needs of the youth of al-Buhayrah and Musa Matruh; and the Suhaj and Tanta offices, serving the young people of the Western Governorate. After going to the fund or a regional office, fill out the form pertaining to the project and its economic feasibility. You will find someone there to help you enter this data at no charge. After evaluating the study to ascertain the project's feasibility by means of the fund, and it is found to be acceptable, you will get an official letter to one of the banks that are under contract with the fund, according to the project's location. This letter will obtain the loan, which ranges in value from 35,000 to 50,000 pounds for one individual, or 200,000 pounds if there are multiple partners in one project. Interest on the loan is 9 percent on a new project and 12 percent for an existing one. The loans are disbursed through banks, because the Social Fund does not deal with individuals, but through responsible intermediate agencies, such as banks, businessmen's associations, and national associations. The loan's term is five years, of which one and a half to two years is a grace period, depending on the project. In order to facilitate the task of searching for a small project, the Social Fund has prepared examples of small projects ready for implementation for those who are serious about work and love craftsmanship. Those who will benefit from the Social Fund's loans include proprietors of small projects, graduates of practical institutes and colleges, or graduates of theoretical institutes and colleges after training, and proprietors of new projects who have expertise, as well as workers who will be relocated as a result of privatization under the economic reform policy that the state is pursuing, and workers returning from abroad. Required documentation includes commercial register, tax card, and permit. In order to make it easier for young graduates who have new projects, it was decided to issue temporary permits when the loans are disbursed.
