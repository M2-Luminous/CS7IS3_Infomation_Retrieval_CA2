The protesters, including now elderly victims of Japan's wartime aggression, were taken into custody Friday on the eve of Hosokawa's arrival in Beijing for an official visit to China. Many of the elderly came to the Chinese capital by train from Hebei and Jiangsu Provinces, the sources said, adding they will be turned over to the Beijing offices of their home provinces. The sources said Tong Zeng, leader of the unofficial victims of Japanese War Crimes Reparations Committee, was still in police custody Sunday. He was arrested Friday morning. They said a petition drive to win Tong's freedom is under way among Chinese intellectuals in Beijing. In a welcoming banquet speech on Saturday, Prime Minister Hosokawa called on China to improve its human rights record, saying human rights are a universally accepted value. The Chinese Government has been sensitive about demanding war compensation for civilian casualties from Japan reportedly because it is afraid it could damage favorable official ties that include as much as 1.2 trillion yen in loans.
