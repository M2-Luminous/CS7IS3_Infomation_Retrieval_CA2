If passed by the lower chamber, the motion would relieve Shinseito elder statesman Keiwa Okuda of his duty as the head of the powerful panel, which sets the parliamentary agenda. The 511-member lower chamber will be unable to convene a plenary session on Tuesday, because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) leadership could not convince some SDP opponents of the motion into voting for it, the sources said. The Democrats, the SDP's largest policy study group, is now defying the SDP leadership's instruction to vote for the motion, which was earlier submitted to the lower chamber's secretariat by the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The SDP stormed out of the ruling coalition due to its rage over the coalition partners' abrupt decision on April 22 to form a unified parliamentary bloc excluding the SDP. It was considering presenting a unified parliamentary front with the LDP against the coalition, they said. In view of the rift within the SDP ranks, the LDP dropped its earlier decision to demand a ballot on the motion at Tuesday's plenary session, deciding instead to wait for the SDP leadership to convince its dissidents, LDP officials said. The LDP had expected the lower chamber to vote in favor of the motion, even if the socialists cast blank votes in view of the decision by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) to vote for the motion, they said. The LDP has 206 lower house legislators, the SDP 74 and the JCP 15. The LDP's tactics will prompt the SDP's democrats to intensify its bid to pressure the SDP leadership to instruct SDP legislators to scuttle the motion by voting against it, rather than merely casting blank votes, the sources said. It requires eliminating the current standoff in the Diet steering committee by Tuesday to enable the ruling coalition to proceed with its original plan to table the long-overdue fiscal 1994 budget bill onto the Diet floor on Wednesday, they said. The passage of the full budget has already been delayed for six weeks, since the start of fiscal 1994 on April 1.
