Council Chairman (Vin Trengrove) said in Johannesburg that any decision to retain detention without trial would also fly in the face of the constitutional principles recently endorsed by the multiparty negotiating process and by the TEC itself. Mr. (Trengrove) called on the TEC to reaffirm its commitment to the repeal of Section 29 of the Internal Security Act, which provides for detention without trial.
