At a private-level Korea-Taiwan meeting held in Seoul on Tuesday and Wednesday, the two sides agreed on a barter trade involving fruits and vegetables. Under the agreement, South Korea will export 5,500 tons of apples and 2,000 tons of pears to Taiwan in the 1993-`94 period while importing from Taiwan 11,000 tons of Taiwanese bananas, 5,000 tons of onions and 2,800 tons of garlic, all in an amount equivalent to the value of the apple and pear exports. Besides, Taiwan promised to import 4,000 tons of South Korean apples separate from the barter trade. This means that Taiwan will import 11,500 tons of South Korean fruits in the current year, which compares with 8,516 tons they imported in the 1991-92 period immediately before the breakup of formal relations.
