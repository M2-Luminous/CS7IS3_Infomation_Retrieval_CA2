FR940419-2-00026 FR940419-2-00020 Golden Field Office; Notice of Federal Assistance Award to Photonic Sensor Systems, Inc. AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a cooperative agreement to Photonic Sensor Systems, Inc. (PSS) for continuation of a project currently being conducted under a cooperative agreement with Georgia Tech Research Corp. (GTRC), (an affiliate of the Georgia Institute of Technology) for development of a sensor system to monitor gaseous nitrogen (in the form of ammonia). ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: Mr. Matt Barron, Contract Specialist. The Contracting Officer is John W. Meeker. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: With assistance from DOE through Cooperative Agreement # DE&hyph;FC02&hyph;89ID12905, GTRC developed an optical sensor for real time detection of ammonia. The original application was to monitor ammonia transfer from agricultural croplands, and thereby reduce the amount of nitrogen fertilizer used; however, PSS has determined that the sensor can also facilitate the use of ammonia in a variety of industrial applications such as large scale refrigeration where the use of ammonia as the refrigerant has efficiency advantages in many applications. PSS proposes to continue development of the sensor through commercial prototype and evaluation of this prototype in full-scale agricultural and industrial settings. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, and is a continuation of, an activity presently being funded by DOE, and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity and satisfactory completion of the activity. Also, PSS the new participant, now has the exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully based on the recent acquisition of both the critical patent rights and technical expertise. DOE funding for the proposed activity is estimated to be $451,000 and PSS's share is estimated to be $426,000 for a total of $877,000 over a three year project period.
