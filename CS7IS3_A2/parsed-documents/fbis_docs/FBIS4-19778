This is exactly what France demanded. The proposal has been accepted by Yeltsin and Clinton. At the military level, NATO should respond within 48 hours to the UN request for air strikes. All this is very complicated and very dramatic as French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe admitted: [Begin Juppe recording] We have to obtain a real cease-fire and not a cease-fire on paper as we have been told for 48 hours now, and the withdrawal of Serbian troops. If these conditions are met and if the situation in Sarajevo is back to normal as it is happening now, then an UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] force should be deployed in Gorazde to act as a buffer to enable the arrival of humanitarian aid because it is urgent to do so as there are 60,000 people whose food stock will not last more than three days. Secondly, we have to make sure that other tragedies similar to Gorazde's do not happen by securing the safe havens. We are discussing this with the Americans and I hope that we will at last do what France has been demanding for some months now, that is to anticipate proportionate air strikes in safe havens if the population is attacked. For this we will have to define the exclusion zones and the strict rules of engagement that we are working out now. Finally, we have to repeat again that whatever our determination to use air power, there is no lasting solution other than a political one. [end recording]
