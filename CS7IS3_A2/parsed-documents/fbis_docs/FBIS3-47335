The (justice minister's advisory) Legislative Council is now working on a revision to the Commercial Law, and as part of the law's revision, is planning to allow businesses to purchase their own stocks in an effort to reduce the volume of issued stocks. Under the policy, companies would be allowed to buy up to 3 percent of their own outstanding shares on condition they cancel the shares within six months. The Finance Ministry intends to prepare rules on procedures for and disclosure of the purchases. The Justice and Finance Ministries are expected to work out new rules before February. The ban that prohibits the purchase of a corporation's own stocks is expected to be rescinded in April 1995 after a revision of related laws. Industrial circles and securities firms have been calling for the stimulation of the stock market through lifting the ban. The bill revising the Commercial Law will have provisions to allow companies to buy their own stocks for cancellation or distribution to employees. The Legislative Council has been studying measures for partial liberalization of the ban, noting: "A full liberalization will threaten companies' financial status because it entails returning money to shareholders." The funds used by a company to purchase its own stocks will be limited to dividend funds, and the purchase will have to be approved in advance at the shareholders' general meeting. The maximum volume of purchases will be set at 3 percent to prevent management attempts to strengthen its control over the company, and to avoid ill effects on the stock market. Companies that buy their own stocks will have to cancel them within a certain period. To minimize the possibility of influencing the shareholders' general meetings, the period for which a corporation will be permitted to possess its own stocks will be set at a maximum of six months. When purchased stocks are canceled, companies will again be allowed to buy their own stocks, up to 3 percent. Stock purchases for distribution to employees is planned because stock purchases by employees often causes instability in stock prices. Stock purchases for cancellation is planned to improve the balance between demand and supply of stocks. Many companies increased their capital during the bubble economy boom, and the resulting stock oversupply is regarded as one of the reasons for the stock market's prolonged slump. In line with the preparatory work for the Commercial Law's revision, the Finance Ministry will develop rules to govern a company purchasing its own stocks. The ministry plans to make it mandatory for businesses wishing to buy their own shares to do so through the stock market and to disclose their purchases before and after the transaction. The ministry is trying to restrict the scale to which a company will be able to purchase its own stocks to avoid ill influences on the stock market -- this is aimed at investor protection. As tangible measures, the Finance Ministry intends to control the quantity of purchases through the following restrictions: 1) The volume of purchases per day should not exceed 25-30 percent of the average volume of transactions in the market; 2) purchases must be done through one securities company; 3) purchases should not be done immediately before the close of the market; and 4) company purchases of its own stock should be prohibited when doing so might push the price of the stock to an unprecedented level. Regarding disclosure measures, the Finance Ministry is expected to urge companies to clarify at the shareholders' general meetings when, how many, and at what price it purchased its own stocks. Even after the purchase, companies will be urged to report when and how many stocks they purchased and at what price.
