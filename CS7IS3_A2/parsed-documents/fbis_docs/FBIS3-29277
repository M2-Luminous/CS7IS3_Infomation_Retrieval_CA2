Senior officials of the two governments were scheduled to start discussing the claims totalling more than 500 million U.S. dollars in Hanoi on Tuesday and Wednesday. One reason for postponing the talks was to consider whether details of establishing the liaison offices in each other's capital should be considered at the same forum.
