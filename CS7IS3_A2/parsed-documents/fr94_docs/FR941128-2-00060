FR941128-2-00060 FR941128-2-00044 The Reserve Banks estimate that, in 1994, the funds transfer and net settlement service will recover 101.1 percent after targeted ROE and automation consolidation special project costs that the service had planned to recover, based on estimated transaction volume growth of 4.8 percent for the year. Revenue is 6.5 percent higher than budgeted, primarily because anticipated volume reductions as a result of daylight overdraft pricing did not materialize. Total costs are estimated to be 6.1 percent over budget, due to (1) higher-than-anticipated data processing costs, offset partially by lower data communications costs and (2) the funds transfer services' $2.0 million share of the pre-tax reduction in pension credits. 1995 Issues The Reserve Banks estimate that funds transfer origination volume will increase 2.8 percent over 1994 levels. Without price changes, the Reserve Banks project that revenues would recover 109.4 percent of expenses, including all current year and deferred automation consolidation special project costs. 1995 Fees The Board reduced the funds transfer fee to $0.50 from the current $0.53. After this reduction, the service is expected to recover 105.8 percent of its costs, after paying all current year and deferred charges for the automation consolidation special project. Uncertainties remain in the cost projections for 1995, however, because of the continued implementation of the centralized funds transfer application software.

The volume of government agency securities transfers increased 10.4 percent over the 1992 volume level. 1994 Performance Through September 1994, revenues from the book-entry securities service recovered 99.1 percent of total expenses plus targeted ROE, compared with a targeted recovery rate of 100.3 percent for the year. During the same period, book-entry securities transfer volume increased 5.9 percent compared with the 1993 level. The Reserve Banks' staff now expects the book-entry securities service to recover 95.5 percent of total expenses after targeted ROE, based on approximately the same transaction volume as in 1993. The estimated recovery rate is lower than originally projected due to two factors. First, securities transfer volume declined unexpectedly. The increase in mortgage interest rates during 1994 has resulted in less refinancing activity and, as a result, fewer mortgages are available to issue additional mortgage-backed security. Higher interest rates have caused securities firms to reconsider investments in existing mortgage-backed securities, resulting in less trading activity. Second, expenses are higher than planned, due to the reduction in pension credits and higher-than-anticipated data processing costs. 1995 Issues The Reserve Banks believe that mortgage-backed securities volume will stabilize by year-end 1994 and increase modestly in 1995 from the reduced 1994 volume level. This conservative volume increase is reflected in the 3.1 percent volume growth rate forecast for 1995. 1995 Fees The Board has approved retaining the current fees for the book-entry security service, based on the Reserve Banks' forecast that they will produce sufficient revenue to recover 100.1 percent of costs, including targeted ROE and $1.0 million in automation consolidation special project costs. The remaining $1.0 million of current year automation consolidation special project costs and the charges that were incurred and deferred in prior years will continue to be deferred for recovery in future years.
