The value of the order was about 10 billion yen. For the Sumitomo consortium, this will be the second order of this nature following a 350,000-circuit system contract signed in 1991. Indonesia is endeavoring to attain an early resolution to the shortage of communication circuits and Sumitomo hopes to receive additional orders. The equipment will be delivered by NEC and installation will begin in July of this year by NEC Nusantara Communications, a joint venture formed by NEC, Sumitomo and a local Indonesian corporate organization called Pimantara Group. The equipment will be installed over a two-year period on Java and Kalimantan islands. Indonesia has about 3 million telephone circuits, providing for less than two telephones per 100 population. The government considers the construction of a more adequate communication network as being essential to encouraging foreign investment in the country and plans on installing 5 million new circuits in the five-year period following fiscal year 1994. Until the 1980's, Siemens of Germany had a monopoly on the Indonesian telephone switching market, but has since been joined by AT&T and NEC, providing for representation by three makers.
