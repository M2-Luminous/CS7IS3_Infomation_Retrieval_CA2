FR940429-0-00164 FR940429-0-00015 The Secretary proposed to strengthen and expand the standards of administrative capability for participating institutions, addressing areas previously not regulated or for which there were only guidelines (pages 9544&hyph;9549); The Secretary proposed to amend the provisions governing default reduction measures to reflect statutory changes made by the Amendments of 1992 and current departmental practices. The provisions in the Technical Amendments of 1993 that address institutional appeals of cohort default rates were not included in the NPRM (pages 9549&hyph;9551); The Secretary proposed to clarify the terms used in the statutory definition of a fair and equitable refund policy (pages 9551&hyph;9556); The Secretary proposed to implement the statutory requirement that institutions have annual compliance audits. The Secretary proposed to extend the audit requirements to foreign institutions (pages 9556&hyph;9557); and The Secretary proposed to amend the Federal Pell Grant Program regulations to implement section 487(c)(7) of the HEA that provides that an institution may offset the amount of Title IV, HEA program disbursements against liabilities or may receive reimbursement from the Department for those amounts if, in the course of any audit conducted after December 31, 1988, the Department discovers or is informed of any Title IV, HEA program assistance (specifically, Federal Pell Grant Program funds) that an institution has provided to its students in accordance with program requirements, but the institution has not previously received credit or reimbursement for these disbursements (page 9558). On February 17, 1994, the Secretary published an NPRM proposing amendments to parts 668 and 682 in the Federal Register (59 FR 8044). The NPRM included a discussion of the major issues involved in the proposed changes. The following list summarizes those issues and identifies the pages of the preamble to the NPRM on which a discussion of those issues can be found: The Secretary proposed a definition of third-party servicer as applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract with an institution to administer any aspect of the institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs (page 8045); The Secretary proposed to expand the factors of financial responsibility of an institution to take into consideration substantial control over both institutions and third-party servicers (pages 8046&hyph;8047); The Secretary proposed annual audit requirements for third-party servicers as necessary to implement statutory provisions under the Amendments of 1992 (pages 8047&hyph;8048); The Secretary proposed notification requirements for third-party servicers against which the Secretary has assessed a liability for a violation of a Title IV, HEA program violation (pages 8048&hyph;8049); The Secretary proposed to create a new section to codify contract requirements between institutions and third-party servicers. As one of the conditions in the contract, a third-party servicer would be required to assume joint and several liability with an institution that the servicer contracts with for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program requirement (pages 8049&hyph;8050); The Secretary proposed to apply against a third-party servicer the sanctions under subpart G of the Student Assistance General Provisions that currently solely apply to institutions for any violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement (pages 8050&hyph;8051); The Secretary proposed to apply the fiduciary standards that currently only apply to institutions to third-party servicers so that third-party servicers would be required to act at all times with the competency necessary to qualify them as a fiduciary (page 8051); The Secretary proposed a definition of third-party servicer applicable to those individuals or organizations that contract with a lender or guarantee agency to administer any aspect of the lender's or guarantee agency's participation in the FFEL programs (page 8055); The Secretary proposed to require a third-party servicer that contracts with a lender or guaranty agency to assume joint and several liability for any violation of any FFEL program requirement or applicable statutory requirement. Collection of liabilities from the violation would be collected first from the lender or guaranty agency (page 8055&hyph;8056); and The Secretary proposed a new section to codify Federal requirements for third-party servicers that contract with lenders or guaranty agencies. A third-party servicer would be required to meet certain standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability to be considered eligible to contract with a lender or guaranty agency. In addition, this section would require a third-party servicer to have performed an annual audit of the servicer's administration of a lender's or guaranty agency's participation in the FFEL programs (page 8056); Program Integrity Triad In order to approve a postsecondary education institution to participate in the student financial assistance programs authorized under Title IV of the HEA (referred to as ``Title IV, HEA programs'') and many other Federal programs, the Secretary must determine, in part, that the institution satisfies the statutory definition of an ``institution of higher education.'' Under the HEA and many other Federal statutes, one element of that definition requires an eligible institution of higher education to be accredited or preaccredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary as a reliable authority as to the quality of the education or training provided by the institution. Another element requires an eligible institution to be legally authorized to provide an education program beyond the secondary level in the State in which it is located. In addition, to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, the institution must be certified by the Secretary as administratively capable and financially responsible. Thus, the HEA provides the framework for a shared responsibility among accrediting agencies, States, and the Federal government to ensure that the ``gate'' to Title IV, HEA programs is opened only to those institutions that provide students with quality education or training worth the time, energy, and money they invest in it. The three ``gatekeepers'' sharing this responsibility have traditionally been referred to as ``the triad.'' While the concept of a triad of entities responsible for gatekeeping has had a long history, originating in 1952, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;325, significantly increased the gatekeeping responsibilities of each member of the triad. Specifically, Congress amended the HEA to provide for a new part H of Title IV entitled ``Program Integrity Triad.'' Under the new part H, the requirements that accrediting bodies must meet if they are to be recognized by the Secretary as ``gatekeepers'' for Title IV or other Federal purposes are specified in detail. Part H also provides a new oversight responsibility for States: the State Postsecondary Review Program. Altogether, part H establishes a set of responsibilities for accrediting agencies, States, and the Secretary that creates a stronger and more coordinated evaluation of institutions that participate, or wish to participate, in the Title IV, HEA programs.
