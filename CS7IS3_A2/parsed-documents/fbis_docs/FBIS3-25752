On 20 February, South African Police officials distributed pamphlets in Ressano Garcia town, in Maputo Province, saying that the common border would be electrified once again to reduce border violations by Mozambican citizens. Deputy Foreign Minister Moiane has told the DOMINGO newspaper that some reports say those pamphlets were dropped from a small aircraft, which may have violated Mozambican air space. The Mozambican deputy foreign minister is currently in Windhoek, the Namibian capital, to represent the Mozambican Government in the ceremony that will see Walvis Bay Harbor returned to Namibia.
