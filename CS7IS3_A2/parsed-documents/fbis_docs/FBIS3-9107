Bratislava SME in Slovak on 17 March on page 1, under the headline "Meciar in Favor of a Fourth Referendum Question," carries a 150-word unattributed report on HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar's reaction to the announcement by the Presidential Office that the HZDS-initiated petition for a referendum failed to collect the required number of 350,000 "valid" signatures. The report states: "Vladimir Meciar said yesterday, `I know from reliable sources that 368,000 valid citizens [as published] had expressed themselves in favor of the referendum. However, because they [officials from the legislative department of the Presidential Office] said that giving the place of residence is not enough and that the term place of residence must be understood to include the street and the exact address, they managed to pull down the number to under 300,000, to only slightly over 200,000. Such an explanation of the shortage [of signatures] and termination of the operation amounts to contempt for the law and the citizen.' Asked what the further course of action by the HZDS would be, Vladimir Meciar replied, `There will be another petition, this time with a fourth question.'" Bratislava SLOVENSKY DENNIK in Slovak on 17 March on page 2, under the headline "Another Referendum in Slovakia?," carries the following TA SR report: "A referendum in which citizens ought to express their confidence in President Michal Kovac is demanded by some HZDS district organizations, a TA SR correspondent learned from reliable sources. Even though the HZDS leadership has not yet decided whether and when a referendum with such contents should be held, petition committees have already been set up in some districts."
