(New York), April 22, IRNA -- Iran's permanent representative of Iran to the U.N. Kamal Kharrazi, last night said if the Security Council had reacted "promptly and vigorously" when its first resolution had been violated by the Serbs, the Bosnian people would have been spared the present catastrophe. Condemning the world body's attitude towards the savage attacks on Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Serbs, Kharrazi said at the open session of the Security Council that the U.N. failure to shoulder its responsibility in the face of continued Serbian aggression could not be ignored. "The fact the Council has tied the hands of the victims so that they cannot exercise their inherent rights of self-defense cannot be be overlooked," he said. The Iranian added that in fact the "Serbs have been given the green light to continue to slaughter the defenseless people of Bosnia-Herzegovina." Referring to the worsening situation particularlly in the besieged city of Gorazde, he said that under such circumstances, the Council has only "one option that is lift and strike," as all other mechanisms designed to defend civilians have failed. "Those who oppose lifting the arms embargo against B-H, are certainly responsible, at least partially, for all innocent lives perished in the Serbian atrocities," Kharrazi made it clear. He said "there is no justification whatsoever, on legal or moral grounds, for the continuation of the unjust arms embargo against Bosnia." The inaction and indecisiveness of the UN in countering aggression coupled with the persistence of certain Council members in denying the inherent right of self-defense to the Bosnians, has made the Islamic world indignant, and brought under serious question the world body's credibility, he said. "Public opinion in the Muslim, and in fact in the world at large, has seriously taken the credibility of the U.N. system into question and is urging the governments to take practical steps in defending their brethren in Bosnia-Herzegovina," added Kharrazi. "The Security Council is obliged to proclaim that the arms embargo is inapplicable to the republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina," he stated. Criticizing the Council's Thursday draft resolution, which had called for an immediate cease-fire agreement in B-H and Gorazde as well as withdrawal of Serbian forces and their weapons from the city, Kharrazi said the document "lacks a clear threat" to the Serbs in the event of probable violation of the undertakings under the present draft. The resolution has fallen short of addressing the critical situation of other declared safe areas as well as other parts of B-H, added the Iranian representative noting that paragraph four of the resolution was formulated in a such a way that it "equates the victim and the aggressor." He said such practice of the Council would only encourage the aggressors to continue their genocide throughout B-H. Kharrazi referred to the draft's call for the intensification of efforts to achieve peaceful settlement by the U.N., European Union, the United States and the Russian Federation and said that nothing would diminish the responsibility of the U.N. and particularly the Security Council in reversing the aggression committed by the Serbs.
