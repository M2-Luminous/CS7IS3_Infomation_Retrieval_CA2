SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34973), EPA issued a proposed rule that gave notice that Becker-Underwood, Inc., 801 Dayton Ave., Ames, IA 50010, had submitted pesticide petitions (PP) 2E4129, 2E4130, and 2E4131 requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.1001(d) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 (Carbazole Violet; Cas Registry No. 6358-30-1), C.I. Pigment Blue #15 (CAS Registry No. 147-14-8), and C.I. Pigment Green #7 (CAS Registry No. 1328-53-6) when used as inert ingredients (dyes, coloring agents) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops only. The proposal also noted that Gustafson, Inc., P.O. Box 660065, Dallas, TX 75266-0065, had requested a tolerance exemption for FD & C Red No. 40 (CAS Reg. No. 25956-17-6). Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomaceous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers; microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active. One comment was received in response to the proposed rule. The commenter was concerned that there would be inadequate monitoring of impurities in the pigments and dyes. Specifically, the commenter cited the possibility of toxic contaminants contained in C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment Green #7, and C.I. Pigment Blue #15 as a result of the manufacturing processes used. The commenter addressed the possible contamination of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 with polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxin and/or polychlorinated dibenzofuran (as a result of the basic reactant chloranil) and contamination of C.I. Pigment Green #7 and C.I. Pigment Blue #15 with polychlorinated biphenyls. The commenter requested that a mechanism be included in the regulation to ensure that pigments made from contaminated intermediates not be sanctioned. As a result of this comment, the Agency has included previously specified limits (Significant New Use Rule (SNUR), published in the Federal Register of May 12, 1993 (58 FR 27980)) in the regulations for C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment Blue #15, and C.I. Pigment Green #7 restricting the contamination of C.I. Pigment Violet #23 by polychlorinated dibenzo- p -dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans, and restricting the contamination of C.I. Pigment Blue #15 and C.I. Pigment Green #7 by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB)s. These limits were developed to bar use of contaminated intermediates in the production of these pigments. In addition, the exemptions for C.I. Pigment Violet #23, C.I. Pigment #15, and C.I. Pigment #7 have also been limited to seed treatment, as originally requested by Becker-Underwood, Inc. The data submitted in the proposal and other relevant material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance exemption will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance exemption is establised as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof, or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
