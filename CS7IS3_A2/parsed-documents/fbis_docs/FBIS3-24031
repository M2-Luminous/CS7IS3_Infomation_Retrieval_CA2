It is this particular sequence of documents that is important, no matter what chronological view we take. So, let us have everything in order: As the 3 February decree says, it cancels reservations concerning the article of the Lisbon Protocol which are found in the decree of the Supreme Council dated 18 November 1993. We look at this document and find that the article mentioned is referred to only in its reservation 3: "Ukraine does not consider Article V of the Lisbon Protocol binding on it." This is all. However, 12 more reservations remain! The article of the protocol itself says that Ukraine must join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (DNYaZ) as a nonnuclear state. So, how does it look? Last November our deputies disagreed with the Lisbon wording of the status of Ukraine and made reservations that would guarantee to Ukraine its true status as the owner of the nuclear weapons that have ended up on its territory, national security, and fair compensation for nuclear disarmament which is beyond the resources of our economy. In the process, the START-1 treaty was ratified, but neither the United States nor Russia recognized this fact because of the parliamentary reservations. In keeping with reservation 11 of 18 November, President L. Kravchuk began negotiation efforts, and the trilateral statement of 14 January 1994 appeared. If for no other reason, this document was interesting, to put it mildly, because nothing was given or guaranteed to Ukraine, but almost everything that the reservations of the parliament called for was promised. So, by adopting the 3 February decree, the Ukrainian Supreme Council actually responded to a promise of guarantees and assistance with a promise-consent to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear state. It ended up being a promise by Washington and Moscow in exchange for a promise by Kiev because, first, Article V of the Lisbon Protocol does not provide for Ukraine joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty urgently and automatically. Second, the preamble to the decree of 3 February says that Ukraine is the owner of the components of nuclear weapons on its territory (see the ninth paragraph of the decree: This is our status as viewed by Ukraine). Third, I repeat, another 12 reservations remain in the November decree which call for the signing of at least 10 state-to-state agreements and other documents. They are supposed to regulate the problems of international guarantees of the national security of Ukraine, economic, scientific-technical, and financial assistance in the process of nuclear disarmament, manufacturer warranty servicing of Ukrainian missiles by Russian specialists, a review of conditions and financing for inspection efforts, opportunities to use launch silos for peaceful purposes, conditions for the use of weapons materials from the liquidated nuclear weapons, and compensation for them. The issues of compensation for tactical nuclear weapons, the schedule for transferring strategic missiles to Russia, conditions for this process, control over dismantling, and so on are to be coordinated separately. In a word, everything is envisioned that our government was obligated to do in Point 2 of the decree of 3 February. Only after these conditions are met will Ukraine be prepared to get rid of nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear country with an easy heart. So, it is already possible to say that by agreeing to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty the Supreme Council of Ukraine has now confronted the United States and Russia with a choice of either failing to listen to Ukrainian demands in the future, too, and bringing pressure to bear on Ukraine, pursuing a policy of double standards in view of an indulgent attitude toward the so-called "threshold" states which are prepared to acquire nuclear weapons; or concluding the agreements envisioned in the January trilateral statement as soon as possible and satisfying everyone. At any rate, our parliament, with astonishing success, has let everybody understand this: If you help Ukraine you will win; if you bring it to its knees, you will win, too, but it could be a pyrrhic victory. This may be the greatest achievement of our parliament in the foreign arena on 3 February. There also were domestic achievements, because the Supreme Council seriously dimmed the halo of the president as the only supporter of nuclear disarmament in the Ukrainian ruling elite, testified yet again that all branches of power are to blame for the critical condition of the Ukrainian state, and obligated executive power headed by the president to sign advantageous agreements on the issues of nuclear disarmament, which it put under strict parliamentary control. At present, the "more compliant" president and the "noncompliant" Supreme Council are together. However, the mutual relations between the two branches of power are another topic....
