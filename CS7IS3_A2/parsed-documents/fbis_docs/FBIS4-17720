Tajik Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zafar Saidov told ITAR-TASS that according to "irrefutable evidence" a thousand and a half Tajik rebels are massing in the Afghan border village of Bakhorak. The group is headed by Abdul Rashid Badakhshi, commander of the so-called Badakhshan Resistance Front. The rebels plan to intrude into Tajikistan's inner mountainous regions and launch military actions against the government troops, he said. Abdul Basir Khalid, commander of Afghanistan 29th Army controlling the region where the rebels are based, is not only tolerant to all their actions but assists rebels, Saidov said. Tajikistan leadership considers such actions as open hostility against the government and as an attempt to provoke a new armed confrontation in the Republic, and warns that the government will make appropriate moves to prevent provocative actions. The Tajik Government appeals to all Afghanistan-based rebels to give up irresponsible actions and turn to search for political decisions whithin the framework of the inter-Tajik negotiating process.
