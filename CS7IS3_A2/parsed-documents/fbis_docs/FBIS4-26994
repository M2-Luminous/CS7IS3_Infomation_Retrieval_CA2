Today's vote is more than just a complicated procedure for determining the future shape of the territory's democratic institutions. It is a rite of passage for Hong Kong's developing democracy, a process enhanced by Britain and recognised by China's Basic Law. In less than three years -- since the first directly elected members took the oath of office -- Legco has transformed itself from a rubber stamp to a body of pragmatic, shifting alliances, capable of effective, if not always constructive, opposition to government policies. Today, it has a chance to display maturity and responsibility. It is the moment to show it has not slipped the collar of one government just to clip on to the leash of another. A mature legislature is one that has the vision and courage to vote for what the public wants and believes in, no matter what Britain or China expect. It is two years since Chris Patten began to listen to popular demand for more democracy and started work on his constitutional package. In that time, legislators have had the chance to work out what their constituents want and to develop a healthy scepticism about both British and Chinese intentions and justifications. They must now judge the competing proposals and amendments on their merits. The Liberal Party's amendments have the attraction of appearing to conform more closely than Mr Patten's 1992 package to China's interpretation of the Basic Law. It is argued these "1994 proposals" would reduce the disruption to political life if China carried out its threat to dissolve all three tiers of elected government in 1997. This argument should be rejected, for the effect of the proposals would be to maximise the chances of Liberal candidates being elected to functional constituencies in 1995. False guarantee The amendments offer no more than a token nod in the direction of the faster democratic development Hong Kong people consistently have shown they want but they give no greater guarantee of a smooth transition than the Patten package. Beijing's tacit support can be read in the decision of pro-China legislators to vote with the Liberals. But, come 1997, the voting system for the directly elected seats is likely to be switched to whatever method with which China feels comfortable (the Preliminary Working Committee, for instance, has talked of proportional representation, which would return more pro-Beijing candidates). The functional constituencies might also be rejigged. At the other end of the scale is Emily Lau Wai-hing's quixotic Bill calling for all 60 seats to be directly elected in 1995. There is a respectable argument that since there is to be no through-train, Hong Kong may as well choose full democracy for the final 21 months of British rule. There is nothing in the Joint Declaration to prevent this and the Basic Law does not come into effect until 1997. The majority of Hong Kong people, however, would not favour such radicalism. The sensible course It would re-ignite the conflict with China and jeopardise the cooperation on other issues at last beginning to resume in the Joint Liaison Group. Even by the British reading, the Bill is in conflict with the Basic Law. So, too, is Martin Lee Chu-ming's call for 10 more directly elected seats. Britain has gone out of its way to stay within the Basic Law, however controversial its interpretation. It would not wish to destroy its own arguments by abandoning any show of convergence with the post-1997 constitution. Difficult though it may be for some legislators to accept, Mr Patten's modest attempt to broaden the franchise represents a sensible middle course. It is not a substitute for full democracy. But it would go some way to increasing Legco's representativeness while staying within the Basic Law as it might be read by a court operating within the British legal tradition. Hong Kong people would feel cheated if Legco adopted a package less democratic than the Basic Law. The storm unleashed by Mr Patten's October 1992 proposals should not deflect legislators from their obligation to settle the conflict in favour of the people of Hong Kong. It is in China's interest as much as Hong Kong's to end the debilitating debate of the last two years and allow an executive-led administration and a newly mature Legco to get on with the business of running the territory's affairs for the remainder of British rule and preparing for the transfer of sovereignty. If they work well, the arrangements might seem less threatening and offensive to Beijing in 1997 than they do today.
