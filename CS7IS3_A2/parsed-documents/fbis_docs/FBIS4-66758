This questioning is due to the economic reform and the changes taking place in the Egyptian arena, the most important of which are privatization and trade liberalization. It is also due to the new factors that make industrial cooperation with the outside world imperative. In addition, goals for increased exports present the best means to both increase industrial activity and apply the latest industrial technologies. Though the ferromanganese industry, which is one of the Egyptian strategic industries, lay idle for many years, millions of pounds have been invested in it. Major and important changes have taken place in this industry leading to major problems which are currently related to keeping pace with the international demand for its products of ferromanganese and meeting its exports obligations. This change has come about because of sound economic management. This management is based on acquiring information and conducting export-related studies, which consider competition and market study in order to achieve its goals. In fact, since the Sinai Manganese Company made use of market and scientific studies, as well as international periodical newsletters that deal with this industry, it is no longer isolated from international markets and has started penetrating them. The successful results that this company has met with prove that, with regard to the public sector, these results are due to the sound economic policy adopted by the Sinai Manganese Company. Such a policy takes into account and closely monitors the different economic changes that effect production and export. It also advocates good quality and stands for competition, especially at the present stage. The Sinai Manganese Company has successfully applied this strategy. Engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, the company chairman and executive officer, initiated this policy and has worked diligently to apply it. His efforts made it possible for the company to export to Japan, Germany, and other countries. Engineer 'Id's strategy and efforts also rendered good results in marketing the company's other products in the domestic market. What are the landmarks of the Sinai Manganese Company's economic and production strategy within the framework of existing investments, particularly relating to meeting its urgent marketing demands and taking into consideration that the company's vital investments lie in the ferromanganese industry? We met with engineer Muhammad Hasan 'Id, chairman and executive officer of the company, in order to become acquainted with the new path of the ferromanganese industry in both world and domestic markets. Engineer 'Id stated with clear and precise words that could be considered important economic indicators, that: "Currently, we are concerned with meeting the European markets' demands especially in view of the uneconomic work conditions existing in the ferromanganese factory now operating at capacity. There should be quick new investments to meet the demands of urgent exports. The current export schedule is a continuation of past exports. This condition is due to the fact that contracts for ferromanganese exports are made at three-month intervals. Prices are stabilized throughout each of these periods. This short contracting period has the advantage of allowing for an increase in prices every three months." Engineer 'Id also indicated that: "The company's export goals are based on both its export potential and the economic gains from exports." He further stated that the Sinai Manganese Company has unlimited demands for its exports. The Ferromanganese Industry's World Market: Factors the Company Should Consider Regarding Competition Because our conversation with engineer 'Id covered the world market and rising exports, it was inevitable that we discuss the factors that the Company considered that allowed it to enter the world market. The chairman and executive officer of the Company responded to our inquiry by saying: "In order for the company just to enter the ferromanganese world market, we had to adopt a graduating pricing strategy that started with a price that was 5-percent lower than the world market price. However, we offered this lower price for a limited period only in order to make sure that our company entered in competition with other companies. In the meantime, we studied all the information relevant to movement in these world markets. Actual Export Figures The chairman and executive officer of the Sinai Manganese Company reported that in 1993 the company had exported more than 10,000 tons of ferromanganese worth $4 million. The Company is expected to export more than 15,000 tons in 1994. Gypsum Ore and Calcified Gypsum: Production and Exports Capacities Besides the ferromanganese project, in the framework of a policy of harmonized production, the Sinai Manganese Company is also producing gypsum ore and calcified gypsum. Engineer 'Id remarks: "There is no problem exporting gypsum ore, because the Company has exporting contracts in 1993/94 to export 60,000 tons to the Arab Gulf region. Meanwhile, the Company has already exported gypsum ore worth $500,000. In addition, it exported 20,000 tons of sand for glass to the European market in 1993/94. Actual sales of calcified gypsum were 120,000 tons, which represented 40 percent of the factory's capacity." At this point, engineer 'Id raised a vital point about which he had been thinking, namely that of changing the activity of the factory in order to make use of its potential and its workers. It is worth mentioning that, since restarting operation of the ferromanganese factory and the manganese mines, the number of workers in the Company has increased to 300. Capital, Investment, Role Demanded and Workers' Share It is necessary to reform the financial structure of the Sinai Manganese Company in order to make it capable of meeting its industrial, strategic, and vital goals. These reforms are necessary for many reasons. Among these reasons is the fact that, since the world market--particularly the markets of Europe and the Arab Gulf--have opened to the Company's ferromanganese and gypsum exports, there have been changes in the Company's patterns of production and exports. The Company also has other potential, such as its port, which is currently busy for 30 days [as published; probably should read "300 days per year"]--a great success for all workers. The different categories of workers appreciate the rise in the Company's exports. As a result of these changes, though the Company's invested capital remains fixed at 10 million pounds, its projects are valued at 220 million pounds: therefore there is the need to reform the Company's financial structure, as was mentioned above. Engineer 'Id believes that, in order for the Company to meet its industrial, strategic, and vital goals, it is necessary to reform the Company's financial structure. In short, these reforms are rescheduling the Company's loans, and making them long-term loans with low interest rates as well as having the Investment Bank contribute to the Company's capital. Currently, 35 pounds are paid as interest for every ton of calcified gypsum, the price of which is 80 pounds, and 380 pounds are paid as bank interest for every ton of ferromanganese. Engineer 'Id adds: "We have already asked the holding company to raise the Company's capital to 60 million pounds in order to achieve a balance between actual investment and current export expectations, which are embodied in privatization, trade liberalization, and the recent agreements."
