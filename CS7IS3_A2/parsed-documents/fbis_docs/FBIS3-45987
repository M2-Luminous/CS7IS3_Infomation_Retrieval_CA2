On Wednesday [12 January], mainland China and France simultaneously announced a communique in which Paris agreed not to authorize any new arms sale to Taiwan in the future. The joint communique was reached following a recent round of bilateral talks in Beijing. Since late 1992, when France approved the sale of 60 Mirage fighter planes to Taiwan, Beijing had persistently pressed Paris to cancel the deal, using various retaliatory measures, including suspensions of a subway and several other big-ticket sales contracts awarded to French companies earlier. Beijing apparently failed to win concession from Paris on this point. French Foreign Minister Alain Jupe told a news conference in Paris on the same day that the Mirage contract with Taiwan will be honored and that spare parts will be delivered. The reason Paris acquiesced in Beijing's demand not to allow future arms sales to Taiwan is obviously because France wanted to do so to restore its relations with the mainland so as to win back its lost businesses and to facilitate its development of the mainland market. But for all the commercial considerations, it is regrettable that the French government has given its consent to the demand of Beijing. The mainland has no valid reason to block Taiwan from purchasing weapons from abroad. This is especially true in light of the fact that mainland China itself has continued to expand its air and navy forces in recent years, posing a threat to the security of Taiwan and in fact the whole region. Taiwan wants to purchase weapons for only one purpose to defend itself against a possible military invasion from the mainland. Beijing has been on record that, if necessary it will not hesitate to take Taiwan by force. Beijing has never relaxed its efforts to prevent Western nations from providing Taiwan with weapons. At the Settle summit in November, Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin complained to President Bill Clinton of his predecessor's decision to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan and demanded U.S. agreement not to allow new sales. In that same month, Beijing raised a similar demand with Germany when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited the mainland. Beijing's persistent intervention will make it more difficult for Taiwan to obtain the supply of high-performance weapons in the future. To cope, Taiwan must strengthen its investment in the development of military technology to reduce dependence on foreign supply. Also on Wednesday, Beijing announced establishment of diplomatic relations with Lesotho, an African country which had maintained formal links with Taiwan since 1990. Over the years, Beijing has not only continued to prevent other nations from recognizing Taipei, but also tried all possible means to win recognition from nations which have diplomatic ties to this government. The reason Beijing consistently does so is to isolate Taiwan from the international community and force the name of the Republic of China to disappear from the whole world. This Beijing interference has indeed caused difficulties for Taiwan's foreign policy in the past but clearly it has not succeeded in isolating this island. Taiwan still maintains strong relations, in both official and unofficial forms, with countries around the world. There is no reason that this will not be the case in the future, given Taiwan's continued efforts to develop democracy and economy as well as the island's willingness to fulfill its international obligations.
