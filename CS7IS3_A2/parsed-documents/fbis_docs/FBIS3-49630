From there he is flying to Moscow. He was in this country for over 24 hours. The main objective of his stay in Prague was to acquaint us and the neighboring countries with the results of the NATO Brussels summit, with the Partnership for Peace project. All countries that took part in this meeting confirmed their interest in this project and expressed their readiness to start to implement it immediately. This means that various delegations will be coming soon and relevant protocols about cooperation in various areas will be prepared. President Clinton emphasized on several occasions, at various talks the importance of stability, peace, and security in central Europe, for Europe as a whole, and also for United Staes security. I personally see this visit as very successful. President Clinton also said something similar because this project was received by the central European countries with understanding. It, however, must be said that all central European countries emphasized they understood this [project] only as a first step on the way to the full NATO membership. The U.S. side took this with full understanding and assured us that this was indeed the path on which it was possible to reach full membership. The speed with which this project will be changed into full NATO membership depends on individual countries, their internal stability, their possibilities, their potential, and many other circumstances. Naturally, during the official talks of the delegations, during the multilateral lunch, and also on other less official occasions, we spoke about various matters, including economic cooperation. The main objective of this visit was, however, what I have described earlier. [Czech Radio correspondent] Mr. President, to what extent is the project Partnership for Peace done to meet our dreams, ideas, and aspirations? To what extent does it contain specific guarantees of us being integrated in the sphere of Euro-American influence, and to what extent is this accommodating attitude toward this project a matter of inner convictions of the representatives of the Visegrad countries? Finally, to what extent is it the realization that there is no other way? [Havel] All those countries which took part in this meeting stressed that they did not want to join the North Atlantic Alliance only in order to have as smaller countries some allies and formal guarantees of their security. This application means something deeper. It means subscribing to certain civilization values which the North Atlantic Alliance is protecting. It also means a will to take an active part in protecting such values. Those specific areas in which protocols on cooperation are to be concluded and which this project contains are generally expressed in the final communique issued by the NATO summit in Brussels, which surely you shall have or which you already have at your disposal. During the discussions on these matters this issue was developed in a somewhat more specific detail. It is clear that this project as such does not contain formalized security guarantees; rather, as it emerged from all the discussions it is in fact a some kind of a degree of security guarantees or let us say a first step to security guarantees. It contains, for instance, the clause about consultations 16 plus one. This means that if a country feels threatened it has the right of consulting its situation with the Alliance and it depends on the assessment of both partners what consequences it might eventually have. [Holec, Czech News Agency] Mr. President, to what extent did opinions of [words indistinct] Visegrad differ? President Walesa's address at the working lunch, from what I have seen, was very critical. President Walesa was saying that, at least according to that speech, the Partnership for Peace is somewhere halfway. Could you tell us more about the differences in opinions as well as President Walesa's stance? [Havel] The important fact is that these four countries, and that was in the interest of the American side as well, gave their support to this project, accepted it, and expressed their readiness to work on it. Of course, stances of some individual delegations differed. In the stance taken by the Polish delegation there emerged some kind of a basic formula that this is a step in the right direction but a small one. We do not share this view. I personally believe that this was the only possible step [to be taken] by the alliance, that it is a well-balanced, well thought out step. If I pose any questions to myself it is only the question why this step had not been taken one or two years ago. Poland has different historical experience. It is more sensitive to the possibility of a likely threat and that is why in its policy there is a somewhat bigger proportion of concern, more caution concerning its own security. However, it is not for me to explain the positions of other states. I am sure that the presidents will have an opportunity to familiarize [us] with their opinions. [Correspondent] [passage indistinct] Did you talk with President Clinton about the fate of Radio Free Europe? [Havel] Yes, we did talk about it, but at this moment I am unable to say anything specific in this matter the press. [Correspondent] If you allow me I shall revert to "Partnership for Peace." You said yesterday that the Czech Republic was willing to begin immediately to fill the project with a concrete content. What is this content and in order to realize these objectives does it envisage bilateral consultations in our region or even consultations within the framework of the Visegrad Four? [Havel] The partnership for peace project has several items which characterize the areas of cooperation. Those specific discussions will be about how this cooperation is to be implemented in individual areas. This will be the subject of these discussions. The Czech side is prepared for such discussions and likewise the North Atlantic Alliance is also prepared for them. President Clinton told us that at the close of the summit in Brussels Manfred Werner had given instructions to the states of the North Atlantic Alliance that if these [Visegrad] countries showed interest that they were to sent immediately their experts and start preparing these protocols at an expert level. The document describes precisely what kind of cooperation is involved. As far as consultations are concerned within the framework of regions the partnership for peace project, and this is one of its clauses, envisages cooperation among individual partnership countries which will then be partners of the Alliance. Talks will be held separately with each country. Such talks will always take the form 16 plus one. The talks are individualized and in the case of each country this may have a different content, perhaps a different rhythm of contacts, different frequence of joint exercises and the like, or cooperation in the field of inspection of military budgets and arms manufacture and the like. Nonetheless, the document also contains a clause that the individual partnership countries, which will sign up to this project, are also to cooperate together. One can hardly imagine a situation in which two partner countries of the North Atlantic Alliance would have cool relations with each other. [Correspondent] Mr. President, while you were discussing it and in view of the very special experiences over the history of Czechoslovakia did you discuss in any way, did you mention in any way a Russian politician named Vladimir Adolfovich Zhirinovskiy and what he may mean? [Havel] Similarly like representatives of some other neighboring countries we also have certain historical experiences of our own, above all the one that if our liberty, our independence are sacrificed to some kind of an illusionary peace, if someone judges that such a small and distant country is not worthy of a possible involvement or possible sacrifices than in history this has never paid off to those countries since later they had to bring sacrifices that were disproportionately far bigger. Central Europe is a region that is very exposed lying in the very center of Europe where in history various wars begun and ended. It is a crossroad of spiritual and civilizational tides, geo-political interests and this is why our security is a part of the all-European security and after all historical experiences the West is in my view is well aware of this, and it is aware of this face to face to certain extreme or nationalistic voices that one can hear at present from various countries. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Mr. President, did you discuss the financial dimension of the Partnership for Peace with the presidents of the Visegrad [Group]? I have in mind their possibilities to financially participate on this project. [Havel] The Partnership for Peace project is a project of a defense alliance, a NATO project. Therefore, its specific articles relate especially to the cooperation between the armies, the cooperation on security. However, it is by no means only this. The project has its political dimension. The cooperation on security is envisaged on the basis of shared democratic values as well as a shared perception of economy and of the economic reform. This means that, indirectly, this partnership must lead, and it is assumed that it will lead, to the deepening of relations in all other areas, including even such areas as is the cooperation between parliaments etc. [Correspondent] President Clinton regularly uses only the word Visegrad. You were speaking about the countries of Central Europe. This conceptual tension is rather well known. Did anything change during this visit? I mean, our idea of individual states and some Visegrad cooperation as opposed to the American idea of Visegrad as a relatively well defined region? [Havel] I think that the difference is not as big as it might seem. Individual countries are aware that the era, when it was necessary to demonstrate our inseparable unity in such a manifest way, is over. This was [needed] at a time when we were doing away with the Warsaw treaty, when we tried to free ourselves from under the Soviet hegemony. At that time it was important that the heads of states and premiers of those three countries often came together. It was at the time when we strived to achieve a fast withdrawal of the Russian army and we demonstrated our political unity both eastward and westward. That era is over. The tasks were completed. Now comes the era of a more concrete, regional and permanent cooperation. A cooperation which is not being turned into problem by anybody and whose urgency and necessity is being perceived by all. Everybody knows that the basic principle of a foreign policy is to be in good terms with one's neighbors and to cooperate with them in the best possible way. Hence, from the conceptual point of view, there are no differences and it is not essential whether we use the words Visegrad Group or not. If you wish so, I can use them. By the way, this group was given its name by you journalists. Could you give us a specific proof of cooperation that is requested from Visegrad Group countries? [Havel] As I have already indicated all Visegrad countries realize that cooperation will have to come from both sides and that this means also an involvement from their side and not only involvement on the side of the North Atlantic Alliance. Among others this means, for instance, a possible participation of our units in operation which the Alliance may carry out at the request of the United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This implies a certain investment, both moral and material. None of these countries have any doubt about this since it arises directly from the project. [Correspondent] At a news conference today Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar voiced the view that cooperation among the countries of the Visegrad group was stagnating. What is your view and do you think that partnership for peace may become a factor that may make such cooperation more dynamic? [Havel] I would not dare to say that it stagnates. I know, for instance, that interior ministers have regular contacts because the whole region has a common refugee problem, that other ministers also cooperate, that cooperation is taking place in various areas. As you know the Czech Republic has developed initiative to speed up the formation of a free trade zone, to expand free trade by including in it some further commodities. I would not say that this co-operation stagnates. It is perhaps less visible. It has simply shifted to various specific areas and is less demonstrative. [Correspondent] Mr. President, has the Czech Republic or other individual countries of the Visegrad four countries obtained an approximate date and a time-table when they could join the Alliance? [Havel] This issue was not discussed. Everyone was very reticent as far as setting dates was concerned and that included us. This is because we know very well that such a matter depends on an enormous amount of various factors and circumstances which can be hardly envisaged and very few politicians would want to take a blame for setting a date which cannot then be met. We merely say that we want to be regular members of the Alliance as soon as possible, and from the other side we have been assured that nothing stand in our way that would prevent us from becoming regular members soon.
