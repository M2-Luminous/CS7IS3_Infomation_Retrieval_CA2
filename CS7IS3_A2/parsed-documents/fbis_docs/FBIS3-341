The bus was attacked just after leaving the town of Salaga, 330 kilometres (205 miles) north of Accra, for Tamale, 90 kilometres (about 55 miles) further north, one passenger told the DAILY GRAPHIC. The driver forced his passage through the ambush and pressed on to Tamale, the paper said. On Tuesday, Ghanaian military police killed 14 people and wounded 15 others when they intervened after tribal clashes at Tamale, according to a new official toll released Friday. The soldiers opened fire after an angry crowd composed mainly of Dagombas, who had clashed with members of the Konkomba tribe, ignored warning shots and was set to attack the troops, an Information Ministry statement said. The government, which Thursday sent a team headed by Defence Minister Mahama Iddrisu to the region, has expressed its "deepest regrets for the incidents" and conveyed its "profound condolences" to the families of those who died. Initial investigations indicated that the Dagombas launched their attack at Tamale, after the Konkombas had collected their pay from a bank, the statement added. Early last month, tribal strife claimed at least 1,000 lives in northeastern Ghana. The army brought about a fragile truce in mid- February after a state of emergency was declared in the region. That fighting between Konkombas on the one hand and Nanumbas, Dagombas and Gonjas on the other was started by a brawl in a market-place at Yendi, 440 kilometres (270 miles), north of here. The two communities, separated by their tribal backgrounds, social status and religious practices, have been fiercely antagonistic for more than 20 years. In 1981, a dispute over a game of cards eventually led to 1,500 deaths. Ghanaian press reports said that troops sent to the northeast with orders to disarm the rival tribes did not dare to venture into the bush, which hampered their operations considerably.
