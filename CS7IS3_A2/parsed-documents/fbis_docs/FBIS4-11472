What the rules do not state, but which is taken for granted, is that before sacrificing himself he should do everything possible to save the ship. By the same logic, generals should try to prevent their tanks and troops from getting stuck in the mud. This was the reason behind the attempt by Imbel, the Army War Material Industry, to use whatever means were necessary to save Engesa [Specialized Engineers, Inc.] -- which has built 90 percent of the Army tanks and armored vehicles -- after it requested a meeting with its creditors in 1990 and went broke in October 1993. Imbel played the role of government trustee in Engesa until the latter went broke. A memorable moment in this episode was when entrepreneur Daniel Birman, of the Arbi group, was asked to invest no less than $7.2 million, without any guarantee, in Engequimica [expansion unknown], a subsidiary of Engesa. The money was transferred on 20 March 1992. Part of it -- some $2.6 million -- was used to soften up Elizier Trindade, the supervisor of Engesa's call for a meeting with its creditors. Everything seems to indicate that the operation sought to delay the bankruptcy, thus facilitating the enterprise's survival and possible sale. Trindade's preventive detention was ordered on charges of passive corruption, but he fled. But why did a big entrepreneur like Birman cough up so much money without guarantees and without knowing what it was to be used for? "We want to buy Engequimica someday, and the $7.2. million was an advance on the increase of capital, which will be accounted for during the first shareholders' meeting," Arbi group director Haroldo Zago said. One of the enterprises of the group, the Brazilian Ammunition Company (CBC), produces gunpowder. Control over Engequimica would have given Birman an outstanding position on the market, at a good price. ISTOE learned that Birman also expected to conclude an agreement for buying part of Imbel's ammunition factory in Piquete. The Arbi group would thus have almost a monopoly on the gunpowder and ammunition production in Brazil. How could one deny a request from Imbel, which is Birman's partner in CBC and in the DF Vasconcellos enterprise, and a privileged consumer of its products? With this idea in mind, Birman provided the money through Spem, which is one of his enterprises. A few days later, the $7.2 million left Engequimica, which had not asked for a creditors meeting, and went to Engesa, which was its creditor. One third of that money went to Elizier Trindade on the day he arranged a new postponement of the bankruptcy. Trindade divided the money: some for his brother-in-law Jose Carlos da Silva, and some for increasing his Bradesco [Brazilian Discount Bank] account. The largest part of the money went to an account in Codelsur [expansion unknown] -- a Uruguayan financial agency -- through the Rio de Janeiro Cash Bank, apparently without telling Brazilian fiscal authorities. The courts suspect the money that Imbel sought from Birman is comfortably lodged in an account of Trindade in the Uruguayan fiscal paradise. Anything was considered justifiable to save Engesa. Daniel Birman refrained from making any claim, even though no shareholders meeting was held after the money was deposited. Birman, who lost both the money and Engequimica, spoke after the enterprise went bankrupt last year and is now trying to be recognized as one of its creditors. If Imbel asked Birman for multi-million dollar help, who was responsible for softening up the supervisor of Engesa's call for a meeting with its creditors? Engesa's owners Jose Luiz and Jose Guilherme Whitaker, who have exported weapons worth $2.6 billion to 28 countries, swear that Imbel's intervention in their enterprise has put them out of the competitive market. The checks that went to Trindade bear the signature of Engesa attorney Marco Aurelio Montenegro and Imbel attorney Jose Carlos da Silva, who have already been charged with having received stolen goods and their properties have been embargoed. The checks were also "agreed to" by Colonel Lucio Pereira, the then vice president of Imbel, who is responsible for Engesa's intervention. Questioned by ISTOE reporters, Pereira declined to comment "to avoid hindering the investigations." Attorney Heloisa Maluff, of the first chamber of Barueri (Sao Paulo), said: "We have already asked for the lifting of the bank secrecy on the accounts of more than 30 people, among them several military men, to help conclude the investigation." This chamber is adjudicating Engesa's bankruptcy. The Imbel-Birman-Engequimica-Elizier Trindade case is just another affair in the nebulous relationship between Engesa and the Brazilian Army. This relationship was so close that in 1982 it led President Joao Baptista Figueiredo to nominate Jose Luiz Whitaker -- the head of Engesa -- for president of the state-run company Imbel. "Engesa benefited from that," retired General Arnaldo Calderari has said. Calderari, a former Imbel president, resigned in protest over Whitaker's nomination. "Yet instead of growing -- because it used Imbel's market -- Engesa plunged into a crisis," Calderari concluded. The crisis was the factor that made the relationship between the Army and Engesa even more unusual. Imbel was willing to nationalize Engesa in 1989 to guarantee its armored vehicle supplies and to avoid losing the important know-how that had been developed. Carlos Tinoco, the then Army Minister, vetoed the operation during [former President] Fernando Collor's administration. Pedro Paulo Leoni Ramos, known as PP, who at that time was strategic affairs secretary, made a new proposal with the support of the Army War Materiel Department (DMB). Imbel would intervene Engesa and would pay its debts -- which totaled hundreds of millions of dollars -- paving the way for privatization. [as published]. The intervention occurred in 1990. Considering it was not even a state enterprise, the team that was created around PP and General Armando Paiva Chaves, the then DMB chief, sought to arrange the sale without an auction. The first step was to reschedule the debts. Thanks to Colonel Lucio Pereira's efforts, almost all the creditors -- the biggest creditors were the Banco do Brasil and the BNDES [National Bank for Economic and Social Development] -- agreed to modify the established payment deadlines. Other creditors, like Jose Bizerra Lins, the owner of the Pecunia travel agency in Sao Paulo, agreed to collect only 10 percent of the debt and to negotiate the rest later. Engesa owed $60,000 to Bezerra Lins for the purchase -- a few days before the creditors were called to their meeting -- of several first-class tickets from Malaysia to Brazil. The tickets were a present to a group of Malaysian generals interested in Engesa's armored vehicles. The Baureri court believes the creditors who agreed to this "arrangement" within the creditors' meeting will not receive a single extra cent because the Bankruptcy Law states that creditors cannot partially relinquish their rights over amounts that are owed to them. This means a loss for the Banco do Brasil and for the BNDES, which in turn means a loss for consumers. It is a big loss because the two banks accounted for almost 80 percent of Engesa's debt, which is today estimated at more than $500 million. To keep Engesa afloat, the state advanced $100 million as an advance payment on the purchase of more than 1,000 armored vehicles, which have not yet left the drawing board: Yet another loss. After rescheduling the debt it was decided to orient the privatization toward creating a joint venture [preceding two words in English] with a big multinational company of the military sector, a powerful Brazilian private group, and Imbel, which would thus preserve its interests and the technology of the Urutu, Cascavel, and Jararaca vehicles. The path chosen was via the recently created SAO -- South American Ordnance -- which comprises Imbel, the Royal Ordnance (a subsidiary of British Aerospace, one of the world's military giants), and, with 2 percent of the shares, Daniel Birman's Arbi group. The initial objective of SAO was to produce ammunition but the Engesa deal seemed excellent because there would be no competition for the purchase, and the British enterprise might manufacture in Latin America, among other things, its famous Rover jeeps. Gen. Paiva Chaves, retired, has said: "Our only objective was to save a strategic enterprise, of major significance for the Armed Forces, and to recuperate the Brazilian image abroad." Imbel president Paiva Chaves has always enthusiastically advocated cooperation with Royal Ordnance. He added: "We were not interested in private groups, no matter whom." A High Command officer has said: "For the British, it will be a fine deal. They can use Imbel for minor work, while opening new doors through Imbel contacts with the Army." Considering that business does not feed on good intentions, the transfer of Engesa collided with a large green barrier; not of military men but of dollar bills. The British enterprise demands sound Brazilian entrepreneurial engagement and a guarantee that the government will support the new weapons manufacturer. This is difficult at a time of tight budgets. The SAO alternative became permanently stuck following President Collor's resignation and the change in command at Planalto Palace. Daniel Birman left the South America Company and was replaced by the Schahyn Cury group, now with 33 percent of the shares. Gen. Paiva Chaves dreamily said: "The participation of such a large national company would have awoken Royal Ordnance's interest and ensure its participation in Engesa. This is still possible." But reality shows that business became almost impossible. There are still executives in London who dream of setting foot -- or a tank track -- on a tropical shore. In view of its financial problems, however, Royal Ordnance had to sell the Rover Company to the German BMW group. This group was involved in a mega-corruption scandal when it sold materiel to the Malaysian Government. What can be done to save Engesa and the Brazilian Army armored vehicle industry? When the SAO option began to fail, Imbel also began to tumble. The first maneuver, which was reported by ISTOE in 1993, involved the curious expropriation of project facilities and the Sao Jose dos Campos plant, Engesa's most valuable asset. This expropriation has yet to be signed by President Itamar Franco. It also called for the auctioning of the remaining facilities in Barueri and Salvador to pay the labor debt that currently totals $50 million (Engesa failed to deposit its employees' Severance Payment in 1987). The maneuver got stuck because the courts informed Imbel that, if the expropriation really occurred, an audit would be ordered and the corresponding indemnification would be demanded. The Army, however, does not have money to pay an indemnification. The second "all ends are justifiable" maneuver involved the alleged sale of Engesa to entrepreneur Wilson "Cito" Mendes Caldeira, which was also to have taken place last year. Mendes Caldeira agreed to assume the debts as long as they did not surpass $350 million. He contracted auditing services, spent $500,000, and then realized he was about to do something foolish. At the time, it was rumored there never had been a Mendes Caldeira option: it had only been a trick to delay bankruptcy. The company went broke in October 1993. Engesa, the most important symbol of the national materiel industry, went bankrupt because no one, not even Mendes Caldeira, deposited the paltry $250,000 the company owed the National Credit Bank. All possible Imbel maneuvers to save Engesa seem to be have been exhausted. A study by the Armed Forces High Command concluded that the best alternative is to privatize the materiel industry. What large group, however, is interested in Engesa? The armored vehicles project -- except that of the Ogum and Osorio, which are the company's main hope -- belong to the government. The courts are thoroughly checking on assets in store and two years may pass before a definitive auction can be held. Meanwhile, the Urutu and Cascavel tanks of the Brazilian Army and of two other dozen countries are rusting away. A colonel stationed at the central Army barracks in Brasilia said: "Unless a solution to the Engesa problem can be immediately found, Gen. Paiva Chaves will be in a very uncomfortable situation." The irony of the problem, however, is that if the courts establish that the creditors who have signed agreements with Imbel will not receive a single penny, not even a single screw, Engesa will reach auction day without debts. It is also true, however, that it will reach auction day without its vital sap, which has been consumed by years of looting and rusting. And that is the dismal end of the "all ends are justifiable" operation.
