The "very, very good result" would "spur on" the SPD, Scharping told Saarland Radio today. The Bundestag election in October was now completely open. The motto of the SPD federal party conference in Halle, "Now we're off," had proved to be well-founded. The CDU/FDP [Christian Democratic Union/Free Democratic Party] government coalition in Saxony-Anhalt, on the other hand, had suffered a "disastrous setback" with losses of almost 15 percent. If this trend were to continue there would be "an exciting 16 October [date of Bundestag election] and quite certainly a change of government in Germany too," the SPD's candidate for the chancellorship said. Scharping ruled out altogether a coalition between the SPD and PDS [Party of Democratic Socilists] after the Bundestag election. His party did not want to enter into debate about other possible coalitions. In the second half of August at the latest, Scharping said he would announce how an SPD-led government would look.
