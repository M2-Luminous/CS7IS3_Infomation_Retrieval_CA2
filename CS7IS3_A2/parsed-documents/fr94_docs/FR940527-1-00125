Since hospital cost reporting periods do not all coincide with the Federal fiscal year, data for a given Federal fiscal year must be derived from more than one hospital cost report, allocated proportionately to the Federal fiscal year. For example, for a hospital with a cost reporting period beginning January 1, one quarter of its cost report for the period ending December 31, 1987 would be allocated to Federal fiscal year 1988, and three quarters of its cost report for the period ending December 31, 1988 would be allocated to Federal fiscal year 1987. Column 1 represents the number of cost reports used that ended in the Federal fiscal year in question. Column 2 represents the number of cost reports used that began in the Federal fiscal year in question. Column 2 is greater than Column 1 because Column 2 includes cost reports for hospitals whose cost reporting period coincides with the Federal year along with cost reports for those hospitals whose cost reporting periods do not coincide with the Federal fiscal year. Column 1 includes only cost reports for hospitals whose cost reporting periods do not coincide with the Federal fiscal year. 2Figures in column 5 represent capital costs per case, adjusted for the anticipated effects of cost report audits and reopenings, from the December 1993 update of HCRIS. For settled cost reports, and audit adjustment factor of 1.0043 was used in each fiscal year for adjusting capital costs per case figures from column 3 for the effects of audits and reopenings. For as-submitted cost reports, the adjustment factors were as follows: FY 1990_0.9256, FY 1991_0.9172, FY 1992_0.9250. The costs per case figures that result after the application of these audit adjustments to submitted and settled cost reports, respectively, are entered in Column 5.
