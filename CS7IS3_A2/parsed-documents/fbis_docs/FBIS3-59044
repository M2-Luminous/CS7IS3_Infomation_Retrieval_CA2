One in three Netherlanders find them unacceptable. According to an opinion poll conducted by the NIPO [Netherlands Institute for Public Opinion] and commissioned by the SMK [Foundation for Society and the Armed Forces], the figures are 57 and 29 percent respectively. The representative sample on which the figures are based was interviewed on 20 and 21 December 1993, at a time when there was still uncertainty regarding the dispatch of some 1,200 Netherlander ground troops to eastern Bosnia. There are now around 2,000 netherlander troops in the former Yugoslavia. Since the end of December, both the likelihood of sending out the reinforced light mobile battalion and of NATO air strikes in the area where Netherlander troops are stationed has increased. According to Defense Minister Ter Beek, if necessary the battalion will take "robust" action in order to fulfill its dual humanitarian mission -- to protect the Muslim population and humanitarian aid convoys. As many as 70 percent of Netherlanders are strongly in favor of using force if necessary in order to get this aid through -- even if this does increase the risk to Dutch soldiers. At the same time, the Dutch are also becoming increasingly pessimistic regarding the likelihood of a lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia. At the end of 1991, half of public opinion no longer believed in a negotiated peace. One year later this figure had increased to 66 percent, and last month the figure had risen to 84 percent. The SMK adds that, in an opinion poll, every vigorous proposal to do something about the war in Bosnia and the suffering of the civilians is welcomed, even if they involve greater dangers for their own soldiers. But as soon as these risks are separately scrutinized, the majority in favor decreases. Questions which make specific reference to possible dead and wounded apparently meet with just a minority in favor of the use of force which involves risks. The high percentage of people who are pessimistic regarding peace in the former Yugoslavia does not really come as a surprise. There is in fact no optimism regarding any of the world's troublespots. Of particular note is the somber appraisal of the prospects for peace in the (former) Soviet Union: 64 percent are pessimistic and 13 percent optimistic. The electoral success of the far-right nationalist Zhirinovskiy has "certainly not reduced" these figures. Two out of three Netherlanders believe that Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary should be able to join NATO. The picture of an unsafe world is confirmed by the fact that 54 percent of the population believe that the number of armed conflicts will increase in the near future. Against this background, the SMK does not find it strange that 74 percent -- a level not recorded since the end of the Cold War -- of people believe there is a need for the armed forces. At 72 percent, participation in UN missions in general receives virtually the same level of support. This does not detract from the fact that the defense of one's own and allied territories is seen by most people (40 percent) as the most important task of the armed forces. Humanitarian aid is seen to be the most important by 35 percent, and worldwide crisis management the most important by 21 percent.
