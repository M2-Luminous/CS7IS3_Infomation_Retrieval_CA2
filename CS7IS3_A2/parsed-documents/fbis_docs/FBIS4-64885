According to current plans, some 33 percent of this program is the responsibility of Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and British Aerospace, 21 percent is the responsibility of the Italian Alenia, and 13 percent is the responsibility of Spanish Casa. These proportions are based on the number of aircraft each partner country will purchase. But because Defense Minister Ruehe wants to purchase 140 Eurofighters instead of the planned 200, the German share should fall to 25 percent. DASA will not accept this reduction, arguing that the degree of involvement in the program depends on the share of the costs of developing the fighter, and this share remains the same, of course. The dispute will probably drag on until next spring because that is when the government will decide whether or not to buy the expensive Eurofighter. The latest price offered by the aircraft industry is 102.5 million marks.
