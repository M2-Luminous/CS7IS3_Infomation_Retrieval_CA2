According to reports received by ARMENPRESS from the Nagorno-Karabakh army defence headquarters, fighting continues in the northern sector of the front and the Mardakert area. Karabakh forces are reported to be repulsing enemy attacks. The Nagorno-Karabkah leadership holds the view that by inflaming the situation in the Karabakh-Azeri confrontation zone, Baku is once again using brute force and challenging the international community, which is making efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. The Azeri Army is engaging in large-scale offensives on the eve of forthcoming high-level peace talks for which the Russian Foreign Ministry is making preparations, and on the eve of the next regular meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in Europe (CSCE) Minsk group on Nagorno-Karabakh, which is opening in Prague today.
