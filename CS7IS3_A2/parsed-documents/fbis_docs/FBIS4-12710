The unpublicized session lasted two hours. According to well-informed sources, speaking to AL-MAJD, Tariq 'Aziz said at a private meeting with friends in the Jordanian capital that Baghdad had access to documents showing that Gulf Arab leaders lavish gifts and bribes on Western dilomats posted in their countries so that they write back to their capitals warning about Iraqi potential threats to and designs on the Gulf states and demanding that the sanctions be maintained. Representations of Kurds in northern Iraq, according to 'Aziz, have been visiting Baghdad recently to appeal to the Iraqi Government to move to rid them of practices by Kurdish militia chiefs, such as Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani. The delegations stressed the Kurdish people's adherence to and support for the Iraqi leadership, according to 'Aziz. Baghdad recently received numerous signals from Moscow that the Russian Government was willing to cooperate with Iraq and reinstate relations on solid foundations, 'Aziz said. Moscow sent the message that it was anxious to see itself gradually break free from the grip of the United States and resume its status on the world stage as a superpower.
