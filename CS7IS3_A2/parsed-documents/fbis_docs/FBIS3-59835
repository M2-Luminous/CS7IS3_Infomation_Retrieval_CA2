There are fewer than 3,000 Thai workers in other Middle East countries. But there are still more than 20,000 Thai workers in Libya, which means that among Arab countries, Libya has the second largest number of Thai workers. Of the more than 20,000 Thais working in Libya, statistics on those sent between 1990 and the present show that almost 13,000 are employed by the Dong A Consortium, a Korean contractor. This is the single largest source of employment for Thais in Libya. The second largest employs only 1,750 Thais. To date, 34 groups of Thai workers have been sent to work for the Dong A Company, with each group consisting of approximately 400-500 workers. Thus, the Dong A Consortium is a giant for Thai workers in Libya. This company has won the bid to build a man-made river for the Libyan government. This is Libya's largest investment project, which calls for laying pipeline to transport water from large underground reservoirs in the desert for use by communities located along the coast. About 40 percent of the Dong A employees are from Taiwan, and 60 percent are from Thailand. Because Thailand and Libya do not have diplomatic relations, in the past workers who wanted to go work in Libya had to obtain a visa from the Libyan embassy in Malaysia and then fly to Tripoli, the capital of Libya. When countries halted air service to Libya because of the conflict between Libya and the United States, travel became even more difficult. Now, people must first travel to a neighboring country and then enter the country. For example, one route is to travel from Bangkok to Egypt and then take a bus from Egypt to Libya, which takes 30 hours. Dong A, which has sent many Thai workers to Libya, uses this route. This is because the construction project is located in eastern Libya near Egypt. A second route is from Bangkok to Malta. From there, people can take a boat to Tunisia, which borders the northwestern region of Libya and which is near Tripoli. Even though these long routes pose an obstacle, the profits waiting there are very attractive. The first project in the eastern region of Libya was completed last year. And 3 years ago, Libya launched a second 8-year project in the western part of the country. Libya has invested more than $8 billion in these two projects. Thai workers will build the "eighth wonder of the world" as this is called by Colonel Muammar Qadhdhafi. The fact that more than 20,000 Thais are now working in Libya shows the effort that they are making to earn a living and enjoy a secure life. Their skills and qualities are greatly appreciated by the companies that employ them. An official of the Dong A Company said that it can be said that these projects are the work of Thais alone. Those who employ Thai workers are very satisfied with them as compared with workers from other countries. A driver is paid about $335. If he works 3 hours a day overtime, he can earn about 12,883 baht a month. The companies provide free room and board near the work site. "Workers can save a minimum of 100,000 baht a year. The employment agencies charge each worker a fee of 40,000 baht." In view of the fact that Dong A is a large employer of foreign workers and that it employees mostly Thais, there are several employment agencies that seek to place workers. These include the PPP Construction Employment Company, the BPB International Company, and the Khuta Company. An employment agency news source said that the managing director of the BPB International Company is a South Korean and so there is a close relationship. Also, the Thai shareholder is a close relative of Mr. Kittisak Hatthasongkhro, a Thai Nation Party MP [member of parliament] from Udon Thani Province. The minimum wage paid is $240-250 a month, and there are benefits. This is very attractive to Thais hoping to strike it rich in the desert--something they have little hope of doing at home. Now that this conflict has arisen, those engaged in sending Thai workers to Libya, who stand to be affected the most by this, have expressed great concern. Madam Kim, the managing director of the BPB International Company, said that preparations have been made to send another 100 workers. But they can't be sent because the Thai government has prohibited this. Actually, the Thai workers there are helping to build up Libya. In particular, the man-made river project must proceed. If Libya does expel Thai workers, those working for the Dong A will probably be the last to leave. The problem is, the "Thai government likes to interfere, which just causes problems." A news source from the Khuta Employment Company Ltd said that Libya is now starting to employ workers from Vietnam and the Philippines instead. It is the government that has created the problem, but it is the workers who must suffer the consequences. Quick action must be taken to solve this problem. "Actually, Libya wants Thai workers, because they are even more skilled that the Koreans and it is their company. This is clear from the fact that the salaries paid to Thai workers are second only to what the Koreans get. Also, they are given annual bonuses and raises." The salaries of these workers are higher than those in Thailand who have a master's degree. Also, they get room and board. Most are drivers, blacksmiths, plasterers, and laborers. Thailand is on the horns of a dilemma. Whichever way it turns, it could get hurt. The government has done things in a very "noisy" way. This has been the case even though Letter NR0504/1419 signed by General Charan Kunlawanit, the secretary general of the National Security Council, summarized the problems and said that Thailand should take action against those private companies said to be involved with the chemical weapons plant in Libya. But the letter stressed that things should be done very carefully, because this is a very delicate issue. Police officials, however, have done things in a very "noisy" manner, apparently wanting the United States to see what they have done, even though they could have done things quietly. Prior to this, officials had been negotiating with Libyan officials in an attempt to remove about 200 Thai workers from the Libyan plant said to be a chemical weapons plant. Thai officials cited the agreement signed by Thailand that prohibits chemical weapons. A regulation that will prohibit Thai workers from working at weapons plants is now being drafted. Libya has been monitoring all of this, because these things are in line with the pressure now being exerted by the United States, Libya's enemy. [passage omitted] From another angle, the companies that send workers abroad are pressuring the government to solve this problem. The fact that officials are licking the ass of the United States may stem from pressures having to do with trade problems between Thailand and the United States. The United States frequently likes to use the GSP issue as a bargaining chip. What this means is that the government gives greater weight to exporters than to those who send workers abroad or to Thai workers who are trying to making a living abroad. There is a good chance that the second largest labor market in the Arab bloc will soon shut down completely. The Man-Made River Project, Water Conduit or Underground Weapons Plant? The collision between Libya and the United States over the terrorists responsible for the bombing of the Pan American Jet has affected Thailand. The Thai engineer who owns a construction contracting company in Chiang Mai was arrested on charges of sending workers abroad illegally. But there are are rumors that he designed an underground tunnel in Libya for use as an underground chemical weapons plant. This has apparently made Qadhdhafi so angry that he has ordered the expulsion of the more than 20,000 Thai workers from Libya. The matter of the underground tunnel is very confusing. Some people say that this is an air raid shelter. Others say that it can be modified for use as an underground weapons production plant. And some say that it is a water conduit that is part of the man-made river project. "The man-made river project, or plant to produce huge water pipes for the project (Berka plant), is 1.4 million square meters in size. The plant produces pipes with a diameter of 4 meters and a length of 7.5 meters. Concerning Libya's "Great Man Made River Project, documents compiled by Dong A official Udon Chanthawan, and a document entitled "The River of Life" prepared by Libyan officials state that the purpose of this project is to defeat the dry natural conditions of the Sahara desert. The goal is to transform this desert into a green agricultural zone. [passage omitted] Thus, this huge project to pipe water from the middle of the desert to communities in the north is in form similar to a man-made river. Altogether, there are five projects: 1. The Al-Sarin-Sidra and Qaslr Benghazi lines. 2. The western Jamahiriyah-Tripoli line. 3. The line connecting Kufra with the headwaters of a river. 4. Ajdabiya-Tubruq. 5. The Sidra line, which follows the coast to Tripoli. [passage omitted] Building these five projects will require a huge sum of money. The first project alone cost $3.27 billion, or more than 80 billion baht, to build. Almost 2,000 km of pipe with a diameter of 4 meters had to be laid through the desert. It took 9 years to complete this project. A total of 1 million cubic meters of water flows through this pipeline each day. The second project, which is being built by the Dong A Consortium, will cost $4.6324 billion. About 2 million cubic meters of water a day will flow through this pipeline. This project will consist of 283 km of iron pipe and 1,240 km of concrete pipe and will take 8 years to build. The man-made river project has not yet been completed. But much experience and knowledge about underground work has been gained from building an underground tunnel in different topographical conditions. A tunnel with a diameter of 4 meters is large enough for a vehicle to drive through. [passage omitted]
