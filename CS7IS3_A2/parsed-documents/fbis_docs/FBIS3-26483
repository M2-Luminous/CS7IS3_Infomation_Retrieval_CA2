A provincial meeting of directors of industrial and commercial bureaus concluded yesterday. Chai Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and executive vice governor, stated: We should comprehensively implement various industrial and commercial administrative reforms, and should establish authoritative market-related law enforcement and supervision organs. Chai Songyue urged industrial and commercial administrative organs to earnestly study and implement the "Company Law" as well as help enterprises become independent legal entities which are incorporated and disbanded in accordance with the law, and which operate independently and assume full responsibility for their own profits and losses, in keeping with reforms of the modern enterprise system and the enterprise registration and management system. Chai Songyue added: Industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels should actively work with relevant departments to vigorously cultivate markets, especially those for production means and factors, in accordance with the demands raised by the provincial party committee and government. We should conscientiously perform the glorious duty of overseeing and managing the large socialist market. At present, we should pay special attention to overseeing and managing grain, cooking oil, and vegetable markets, and should investigate and sternly deal with the practices of manipulating and cornering markets and of driving up prices. We should also stabilize markets and work in earnest to ensure supplies to fill "rice sacks" and "shopping baskets." Chai Songyue said: We should judge things against the criterion of "whether they are conducive to the three causes" [conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist society, to increasing the overall strength of our socialist country, and to improving the people's living standards]. We should correctly understand the status and role of the non-state sector. We should not only continue to develop the individual and private sectors in areas where the state economic sector is underdeveloped, but should also encourage the development of such sectors in areas where the state sector has a relatively sound basis. We should intensify our education, supervision, and management of operators of individually- and privately-run enterprises, instructing them to love their party and country, respect their professions and abide by the law, work honestly, pay taxes according to relevant regulations, operate legally, and seek healthy development. Other speakers included Kong Xiangyou, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee, and Lu Songting, secretary general of the provincial government.
