There are also external reasons, namely leading Hungarian politicians, in the background of the crisis, the document reads. According to the VMDK leaders, some powerful people of the Hungarian Government made the financial support aimed for the Vojvodina Hungarians subject to a demonstration of party loyalty. The aim of the Hungarian Government politicians was to line up the VMDK, too, among the supporters of the Budapest coalition.
