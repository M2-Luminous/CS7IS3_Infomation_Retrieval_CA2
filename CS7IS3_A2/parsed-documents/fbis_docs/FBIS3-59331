Besides the one or two friends who knew about it, there was almost no one else who knew, which greatly surprised friends overseas and in the mainland. Friends ask me: "Why did you go back to Beijing?" "To get some books, and second, to meet some friends, especially good friends," I answer half jokingly. In fact, there might be more important reasons, like checking out the atmosphere and seeing Beijing. It is strange that while I was in Beijing I hated it there, but after being away, I always think back to Beijing. I remember once returning to Beijing from Singapore. I walked on Xiwaida street, and the crowded pedestrians and the noisy environment made me immediately feel warm and happy: I had come back home. I also remember that on 11 June 1989, I went to Guangzhou, and my Hong Kong friends there advised me to leave the country. I hesitated for a while, but eventually decided to stay and after a little while I went back to Beijing (Even though I was a bit regretful later on). There are many reasons I did this, but among them there was an unconscious reason, a fear of being parted from Beijing. Anyhow, I lived for forty years in Beijing. It seems strange that although the last several times I was away from Beijing were for less time than this one, when I walked into my living and study rooms I always had some familiar and strange feelings. This time when going back, I of course also expected this kind of feeling. I do not know why the similar feelings did not arise: Everything was still familiar, just as if I had only left for several days. Sure, everything seemed as familiar as before, and everything seemed unchanged. Beijing was still as crowded as before, dust was still flying around, and the air was still so unfresh. These feelings were emphasized having come from an extremely clean country such as Switzerland, which has less people and more space. It may not have changed overall, but there still may be some smaller changes: There are more vendor stands selling food and clothing, especially the small yellow "loaf of bread" taxis that are all over the streets, and will stop when you wave to them. The fare is reasonable and inexpensive, at ten yuan per ten kilometers. Before, I have always said that among the four essential items of food, clothing, housing and transportation, the first three are satisfactory for the people of Beijing, with only transportation posing a problem--it is particularly difficult for people to get onto the public buses. Today, it seems that this problem has been solved. My friends all say so, and I have been happy about this for a long time. Even though the yellow taxis may not look good in the scenery--this kind of extremely ugly bug crawling everywhere and polluting the air and environment badly--they benefit the people. Over the course of a year, there have been some changes: More abundant commercial products, more crowded and noisy markets, higher quality clothes, more expensive restaurants, and more wealthy people. To get a haircut is seven yuan, but when I left the country it was only eight jiao. To take a shower is three yuan, but before it was six jiao. Of course the prices for grain, meat and vegetables, and clothes did not increase this much, and most of them did not increase by more than half. Thus it seems that my friends do not have many complaints. One friend told me that she earns six to seven hundred yuan per month which is enough to support a child. But I think that she cannot go to a restaurant on her salary. Even though not going to restaurants, she can still eat chicken, duck, fish and meat, which are not very expensive at market prices. Thus, let those who have the money and would like to pay for a restaurant go there. Also, there are different levels of restaurants. Even the food sold by the roadside is not completely inedible. I think this is very good and hope that the gap between rich and poor will not widen. Multiple life-styles, different options and levels of consumption are a healthy road for development. In this way the people who "would like to stay poor" have the means to "stay" poor; otherwise, if there is really no food to eat, how can those people carry out their studies? Nevertheless, a lot of people still persuade me that I had better stay abroad, there is no research to do in China. Of course, I understand that in China to do research is not better than doing business. There will not be a "culture fashion," rather, the "doing business fashion" will continue to prevail. This is what I had expected, and I think this is a good thing. At the same time I also understand that there are still a lot of people who did not "jump into the ocean," or are unable to "jump into the ocean," or are not willing to "jump into the ocean," but are seriously pursuing their research. Moreover, there are younger intellectuals who are growing rapidly in number. They abandon politics, concentrating on knowledge. With strong ambitions and boundless enthusiasm, they came to see me. It seems that so long as you do not touch upon politics, and do not speak about human rights and democracy, you can read about Sarte, speak about Nitzche, and write about Hobbes. No one will interrupt you. Two years ago people criticized my left-wing opinions, now people hardly repudiate me. As for those points that have been criticized, there are still a lot of people writing about them, using them, and "spreading" them. They just don't mention my name. This is very ridiculous, but history and truth are often absurd and astonishing, especially in today's China. Of course, my friends are still unhappy that the news is still in the same form, with politics and ideology showing no signs of freedom. To recover the relatively lenient situation and environment prior to "4 June" is not very easy. It still takes a lot of effort, and even a longer period of time. This is in my expectations. I also predict that there will not be a change for the time being. Changes come slowly, but I think that slow change also works as long as we do not go backward. Not going backward is going forward. Of course, that great change will come eventually. I still hope it will come gradually, step by step; if it comes too fast, too easy, too unbelievably, it may not be good. This year one of my students published an article that says that the object of philosophy is ideas, and "ideology" is already far removed from Marxist-Leninist philosophy; the article is written profoundly and logically. Thus it was published without questions, and nobody tried to stop it. Isn't this nice? Culture, knowledge and literature that were once denounced as "corrupt, anti- revolutionary, backward, modern western capitalistic" culture, are again circulated by publishing companies, isn't this good? This trip to Beijing went very fast, altogether about twenty days. Besides Zaifu and one other friend who knew, there was almost nobody who knew before the trip, which greatly surprised my friends on the mainland and oversees. Since coming back to Beijing, I have of course returned to my previous unit and also met several institution directors. After some small talk, one person laughed at my "lightning" trip, and criticized my anti-leftist articles in the journal FANGZUO BEIWANGLU [PREVENT LEFTISM MEMORANDUM]. I said that I agree with the "non-argument" principle, but are not the leftists still constantly attacking me? I of course had a reason to rejoin with my article in the fourth issue of ZHONGLIU, and to take a "lightning" approach when visiting Beijing to "prevent unexpected events." The director is also my friend, who smiled embarrassingly and again pointed out that my trip was welcomed and assured me of the freedom to come and go. This is really funny. When I was in Beijing, I read the July issue of the journal ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU, which still carried the article criticizing my views. It is ironic that the writer who criticized me in various ways in the article eventually went to the United States to look for democracy, and it seems that he will never come back. After I read about this, I could not help secretly laughing: Does this mean that Beijing will always remain as your world? Today, haven't I come back? Moreover, I will still come back in the future. Beijing's democracy, and China's democracy, are more important to me than American democracy.
