[Buwayz] The meeting dealt with several major political issues, those concerning the regional situation and foreign policy and those concerning the domestic situation. Lebanon is undoubtedly coming to a sensitive stage as far as the [peace] negotiations are concerned, especially in view of the progress made in the Palestinian-Israeli file and the efforts being made to boost the negotiations. I believe the Lebanese arena should be fortified in a way that will enable Lebanon to deal with this stage using all its resources and capabilities. Regarding the domestic situation and the political, media, and security issues, I believe that despite everything, this stage requires action that will enable Lebanon to get through this critical stage. [Al-Da'uq] His beatitude the [Maronite] patriarch, in his Easter message two days ago, raised the issue of the Christians' participation and the lack of a balanced treatment of Christians. What is your view of this and of the patriarch's message? [Buwayz] I do not believe anyone is saying he has achieved his every ambition for Lebanon, be it in relation with national unity, democracy, or the development of the political system. The crux of the matter is that this state has not inherited much. This state has not inherited establishments, only destruction and ruin. We have many more ambitions for Lebanon. As for the timing for achieving them, the state undoubtedly need not rush through each stage, but should make particular, constant progress toward strengthening national accord, building the state of institutions and the state of justice, and toward achieving the accurate, developed, and real representation, not of individuals, as much as of political ideas. [Al-Da'uq] Minister, the vanguards of the Palestinian police started to arrive in the Gaza Strip today. Will the start of the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho Agreement help boost the negotiations, specifically on the Lebanese-Israeli track? [Buwayz] The Israeli side's excuse in the previous round of negotiations was its inability to advance on several fronts and that the Palestinian file remained open, requiring it to be focused upon before embarking on other files. It appears now that this file has made some progress on its principal points. So we are asking what the next excuse will be. In the previous round, the Israeli side claimed that the Israeli Government's domestic position did not allow the adoption of or commitment to decisive decisions. Now, following the development of this domestic position and these new alliances we see in the Israeli domestic arena, we believe there can be no excuses for keeping the negotiations stalled and futile. We believe there might be some appropriate climate if the Israeli side really wants to be serious in the coming stage. [Al-Da'uq] Minister, have you been told that the U.S. secretary of state might visit Lebanon during his next tour? [Buwayz] I believe this tour remains vague; its itinerary has not been drawn up. [Al-Da'uq] Thank you, Minister.
