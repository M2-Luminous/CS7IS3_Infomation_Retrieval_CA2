"We must see through and fight the fascist trend that has been clearly emerging in politics for the past half year since the inauguration of the Hosokawa cabinet," the group said in a statement. All group members are legislators of the powerful House of Representatives. The 22-member group of the main opposition asserted that Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, major components in the seven-party coalition, want political reform to be achieved so as to gain absolute power. A change in the system for House of Representatives elections, a centerpiece of the government-sponsored reform package, "is a weapon definitely necessary for a political bloc forged by Shinseito and Komeito." It described the two parties as having a "fascist nature" in their lust for power. "We are saying what nobody else has said, though he or she has noticed the signs," lower house member Katsuhiko Shirakawa told a news conference. Calling Shinseito and Komeito "authoritarian and autocratic" forces, another lower house member, Minoru Noda, said the two parties will continue to threaten the nation's parliamentary democracy. The coalition and the LDP have been at loggerheads over the course of political reform aimed at ending rampant corruption in Japanese public life. Hosokawa has staked his political fate on enactment of necessary legislation by the January 29 close of the current Diet session. Shirakawa and other LDP lower house legislators told reporters that they will ask lower house and House of Councillors legislators of other political parties to join the parliamentary group, temporarily called "The Association of Solidarity for Freedom." Shinseito's co-leader, Ichiro Ozawa, is one of the most powerful politicians in the coalition and was apparently instrumental in establishing the coalition government last August after dislodging the LDP from a 38-year-old grip on power following the general elections a month earlier. Ozawa is believed to have still exerted strong influences behind the scenes and have a strong tie with Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa. Political analysts said Shinseito and Komeito may unite as the next stage of rallying political forces comes around.
