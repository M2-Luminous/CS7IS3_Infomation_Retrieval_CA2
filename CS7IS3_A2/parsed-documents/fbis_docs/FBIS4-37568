He was received by the brother commander of the camp and the officers. During his visit, the brother president saw the progress of training and qualification programs at the camp and inspected the situation of the troops and NCO's. The troops expressed their happiness over the visit of the brother commander president, asserting their willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of the homeland and duty under all circumstances in defense of the will of the people to maintain unity and bolster their march and promote progress under democracy, which they chose as a way of life. They noted that there is nothing more precious than the homeland and its unity and that nothing deserves more precious sacrifices than maintaining unity. The brother leader president spoke to the brother officers, NCO's, and soldiers, praising the enthusiasm, high morale, sincere national feelings, and overwhelming feelings of love for the homeland and loyalty to it, which are demonstrated by the brother members of the camp and all other sons of our Armed Forces. He said this high national and moral spirit on the part of each individual in our valiant Armed Forces is a true embodiment of our just cause and of the noble principles and goals in which the sons of our Armed Forces believe and to which they are faithful. He noted that they do not fear death and do not neglect their duty under all circumstances. It was by this courageous national spirit that the heroes of our Armed Forces have championed the will of their people and foiled all schemes and plots against the homeland and its unity. They are today valiantly opposing the gang of apostasy and secession and defeating it all over Yemen. They are thus recording a new chapter of glory, heroism, and sacrifice for our people and our Armed Forces, which have always been faithful to the people and the homeland and have represented a bulwark that wards off all dangers and challenges. The brother president noted the challenges imposed by the traitorous agents on the homeland and the seditions and sabotage they sought to ignite. He said the history of that criminal gang is replete with destruction and sabotage and that its conduct is marked by treason and plotting. Without this, this gang cannot live or have any existence. Our people have received nothing from this gang save death and destruction. He added that the collusion, treason, and spite of this gang against the people and homeland have been exposed. This gang has a black history of oppression, suppression, and massacres by suppressing the people's freedoms and displacing qualified personnel of the sons of the homeland. Our people are today rising against this clique and are opposing its spite and trickery to maintain their unity, freedom, and democracy. They also seek to build their new society on the basis of justice, comprehensive development, and advanced local government that is founded on administrative and financial decentralization, respect for human rights, dignity, and property. The brother leader president added that the heroic and great role which our Armed Force are playing in defending unity and constitutional legitimacy and in confronting those who have departed from that unity, legitimacy, and the free will our people demonstrated during the elections of the 27 April 1993, express our people's strong belief in and determination to safeguard the achievements and gains they made, thanks to their struggle, sacrifices, and efforts throughout the course of the Yemeni revolutions on 26 September and 14 October. The brother president referred to the current criminal acts the rebel secessionist gang is committing against the people and homeland by targeting economic installations and civilian establishments and continuing its hostile, destructive policy, including firing Scud missiles against peaceful civilians, attacking the Aden refinery pipeline and the power generating station, and destroying electricity and water projects in the Lahij and Abyan governorates, the latest of which was the treacherous aggression against civilians and the power generating station in the airport. This gang is also cracking down on and torturing innocent citizens in the brave city of Aden, where the supporters of that gang are forcing children, the elderly, and women to carry arms, plunging them into the furnace of death without fear of God and undeterred by conscience, ethics, or humanism. He also stressed that this criminal gang will not escape justice because it has committed acts of crime against the people and homeland, referring to the many opportunities the leadership has offered to those who were misled to join the ranks of unity and legitimacy and not to obey orders issued to them by that gang. He then explained that those who were misled could still benefit from the general amnesty law and join the ranks of unity and legitimacy in order to end the shedding of Yemeni blood. Therefore, he said, they should take advantage of that before it is too late and before they regret what they have done against their people and homeland, stressing that our people and the Armed Forces, which have managed to overcome many challenges and backed the will of revolution, liberation, and independence, will not relinquish unity and will face that new challenge that is imposed on the homeland's unity and future. Victory will come, God willing, for our faithful, patient, and militant people and for the brave Armed Forces. In his speech, the brother president praised the large-scale national rallying by the masses of our people, chief among which are political parties and groups, popular and professional organizations, and all political and social forces, which have faced up to their national responsibility and which have demonstrated a patriotic stand. He also said that the challenge imposed by the gang of apostasy and secession on the homeland and its unity represents a real test to responsible positions and the principled commitment to the national constants. The brother president praised the great role Yemeni women played in supporting the defense of unity and legitimacy. He said that the generous donations, including food and money, which were offered by every mother and sister in the Yemeni family, represented a strong moral support for the heroes of our brave Armed Forces, which are waging the military operations against the rebels who have abandoned legitimacy. He also hailed our people's genuineness, their love for their homeland, and their adherence to unity as a great goal that cannot be relinquished, adding and that the homeland and its unity are worthy of all sacrifices.
