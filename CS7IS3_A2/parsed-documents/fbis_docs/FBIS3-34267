Andy King, director of Gatwick-based ANA Aviation, said the Boeing 707 aircraft's cargo contained nothing more sensitive than torch batteries. The aircraft was on route for Aden with a cargo for the Southern Yemen airline al-Yemda when it was forced to land at al-Hudaydah airport near Sanaa, by the military. The four-man crew, which included a British engineer, left Britain with the cargo on Saturday night. After the Ugandan-registered plane was forced down they were held at the airport for 18 hours before being released. "This is air piracy as far as we are concerned," said Mr King. "The plane had permission to go to Aden. You can't force airplanes out of the sky. It's against international law. We are being used as a pawn between the North and South Yemenis," he said. "There was nothing dangerous or of a military nature on board. There were just batteries and some pharmaceuticals," added Mr King. He said various diplomatic efforts were being made and it was hoped the plane would be able to take off again with its cargo tomorrow. A Yemeni interior ministry official said the plane was seized because it was carrying batteries for military equipment and communications sets and had entered the country's airspace without the knowledge or approval of the authorities. Tension has been growing recently between the formerly Marxist People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (South Yemen) and the north.
