The delegations included representatives of the Public Order and Foreign Affairs Ministries of the two countries. Correspondents report that the meeting dealt with events at the Ano Episkopi Military Camp and the issue of the Albanian illegal immigrants, whose number at the Greek-Albanian border has increased. Yeoryios Kirousis, our correspondent in Ioannina, reports that most of the arrested North Epirus Greek-Albanians, members of the organization Omonoia [Greek-Albanians Association], have been taken to Tirana. No one knows how many Omonoia members have been arrested from Sarande, Delvine, Himare, Gjirokaster, Tepelene and (Premetis). Omonoia President Sotirios Kiriazatis also went to Tirana for meetings with government officials to discuss the persecution of the Greek minority in Albania. The latest mass arrests and strong police presence in the towns and villages of North Epirus have reportedly created fear among the Greek minority. The residents of the area avoid moving far from their homes and stay indoors after sunset. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias stressed that the Greek Government condemns and protests the profound and continuous persecution of the Greek minority by the Albanian authorities. The foreign minister made his statement after the mass arrests of Omonoia members in Gjirokaster yesterday. These actions, he said, violate basic human rights and personal liberties. Papoulias added: The Greek people, who generously welcome and host thousands of Albanian citizens, question and feel offended by the Albanian authorities' behavior against the Greek minority in Albania. The foreign minister stresses that the government will take all the necessary steps and make representations to protect the Greek minority's internationally safeguarded rights.
