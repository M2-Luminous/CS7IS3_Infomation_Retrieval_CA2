A: I will discuss with Prime Minister Chuan ways of deepening the ties of friendship and cooperation between the Republic of Korea and Thailand and of promoting share prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. First of all, we will focus our attention on how our two countries should pull together to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, which is threatening the security of not only this region but also of the entire world. We will also conduct in depth discussions on ways to boost substantive bilateral economic cooperation, especially by expanding the flow of trade, investment and people between our two countries. Views will also be exchanged on how to strengthen Asia-Pacific regional cooperation, primarily through the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Q: Where does Thailand stand in South Korea's conduct of foreign affairs and international economic relations? How do you envisage bilateral Korean-Thai relations to develop from now? A: As part of its New Foreign Policy, our Government is attaching great importance to Southeast Asia. As a key member of ASEAN Thailand is playing a major regional role. I applaud your countries for taking the initiative in creating the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and for having striven so hard to promote stability on Indochina. Later this year, in its capacity as the chairman of ASEAN, Thailand will host the first meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum, at which a multilateral dialogue on Asia-Pacific security will be conducted for the first time. I am hopeful that this forum will greatly contribute to peace and security in this region. My view is that our two countries will be able to further expand mutual ties, especially by more actively conducting bilateral and multilateral efforts to promote regional prosperity and security. In view of the fact that Thailand, which occupies an important position in the ASEAN and Indochinese economy, is continuing to grow rapidly, I believe the importance of your country as a diplomatic and economic partner for us is increasing faster than ever. Just as Korea is located at the centre of Northeast Asia, so is Thailand serving as a bridge between ASEAN and Indochina. Accordingly, I think Thailand is an important base for Korean businesses venturing into Indochina and Myanmar (Burma). It is true that nowadays, our two countries are competing against each other on the international market in a limited range of products like garments and footwear. My view is, however, that there is a great potential for complementary and mutually advantageous economic interaction between our two countries in many areas. [Text] Furthermore, since both Korea and Thailand have sustained a high growth rate on the strength of outward-looking development strategies and the industriousness of their peoples, I believe that our two countries are in a unique position to lead economic growth in the Asia-Pacific region. I hope and expect that building on its long-standing, open-door policy for all regardless of ideological differences Thailand will be able to significantly contribute not only to the stability of the Korean Peninsula but also to the stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region in general. Q: How do you envisage South Korea's economic relations with ASEAN and Indochina to develop taking into account your country's close economic ties with neighbouring countries in Northeast Asia? A: In the wake of the end of the Cold War, China and Vietnam -- the major Asian socialist countries -- are rapidly emerging as major markets for the Republic of Korea (ROK). Korean businesses are briskly moving into those lands to combine their technology and capital with the abundant human and natural resources there in a complementary and mutually beneficial fashion. My view is that the business climate is also greatly improving in the ASEAN countries as they continue to achieve rapid growth, thus joining the ranks of the newly-industrialised economies. They are also opening their markets ever wider and intensively investing in social infrastructure. Consequently, there now are emerging greater opportunities for the Republic of Korea and ASEAN to develop complementary economic ties, especially by sharing their accumulated developmental expertise and information. In particular, I believe it advisable for the ROK and Thailand and other ASEAN to enter joint ventures in Vietnam and neighbouring Indochinese countries, now that their relations with the United States are improving and they are emerging as attractive targets for foreign investment. To further expand ROK-ASEAN economic cooperation, I think it is necessary that the emerging and contemplated sub-regional groupings, such as AFTA and EAEC (the East Asian Economic Caucus), be open economic communities, rather than closed trading blocs. Q: What specific policies does South Korea intended to adopt vis-a-vis Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos)? Does your government intend to pursue such policies by going it alone or in partnership with any country in ASEAN? A: Korea normalised diplomatic relations with Vietnam in December 1992, and will do so with Cambodia and Laos in due course. Presently, we are contributing to the efforts of Vietnam to rebuild its economy. We hope that we will be able to promote economic exchanges and visits with Cambodia and Laos even prior to the normalisation of diplomatic relations. We know that our policies toward these countries are in line with the efforts of ASEAN to promote the peace, stability and prosperity of the nations in the region. Q: Does your government have any clear-cut policy on helping to bring about positive political and economic changes in Burma? A: We are very interested in the development of Myanmar and hope that it will be able to smoothly achieve democratisation as well as economic development. It was in this context that our Government welcomed the Myanmar Government announcement in April 1992 of the release of political prisoners along with a timetable for democratisation. The Korean Government has, in fact, been positively considering offering Myanmar assistance from the Economic Development Cooperation Fund to help promote its economic well-being. We also plan to study ways to cooperate with other ASEAN nations in supporting the democratic development and economic reforms of Myanmar. Q: What does South Korea hope to achieve from its participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum? A: We hope and expect that the forum will gradually build a security regime in the Asia-Pacific region. As the forum is comprised of nations that have had hostile relations in the past, we believe that it should gradually build a climate of mutual trust through free discussion of issues of mutual concern including politics and regional security, rather than attempting to resolve all pending issues en bloc. We understand that the forum's initial conference will be held in July with the participation of the foreign ministers of 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific region. We believe that that meeting will be very significant as it reflects a common concern about regional security and cooperation. Q: What role does South Korea expect Japan to play in the broader framework of regional security in the Asia-Pacific region? Should Japan assume a bigger security role in areas such as regional and international peacekeeping? A: Now that the Cold War era is over, Japan will be able to play a strengthened role commensurate with its economic power, and increase its responsibility for the peace and prosperity of the region. However, it should not be overlooked that the unfortunate experience which the nations in the region suffered in the past has caused Japan's neighbors to be wary about its emergence as a major military power in the region. Therefore, Japan should spare no effort to remove such anxiety. Q: What specific measures do you propose to resolve the confrontation on the Korean Peninsula? And how do you propose to go about implementing these measures? A: Due to increasing doubts about North Korea's nuclear development and its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), tension has been mounting, not only between South and North Korea but in the international community, which is seeking sanctions against North Korea. There will be no easing of tension between the South and the North as long as North Korea refuses to return to the IAEA and settle the nuclear issue. However, if the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, it will be possible to promote mutual prosperity by implementing the various South-North accords worked out in the past. We are ready to substantially implement all the accords by activating all those South-North joint organisations already established or to be established by agreement.
