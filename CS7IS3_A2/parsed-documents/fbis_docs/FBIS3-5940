Recalling that at a time when the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is due on March 21, some seditious forces of the United States, Japan and South Korea are trying to obstruct the implementation of the agreed conclusions, insisting on preconditions and hard lines against the DPRK, the news analyst says: This is an anti-dialogue move of those who hate a negotiated solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. By calling for preconditions, those seditious forces seek to hinder the implementation of the agreed conclusions reached at the New York DPRK-U.S. contact and lower the checkbar on the way of the solution of the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiation which has been paved with much difficulty. Things, however, will not go as they wish. The point is how the DPRK and the U.S. promote the process of the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula which has been put on the right track, with a sound thinking faculty, not caring a bit about the moves of any seditious force. The situation may develop to a grave phase, if any side delay or foil the implementation of the agreed conclusions, seeking its selfish purpose or lending an ear to the seditious voices. The seditious forces must renounce the reckless attempts to block the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. What is needed at the present moment with the third-round DPRK- U.S. talks ahead is to do act in favor of the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. If a dialogue partner set unreasonable preconditions and, furthermore, take up the refrain of the call of the seditious forces for tough measures, that will result in spoiling the atmosphere of dialogue and negotiation.
