At first they used their local agents to disturb the peace and tranquility in every corner of this country from Kordestan to Gorgan and Khuzestan. Unable to use ethnic differences to have them fight against one another because of their Islamic sense of brotherhood and equality principle, in which all Muslim Iranians believe regardless of their ethnic backgrounds, the arrogant powers decided to arm to the teeth the Iraqi army for their malicious purposes. Despite the support provided by the West and the former East as well as all the rich Arab shaykhdoms of the Persian Gulf, the Iraqi regime failed to accomplish its mission. Eight years of sacred defense and self-sacrifice by the Iranian combatants, foiled the efforts of superpowers to overthrow the Islamic regime. Although their plots have been futile so far, however, the arrogant powers' conspiracies have not ended and it does not seem they will give up any time soon. Indeed, as the leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Khamene'i, said in his Wednesday meeting with the commanders of the Army, Navy and the Air Force, the Iranian armed forces should be alert and vigilant, because the enemy is "wounded and dangerous". If in 1980 Iraq's excuse for imposing war on Iran was its sovereignty claim over Arvand River, who knows, may be one day the arrogant powers decide to use the issue of the three Persian Gulf islands as an excuse to meddle in the internal affairs of the region's countries. The Iraqi-imposed war taught us a lesson to remember. We must break the chains of dependency on all fields, in particular, in as far as the military technology and training are concerned. While the former regime's armed forces heavily depended on American and British military advisers and hardware, the Islamic Republic Armed Forces are working to become self-sufficient in all terms possible. The Iranian news agency IRNA reported Friday that an Iranian manufactured tank named Iran Leopard was combat-tested by the Self-Sufficiency Jehad Department of the armed forces. The tank has been designed in such a way so as to have more maneuvering power than those employed by other countries' and costs one third its foreign-made counterpart. The good news came at the time that the Iranian armed forces are preparing to celebrate the Army Day (Monday April 18.) While other countries of the Middle East depend on foreign military technology, Iranian armed forces, are doing their best to design and manufacture a tank suitable for the country's terrain and weather conditions. This is not only a big achievement but also a major step forward toward improving Iran's defense capabilities.
