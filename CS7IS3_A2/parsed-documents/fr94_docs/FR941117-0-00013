FR941117-0-00013 FR941117-0-00003 Therefore, we are responding to this comment by revising ยง416.1123(e)(2) to provide that the dependent's portion will be counted as the dependent's unearned cash income if the dependent resides with the veteran or the veteran's surviving spouse, or if the dependent receives his or her own portion in a separate payment from the VA. The United States Courts of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have held that it is reasonable to count the augmented portion of VA benefits as unearned income of the dependent on whose behalf it is paid, in White v. Shalala, 7 F.3d 296 (2nd Cir. 1993), Kennedy v. Shalala, 995 F.2d 28 (4th Cir. 1993), Inman v. Shalala, Nos. 93&hyph;2305 and 93&hyph;2941 (7th Cir., July 19, 1994), and Ryder v. Shalala, 25 F.3d 944 (10th Cir. 1994). We are aware that the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida has rejected this reasoning in Fair v. Shalala, No. 90&hyph;1263&hyph;CIV&hyph;T&hyph;22A (M.D. Fla., Aug. 2, 1993). We have sought appellate review in this case, but will apply the operative court order pending the resolution of the appeal. Except for the changes noted above and several nonsubstantive technical revisions, we are adopting the rules as proposed on May 18, 1990, at 55 FR 20612 and are restating the interim final rule published on that same date at 55 FR 20598. Regulatory Procedures Executive Order 12866 We have consulted with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and determined that these rules do not meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. Thus, they were not subject to OMB review. Paperwork Reduction Act These final regulations impose no reporting/recordkeeping requirements requiring OMB clearance. Regulatory Flexibility Act We certify that these final regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because these regulations will affect only individuals. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, is not required.
