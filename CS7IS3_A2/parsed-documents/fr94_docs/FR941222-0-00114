FR941222-0-00114 FR941222-0-00017 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 216 [Docket No. 941133&hyph;4333; I.D. 111494B] Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of embargoes. SUMMARY: NMFS announces that, in adherence to regulations and court orders, yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) by purse seine vessels of Colombia or the Republic of Vanuatu are prohibited from entry into the United States. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90731. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LT Dana Wilkes, 310&hyph;980&hyph;4000; Fax 310&hyph;980&hyph;4018. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) (16 U.S.C. 1361 et seq .) requires a ban on the importation of commercial fish or products from fish that have been caught with commercial fishing technology which results in the incidental kill or serious injury of marine mammals in excess of U.S. standards. In the case of yellowfin tuna harvested by purse seine in the ETP, the MMPA requires a ban unless the harvesting nation has a program and performance that is comparable in its level of marine mammal protection to that of the United States. The regulatory program of the harvesting nation must include, among other things, such prohibitions against encircling certain schools of dolphin, conducting sundown sets, and other activities as are applicable to U.S. vessels under the marine mammal program of the United States (16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(2)(B)(I)). MMPA regulations require that harvesting nations implement marine mammal protection requirements within 180 days of the date that such requirements are placed on U.S. vessels (50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(v)(B)). On November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58285), NMFS published a final rule declaring the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin ( Stenella attenuata ) to be depleted under section 3(1) of the MMPA (16 U.S.C. 1362(1)). On January 27, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in the case of Earth Island Institute v. Brown , No. C 88&hyph;1380 TEH, enjoined NMFS, effective immediately, from permitting any incidental taking of any northeastern offshore spotted dolphin in the ETP, and required that NMFS include this prohibition in the comparability requirements for foreign nations. On February 1, 1994, NMFS notified U.S. vessels fishing under the general permit issued to the American Tunaboat Association (ATA general permit) that all sets on the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin were prohibited due to the stock's recently determined status as depleted under the MMPA. On February 4, 1994, NMFS further advised those vessels that the take of all offshore spotted dolphin was prohibited immediately under the provisions of the January 27, 1994, order requiring NMFS to minimize the take of northeastern offshore spotted dolphin. On February 8, NMFS, in order to ensure that the aggregate dolphin mortality quota mandated by the International Dolphin Conservation Act was not exceeded, prohibited the taking of any additional dolphin, regardless of species or stock, under the ATA general permit, thus closing the fishery. On February 22, 1994, NMFS published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8417) of the January 27, 1994, court order, and of the February 1, 4, and 8, 1994, NMFS actions discussed above. The prohibition on the take of any of the northeastern stock of offshore spotted dolphin has been incorporated as a new element in the marine mammal program of the United States. On August 24, 1994, with a subsequent technical correction on September 19, 1994, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California amended its order of January 27, 1994, and specified that its prohibition applied only in the area from 40 N. lat. to 5 N. lat., and from 120 W. long. to the coastline of Central and South America. As of September 28, 1994, NMFS had not received documentary evidence from Colombia or from the Republic of Vanuatu that either nation has incorporated into its marine mammal protection program a prohibition on encircling with a purse seine net any school in which a northeastern offshore spotted dolphin is observed. Therefore, because the 180-day period allowed for a foreign nation to adopt a comparable prohibition expired on July 26, 1994, in adherence to the regulations and court orders cited above, NMFS on September 28, 1994, notified the U.S. Customs Service, and here announces, an immediate ban on imports of yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels of Columbia and the Republic of Vanuatu. Dated: December 13, 1994. Samuel W. McKeen, Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service.
