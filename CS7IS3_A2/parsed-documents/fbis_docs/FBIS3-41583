The environment ministry's scheme for ecological policy is a good one, Klaus stresses in the letter, in which he responds to a letter sent to him recently by the above mentioned figures. The government's ecological policy is not torn out of the context of social transformation, is not implanted in some conceptions of `sustainable development', which are far from the reality, but it focuses on the protection and improvement of the environment to the extent allowed by our means, the letter says. Ecological policy of a country depends on the country's possibilities and it is limited by its economy, Klaus insists in the letter. Therefore he finds it senseless and misleading to compare the Czech Republic's spending on the environment with those in the advanced countries. These countries have the smallest problems with the environment, as their economies provide them with funds to protect it. Inappropriately high demands regarding the funding environmental protection could stifle the Czech economy as early as the very beginning of its transformation, Klaus stresses.
