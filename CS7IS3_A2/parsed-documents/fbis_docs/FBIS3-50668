In a news conference, Cristiani declared: "I am convinced that nobody in his right mind could guarantee that the FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) has destroyed all of its weapons, because we all know this is not true." Additionally, Cristiani revealed that the government has thousands of documents linking the FMLN to the assassination of rightist leaders and ideologists during the past decade, the responsibility of which was later denied by the former guerrillas. According to Cristiani, Presidency Minister Antonio Rodriguez Porth appeared to be one of those victims. He was killed nine days after the current government took office in June of 1989. The Salvadoran president also stated that the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal) were kept informed of the existence of weapons and groups of former guerrillas who are still armed. "They have had weapons in Nicaragua, and they have weapons in our country," insisted Cristiani, who did not give details on the alleged weapons still in the hands of former rebels. In August of 1993, Onusal issued a communique proclaiming the total destruction of the FMLN arsenals, although it warned that there was a very good chance that weapons could turn up in the future in isolated cases.
