FR940620-0-00149 FR940620-0-00029 14.2.4(4)␣Landings Paragraph (4) requires a 48 inch deep landing at the top of, and equal to the width of, a perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp. A similar landing, 60 inches in length, is required at the bottom of a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp. Cross slope and surface criteria are also specified. An appendix note clarifies the use of level landings. Comment. Comments from persons with disabilities supported the requirement for a 48 inch landing at the top of public sidewalk curb ramps. Many objected to perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps that do not have landings and which require pedestrians to negotiate across a complex cross slope. Commenters cited three major concerns regarding the lack of a level landing at the top of a public sidewalk curb ramp: (1) lack of a space to turn when approaching a public sidewalk curb ramp; (2) lack of a space to bypass the public sidewalk curb ramp, and (3) lack of a level area to rest and turn after ascending the public sidewalk curb ramp. The NPRM provided an exception that would permit a 36 inch deep landing under conditions of site infeasibility. Comments from persons with disabilities did not support the exception, noting that a 36 inch landing was too narrow to be useful. Response. This provision is consistent with ADAAG 4.2.1 (Size and Approach) specifications for clear floor or ground space for wheelchairs, which requires a 30 inch wide by 48 inch long area for a single wheelchair. Unlike ADAAG 4.8.4 (Ramps), which requires a landing 60 inches in length where ramps change direction, additional space available on and adjacent to a public sidewalk will provide adequate clearance for footrests and longer motorized wheelchairs. While a 36 inch landing would provide an adequate passage for a person using a wheelchair bypassing a public sidewalk curb ramp, it will not accommodate a 90 degree turn with all wheels on level ground. Consistent with comments discussed at 14.2 (New Construction: Minimum Requirements), the exception proposed in the NPRM to allow a 36 inch wide landing in cases of site infeasibility has been limited to alterations. 14.2.4(5)␣Slope Paragraph (5) requires that the minimum feasible running slope be used for a public sidewalk curb ramp and establishes a 1:12 maximum slope when measured from a level plane. An exception permits parallel public sidewalk curb ramps constructed along sloping public sidewalks to be steeper than a slope of 1:12 if a ramp at 1:12 would extend more than 96 inches in length. To simplify field application, the exception proposed in the NPRM to permit an alternative method of measuring public sidewalk curb ramp slope has been replaced by a limitation on the length that might result from strict application of the maximum slope requirement for parallel public sidewalk curb ramps only. Where a running slope of 1:12 would result in a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp more than 96 inches long when measured from a level plane, the public sidewalk curb ramp need not exceed 96 inches in length. Where public sidewalks intersect, as at corners where public sidewalk curb ramps are necessary to serve street crossings, the cross slope limitation will apply in both directions, thus providing a level landing from which to measure curb ramp slope. Perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp slope and the slope of the parallel public sidewalk curb ramp segment adjacent to the corner can therefore be measured from a level plane. Thus, where parallel public sidewalk curb ramps are located at public sidewalk intersections, the ramp up or down to the landing from the intersection will be no steeper than 1:12. On the other side of the landing, the slope may be that of the public sidewalk itself, unconstrained along sloping rights-of-way. Where a parallel public sidewalk curb ramp is constructed at a midblock crossing along a sloping public sidewalk, the parallel public sidewalk curb ramp may be the sloping public sidewalk itself connecting on either side to the landing. 14.2.4(6)␣Edges Paragraph (6) requires side flares of perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramps to have a maximum slope of 1:10 if adjacent to a public sidewalk. Comment. The NPRM limited side flares to a maximum slope of 1:12 where the landing at the top of the perpendicular public sidewalk curb ramp was less than 48 inches in length. Several commenters noted that the 1:12 limitation on side flare slope was unnecessary in new construction since a minimum 48 inch level landing is required at the top of a curb ramp. Two commenters recommended steeper side flares as being more distinguishable by persons with vision impairments and suggested a 1:8 maximum. Others supporting a steeper slope for side flares noted that this would make additional public sidewalk area available for signals, utilities, and street furnishings. Response. This section of the interim final rule applies only to new construction, where public sidewalk curb ramps must have a minimum 48 inch long landing. Side flares may therefore have a maximum slope of 1:10. This will make curb ramps more distinguishable. In alterations, where a 36 inch long landing is permitted, side flares must have a maximum slope of 1:12. 14.2.4(7)␣Surfaces Paragraph (7) requires that the surfaces of public sidewalk curb ramps be stable, firm and slip-resistant and provide a visual contrast to surrounding public sidewalk areas. Each public sidewalk curb ramp and landing surface shall lie generally in a continuous plane. Gratings are prohibited on public sidewalk curb ramps. Detectable warnings provisions have been reserved. Consistent with comments discussed at ADAAG 14.2.1(3) (Public Sidewalks: Surfaces), provisions have been added to this section requiring that surfaces of public sidewalk curb ramps lie generally in a single plane and prohibiting gratings in public sidewalk curb ramps. An appendix note at A14.1.2(3) clarifies this requirement. Comment. Several commenters noted that reserving detectable warnings provisions in the NPRM eliminated a requirement for visual contrast on public sidewalk curb ramps. These commenters noted that a visual contrast was helpful to pedestrians, particularly at night. Response. A provision has been added requiring that the surface of the public sidewalk curb ramp shall contrast visually with adjoining public sidewalk surfaces, either light-on-dark or dark-on-light. An appendix note at ADAAG A4.29.2 (Detectable Warnings on Walking Surfaces) contains recommended contrast values.
