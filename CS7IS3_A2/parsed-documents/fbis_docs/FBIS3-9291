High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), carrying 112 tonnes of flour, on Monday unhindered and safely crossed Bosnian Serb territory on its way for Moslem-held Tuzla, eastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, TANJUG learned from Bosnian Serb military sources. Owing to the efforts of the Bosnian Serbs, the relief aid ground routes towards Tuzla and other Moslem-, i.e. Croat-held towns in Bosnia, have so far remained safe and open. Bosnian Serb military sources once again rejected claims by the international community that the opening of the Tuzla airport is "necessary" out of humanitarian reasons, and expressed doubt that other reasons and intentions lie behind the action. The Bosnian Serbs, fearing that the Moslems could use the airport to illegally acquire arms under the guise of humanitarian aid, have made its opening conditional that the airport is monitored by Russian peacekeepers and that Serb observers control the cargo checks.
