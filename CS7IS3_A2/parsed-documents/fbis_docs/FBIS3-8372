The R.S.K. is now one of the U.N. Protected Areas (UNPA) in Croatia. Croatia will focus its activities on negotiations with the R.S.K. local and military authorities about the return of Croats who have fled these lands. The negotiations will be brokered by the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The same sources maintain that Serb representatives will be offered a possibility of re-integrating the R.S.K. territories into Croatian districts, as well as cultural and administrative autonomy in the lands where they constituted a majority population according to the 1991 census, and the right to take part in district assemblies. The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly Serb-populated parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia in response to Croatia's forcible secession from former Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the Serbs' status as a constituent nation to that of a national minority. The R.S.K. has been the UNPA since 1992, but Croatia has launched three large offensives against Krajina's territories since then, while uninterrupted Croatian Army attacks on Serb positions along the demarcation lines ceased after a ceasefire had been signed last December. However, all efforts to reach a lasting agreement on a cessation of hostilities have been unsuccessful so far. The sources estimate that the main purpose of Monday's visit of Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic to the Senj-Lika District, bordering on the R.S.K. in western Croatia, was a preparation of a new "diplomatic offensive" against the R.S.K. Jure Radic, head of the presidential office and secretary-general of Croatia's ruling party the Croatian Democratic Union, confirmed on Saturday in Osijek that Croatia intended to initiate "a diplomatic offensive" backed by "a variety of political skills." The Osijek District borders on the R.S.K in eastern Croatia. The sources estimate that Croatia's officials will primarily undertake these activities to "collect evidence" that it is necessary for the United Nations to prolong its mandate in the R.S.K., i.e. to convince the international community that the re-integration of the R.S.K. into Croatia is impossible unless pressure is put on Krajina. The current UNPROFOR mandate in the R.S.K. is due to expire on March 31, and it is to be renewed by the U.N. Security Council if approved by the countries that signed the Cyrus Vance plan on the introduction of U.N. Protected Areas to Krajina. At the same time, the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry said it had rejected the proposal by UNPROFOR Commander in the UNPA "South" Sector, George Oehring, to negotiate with representatives of the Serb National Party whose leader is Milan Djukic. The Serb National Party is one of the opposition parties in Croatia which has been instructed by the Croatian regime to gather all Serbs who have chosen to remain in Croatia. The party has proclaimed itself to be a protector of their minority rights. A statement released by the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry says the R.S.K. considered this proposal by the Serb National Party as "one which lacks seriousness," while the document "peace with no alternatives" by this party, proposed late last year as a negotiating basis, was described as "a set of forgeries." According to the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry, the document "contains untenable information that, instead of 400,000 Serbs, only 180,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia, and that, instead of 500,000 Serbs, only 180,000 are living there at this time." The document advocates a kind of "confederal" autonomy of the R.S.K., but it does not envisage for Krajina to have the right to secede from Croatia. The R.S.K. authorities underscore that Serbs, who are entitled to self-determination like any other former Yugoslavia's nation, have voted in a referendum to live in an independent state, and therefore any further negotiations on the issue are totally out of the question.
