For its first convening, the Chamber of Deputies could not reach the necessary quorum for the debates planned yesterday. Frantz Robert Monde, the new president of the Chamber of Deputies, warned he would take sanctions against the absentees or those who believe in an empty seat. Edner Jean files a report: [Begin recording] [Jean] Several reasons can explain the failure of this first session of the Chamber of Deputies under the aegis of President Monde. First of all, the absence of several legislators, most particularly those of the BP-FNCD [Parliamentary Bloc for the National Front for Change and Democracy] who stayed in the United States after the international conference. The difficulties in obtaining fuel allegedly also forced some deputies to stay home. However, beyond those considerations, the postponement of this session is mostly interpreted as a response from a group of deputies to the election of Frantz Robert Monde. The new president of the Chamber spoke about the boycott and is considering taking severe measures against the absent deputies. Thus, Monde is giving his first warning to the absent deputies: [Monde] Obviously some sectors wish to boycott the work of the Chamber. You can be sure that we are going to consider immediate measures to stave off their efforts. However, it is sad to note that some legislators, paid to attend debates, do not have the courage to do so and prefer, for a question of bureau, not present themselves at the Chamber. It is a shame for those that they represent. [Jean] What kind of solutions are you considering, President? Some deputies suggested seizing the checks of the absent deputies. [Monde] All the measures being considered will be taken with the majority. [end recording] [Jean] The former president of the Chamber considers that it is too early to speak of a boycott. Antoine Joseph, who is back to his status of a simple deputy, thinks that it falls upon the new leader to search for the causes which provoked the absence of the deputies in order to find a solution as soon as possible. This is necessary because a session full of issues is awaiting the deputies, he explains. [Begin Joseph recording in Creole] It is too early to speak of a boycott. Perhaps there are many problems. Maybe there is a lack of contact with the presidents of the groups. The mobilization is not going very well. There is also a problem of gasoline. I think that the parliamentary bureau should take things in hand and search for the causes with the deputies and then take measures which would allow holding the session. We are at a difficult juncture which should prompt us to hold sessions to decide the important issues. There are economic problems; there is the possibility of a new increase in the monetary ceiling;, there is also the national conference; there is the resignation of the Malval government. We have as many important issues which the Parliament must make decisions on. Personally, I think that the holding of sessions during these times is urgent and necessary. Thus, the parliamentary bureau must take measures in order to hold sessions.[end recording] [Jean] Antoine Joseph, who just lost his post of president to the profit of Frantz Robert Monde, does not get discouraged. He is about to constitute a new bloc in the lower chamber, a bloc which should offset the powers of the Alliance in face of the FNCD. [passage omitted] The socialists who have a representative within the new parliamentary bureau, Mac-Ferl Morquette, the vice president, did not give all that they could to obtain a quorum. The socialists prefer to wait and hope, a wait and see attitude.
