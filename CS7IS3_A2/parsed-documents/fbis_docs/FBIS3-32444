"Do not abandon us, do not let us die alone, do not let our struggle end in a vacuum," the EZLN said in a message released today, Saturday, and sent to the executive coordinating commission of the Guerrero State Council of Indian and Peasants Organization. The communique came in reply to a letter by Guerrero Indian organizations, which includes representatives from the Amusgo, Mixtecos, Nahuatls, and Tlapenecos ethnic groups, and was delivered to the EZLN by its intermediary [Monsignor] Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas. The EZLN called on the Guerrero Indian organizations to "take our blood as nourishment, fill your hearts and the hearts of all good men of this Indian and non-Indian land," but does not specify the type of support they request. "Brothers, let our path be the same for all: liberty, democracy, justice," the Zapatistas added. Guerrero, located approximately 300 km south of Mexico City, is one of the states most analysts believe will show evidence of the EZLN movement. Recently, local police initiated an operation to search for guerrilla hideouts in this state's mountainous region. The last Mexican guerrilla rebellion occurred in Guerrero in 1970 with the Party of the Poor, founded by Lucio Cabanas, a rebellion subsequently controlled by the Armed Forces.
