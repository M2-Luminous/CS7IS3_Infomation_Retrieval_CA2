Take notice that on April 1, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) pursuant to Section 7 of Article III of the General Terms and Conditions of Fourth Revised Volume No. 1 of FERC Gas Tariff, and in conjunction with the reconciliation of Tennessee's Transition Gas Inventory Charge under Article XXXII of the General Terms and Conditions, tendered for filing a report of the costs and revenues experienced under its cashout mechanism for resolving monthly imbalances during the period July 1992 through August 1993. Tennessee states that because its cashout costs exceeded its revenues during the applicable period, it owes no refunds of the penalty revenues collected.

All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding.
