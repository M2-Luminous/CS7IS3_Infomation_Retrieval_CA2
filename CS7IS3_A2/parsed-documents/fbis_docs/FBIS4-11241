Roosen will exercise the office simultaneously with his current position as chairman of the Board of Trustees of Banco Latino. In a lengthy news conference held after being sworn in, Roosen presented his six-point plan to rescue the national banking system: reaching a solidarity accord with private banks, strengthening the Superintendency of Banks, reorganizing Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund], reducing nominal interest rates and the differential between nominal and real interest rates, defining new financial instruments to replace the zero-coupon bonds, and establishing a plan of rehabilitation or major surgery for banks assisted by Fogade. [Begin Roosen recording] If we are able to strike a pact of solidarity regarding what I mentioned in my initial explanation, the country will see a change and will see a restoration in confidence, which was key in the case of Banco Latino. I am convinced by the conversations I held yesterday morning and last night, which prompted me to accept this difficult task, that the government is ready, the Central Bank is ready, and, as a result of my contacts with fellow bankers as chairman of the Board of Trustees, I am convinced the banks are also ready for this solidarity pact. This is key to eliminating the uncertainty that affects the financial system at this time. [end recording] Dr. Gustavo Roosen said that meetings with the private banks will begin this weekend in an attempt to sign the solidarity accord. A 72-hour deadline was set for its signing.
