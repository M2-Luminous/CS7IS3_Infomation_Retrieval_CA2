FR940902-2-00129 FR940902-2-00053 21. Reports indicating the amount of payments of principal and interest are provided to certificateholders at least as frequently as distributions are made to certificateholders. Certificateholders will also be provided with periodic information statements setting forth material information concerning the underlying assets, including, where applicable, information as to the amount and number of delinquent and defaulted loans or receivables. 22. In the case of a trust that offers and sells certificates in a registered public offering, the trustee, the servicer or the sponsor will file such periodic reports as may be required to be filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although some trusts that offer certificates in a public offering will file quarterly reports on Form 10&hyph;Q and Annual Reports on Form 10&hyph;K, many trusts obtain, by application to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a complete exemption from the requirement to file quarterly reports on Form 10&hyph;Q and a modification of the disclosure requirements for annual reports on Form 10&hyph;K. If such an exemption is obtained, these trusts normally would continue to have the obligation to file current reports on Form 8&hyph;K to report material developments concerning the trust and the certificates. While the Securities and Exchange Commission's interpretation of the periodic reporting requirements is subject to change, periodic reports concerning a trust will be filed to the extent required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 23. At or about the time distributions are made to certificateholders, a report will be delivered to the trustee as to the status of the trust and its assets, including underlying obligations. Such report will typically contain information regarding the trust's assets, payments received or collected by the servicer, the amount of prepayments, delinquencies, servicer advances, defaults and foreclosures, the amount of any payments made pursuant to any credit support, and the amount of compensation payable to the servicer. Such report also will be delivered to or made available to the rating agency or agencies that have rated the trust's certificates. In addition, promptly after each distribution date, certificateholders will receive a statement prepared by the trustee summarizing information regarding the trust and its assets. Such statement will include information regarding the trust and its assets, including underlying receivables. Such statement will typically contain information regarding payments and prepayments, delinquencies, the remaining amount of the guaranty or other credit support and a breakdown of payments between principal and interest. Secondary Market Transactions 24. It is the policy of many underwriters to attempt to make a market for securities for which it is lead or co-managing underwriter. It is also the policy of many placement agents to facilitate sales by investors who purchase certificates if such entity has acted as agent or principal in the original private placement of the certificates and if such investors request such entity's assistance.
