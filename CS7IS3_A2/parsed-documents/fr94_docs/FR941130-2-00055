FR941130-2-00055 FR941130-2-00033 [Docket No. 94&hyph;28] Vessel Sharing Agreements; Order to Show Cause Section 5(a) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (``1984 Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(a), requires the filing at the Federal Maritime Commission (``Commission'') of agreements among ocean common carriers regarding vessel space/slot charters, sailing arrangements and vessel deployment (collectively referred to herein as ``vessel sharing agreements'') for the common carriage of goods by water in the foreign commerce of the United States. 1 In recent years, three vessel sharing agreements involving the trans-Atlantic trade (``Trade'') have been filed which require membership in a separate conference agreement. These agreements are Agreement No. 203&hyph;011394 (``OOCL Agreement''), 2 Agreement No. 203&hyph;011395 (``Maersk Agreement'') 3 and Agreement No. 203&hyph;011396 (``Cooperative Agreement). 4 They require the participants, Sea-Land Service, Inc. (``Sea-Land''), P & O Containers Ltd. (``P & O''), Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. (``Nedlloyd''), Orient Overseas Container Line Ltd. (``OOCL'') and A.P. Moller-Maersk Line (``Maersk''), to be members of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement (``TAA''), now known as the Trans-Atlantic Conference Agreement (``TACA''), (Agreement No. 202&hyph;011375). 5 1 An agreement is defined in section 3(1) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(1), as ``an understanding, arrangement, or association'' and may include conference and non-conference agreements. 2 The agreement allows Orient Overseas Container Line to charter vessel space from Sea-Land Service, Inc., P&O Containers Ltd. and Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. 3 The agreement allows Sea-Land Service, Inc., P&O Containers Ltd. and Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V. to charter vessel space from A.P. Moller-Maersk Line. 4 This is a discussion among Sea-Land Service, Inc., P&O Containers Ltd., Nedlloyd Lijnen B.V., OOCL and Maersk regarding the deployment and redeployment of OOCL vessels in the trans-Atlantic trade. 5 TACA is the recent modification of the Trans-Atlantic Agreement. TACA became effective on October 24, 1994. A conference is defined by the 1984 Act as an ``association of ocean common carriers permitted, pursuant to an approved or effective agreement, to engage in concerted activity and to utilize a common tariff,'' 46 U.S.C. app. 1702(7). Like vessel sharing agreements, conference agreements must be filed at the Commission. However, to ensure that a conference or its members cannot restrict or otherwise control conference membership, section 5(b)(3) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(3), requires that a conference agreement must permit any member to withdraw from conference membership upon reasonable notice without penalty. In addition, section 5(b)(2), 46 U.S.C. app. 1704(b)(2), states that each conference agreement must provide reasonable and equal terms and conditions for admission and readmission to conference membership. Any conference agreement that imposes withdrawal penalties or unreasonable terms and conditions for readmission to a conference violates the 1984 Act and may be canceled or modified by the Commission under section 11(c) of the 1984 Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1710(c). As noted above, the OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement require Sea-Land, Nedlloyd, P & O, OOCL and Maersk to be members of TACA. If one of these carriers withdraws from TACA, it is compelled to withdraw from these vessel sharing agreements. 6 The OOCL Agreement, the Maersk Agreement and Agreement No. 202&hyph;011171, another vessel sharing agreement, involving Sea-Land, P & O and Nedlloyd, 7 impose penalties on the carrier that withdraws from the vessel sharing agreements, i.e., 6 The Maersk Agreement gives Maersk, Sea-Land, Nedlloyd and P & O the option of terminating or withdrawing from the agreement, if one of them withdraws from TACA. 7 This agreement involves chartering of Sea-Land vessels in the trans-Atlantic trade. (1) The withdrawing party must give six months irrevocable notice to the other parties. (2) The withdrawing party shall cease operation as a common carrier in the Trade. (3) The withdrawing party shall not re-enter the Trade as a common carrier for a period of five (5) years. (4) The withdrawing party shall, during the six month notice period, make all reasonable efforts to assist the other parties in succeeding to the business of the withdrawing party including, but not limited to, providing customer lists, and affirmatively recommending the other parties to the withdrawing parties customers.
