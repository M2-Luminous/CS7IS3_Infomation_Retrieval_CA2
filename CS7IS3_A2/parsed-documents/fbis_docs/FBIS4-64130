Now They Are Only Left To Decide on How To Position Them"] [Text] On Wednesday Boris Oleynik, chief of the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation at the negotiations with the Crimean Supreme Council delegation, at a news conference voiced his satisfaction with the results of the meeting with delegates from the peninsula. As is known, a decision was made to recommend to the Ukrainian and Crimean Supreme Councils that they set up a joint working group. The Ukrainian delegation asked the Crimean Supreme Council within three days to consider the question of suspending the legislative acts adopted on 20 May for the entire period that the joint working group will be in session. Sergey Tsekov, chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council, stated that Crimea has no intention of seceding from Ukraine: "This can be suggested only by those who are not familiar with the content of Crimean laws." True, he failed to respond to the question about how his words correlate with the program provision of the Crimean Republican Party, of which he is a member, about the peninsula's joining Russia.
