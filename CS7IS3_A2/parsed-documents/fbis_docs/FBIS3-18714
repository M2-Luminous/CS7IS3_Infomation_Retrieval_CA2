Abandoning a certain routine and a past that has become too easy usually involves a great deal of pain. Ironically enough, so far no one has suffered more from Bill Clinton's changes than the president himself and some of his closest aides. The most noticeable change at the White House is a strong touch of provincialism. The guard of advisers that he brought from Arkansas threatens to fail because of the tough climate in Washington. There has already been one suicide. The provincial troop has plunged Clinton into his deepest crisis to date. In fact, the Whitewater affair that stems from his office as governor in Arkansas cannot be compared with the scandals that became a legend, including Watergate and the Iran-Contra affair. However, it is more than a harmless episode, as Clinton is trying to pretend. His protests of innocence are no longer effective because he himself is to blame for the current crisis. Intensive efforts were made to influence a legal process. Clinton's credibility has suffered in this respect. If he really is innocent, then there is no need for intensive manipulations by his advisers aimed at influencing legal investigations. With great certainty, we do not know yet the whole truth in this affair, which is not only embarrassing for the president himself but also for First Lady Hillary, who is apparently more deeply involved in the affair than has been known so far. Her contacts with legal adviser Nussbaum, who has now been dismissed, date back to the Watergate days. In any event, the nation is viewing this affair with increasing confusion and concern. It senses for the first time the price for the most evident change that has taken place after the Clintons entered the White House: It is having two presidents at the same time.
