FBIS3-32338 "drlat025_c_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 MEXICO EZLN Asks Nongovernment Organizations For `Peace Cordon' PA0602154594 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0618 GMT 6 Feb 94 PA0602154594 Mexico City NOTIMEX Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] San Cristobal de Las Casas, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- The Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has asked Mexican nongovernmental organizations to create a "peace cordon [cinturon de paz] to avoid pressure, intimidation, or even attacks" by the parties involved in conflict. In a communique dated 1 February and released in this southeastern Mexican city on Saturday [5 February], it was noted that the request was made in view of the imminent start of peace talks between Peace and Reconciliation Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis and the EZLN. The fact that the dialogue could be held within a conflict zone would entail risks of provocation that could obstruct or bog down the dialogue. "With the goal of reducing undesirable tensions to a minimum between the parties involved, a security or peace cordon should be formed around the dialogue site to avoid pressure, intimidation, or even attacks by one of the parties involved in the conflict against the other." Meanwhile, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis said here today that the direct talks with the EZLN "will be held very soon," and he added that "everything is set and there are no problems in holding the meeting." After meeting with Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de Las Casas -- the link between the armed group and the commissioner -- Camacho said "we will come out ahead" in efforts to find a peaceful solution in Chiapas. Buffer zones were created to hold the meetings in the area of Los Altos de Chiapas at the request of Camacho Solis. This request was accepted by the armed group on Thursday. The towns of San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac, in north central and southeastern Chiapas, respectively, were proposed as the two areas that will remain free of any armed presence and where the International Red Cross would provide assistance to the civilian population. Camacho Solis explained this idea is intended "to create areas of detente" to support the population that has been adversely affected by the conflict. The armed group added that it would withdraw its men from San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac when the International Red Cross installs its camps to provide the humanitarian aid. On Saturday, the International Red Cross Committee announced it would restore medical services in certain areas of Chiapas and would organize a program to supervise the health centers run by Mexican personnel. According to the plan, the International Red Cross will only provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population and medical treatment to all, including the transportation of patients to hospitals in Chiapas or anywhere else in the country as required. Another action that contributed to the progress of the peace process was the EZLN's sending of a communique to Bishop Ruiz. In the communique, the rebels announced they would "shortly" release former Chiapas State Governor Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, who was kidnapped on 2 January. In another communique addressed to the Executive Coordinating Commission of the State Council of Indian and Peasant Organizations, the EZLN said those Zapatists who "had verbally assaulted local residents who did not support our struggle have been reprimanded." This communique added: "Neither physical nor verbal threats to force anyone to join our struggle will be tolerated from our troops and supporters. Our war laws are very clear in this regard, and we have already taken action to correct the damage done and to prevent the problem from recurring."
