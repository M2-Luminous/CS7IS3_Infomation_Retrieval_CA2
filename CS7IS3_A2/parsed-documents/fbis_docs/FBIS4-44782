Meanwhile, the French government has set up a scientific group that will attempt to promote the development of biofuels along with the concerned ministries (Industry, Environment, Higher Education and Research, Agriculture and Fisheries), announced Agriculture Minister Jean Puech, as he inaugurated the Forum. The new group, "Agriculture for Chemistry and Energy" (Agrice), to be chaired by Philippe Mangin, brings together representatives of the National Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA), national agricultural trade unions and industry. Mr Puech added that "the industries concerned by the future of our agriculture, as well as potential customers for the technologies being explored also wish to take part. Two major French enterprises, Total and Rhone-Poulenc, are currently representing these interests." France has chosen "an intelligent alternative to traditional set-aside, namely, industrial set-aside," he added.
