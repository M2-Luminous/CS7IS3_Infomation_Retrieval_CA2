IEC chairman Judge Johann Kriegler has just announced that the computer system used to calculate the results has been tampered with. Anton Fisher is at IEC headquarters in Kruis Street. Anton, the story please: [Fisher] Jeremy, what happened was that there were noticeable inconsistencies between the tallies received from the counting stations and the number of votes being put out by the computer, so what happened was that, according to Judge Kriegler, it appears that the computer program used here by the IEC had been tampered with, to such an extent that certain parties were being consistently favored, were getting more votes all the time, and that is the gist of the kind of tampering that is now being discovered. [Dawes] Are they going to disclose, or has it been disclosed, how many votes have been affected? [Fisher] Well, Judge Kriegler was questioned on that and according to him it's quite an insignificant amount, but he did concede that it could amount to tens of thousands of votes in the 12 million that had been counted up to yesterday morning. [Dawes] They can't identify which particular areas are going to be affected? [Fisher] No, but it's on a party basis. Certain particular parties are being favored by this fault in the program which has been discovered, and he wouldn't name which parties either. [Dawes] So, what is Judge Kriegler going to do now to follow this up? [Fisher] Well, apparently the monitoring directorate of the IEC has started an investigation. What they have done also is called in the help of two outside computer experts, and they are now continuing the investigation and apparently the matter will be referred to the police. [Dawes] Have the party leaders been informed and are they going to react to the this? [Fisher] Apparently, there has been communication between the parties, you know, all parties at the party liaison committee.
