FR940304-0-00038 FR940304-0-00015 Response: The proposed rule and this final rule address the requirement for diagnostic coding of only physicians' bills. This new coding requirement does not apply to bills from laboratories (except for physician laboratory services_see ยง405.556). Comment: One commenter suggested that referring physicians provide a reason for the biopsy or referral. It requested that this practice be encouraged and emphasized through carrier communication with the physicians. Response: We have always encouraged that the referring physician communicate the reason for the referral or specimen so the proper medical interpretation is made or test is performed. We will continue to encourage carrier to convey this message to the physician community. Comment: Three commenters were concerned that providing for only four diagnostic codes on the form HCFA&hyph;1500 is insufficient in many cases to adequately describe a patient's condition. Response: Since the implementation of the diagnostic coding requirement, we have received few complaints concerning the form HCFA&hyph;1500. Thus, we believe that four diagnosis codes are sufficient in most instances. We note that this regulation is not intended to change the structure of the form HCFA&hyph;1500. Moreover, our contractors' claims processing systems, as currently constructed, would not be able to accommodate more than four diagnosis codes on a single claim. The use of codes instead of a narrative description should enhance the physician's ability to describe the patient's condition with greater precision. If there are cases where the use of four codes is not sufficient, we suspect that they would arise when more than one procedure has been performed (for example, psychological counseling provided to a trauma patient). In such cases, the physician could submit one claim for the procedure that relates to four or fewer diagnoses, and submit another claim for the other procedures with their attendant diagnoses. Comment: The American Ambulance Association requested that the final rule specify that the coding requirements do not apply to ambulance services. Response: This final rule provides only that each bill or request for payment for physician services must include diagnostic coding. These provisions do not apply to ambulance services. Comment: One commenter interpreted the proposed rule to imply that physicians must now submit claims for services that they would not have normally billed under the previous guidelines. The commenter requested that HCFA clarify this point in the final rule. Response: Although the ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM coding system permits classification of many services for which specific codes could be used, the mere presence of an ICD&hyph;9&hyph;CM code does not, of itself, mean that a bill or request for payment must include the code for that service. If a physician generally would not have submitted a bill or request for payment for a particular service prior to the physician diagnostic coding requirement, the physician may not be required to submit a bill for that service under the new rules. For instance, HCFA did not mean to imply, under an example in the guidelines published in the proposed rule (54 FR 30564), that a bill should be submitted for a service for X.3, attention to surgical dressings and sutures, if this service is included in the surgeon's global charge. However, if this service is performed by another physician, unrelated to the surgeon, it might be appropriate for the second surgeon to use this code to describe the reason for the encounter. Comment: One commenter suggested that HCFA clarify in the final rule whether the new regulations supersede or supplement individual carrier coding policies since there are conflicts between the new and old coding practices.
