FR940916-1-00072 FR940916-1-00016 Adequate deployment of mechanical employees will remain necessary for the foreseeable future, both to foster power brake safety and to ensure that other components of locomotives and cars are adequately inspected and maintained. Federal regulations should encourage this process through reasonably structured incentives while avoiding any attempt at micromanagement of business decisions. This notice embodies a strategy to achieve safety in the short term_train by train_while encouraging adequate deployment of mechanical personnel to provide the eyes, hands and minds necessary for effective maintenance of railroad rolling stock. General Revision of Standards for Freight and Passenger Service Commenters in this proceeding have noted, and FRA agrees, that the current regulations fail to adequately delineate between requirements for conventional freight braking systems and the more diverse systems for various categories of passenger service. FRA also agrees that the regulations should be updated to recognize contemporary electronic systems that are used to control elements of power brake systems. Finally, FRA has learned over years since passage of the Power or Train Brakes Safety Appliance Act of 1958, which required adoption of the Association of American Railroads' (AAR) recommended practices as regulatory text, that improvements in clarity are badly needed. Accordingly, FRA proposes a comprehensive revision of the regulations that preserves useful elements of the current system in the framework of an entirely new document. The resulting proposed changes balance the concerns of rail labor and management and would increase the effectiveness of the regulations. The NPRM includes significant incentives to the railroads to encourage the use of qualified mechanical forces to conduct train brake system tests at major terminals where long-haul trains originate. The NPRM also proposes requirements to check abuses in the single car test program. The overall regulatory proposal focuses on safety performance rather than micromanagement of the railroads. In developing this proposal FRA engaged in a systems approach to the power brake regulations. FRA considered all aspects of a railroad operation and the effects that the entire operation has on the train and locomotive power braking systems. Therefore, these proposed requirements not only address specific brake equipment and inspection requirements, but also attempt to encompass other aspects of a railroad's operation which directly affect the quality and performance of the braking system, such as: personnel qualifications; maintenance requirements; written procedures governing operation, maintenance, and inspection; record keeping requirements; and the development and integration of new technologies. Consequently, FRA views this proposal as an organic whole, with any one of its individual requirements being necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the others. As an additional aspect of this systems approach, FRA considered the role that shortline railroads have in today's freight industry. FRA believes that the current marketplace requires Class I railroads and shortline railroads to operate as an integrated system. Many of today's shortlines rely on Class I railroads for the training of their employees and the maintenance of their equipment. In addition, many shortline railroads and Class I railroads interchange and operate each others equipment. Therefore, except in limited circumstances, it is impossible, from a regulatory standpoint, to separate shortline railroads from Class I railroads. Therefore, in order to ensure the safety and quality of train and locomotive power braking systems throughout the entire freight industry, this proposal generally imposes a consistent set of requirements on shortline and Class I railroads as a group. Although FRA recognizes that many of the operational benefits created by this proposal are not available to most shortline operations, FRA feels that the integrated nature of the freight industry requires that universally consistent requirements be imposed on both shortline and Class I railroads. The proposed rule is justified on the basis of operating cost savings to the industry as a whole. Cost savings due to accident/incident prevention were quantified to some extent but were not included in the cost impact analysis. See 49 CFR ยง225.5. Although significant accident/incident reduction will occur due to the proposed rule, the benefits were not fully quantified because of the need to proceed with satisfaction of the statutory mandate, the already positive benefit to cost ratio, and the difficulty associated with quantifying the effectiveness of some of the proposals prior to further public comment. A detailed discussion regarding the quantifying of benefits derived from accident/incident reduction is provided in the Regulatory Impact section of the preamble and in the Appendix to the Regulatory Analysis. FRA recognizes that some of the provisions contained in this proposal may affect other FRA regulations currently in existence. For example, the provisions regarding Special Notices for Repair for freight cars and locomotives contained at Part 216 of this chapter do not address nonconformity with the requirements proposed in this part. Other FRA regulations that may be affected by these proposed requirements are the Freight Car Safety Standards, the signal inspection standards, and the Locomotive Engineer Qualification Standards contained at Parts 215, 236, and 240 of this chapter respectively. Consequently, after issuance of a final rule, FRA will make whatever conforming or clarifying changes to FRA's other regulations that are deemed necessary.
