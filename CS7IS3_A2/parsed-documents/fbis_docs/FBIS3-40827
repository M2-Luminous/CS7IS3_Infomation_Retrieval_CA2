It was contained in an extended written speech, interspersed with some verbal exchanges. Regardless of the fact that the bill is being submitted to the Parliament more than one and one-half months after the expiry of the legal limit and in view of the short time available to the Parliament to debate it, we hasten to say that the bill is characterized by its being essentially based on an old and antiquated concept. It provides no clear or harmonious answers to questions relating to the present reality, although it consists of some procedural matters. Reading the finance bill will, at the first instance, show that it stems from the desire to resolve its inherent contradiction with the reality and with its requirements, by absorbing this contradiction within its own form, structure, and procedures. What is actually needed is to ease the heavy tax burden on the economy, particularly income tax, and to realize some kind of tax compatibility that would generate competition in the economic field, particularly with the aim of redirecting private investment and creating conditions suitable for financing the economy and removing the obstacles that created bottlenecks in the past two years. The aim is also to find satisfactory solutions for the public debt arrears that accumulated during the past years, while maintaining social stability based on acceptable balances, and to fulfill promises that have repeatedly been made but never fulfilled. But the finance bill has done what can be described as short-circuiting all that in one way or another. It does so by adopting mathematical equations ranging between plus and minus so that the official rhetoric on the bill may be able to find something to say about and to justify things, without revealing the fact that the bill is essentially a choice of programs for the new government, which promised that the bill would be an embodiment of its programs, following a featureless statement. Evidently the bill wants first and foremost to reach a figure, which is 1.5 percent. The aim is to confine the treasury deficit within the constraints of this figure and to make it compatible with the GDP. Nobody objects to showing interest in the financial balances or minimizing their significance on both the domestic and foreign relations level. This is contrary to what the minister argued in vain. Focusing on a particular figure could be suitable for an academic hypothesis, but insisting on it as a precondition will not allow them to make a choice that is a compromise between the balances and realities, a choice which the various factions of the society are calling for and which acts as a sound arbiter among them. This is regardless of whether or not the figures relevant to it can be realized and the extent to which they will be adhered to. Perhaps it was setting this ceiling for the bill that gives it a particular mathematical character and takes away from it the qualities of a serious bill resulting from integrated economic and social policies with broad vistas. It is apparent from the various figures of the bill that it is a settlement between figures, balancing figures with one another on paper, and playing with figures within the constraints of a very low ceiling. Servicing the public debt is increasing, growing, and becoming heavy. It exposes the failure to solve the problem last year. In fact it has gotten worse 1983 and 1993. It has increased several fold since the beginning of the structural evaluation and the rescheduling of debts. The calculations first and foremost address servicing the foreign debt. The debt increased from 15.475280905 dirhams to 17.513564480 dirhams [as published] (that is about $1.86 billion). That is an increase of 13.17 percent. Keeping in mind that rescheduling private and public debt is no longer possible to do in the old-fashioned way. The Paris and London clubs have decided to end the debt rescheduling soap opera. Given the pressure of the 1.5 percent ceiling set for the total treasury deficit, the calculations based on servicing the debt leave no room for financial options that would help economic revival and the relaunching of the social policies after a long period of stagnation. The finance bill options in this case have been put between pincers' jaws, leaving no room for the balance sheet other than maintaining control, with the balance sheet itself becoming an option. The problem lies here. And because the World Bank has its directives, these have been endorsed by what seemed to be a parallel parliament that was recently convened in Casablanca. It was necessary for these directives to be integrated with the accounts, as has customarily been done since the eighties. And because these directives primarily revolve around the private sector, they have been partially absorbed in them, within the limits allowed between the pincers' jaws. Within this framework, the corporation tax has been reduced to 37 percent, although the World Bank recommends that it should not exceed 35 percent on average. This is followed by reducing the highest average of public tax on income to 47 percent, followed by reducing the value added tax levied on bank interest, by subjecting the government treasury bonds to a partial tax, and by reducing the import tax on building material 10 percent while raising it 15 percent with respect to most other imports. These tax measures constitute the proposed basic laws of the finance bill as a whole, while anything else remains marginal. If these measures are viewed in light of the aforementioned World Bank directives, coupled with the measures relevant to them, such as increasing the portion exempt from public tax from 15,000 dirhams to 18,000 dirhams. Here we immediately discover that these measures carry inherent contradictions, to which we referred at the beginning, as long as they constitute a partial step toward responding to the World Bank directives rather than fully responding to them. They partially respond to demands put forward by the private, sector but do not respond to them fully...et cetera [as published], because the pincers' jaws in question continue to exert pressure. There has been demand that steps should be taken to restore to the state its rational economic role on the ground that this is one of the basic and urgent conditions for reviving the economy after two years of general economic recession and reduced growth. Therefore, the government has increased the investment budget to 3.99 billion dirhams (the equivalent of $423.6 million) compared with 1993 (15.1 billion dirhams compared with approximately 19 billion dirhams) [as published]. This is to show that there is an increase. Regardless of how closely the investment budgets are adhered to and how they are disposed of, that increase remains an increase on paper. In the end it is a mathematical result, and the fact that it is limited in scope shows that the will to revive the economy is nonexistent. We need not recall that public investment has an impact on the national economy and on national investment which has been weak since record-keeping was started. This also affects the contracting sector, such as public works and construction. As for the social policy promised by the government in a loosely worded statement, the balance sheets that governed drafting the finance law have failed to bring it into effect. Rather, the pincers have pressed hard. Despite the fact that the number of jobs expected to be created has been set at 25,000 jobs, and regardless of whether they will really be created or remain in storage, they realize no real progress in the field of absorbing a large number of unemployed, particularly those with higher education diplomas, that has reached more than 150,000. The funds allocated to revive employment are vaguely defined so far in terms of goals, means of financing, ways of expenditure, and trusteeship...et cetera. [as published] It must be pointed out in this regard that the proposed granting of loans to persons engaged in economic revival has failed. The contractual retraining program has made no progress. Both projects did not really absorb unemployed people nor did they open new vistas in the employment field. Allocating a special fund for job creation under the supervision of the ministry of finance does not mean that it will succeed or achieve objectives that were not achieved previously, notwithstanding the allocation of one billion dirhams to the fund. Increasing the tax-free portion of income to 18,000 dirhams does not result in a real increase in the income of people with limited or middle income. Rather this is yet another joke that is the subject of mockery and bitterness. The government continues to adhere to its unintelligent method of responding to the demands submitted by the unions representing the working factions in the field of wages and salaries. The value of these salaries and wages has been frozen; they lost much of their real value, resulting in a major drop in the purchasing power of the majority population in the face of the increasing inflation. This has also resulted in a drop in consumption and in the shrinkage of the domestic market, with all its economic effects. The drop in consumption is a major cause of economic stagnation in the past years as well as for the crisis in the contracting market. On the social level, the budget of the national ministry of education, which increased only by 5.06 percent, and of the ministry of health, which increased only by 9.76 percent, and the expected limited investments in the two budgets show that the government makes no provisions for real social investments, considering the acute shortage in education and medical facilities and staffs. It also gives no consideration to the workers' conditions. Clearly these limited increases are a far cry from the bombastic speeches about the will to carry out reforms in the social field. Meanwhile certain problems are left to rot, including those of education in the countryside and health care in towns and villages and other such issues. The same thing can be said about the housing situation that calls for a determined policy and mobilization of all available resources, particularly resources of the social reserve funds. It is known that at no time was the management of these funds socially oriented. Instead, deductions from wages and salaries have been blatantly used to increase the wealth of a few people. The government, given the data available to it, should be more certain than anybody else that the social policy cannot be left to market forces; for in no country, however liberal it may be, are socioeconomic factors laissez-faire, because leaving them unchecked means subjecting them to savagery. Social problems are far too difficult to be left to the market for resolution. Above all, the government is called upon to channel revenues from income taxes and from national resources exploitation into the social arena in order to improve social conditions and the standard of living, not just because this falls within the jurisdiction of government, but also because it is what makes a government legitimate, given that governmental legitimacy is based on seeking acceptable social balances, as the experience of peoples and countries has confirmed.
