[passage omitted] Following are certain typical questions and Leonid Kravchuk's responses. [passage omitted] [Question] Does it make sense to hold presidential elections, given the fact that decisions made by the current Supreme Council have practically reduced the president's role in the state to nothing? [Kravchuk] I would answer this question as follows: Certain deputies' view is to make the president absent from our state's political structure. This is their right. But, while stating this, they are simultaneously voting to hold the presidential elections. Where is the logic? Now, I will really answer your question. If the election is held, and the president is elected in accordance with the current law, meaning that he is elected head of the state and executive branch, this will mean that the people have voted for a presidential-parliamentary state. This will be a peculiar referendum, confirming that the people want a president -- a guarantor of independence, social protection, and the Constitution. Addressing the Supreme Council, I said that when the president is finally elected, all subsequent attempts to reduce his powers will fail, because the president will act in the name of the people. From this viewpoint, the presidential elections will make sense. [Question] Why did you propose Vitaliy Masol for the office of prime minister, even though you had been against him prior to that? [Kravchuk] No, I had not been against Vitaliy Masol. He was dismissed when the Soviet Union still existed, and when the Communist Party of both the Soviet Union and Ukraine was fully in power. Vitaliy Masol was then invited to the Central Committee, and it was recommended that he step down, taking the existing situation into account. He sought to obtain support outside Ukraine's borders (he can personally confirm that), but he did not find any. Thus, I was working with Vitaliy Masol, though not directly, but as the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman. I believe that he is an educated, experienced man. His program indicates that he has altered his way of viewing Ukraine's problems and economy. I would like him to achieve everything, and that nobody hamper him. Other candidates for the office of prime minister, as far as I understood the situation, would not have been supported by the parliament. Currently, Vitaliy Masol satisfies the interests of many people. [Question] What are your personal relations with Boris Yeltsin currently? [Kravchuk] My relations with Boris Yeltsin are normal, just as between people who have known each other for a long time, who know their strong and weak sides, and even when it is better to phone each other. Yet, obviously, the Russian president protects the interests of Russia, because otherwise, the Russians would not need such a president. Unless the Ukrainian president protects the interests of Ukraine, defends its integrity, sovereignty, and statehood, Ukraine does need such a president either. Thus, we both protect the interests of our states. However, this protection must not lead to the suffering of both peoples. This is an art, the art of political leadership. So far, we have been successful. [passage omitted]
