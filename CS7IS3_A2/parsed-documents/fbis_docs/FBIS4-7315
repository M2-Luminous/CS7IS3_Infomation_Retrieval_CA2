It is the first time in the postwar period for the nation's four- wheel vehicle production to fall for three straight years, association officials said. The latest annual fall was the largest since fiscal 1947, when domestic auto output took an 18.9 percent tumble, they said. The three-year string of declines was produced by a prolonged auto market slump at home against the backdrop of the worst recession in decades. For the fiscal year that ended March 31, production of passenger cars fell 11.8 percent to 8,199.790 as weak output of small cars offset a gain in larger cars. Production of "compact" cars, or those with engine displacement below 2000 cc, shrank 20.0 percent to 4,826,387. Output of cars with engines of more than 2000 cc rose 4.3 percent to 2,587,133, underlining the shift to such models away from compact cars. Production of trucks declined 12.7 percent to 2,603,190, while output of buses went down 11.8 percent to 46,847. For March alone, domestic automobile production fell 9.4 percent from a year earlier to 1,054,608 vehicles for the 18th straight month of decline, the association said.
