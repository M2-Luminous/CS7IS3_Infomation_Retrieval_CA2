NATO has once again given an ultimatum to the Serbs. [passage omitted] Listen to the reaction of Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who was in Nancy yesterday, speaking to Olivier Schneid: [Begin recording] [Juppe] Last night's decisions by the UN Security Council following the French initiative asking the Serbs to withdraw from Gorazde, should be followed by actions. When persuasion fails, force should be used. I think, therefore, it is logical that NATO should provide the United Nations with the means it requested in order to enforce international law. I would also like to say that we should not reduce our diplomatic efforts. [Shneid] Isn't this ultimatum a bit late? [Juppe] You can always say that but it is here today. Now we will have to implement it. We should be aware of the risks involved, however, including risks to ourselves and to our soldiers. [end recording]
