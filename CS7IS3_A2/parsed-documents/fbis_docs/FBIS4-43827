[passage omitted] Several senators are worried about the nuclear deterrence issue, which has been a subject of contention between the president of the Republic and the government. Mr. de Villepin expressed doubts as to the "realism of the determination to implement" the nuclear program "without additional testing." Mr. Leotard demonstrated complete agreement, indicating that "test simulations will not be sufficient to exempt France from actually performing additional testing." "Not a single scientist or member of the scientific community ever told me otherwise," he added.
