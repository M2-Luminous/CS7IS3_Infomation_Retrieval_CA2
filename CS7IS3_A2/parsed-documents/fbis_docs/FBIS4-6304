Now that the situation has become serious, they should not make any compromise to patch things up. It is fervently hoped that all Diet members will be fully aware of the current political situation and consider what Japan is required to do, and what they have to do. Carrying out political reform -- which the two previous cabinets failed to carry out -- is the greatest political achievement of the Hosokawa government. However, it can be said that political reform has not been completed until redistricting for new constituencies is decided and the effective date of the new electoral system is set. Among conservatives within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], some want to see political reform canceled by holding a general election after the Diet dissolution under the current multiple-seat constituency system. Therefore, regardless of what sort of cabinet the next government will be, the Diet should not be dissolved until the new electoral system is completely established. The biggest immediate problem facing Japan is the issue of North Korea. The United Nations is about to implement sanctions against North Korea which is suspected of developing nuclear weapons. Although I hope this issue will be settled peacefully, I cannot help wondering what action Japan will take if the United Nations should decide on sanctions. Senator William Roth (of the Republican Party), who is versed in Japanese affairs, stresses: "If Japan does not take any action, the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty will be just a piece of paper." The government is required to realize the possibility that if Japan, which advocates UN-centered policies, should fail to comply with the United Nations' possible decision on economic sanctions, not only will its loyalty to the United Nations be called into question -- and thus Japan will be isolated from the international community -- but also the United States will review its security treaty with Japan. Japan's evasion of its responsibility by providing financial contributions, like during the Persian Gulf war, will not be allowed this time. In order to completely discontinue exchanges of things, money and people with North Korea, it is necessary to review all the existing laws and at the same time legislate new laws. The North Korean issue is an important problem that tests Japan's ability to deal with a crisis. Actually, instructions should have already been given by Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura to ministries and agencies to study how to deal with the North Korean issue. However, Mr. Takemura, who has close relations with North Korea, has not done anything about it. Although there have been calls for Mr. Takemura to be chosen as prime minister, it is an absurd view. It may be all right to choose him as prime minister if the situation is calm. But given such a serious situation, we should by all means not let him take power. Regarding the North Korean issue, SDPJ General Secretary Kubo said: "Our party has fraternal relations with the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK], and we can talk to the WPK because the WPK is a fraternal party of the SDPJ." It is all very well, but I wonder what the SDPJ will do if the situation does not allow the SDPJ to talk to the WPK. When the Persian Gulf war broke out, Ms. Takako Doi flew to Iraq and met with President Husayn. But her effort ended in complete failure. I would like to ask the SDPJ what action it will take if North Korea rejects requests of such SDPJ leader as Mr. Kubo for accepting nuclear inspections, and if the United Nations implements sanctions. Mr. Takemura recently published a book entitled Japan--A Small But Brilliant Country. In short, this is a book of schoolgirlish tastes. When I visited Jakarta recently, I asked a high-ranking Indonesian official which countries the word "a small but brilliant country" brought to mind. He answered "Singapore." This answer is common sense. Japan is not "small." Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) accounts for 15 percent of the total GDP of the world, and when the GDP of the United States is added, it reaches 40 percent of the world GDP. The view of the international community is that Japan should have a more responsible role in the United Nations. With such hopes in mind, foreign nations say that they can let Japan become a permanent member of the UN Security Council when the United Nations is reformed. I think Mr. Takemura and the SDPJ probably want to avoid any military duties. However, they should recognize that Japan will not be allowed to take such a special position in the United Nations. Need To Promote Economic Reform The next immediate task is to seek ways to solve the Japan-U.S. economic friction. Japan is frowned on by foreign nations for storing up a $130 billion trade surplus. Of course the United States and European nations cannot criticize Japan if Japan's market is fully open to other nations. However, in Japan various regulations and barriers were established in wartime and during the period of postwar reconstruction. From the standpoint of the other nations, it is not easy for foreign nations to access Japan's market. This reflects the fact that the Japanese are unable to obtain cheaper foreign products. The gap between domestic and foreign prices is about 30 to 50 percent. Getting rid of regulations and barriers will not only help solve trade friction but also lead to creating a society in which the people feel comfortable and satisfied with their lives. The Hosokawa government, after carrying out political reform, set "economic reform" as the next task to be fulfilled. It was a correct decision. However, carrying out economic reform requires a capability to overcome the heavy resistance of bureaucrats. In view of this, the ruling parties need to get united. The Hosokawa government failed to take the leadership because of the split in the ruling parties resulting from the conflict over political realignment and policy matters, thus failing to bear down on bureaucrats. Meanwhile, however, a line has already been laid by Hosokawa. What the next government has to do is to run on the track like a weighty train. Rise in Consumption Tax Unavoidable Carrying out tax reform is also an unavoidable matter. Unlike the time when consumption tax was introduced, the people are now gradually understanding the meaning of indirect tax. The current component ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax revenue is 7:3. If this current component ratio should remain unchanged in the coming aging society, payment of income tax will be unbearable for tax payers. For this reason, a rise in consumption tax is unavoidable. The new coalition government should keep this point in mind. Revision or abolition of the current food control system is also indispensable. It is urged that politicians who share a common understanding on the current political situation described above get together. The government formed through such a process will be able to work in the people's interests.
