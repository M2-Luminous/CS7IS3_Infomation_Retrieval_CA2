Jordanian sources had said that while in Saudi Arabia, the king would hold talks on the Gulf situation, clearing the Arab atmosphere, and peace efforts. AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM has learned from its special sources that the idea of the Jordanian king's visit to Saudi Arabia had been proposed by Yemeni Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid in Saudi Arabia during his meeting with the custodian of the two holy mosques, who welcomed the accord document signed in Amman. The sources said that al-Bid telephoned King Husayn in the presence of the custodian of the two holy mosques, who welcomed the king's visit for minor pilgrimage.
