Reasonably available control technology or RACT, for the purposes of paragraph (s) of this section, means the lowest emission limitation that a particular coating line is capable of meeting by using measures that are reasonably available in terms of technological and economic feasibility. Such measures may include either control system(s) or coating reformulation(s) or both. Tab press lubrication is the process which uses a lubricated mechanical press to create beverage container lid tabs from flat aluminum metal stock. (3) Standards. (i) Limits. Tab press lubricant cannot exceed a VOC content of 5.73 pounds per gallon of lubricant used, less water and less exempt compounds, as defined in paragraph (s)(2) of this section; and VOC emissions from tab press lubricant usage cannot exceed 1.2 ร 10 ^5 pounds of VOC per tab produced. (ii) Emission control system. Alternatively, a facility may comply with the provisions of paragraph (s)(3)(i) of this section by using an emission control system, provided that the overall efficiency of the system (capture efficiency multiplied by destruction efficiency) shall not be less than 85% by weight in reducing organic compounds. The emission control system, as well as the operation and maintenance plan necessary to ensure compliance on an ongoing basis, shall be approved in writing by the Administrator. (iii) Compliance schedule. Limits as defined in paragraphs (s)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section shall be achieved upon publication of the final rule. (4) Test methods. (i) Determination of VOC content of lubricants. The VOC content of coatings subject to the provisions of paragraph (s) of this section, excluding exempt compounds, shall be analyzed as prescribed by 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 24. (ii) Determination of exempt compounds. Measurement of exempt compounds shall be conducted and reported in accordance with ASTM D 4457&hyph;85. For exempt compounds where no reference test method is available, a facility requesting the exemption shall provide appropriate test methods approved by the Administrator. (iii) Determination of destruction efficiency. Destruction efficiency as specified in paragraph (s)(3)(ii) of this section shall be determined by 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Methods 25 and 25A. (iv) Determination of capture efficiency. Measurement of capture efficiency of the emission control system as specified in paragraph (s)(3)(ii) of this section shall be conducted and reported in accordance with the U.S. EPA protocols, 37 or other capture efficiency methods approved by the Administrator. 37 40 CFR 52.741(a)(4)(iii). (5) Administrative requirements. (i) Material usage records. (A) The facility shall maintain a current list of lubricants and solvents in use which include the following information: (1 ) Name and manufacturer information; ( 2 ) Mixing instructions; ( 3 ) VOC content of tab press lubricants as applied; ( 4 ) Weight percent water; and ( 5 ) Weight percent exempt solvent. (B) The facility shall maintain records of the amounts of lubricants and VOCs used according to the following schedule: ( 1 ) Monthly records showing the types and amounts of lubricants used that meet the standards in paragraph (s)(3)(i) of this section; and ( 2 ) Daily records showing the types and amounts of lubricants used when such usage was in conjunction with emission control equipment. (C) The facility shall maintain monthly records of the number of tabs produced by each type of tab press. (ii) Emission control equipment records. Any facility complying with the provisions of paragraph (s)(3)(ii) of this section by using air pollution control equipment shall maintain daily records of key system operating parameters, such as temperatures, pressures, and/or flow rates, for the emission control equipment. (iii) Proof of compliance. The facility shall prove compliance with the standards of paragraph (s)(3) of this section by conducting annual source testing of tab press lubrication operations and analyzing VOC content of the lubricants as per paragraph (s)(4)(i) of this section. (iv) Retention of records. All records maintained pursuant to this section shall be retained and available for inspection by the Administrator for the previous five-year period. (t) Fugitive emissions from oil and gas production facilities and conveying stations. (1) Applicability. The requirements of paragraph (t) of this section shall apply to any owner or operator of an oil or gas production field or conveying station. For the purposes of this paragraph, the affected areas include the Sacramento Metro Area, the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin Area, and the Ventura County Area as described for ozone in 40 CFR 81.305. (2) Definitions. For the purposes of paragraphs (t)(1) through (t)(7) of this section, the following definitions shall apply. All terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in ยง52.2950. Background means the ambient concentration of organic compounds expressed as methane as determined by a portable hydrocarbon detection instrument when the reading is taken at least three meters upwind from any component to be inspected and which is not influenced by any specific emission point. Closed-vent system means any system that is not open to the atmosphere and is composed of piping, connections and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gases or vapors from a piece or pieces of equipment to a vapor recovery or disposal system. Commercial natural gas means natural gas containing less than 10% VOC by weight. Component means any valve, fitting, pump, compressor, pressure relief device, diaphragm, hatch, sight-glass, open-ended line, or meter. Compressor means any device used to compress gases and/or vapors. Control valve means a device used to regulate the fluid pressure or volume in a process unit that, upon actuation, releases process stream VOCs. Excluded from this definition are control valves that are actuated by non-process stream compressed air. Conveying station means any compressor station, metering station, or other transfer station located between the extraction well and the refinery or gas processing plant. Critical component means any component that if shut down would require the shutdown of a critical process unit. Critical process unit means a process unit that has no standby equipment available, that cannot be bypassed, and that would be technically infeasible to repair leaks from without shutting down the associated process.
