Checks are also being carried out on international trains. This monitoring is the result of agreements reached between the government and Second Chamber in order to halt the increase in the number of illegal foreigners entering the Netherlands. It principally concerns people who enter the Netherlands illegally or asylum-seekers who have no chance of receiving a residence permit. The so-called flying brigades will be in action 24 hours a day.
