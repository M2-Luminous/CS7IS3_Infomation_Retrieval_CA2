[Peto] During the talks, it has become clear that the MSZP's coalition intention is serious and this cannot at the moment be doubted by the SZDSZ. The coalition will obviously increase the chance that policies that are acceptable to the SZDSZ prevail in the country, and it is no secret that this was one of the factors that influenced us. Therefore, if we had and have worries about the possible existence of various intentions in the MSZP, we will be able to influence these intentions through the coalition. I do not think that this needs to be kept secret. [passage omitted] [Sumegi] You have often mentioned the example of Germany, where the Free Democrats, in spite of their few mandates, occupy an important position in the government. Is it possible that the SZDSZ will get the positions of foreign minister, interior minister, and justice minister in Hungary? [Peto] If we only looked at the speculation then the whole government would belong to us because it has already been suggested regardomg all ministries that we insist on having it. We do not wish to talk about this in public during the talks. [passage omitted] [Sumegi] Returning to the German example, is it possible that, whoever acquires majority, the SZDSZ can always be a governmental factor? [Peto] Hungarian political life consists of three lines and practically none of the political forces can form a government on its own -- although the MSZP has now acquired the absolute majority. I assume that this situation will be prolonged and that a similar landslide-like victory cannot be expected at the next elections. Therefore, at least two forces will always have to work together. The SZDSZ is a serious factor in political life and, at the next elections, it can be one of the parties that will choose coalition partners. [Sumegi] Do you even think cooperation with the conservative parties possible? [Peto] On the basis of statements made by some leaders of the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], I assume that there is a chance that the MDF will conduct moderate politics in opposition. It is not necessary for our relations to remain the way they have been in the past few years. I can imagine that the Hungarian political life will be like the German one where there are joining points between the various political forces. [passage omitted] [Sumegi] The SZDSZ, which has so far been open about its politics, appears to be more hostile to the press. [Peto] We consider it extremely important to inform the public but we also have other obligations. If our convention had been public then our debate could not have been so open. A decision that will determine a party's life in the long run does not necessarily have to be made before the public, and the same applies to the coalition talks. The negotiations would not achieve their objective if we were also trying to adapt to the needs of publicity. [passage omitted]
