It is possible that my essay today will make a small addition to these conclusions you have drawn. It is not possible to show political activity in Uzbekistan today. In the street, the home, at the workplace -- everywhere there are spies, every day there are new intrigues, new investigations, new crimes, new punishments. Together with everybody else, I have not remained without sin. They have accused me of attempting to overthrow the state. Let me briefly explain the situation: in the Summer of 1992 a group of activists decided a public organization called "National Assembly" in order to help Parliament in pushing through laws. I was informed about this, but I said that the Erk Party would not join this organization. They accused me of being among the members of an organization which had still not been organized. We were eight people intending to overthrow the state. At the same time, the "National Assembly" plan had been sent to the President in order to provide him with advice. Now, do you imagine that men planning to overthrow the state would send their plans to the man standing at the head of the state? What would they say, "Respected president, we intend to overthrow the state, here is some advice?" Procurator Jorayev himself exposed to the entire world in the 11 August issue of KHALQ SOZI newspaper that the accusation which was made was meaningless. Jorayev wrote: "The National Assembly program is known to all; it consists of generalities taken from other sources and there is nothing new in it." If the words in the "National Assembly" program -- the basic documentation of the crime which was committed -- are words known to everyone, and if this were not sufficient, if they were general words taken from other sources and if there is nothing new in them, what is the crime in this program? Praise be to Jorayev: through the shrewdness of his words, he condemned the political order in Uzbekistan. But not even a lawyer like Jorayev can revive the complete innocence of the activists of the "National Assembly." All of Uzbekistan was amused for days by this. But our hope is in the future. Those striving to bring this hope to life exist in Uzbekistan. Let me inform you briefly about one of the components of these forces, the Erk Party. The Erk Party is an opposition party. Why is an opposition necessary? First, an opposition is necessary in the capacity of a helper, an advisor to the existing government in the urgent political and economic questions in the republic. In addition, the opposition is needed to control the rule of the party or group that has gone to the pinnacle of the state. Thus, the rulers should not become angry, nor should they view the people as their own property. Control by the opposition is completely different that control by state organs -- this control is the control by political forces, in the broadest sense, by social forces, which are not in the government. If the opposition party makes the people understand its program in an election and this party comes into government; the defeated party leaves th government and becomes the opposition itself. And that is all it is. This rule is a daily rule in the Western states. In these states, no government would hasten to cut down the opposition as quickly as Uzbekistan's government. For three years, the Erk Party is a party that has survived by evading the axe. If this party came to government, what would it give the people? Various people have asked me this question under various conditions. Unfortunately, I have had slight opportunity to answer it. In Uzbekistan the majority of people are not familiar with the Erk program. The government says that the people should neither know nor hear about this program and, to a certain extent, it has attained its goal. Permission to print the economic program of the Erk Party in the newspaper ERK, which is its own newspaper, has not been granted because if the program is published the government could not make the claim that "the opposition has no program." If the program were published in the newspaper, proponents of Erk would increase and would become dangerous to the government. According to the economic views of the Erk Party, I would appeal first to the peasants: If Erk comes into the government, it would not take anything out of your pockets but would probably give you your own property. Then you would not stare at the chairman when he tells you how much of our cotton the state will take, but you would sell the cotton at the price you want. At that time the chairman would not tell you and your grandfather what to do because not only the cotton, but also the land would be yours. An Erk Party government would begin privatizing land bit by bit. This means that it would be leased; profitable lands would be the first to be leased; that is to say, these lands would be given to the leaseholder in perpetuity. At the same time, all kolkhoz lands would be converted into the form of full leases and these, in the course of two of three years based on the income taken out of them, would be turned over to the leaseholders as private property. As for the revived kolkhoz itself, if society benefits from it, it is possible that it would survive on an equal basis with private enterprises. But, we would have to see, because today there is no kolkhoz which is not in debt to the state: for this reason, the Erk Party thinks that the kolkhoz system has no future. It is possible that the privatization movement will not take one-two years, but longer because before enterprises can take on a new form it will be necessary to create the technical and material basis for them. Until these enterprises are standing on their own feet after these measures are taken, they will either not be taxed or taxed at a minimal level. In village areas small firms and factories would begin to be built which would process the product on the spot. The state would take on the responsibility of supplying them with equipment because private enterprises could not survive at the initial stage without help from the state. In brief, the Erk Party will begin its work with land reform; in the first five years, the basic plan of action will take not heavy industry, but light industry into consideration. Seventy percent of Uzbekistan's population lives in villages and if land reform is successfully implemented, 70 percent of the population of our nation will be saved from sinking into poverty. Through these economic measures, a national property census will be taken. And, outside of large factories and heavy industry, all middle-sized and small plants will begin to be privatized. The Erk Party will begin its fight for the preservation of nature with the severe consequences of the cotton monoculture. A state must be concerned for the health of its population before everything else. The Erk Part views this question as a question of equals importance to the economic and political questions, and will expend all its strength to resolve it. A government which thinks that the problem will be resolved by burdening public organizations like the Aral Committee with it is irresponsible. On the work of the Erk Party on political reforms The Erk Party considers its basic goal to be the transformation of Uzbekistan into a democratic state. In order to build a democratic state, passing a democratic Constitution is not enough in itself. Uzbekistan's people have a democratic Constitution, but this Constitution cannot improve the lot of Uzbekistan's people. The leadership rules over the will of the people, not the laws or the Constitution. Today they have sat on the Constitution; a democratic state would remove the Constitution from under these bureaucrats and would raise it to the necessary level. Thus, they would be able to prevent all kinds of distortions in a democratic society. By the same token, neither leftwing forces nor rightwing forces would be able to endanger the state. In other words, a true structure, we think a democratic system could come into being in the state, not a group of bloodthirsty officials. What do we mean by a democratic system? Let me give an example: let us say a racist becomes the head of government in England. This individual would be unable to change English policy to a racist policy because the democratic mechanism of the state would force this person to act within certain limits. If this person opposed the system, the system would remove him from the government. This means that in such a system the coming into power of a fascist or a madman would be quite improbable. Now if Tashmat ascends to the throne in states lacking a democratic order but only a tyranny, the entire state follows Tashmat's policy; if Ashmat mounts to the throne, it follows Ashmat's policy. In other words, if Tashmat and Ashmat are both crazy, or if they are treasonous, both the state and the nation are in terrible danger. Thus, the Erk Party considers that a state built on the democratic principle is the most credible state. Let me say a few words about the Erk Party's cadre policy. The Erk Party believes that the cadres will play an important role in the building of a new state. In this sector we have a traditional sickness-- localism. Our leadership, instead of understanding that our nation cannot be divided from its people, has pursued a divisive policy, and has descended into localism. This policy seriously poisons the minds of our people, and it will demand considerable work to drive this poison out. The Erk Party will take this selfless task on its own shoulders and root out the divisive policy. Cadres, primarily, will be selected according to their worth and then their willingness to work in the interests of the state. They will be given the opportunity to work creatively within their duties and to take a creative approach to their jobs. In other words, they will not have to ask the president for permission to do everything as they do now; independent and intelligent officials will not sidestep difficult problems, they will just resolve them. Every official will be evaluated at his rank within the state and will be compensated for his work and trustworthiness. Officials will not be insulted by their bosses, and shortcomings in the official's personal life will not be judged by the administration. They will be paid enough to lead a free and straightforward life, and all possibilities for their retirement to normal life will be created. Whether one is a normal official, deputy, teacher at a university of a physician, he will live with the feeling that "I am necessary to the state, and the state will also reinforce this idea. In its turn, the state will demand definite responsibility from the official. When the official is in the administration, it will be a condition that he knows that the state's interest and authority is his primary goal. Every minor complaint against the official will be investigated in depth by the state and appropriate measures taken. An official who takes a bribe will be punished mercilessly by the state. The state has the legal and moral right to do this because the state will have guaranteed its officials with the salaries and privileges at a level where they will not feel the need to break the law. The most severe punishments will be given to officials who betray the interests of the state. In this way, as long as the state finds it useful to defend its officials and guarantee their [word obliterated], it will also be in the officials' interests to provide their services honestly to the state. The Erk Party's ideological statement is brief: national awakening and an independent state. These ideological examples are not from a brochure by Erk's leadership, but taken from the rich history of our nation. Starting at the beginning of our century, the Djadidist movement brought forth a new national ideology. This movement was not guided by the khanate or the governate, but by politically educated groups and free-thinking enlightened people. These societies evoked the people's ideals and comprehended their hopes, aspirations and sorrows clearly and precisely. All organizations similar to this could manifest themselves in cultural-educational, historical, language or newspaper societies. Similar organizations began to form two years ago but were quickly closed down. The writers' union was such an organization but, unfortunately, it split and quarreled over authority and divided its prizes. The state does not have to close these societies, on the contrary, it should support and strengthen them. The state has to create its own ideology on the foundations of these societies. Thus, the new state would gain trust among the people. Once this trust is gained, then the state has a job to do: it must prepare the economic and political basis for the ideology it is creating. In other words, without reforms everything we have stated above will remain beautiful ideas or mere embroidery. For the state to make its people follow its ideology, it must grant political and economic freedoms to them. The person with a fettered mind cannot love his nation nor can he be committed to it. The poor man is that way. Erk Party's views on religion The Erk Party is for giving complete freedom to religious organizations because faith is inherent, and those believing in Allah can be useful to society. Even if they do not contribute to society, they do no harm. This philosophy expresses the Erk Party's relationship to religion completely. Specifically, educated religious leaders can help in the spiritual health of the new state we are building. They will show enthusiasm in nourishing with purity and faith the emptiness in the hearts of our nation which has undergone a century of slavery. As for "Islamic fundamentalism," that is something to think about. In general, religious radicalism is foreign to the nature of the Turkic peoples. In fact, our ancestors never promoted a policy of ignorance in the religious sector. The Turkic peoples were at the forefront in spreading Islam; the conquered other nations but always distanced themselves from religious ignorance, and propagandized their own religion by means of education. Today, some of our friends, calling themselves religious believers, say mistakenly to males "if you wear a necktie, you are an unbeliever" are to females "if you do not wear the veil, you are an unbeliever." But faith lives in our hearts, not our clothing. If, instead of faith in the hear there is misery, and if such a woman puts on the veil, the veil only covers the misery. Islamic educators direct their training toward mankind's inner world. Islamic elements, not the veil or turban, are in service to Allah and this belief. Twenty years ago there were 400 thousand Muslims in Europe. Today, there are four million Muslims in Europe, the majority of whom are European. These people are not under the influence of simplistic Islamic propagandists for Islam, but have read the blessed Koran. Otherwise, they have accepted this religion under the influence of deep-thinking Islamic propagandists. Simplistic propagandists have always done more harm to Islam than good. This simplistic philosophy was the cause of the centuries-old degraded condition of Islam in Turkestan. The "Islamic obedience" taught by these simple mollas was a way of extending the life of Tsarist Russian colonialism in Turkestan. However, Islam is not a religion of obedience or subjugation. Islam is a religion of courage and valor. Islam teaches one to bow his head to no one but Allah. Islam teaches one to fear nothing but Allah. Abukadir Al Jazairi, a mujahid who fought against French colonialism, was asked by Western reporters "Why do your soldiers not fear death?" He answered: "Because my soldiers believe in Allah. They know that their lives are not in the hands of the enemy, but in the hands of Allah. Thus, why should they fear the enemy?" Our children should be trained with such faith.
