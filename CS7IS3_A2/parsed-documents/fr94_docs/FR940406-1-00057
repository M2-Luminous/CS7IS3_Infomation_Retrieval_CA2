FR940406-1-00057 FR940406-1-00015 48 CFR Parts 25 and 52 [FAR Case 92&hyph;48] Federal Acquisition Regulation; Fluctuating Exchange Rates AGENCIES: Department of Defense (DOD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense Acquisition Regulations Council are proposing to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to provide guidance on the use of foreign currency. A corresponding provision is proposed regarding evaluation of foreign currency offers. This regulatory action was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review pursuant to Executive Order 12866, dated September 30, 1993. DATES: Comments should be submitted on or before June 6, 1994, to be considered in the formulation of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Interested parties should submit written comments to: General Services Administration, FAR Secretariat (VRS), 18th & F Streets, NW., room 4037, Washington, DC 20405. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;48 in all correspondence related to this case. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter O'Such at (202) 501&hyph;1759 in reference to this FAR case. For general information, contact the FAR Secretariat, room 4037, GS Building, Washington, DC 20405 (202) 501&hyph;4755. Please cite FAR case 92&hyph;48. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background This case was opened based on Department of Defense Inspector General Report Number 92&hyph;090, May 14, 1992, Impact of Fluctuating Foreign Exchange Rates on Contract Prices, which found that regulatory guidance does not adequately address consideration of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. , because this rule pertains to contracts entered into and performed overseas, and with rare exceptions, will affect only foreign concerns. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has, therefore, not been performed. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 601. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. C. Paperwork Reduction Act The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed changes to the FAR do not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements, or collections of information from offerors, contractors, or members of the public which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq. List of Subjects in 48 CFR Parts 25 and 52 Government procurement. Dated: March 28, 1994. Albert A. Vicchiolla, Director, Office of Federal Acquisition Policy.
