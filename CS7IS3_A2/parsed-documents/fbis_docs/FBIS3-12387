In a statement published today by the Bahraini newspaper AL-AYYAM, Dr. al-Iryani said these reports are baseless, pointing out that the formation of a new Yemeni government is presently not a subject of discussion. The paper disclosed that Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has invited his "deputy" 'Ali Nasir Muhammad [former president of South Yemen] to form a new Yemeni government to replace the government of Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, the current Yemeni prime minister. 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, however, rejected the offer.
