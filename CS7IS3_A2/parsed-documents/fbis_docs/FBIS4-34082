FBIS4-34082 "drlat115_r_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-115 Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 Peru Independent Candidates Have `Best Chance' Independent Candidates Have `Best Chance' PY1406234894 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1547 GMT 13 Jun 94 PY1406234894 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Lima, 13 Jun (EFE) -- Research carried out by polling enterprises shows that the Peruvian presidential candidate with the best chance of winning the 1995 elections is one who is independent and able to solve the unemployment problem, the economic crisis, and the hunger problem. Here are the issues that currently worry Peruvian's the most: unemployment (31.4 percent), the economic crisis (21.7 percent), terrorism (18.1 percent), low salaries (6.6 percent), hunger (5.9 percent), education (4.4 percent), drug trafficking (4.2 percent), and corruption (3.6 percent). The poll conducted by the Imasen enterprise reveals that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's chances have dropped to 28.3 percent while current President Alberto Fujimori enjoys the support of 39.8 percent. Perez de Cuellar's popularity probably dropped due to his delay in deciding whether or not to run in the April 1995 elections. If Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar went to a second round, Fujimori would obtain 46.8 percent and Perez de Cuellar 40.3 percent. A survey by Imasen in April showed the electoral preference also leaned in Fujimori's favor with 45.6 percent compared to 43.6 percent for the former UN secretary general. Lima Mayor Ricardo Belmont, who has just announced his candidacy, received 14 percent support while former President Fernando Belaunde received only one percent. Belaunde's electoral campaign, which started a few months ago, appears the most aggressive. "Authoritarianism must not continue at Government Palace," stated Belaunde who said the article of the 1993 Constitution that authorizes immediate presidential reelection "is an adventure that harms the people of Peru and America." The Datum polling enterprise announced that the candidate must establish a real relationship with electors because his success or failure relies on a harmony between what he preaches and what the people need. Another polling enterprise, CPI [expansion unknown], has found the candidates must appear independent and must reconcile social aspects with the modernization of the economy. Other enterprises maintain that the discrepancies between what candidates promise during campaigns and what happens once elected has caused the people to disbelieve in political speeches. The Forum enterprise has stated that "nefarious experiences of the past mean the people no longer want political speeches, rather direct messages, free of superfluous words."
