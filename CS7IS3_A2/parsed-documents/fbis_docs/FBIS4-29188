The U.S. Embassy in Tokyo conveyed Washington's opposition to the EAEC proposal to the Japanese Government June 7, saying the caucus would have a negative effect on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. It marks the first time that the administration of President Bill Clinton, which has taken a wait-and-see attitude on the EAEC, has explicitly opposed the proposal. The embassy also told Japanese officials that Thailand, which is the current chairman of ASEAN, and Brunei, as the ASEAN chairman of the U.S.-ASEAN dialogue this year, will be informed about Washington's stance. The declaration of U.S. opposition to the caucus comes soon after ASEAN officials briefed the U.S. Government during the u.S.-ASEAN dialogue meeting in Washington in may on the details of the EAEC as formulated by ASEAN in a blueprint on the EAEC concept. According to the blueprint, the EAEC is not "a subsidiary organ of APEC but would function independently of it." It points out that even though ASEAN agreed last year that the EAEC would function as a caucus within APEC, it is not a caucus "of" APEC. The blueprint also says "the caucus would determine its own agenda" and "the results of the caucus' discussions need not be reported to APEC meetings unless deemed necessary." At the Washington meeting, ASEAN officials assured the U.S. Government that the EAEC would not be confrontational and would be compatible with the U.S.-favored APEC forum. U.S. Assistant Secretary for East Asia and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord did not give a response at the time. The administration of former President George Bush had bitterly opposed the plan for the EAEC, which would exclude the U.S. because of worries that it would become a confrontational economic weapon of Asian economies against the developed world. But the Clinton administration initially appeared to move toward a softer stance. Washington's latest opposition makes it more difficult for Japan to accept ASEAN's invitation to join the EAEC. So far, Japan has remained cool toward the issue because of fear of antagonizing the U.S. The absence of Japan, Asia's economic powerhouse, from the EAEC would put the proposal in a quandary and analysts say ASEAN may now have no choice but to make further changes to the EAEC concept.
