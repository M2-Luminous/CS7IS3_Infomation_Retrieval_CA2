The Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA- PT] provided the Riot Police with such equipment. A FALA officer, who was part of the Joint Political and Military Commission, said the Bicesse Accord is quite clear when it says that no country or government may supply lethal equipment to any of the signatories of the accord. Yesterda, ABC, which is published in Madrid, reported that the Spanish opposition demanded explanations about the sale of weapons to the MPLA-PT when the Bicesse Accord was still in force. Felipe Gonzalez' government refused to comment, alleging that the equipment delivered to the MPLA was a state secret. Meanwhile, ABC says the Spanish Government has confirmed its participation in training the MPLA's riot Police. Our FALA sources said Spain should be condemned by the UN Security Council for its involvement in the violation of the Bicesse Accord.
