Ballots cast by members who did not attend the meeting but who submitted their ballots in accordance with instructions above will be counted with votes cast at the meeting. In order to have a suitable record of the vote, the voting at the meeting should be by written ballot as well. •The board of directors shall, within 10 days, certify the results of the membership vote to the regional director. The statement shall be verified by affidavits of the Chief Executive Officer and the Recording Officer on NCUA 4505. III.F_Compliance With State Laws If the proposition for conversion is approved by a majority of all members who voted, the board of directors should then: •Ensure that all requirements of state law and the state regulator have been accommodated; •Ensure that the state charter or the license has been received within 90 days from the date the members approved the proposal to convert; •Ensure that the regional director is kept informed as to progress toward conversion and of any material delay or of substantial difficulties which may be encountered. If the conversion cannot be completed within the 90-day period, the regional director should be informed of the reasons for the delay. III.G_Completion of Conversion In order for the conversion to be completed, the following steps are necessary: •The board of directors will submit a copy of the state charter to the regional director within 10 days of its receipt. This will be accompanied by the federal charter and the federal insurance certificate. A copy of the financial reports (FCU 109A and 109B) as of the preceding month-end should be submitted at this time. •The regional director will notify the credit union and the state regulator is writing of the receipt of evidence that the credit union has been authorized to operate as a state credit union. •The credit union shall cease to be a federal credit union as of the effective date of the state charter. •If the regional director finds a material deviation from the provisions that would invalidate any steps taken in the conversion, the credit union and the state regulator shall be promptly notified in writing. This notice may be either before or after the copy of the state charter is filed with the regional director. The notice will inform the credit union as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will not be effected and completed until the improper actions and steps have been corrected. •Upon ceasing to be a federal credit union, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act, except as may apply if federal share insurance coverage is continued. The successor state credit union shall be immediately vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. Operation of the credit union from this point will be in accordance with the requirements of state law and the state regulator. •If the regional director is satisfied that the conversion has been accomplished in accordance with the approved proposal, the federal charter will be canceled. •There is no federal requirement for closing the records of the federal credit union at the time of conversion or for the manner in which the records shall be maintained thereafter. The converting credit union is advised to contact the state regulator for applicable state requirements. The credit union shall neither use the words ``Federal Credit Union'' in its name nor represent itself in any manner as being a federal credit union. •If the state credit union is to be federally insured, the regional director will issue a new insurance certificate.
