FR940621-2-00066 FR940621-2-00044 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Availability of an Environmental Assessment and Receipt of an Application for a Permit To Allow Incidental Take of the Endangered Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard and Threatened San Joaquin Kit Fox by the City of Bakersfield in Kern County, CA AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice advises the public that the City of Bakersfield (Applicant) has applied to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) for an incidental take permit pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The application has been assigned permit number PRT&hyph;786634. The requested permit would authorize the incidental take of the endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizard ( Gambelia silus ) and the threatened San Joaquin kit fox ( Vulpes macrotis mutica ) in the city of Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The proposed incidental take would occur as a result of construction activities for a sewer trunkline in blunt-nose leopard lizard and San Joaquin kit fox habitat. The Service also announces the availability of an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the proposed issuance of the incidental take permit. This notice is provided pursuant to section 10(c) of the Act and National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR §1506.6). DATES: Written comments on the permit application and EA should be received on or before July 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments regarding the application or adequacy of the EA should be addressed to Mr. Joel Medlin, Field Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Field Office, 2800 Cottage Way, Rooms E&hyph;1803 and 1823, Sacramento, California 95825. Please refer to permit No. PRT&hyph;786634 when submitting comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Peter Cross, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Sacramento Field Office, 2800 Cottage Way, Rooms E&hyph;1803 and 1823, Sacramento, California 95825 (916&hyph;978&hyph;4866). Individuals wishing copies of the application or EA for review should immediately contact the above individual. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under section 9 of the Act, ``taking'' of endangered blunt-nosed leopard lizards and threatened San Joaquin kit fox is prohibited. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered or threatened wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered and threatened species are in 50 CFR §§17.22 and 17.32, respectively. The applicant proposes to implement a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) for the blunt-nose leopard lizard and San Joaquin kit fox that will allow construction of a sewer trunkline in the city of Bakersfield, Kern County, California. The permit would authorize the disturbance of up to 88.2 acres. The permit would be in effect for 2 years. The application includes an HCP and Implementation Agreement. The applicant proposes to construct a 12 to 30-inch diameter underground line within a construction corridor ranging between 35 and 75 feet in width. Construction is proposed to begin after permit issuance and to take about 8 to 9 months. A total of 88.2 acres will be subject to temporary disturbance as a result of sewer trunkline construction activities. Approximately 73 acres of the total disturbed area is considered suitable habitat for the two listed species. The area that will be subject to temporary disturbance includes urban, actively cultivated, and nonnative grasslands. The applicant proposes to undertake a series of on-site and off-site mitigation measures to offset the incidental take of a small number of San Joaquin kit foxes and blunt-nosed leopard lizards, and the temporary impacts to their habitats associated with this project. These measures would include: (1) Offsite acquisition of 80.2 acres of native habitat; (2) transfer to the California Department of Fish and Game, or the designated trustee, funds to manage and improve these offsite lands; and (3) measures to reduce the potential of take of both species to the maximum extent possible during construction of the sewer trunkline. The EA considers the environmental consequences of four alternatives. The alternatives include the proposed action (permit issuance), no-action (permit denial), incorporation into the Regional Section 10(a) permit for the Metropolitan Bakersfield Area, and modifying current sewer trunkline alignments. Dated: June 15, 1994. H. Dale Hall, Regional Director, Region 1 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15008 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;55&hyph;M
