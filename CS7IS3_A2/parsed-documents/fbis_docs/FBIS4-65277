FBIS4-65277 "drweu094_h_94007" FBIS-WEU-94-094 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 GERMANY Moscow Embassy Says Mafia Targets German Firms Moscow Embassy Says Mafia Targets German Firms LD1405165994 Berlin DDP/ADN in German 1115 GMT 14 Apr 94 LD1405165994 Berlin DDP/ADN German BFN [Text] Siegburg/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German business representatives in Moscow seem to be increasingly at risk from the Russian mafia. This was the gist of an alarming telegram sent by the German Embassy in Moscow to the German Foreign Ministry headquarters, according to the `Bonn-Info' information service. Today a Foreign Ministry spokesman was unwilling either to deny or confirm the telegram for the moment because of the diplomatic nature of the message. In the embassy's view, there is a "strong probability" of German associations and firms "coming into contact with organized crime sooner or later," particularly in Moscow and St. Petersburg. That only left a "choice between paying or leaving." The mafia was trying to plant "bookkeepers" to monitor company income to secure their "tax share" in the form of protection money. Firms with retail outlets or storage buildings in particular were therefore coming to arrangements with blackmailers to prevent the risk of their buildings being "torched." The blackmailers were also frequently threatening the lives of the businessmen and their families. In its telegram, the embassy raises the question of whether the German Government should advise against business activity in Russia in the event of growing risks. Protection from the Russian authorities was "insufficiently guaranteed".
