The changes in the foreign currency market follow yesterday's decisions by the committee for regulating the foreign currency market. The committee announced that the state banking system will supply the foreign currency required by some importers at 50 rials less than current market prices. The cabinet also decided in a session last night that, taking into account the decisions of the committee for regulating foreign currency, dealings with the foreign currency open market by any government establishment or establishments affiliated to the government in order to secure their required foreign currency will be illegal and any negligence by the banks during the currency allocation procedures will be deemed as collaboration with economic saboteurs. Here is our correspondent with a report on the situation in the foreign currency market today: [Unidentified correspondent] After the decision by the committee for regulating the foreign currency market to ban the purchase of dollars by government companies as well offering foreign currency to companies at prices lower than those on the open market, currency prices on the Tehran currency market fell by 100 to 150 rials per dollar last night. Today as well, prices are reduced by the same amount compared with yesterday's prices. Right now I am at the Tehran foreign currency market. After last night's cabinet decision, currency dealings at the Tehran foreign currency market have almost stopped since this morning but at the new prices currency dealers are only buying and show no inclination to sell. At the same time on the Tehran open foreign currency market currency dealings are stagnant and the market is quiet. At the moment each dollar is priced at 263 tumans which shows a decrease of 14 to 17 tumans compared with yesterday.
