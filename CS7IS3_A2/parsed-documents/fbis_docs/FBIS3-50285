Terms like "arrogance" and a "mean trick" are flying about, together with appeals for solidarity and warnings that by this attitude we may lose our last allies. Nevertheless, these daring statements are not based on any rational arguments. However, it is precisely rational thinking and a cool head that we most need today in the tumultuous region of Europe, particularly in its Eastern and Central parts. The stand of the Czech Republic is not a struggle for petty prestige, as one reporter called it, but responsible behavior. If we succumbed to pressures for a close coordination of the approach to NATO with all of the Visegrad countries, we would be making an error. Unfortunately, it is true that we are more likely to become NATO members after we manage to separate ourselves from the irrational vision of a Visegrad self-help association, after no one dares to include the Czech Republic in East Europe, and after we really prove that we are a prosperous, and especially a stable, democratic state. I believe it is better to have as a partner, even if relatively later, the entire Western civilization than, immediately, several unreliable riders en route to the same destination. I am sorry, but Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary have let themselves be pushed into the role of three drowning men who are trying to grasp the coattails of a fourth one. The representatives of the Czech Republic, however, do not belong to those who cannot realize that three drowning men are too much for one rescuer. It must be hoped that the drowning men know how to swim, at least a little. Someone could object: What about our sense of solidarity? Should we help them, after all? I believe that the notion of solidarity is not at all appropriate in the present situation. How can we help Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia? How else but verbally? I believe that no one wants us to condition our admission into NATO Samaritan-like by a [demand for] the simultaneous admission of all of the other Visegrad partners. That would be an inexcusable gamble with the security of the Republic because such a statement would slow down our admission into NATO. It could even block it completely because who knows what is going to happen in East Europe over the next few years? Claims have also been made, as another argument for the coordination of the proceeding of the Visegrad Four, that, after the partition of Czechoslovakia, the West does not want to tolerate any further disintegration of the Central European region. I do not understand what the issue is here. In the instance of the partition of Czechoslovakia, it was an execution of the will expressed by the majority of citizens in the 1992 elections, a commendable avoidance of a Yugoslav-type tragedy, and simply an act that is impossible not to respect, one that must be commended. And the unwillingness to dissolve the Visegrad Four? This fear is again rather irrational and not at all supported by the evidence. Are the Western countries at all interested in maintaining an integral bloc in the Central European region? Could the Polish or the Slovak elections, for instance, or the expected outcome of the elections in Hungary have changed something in their attitude? If so, would the possible interest in keeping the Visegrad countries close together be in or, rather, against the interests of the Czech Republic--that is, against expeditious admission to NATO? It is interesting that all of the consequential foreign policy makers in the Czech Republic--the president, the prime minister, and the foreign minister--have reached a rare accord regarding the approach to NATO. It shows that, when the going gets tough, when Czech national interests are at stake, the political representatives can unite. The guarantee of the security of the state and, therefore, admission to NATO really is the number-one national interest.
