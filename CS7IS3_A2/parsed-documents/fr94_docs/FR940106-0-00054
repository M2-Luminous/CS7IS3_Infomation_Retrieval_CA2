FR940106-0-00054 FR940106-0-00017 To §493.1483, Standard: Cytotechnologist Qualifications, we added several alternative qualification standards for cytotechnologists with education or experience requirements that had to be met by the effective date of the regulations (September 1, 1992) or by a specified later date. To the previous Federal requirements, we added at §493.1483(b)(4) a current work experience requirement that had to be met by September 1, 1992, which was applicable to those individuals who received their cytotechnology training and acquired their work experience prior to January 1, 1969. At §493.1483(b)(5), we added a new provision requiring current work experience by September 1, 1993, in addition to requiring on or before September 1, 1994, that individuals either complete their cytotechnology training in an approved school or be certified in cytotechnology by an organization approved by HHS. II. Revisions to the Rules We have now determined that we did not provide sufficient time for cytotechnologists to meet current standards. Without prior notification, the February 28, 1992 rule required individuals, who obtained their education and training prior to January 1, 1969, 6 months to acquire 2 years of current work experience. Also, individuals, who trained outside of the United States, were given 1 year and 6 months to fulfill the requirement of 2 years for current work experience in the United States. Therefore, we are revising the dates originally published in the February 28, 1992 rule at §493.1483(b) (4) and (5) concerning personnel requirements for cytotechnologists who qualified under Federal regulations and for individuals who trained outside of the United States. Based on public concern and our analysis of anticipated availability of qualified individuals, we are revising our regulations to allow all individuals 2 full years from September 1, 1992, the effective date of our personnel requirements, to gain the necessary experience to qualify under the regulations. Accordingly, in §493.1483(b)(4), we are revising the date from September 1, 1992 to September 1, 1994, to enable a previously qualified cytotechnologist to continue working without interruption and obtain the necessary work experience. In §493.1483(b)(5)(i), we are similarly revising the date from September 1, 1993 to September 1, 1994 to allow an individual trained outside the United States and an individual who does not meet the other qualification standards an opportunity to obtain the 2 years of slide examination experience within the United States. As a technical revision to our rules, we note that §493.1483(b)(5)(ii) provides that an individual qualifying as a cytotechnologist must, on or before September 1, 1994, have either graduated from a school of cytotechnology approved by the CAHEA or be certified by an organization approved by the Department. It is possible that the CAHEA may cease to function as an accrediting organization before the Department has recognized any alternative certifying organization. In order to prevent the possibility that individuals will not have 2 full years to be certified by an approved certifying organization, we are extending the date from September 1, 1994 to September 1, 1995. This will allow time for the Department to recognize organizations that certify cytology personnel and minimize the loss of currently employed individuals at a time when there is an existing shortage of qualified cytology personnel. We are also making a conforming change to §493.1483(b)(1) to provide that a school of cytotechnology must be accredited by CAHEA ``or other organization approved by HHS.'' III. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay of Effective Date We ordinarily publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register and invite public comment on proposed requirements. The notice of proposed rulemaking includes a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms and substances of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. This procedure can be waived, however, if an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rule issued.
