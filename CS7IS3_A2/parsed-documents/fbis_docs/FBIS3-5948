FBIS3-5948 "dreas049_c_94011" FBIS-EAS-94-049 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Mar 1994 North Korea GFTUK Urges South Workers To Demand Pay Hike SK1203222894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1518 GMT 12 Mar 94 SK1203222894 Pyongyang KCNA Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea [GFTUK] issued an appeal to the South Korean workers today concerning the existence of the workers which is now in a grave crisis due to the South Korean authorities' anti-popular labour policy and wage-curbing move. The appeal charges that the Kim Yong-sam regime has been brandishing the sword of fascist dictatorship against the workers, branding their just struggle for the right to live and democracy as "collective egoism". It says: Imposing "sharing of hardships" upon the working masses, the traitor Kim Yong-sam, puppet, cut the yearly wage hike rate at below 3 percent and is making no scruples of fascist crackdown on the labor movement by invoking even the ill-named "emergency arbitration power" of the period of "Yusin" dictatorship to curb the struggle for a higher pay. He has lifted to more than 3,000 million dollars, the largest ever, the burden share for the maintenance of the U.S. occupation forces in South Korea and increased the military spendings for the first year of his office to more than 10,000,000 million won, or up 9.6 percent from the previous year, while suppressing the workers' just demand for a higher pay at the point of the bayonet. The appropriations of the puppet government's "budget" for the socalled "welfare of the working people" account for a meager one 300th of the military expenditures. The miserable living conditions of the labouring masses including workers cannot be improved, nor can the outrageous deeds of the employers be removed as long as such dastardly traitor, dirty turncoat and disgusting political prostitute Kim Yong-sam the traitor is left in power in South Korea. The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a trickster as cunning and shameful as an old fox is now is preaching "compromise" on one hand and trying on the other to weaken your strength through ruthless suppression and "ameriolation". There should be no compromise with the clique of traitors. No compromise, no hesitation, no submission is the way for you to win in the struggle for a higher pay and the right to live. The enemy pouncing upon you with a dagger between his clenched teeth must be fought back with a dagger. South Korean workers! The season of struggle has come. Rise daringly in the springtime struggle for a wage hike excel. Your demand will not be met through petitioning or negotiations. Kindle a fiercer flame of struggle to wreak the pentup rancour of the forerunners who fell in struggle and to save the people from distress! Rise up like mountains and demonstrate the strong mettle of the working class! You workers in South Korea must develop your struggle for wage hike into an anti-U.S. struggle for independence and an anti-fascist struggle for democracy if you are to lead a life worthy of human being in a genuinely independent and peaceful world. Fight it out to bring down a stern sledge hammer on the head of the Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors and establish a true independent democratic regime in South Korea!
