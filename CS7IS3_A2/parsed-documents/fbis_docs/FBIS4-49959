Statistics show that the 45 large reservoir areas directly administered by the provincial government generated 530 million yuan in industrial and agricultural output value last year, compared with 360 million yuan in 1990. The per capita net income of local residents also increased drastically. Most of the farmers living in the reservoir areas have now gotten enough to eat and wear. While earmarking more money to support construction of basic facilities, such as farmland and water-control works to improve production and living conditions for local farmers, the provincial government has also adopted measures to encourage farmers in the above-mentioned areas to turn rich resources into economic advantages. Local farmers have now established many cash forest areas, fish ponds, fenced streams for breeding fish, and bases for growing edible fungus, while making active efforts to set up numerous industrial businesses compatible with these bases. Such efforts have begun to pay off. With more money in hand, farmers in the reservoir areas in turn have started to pursue more and better cultural activities.
