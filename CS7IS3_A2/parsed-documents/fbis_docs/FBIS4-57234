This ship anchored in Lirquen to load 3,000 tons of fishmeal. [Begin Lirquen Customs Official Rene Lobos recording] The ship left at 0130 and is now sailing around Lirquen Bay. [end recording] The two sailors who defected have been identified as Orlando Mayo Lopez, physician, and Wilfredo Falaro Escandon, cook. They both come from Havana and arrived last night, at approximately 2200, at the Investigative Police station in Concepcion. [Begin Concepcion Investigative Police Official Oscar Barra recording] What they want is for Chilean authorities to help them travel to Miami, where they have some relatives and job opportunities. [Unidentified reporter] Are they asking for political asylum? [Barra] That is more or less what they want, but they do not know the legal term. [end recording] The two Cubans remain at the Investigative Police station as guests and have refused, so far, to meet with the media. They are awaiting the decision of administrative authorities. [Begin Regional Ministry Secretariat General of the Government Ariel Duffan recording] According to preliminary investigations and to what they are requesting, they are not entitled to political asylum because they are not being persecuted for political reasons, and they have not committed any crime that would entitle them to be granted political asylum. [end recording] The captain of the Cuban ship Primer Congreso del Partido has been identified as Manuel Fuentes Sainz. It is uncertain, however, when the Cuban ship will leave the port of Lirquen, because in addition to the two sailors that have defected, it has engine problems. A third Cuban citizen also defected from his ship anchored in Iquique. The sailor from the Cuban ship Olguin, who has been identified as Alay Gimenez, escaped in Iquique and requested asylum. Interior Under Secretary Belisario Velasco said that the situation of the three Cubans who have requested political asylum in Chile is being assessed. Velasco said that Interpol would be consulted before any decision is made.
