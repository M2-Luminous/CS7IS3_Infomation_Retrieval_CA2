In an interview with AL-AHRAM to be published tomorrow, Friday, the interior minister disclosed that the security agencies managed to frustrate the scheme beforehand, after seizing faxed instructions from abroad found in the possession of the 25 terrorists arrested last Sunday. Al-Alfi added that the dreadful scheme sought to terrify the public by carrying out a number of terrorist operations such as blowing up a considerable number of recreation grounds, cinemas, and theaters and assassinating a number of public figures. In the interview, al-Alfi reveals that large amounts of money, estimated at thousands of dollars, were found in the possession of the members of this new terrorist organization, which belongs to the "Islamic Group," who were involved in recent attempts to blow up banks. The money was being used to finance their operations. Al-Alfi added that large amounts of material used in making high- explosive charges were discovered in hideouts in Asyut and Cairo. Sent from abroad, the material contained new substances that were to be used for the first time and were to be set off by remote control to cause the largest possible explosions.
