The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said corporate acquisitions of land for new factories in 1993 decreased 33.8 percent from the year before to 1,634 cases, the lowest since 1979. The total tract of land acquired for new plants also dropped 28.7 percent to 2,290 hectares, the ministry said. The ministry said the report was based on a survey of corporate purchases of land for new factories, covering 1,000 square meters or more. Citing another survey conducted last fall on capital investment plans, the ministry predicted the sluggish trend will continue in 1994. The ministry said land acquisitions decreased in most regions covered in the survey.
