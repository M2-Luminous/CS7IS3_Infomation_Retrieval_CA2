The government sent its commentary on the Mazowiecki report to the participants of the 50th session of the UN Human Rights Commission being held in Geneva from January 31 to March 11. The illegal grouping republic of Kosovo is trying to set up a parallel state apparatus and power structure with the open intention of separating the province from Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. "In line with the norms of international law this must be treated as illegal activity jeopardizing the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the country in which the minority lives," the commentary states. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and Metohija reject the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia and have at an illegal assembly adopted the constitution of the so-called republic of Kosovo. The Albanian minority organized a referendum on secession with the aim of forming a parallel system of power. The so-called Ministry of Defense of the "republic of Kosovo," is particularly active, it has war plans, organizes the formation and training of military units, keeps evidence of draftees, has an agreement on the purchase of arms and military equipment from abroad, the Yugoslav Government stresses. That is why a group suspected of preparing an armed uprising was arrested in September and October 1993. The group was led by Hajzer Hajzeraj, who was declared defense minister, and Ejup Dragaj, the so-called deputy defense minister. The objective of the action was to maintain its sovereign authority over the entire territory of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Government stated. Commenting the part of Mazowiecki's report related to the rights of ethnic Albanians, Human Rights Federal Minister Margit Savovic assessed Monday that the report insists on the "mistreatment of Albanians" ignoring their separatist activities. Searches conducted in Albanian houses in Kosovo and Metohija are put on the same level as mines planted in Serb houses in Croatia, and no mention is made of the large quantities of weapons which were discovered by the police during these searches, Savovic says.
