FR940314-2-00031 FR940314-2-00014 Initiation of Investigation The Department has examined the petition on steel wire rod from Germany and found that it complies with the requirements of section 702(b) of the Act. Therefore, in accordance with section 702 of the Act, we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determine whether manufacturers, producers or exporters of steel wire rod receive countervailable subsidies. The following programs are included in our investigation. 1. ``RÃ¼ckzahlungsverpflichten'' (RZVs) 2. Government Assumption of Debt 3. Debt Forgiveness by Private Banks 4. Worker Assistance under the European Coal and Steel Community's Article 56(2)(b). We are not including the following program which was alleged to be benefiting producers of the subject merchandise in Germany. The Government of Saarland's Capital Contribution to DHS of DM 145.1 Million Petitioners alleged that a DM 145.1 million payment by the Government of Saarland (GOS) constitutes a countervailable equity infusion. Petitioners base this allegation on their claim that the shares which the GOS received in exchange for this payment had a value of only DM 82.5 million, DM 62.5 million less than what the GOS paid. The question of whether this transaction constitutes a countervailable equity infusion was addressed in Certain Hot Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From Germany (58 FR 6233, January 27, 1993). The Department determined that the funds were provided on terms consistent with commercial considerations because at the same time that the GOS invested, two private investors also invested in DHS on the same terms. Petitioners have provided no new information in this petition indicating that this determination was incorrect. Therefore, the Department does not intend to re-investigate whether the investment was consistent with commercial considerations. ITC Notification Pursuant to section 702(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of this initiation. Preliminary Determinations By the ITC The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that a United States industry is being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of steel wire rod imports from Germany. If the ITC makes a negative determination, we will terminate this proceeding; otherwise, the investigation will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b). Dated: March 4, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
