Our political correspondent Udi Segal reports: [Begin Segal recording] This round of multilateral economic talks being held in Rabat, Morocco will focus on new proposals on regional economics in transportation, agriculture, and tourism. The Israeli delegation, led by Bank of Israel Governor Ya'aqov Frenkel and Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir left for Morocco this morning. The delegation will discuss implementation of European plans, such as the establishment of a joint tourism Riviera between Jordan, Egypt, and Israel on the Red Sea. Within that framework, there are plans to open the Jordanian-Israeli border to tourism and to linking the transportation and electricity infrastructures along the coastline. Fourteen Arab states -- including the PLO -- and 25 states outside the region -- including the United States, Japan and the EU -- are participating in the fifth round of economic multilaterals. A Foreign Ministry delegation headed by 'Oded 'Eran, assistant director general in charge of economics, was in Morocco last week to prepare the meeting with the Moroccans. The Foreign Ministry believes that progress along the bilateral track will permit progress in the Rabat talks and along the Jordanian track. Other political-economic activity is being conducted by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres himself, who left for Luxembourg this morning to attend a meeting of the European Council of Ministers. Peres is trying to persuade the ministers to reword the economic accord between Israel and the EU. [end recording]
