The decision was made at the agency's governing board meeting held in Kyoto with representatives from 22 countries of the 24 member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) attending. Russia has asked for IEA assistance in the field of energy since last year. Meeting participants agreed that the agency should draw up a concrete program together with Russia in the form of a document, although the paper will have no legal binding force. The assistance will include providing energy conservation technology, research and statistics methods regarding energy supply and demand, and technology for developing alternative energy sources, the sources said. In addition, the participants discussed how IEA member nations will share the financial burden of helping Russia with nuclear power plant operations, which Russia has also requested, the sources said. They also agreed that the IEA and the OECD will continue to cooperate in the area of technology development for global environmental protection. The IEA meeting is the first in 16 years Japan has hosted. On Thursday, the Japanese Government and IEA will hold a seminar to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the IEA's inauguration. Robert Hawke, former Australian prime minister, and Brent Scowcroft, former U.S. presidential assistant, will take part in the seminar which focuses on the IEA's long-term strategy.
