Participants in the environment congress for Asia and the Pacific (Eco Asia `94), under way in Omiya outside Tokyo, also include delegates from the Asian Development Bank and 10 other international organizations. The conference participants are discussing recent global trends for sustainable development, in keeping with decisions made at the 1992 earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. The theme of that summit was "Ecologically Sustainable Development." Indonesian Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmaja, the keynote speaker, said the political and economic basis for resolving environmental issues should be radically altered in the region, which contains more than half the world's population and is undergoing rapid urbanization and economic growth. But a Chinese delegate said prices for the region's primary products are low and growth can now only be guaranteed if the region's resources are used to excess. The Chinese delegate said this can only be remedied if developed countries cooperate by supplying funds and technology to developing countries. A Canadian delegate recommended devising targets for the preservation or improvement of the environment, while a delegate from the United Nations University suggested the setting up of a center for the supply of information on the environment and technology. On Wednesday, delegates will discuss a long-term outlook for the region, strategies to cope with urbanization, and cooperation among regional government authorities and agencies.
