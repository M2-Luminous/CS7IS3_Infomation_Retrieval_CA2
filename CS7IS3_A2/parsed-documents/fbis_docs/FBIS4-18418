What is your reaction? [Haberer] I was very surprised at this sudden change. In November 1993, the prime minister asked me repeatedly to take on the presidency of Credit National, and wrote to me that: "The government wishes to call on you to preside over this establishment. This is an important mission for a person who is capable of guiding Credit National in the future." This affair brings together all the elements characteristic of an abuse of power because the state, which does not hold one share in Credit National, has nothing to rebuke me for in my management at the head of this bank. It accords itself the power to punish the head of one bank for reasons which are to found in another. This is the first time such a thing has happened and could constitute an interesting case of jurisprudence for the Council of State. I ask myself: Was not my fate sealed from the time of my appointment? All this is unseemly. Credit National is a prestigious business, with an outstanding team, and it is regrettable that the state should interfere in its management because of the political climate. This demonstrates a harmful lack of concern for this 100-percent privately owned company which, in the competitive world in which it lives, needs stability. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What reasons have you been given for your dismissal? [Haberer] When I asked for explanations, I was told that media pressure on Credit Lyonnais was such that I should withdraw from Credit National. I find this very worrying for democracy and for the government's authority. Another explanation I was given was that Credit Lyonnais' losses were higher than the public authorities thought. This is wrong. Before succeeding me, Jean Peyrelevade carried out an audit and wrote to the prime minister informing him of the bank's situation and of the provisions which would have to be set up. On the day the government appointed me, it was perfectly aware of this situation. Moreover the results published last week conform exactly with those announced in that letter. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What is your reaction to Credit Lyonnais' results and its restructuring plan? [Haberer] It is an excellent plan. For me, Jean Peyrelevade is a skillful negotiator who has defended the bank's interests to the best of his ability, and I would never have been able to obtain as much as he has from the government. With hindsight, I also tell myself that I should have used the same method on my arrival at Credit Lyonnais in 1988. At that time, the shortfall in provisions for risks was higher than the bank's shareholders' equity. If I had put Credit Lyonnais into the red, I would later have been considered a savior. But I took a different approach, by gradually making good this lack of provisions and by strengthening the bank's equity through financial operations with the public shareholder. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Even so, you have left Credit Lyonnais in a difficult situation. [Haberer] When you use figures, you must place them in their right context, in particular against the background of a purge. One cannot say -- as some have not hesitated to -- that Credit Lyonnais is in a state of quasi-bankruptcy when the 6.9 billion francs [Fr] of losses represent no more than 7 to 8 percent of the Fr85 billion of shareholders' equity. This situation is incomparably less serious than that of banks which everyone knows have lost all their equity. In the same way, when one talks of the Fr20, 30, or even 40 billion of property loans which will be transferred within the scope of the streamlining operation, this should be seen in the context of the Fr2,000 billion of the bank's total balance sheet. If these figures had been used in the right context, taking into account Credit Lyonnais' size, they would not have had anywhere near the same meaning. A few years ago two private banks, Barclays and Citibank, posted losses which were proportionally larger than those of Credit Lyonnais. Their top managers are still there and the banks are in a better situation. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Risk monitoring nonetheless does not appear to have been Credit Lyonnais' strong point. [Haberer] It is true, but internal controls exist at Credit Lyonnais as they do elsewhere, and I was very much concerned with strengthening them. For example, I reformed the bank's internal audit department, its methods, and its management. I also created a centralized control function, as no consolidated control body existed to centralize the risks relating to the same customer at Credit Lyonnais' 100 or so subsidiaries. To emphasize the importance of this function, I installed it in the general directorate. Finally, I created a participation committee: Every time a significant investment was made in a business, a file was prepared, which ended up on my desk. But control can never be perfect, as there are procedures and the people who apply these procedures. At Credit Lyonnais, as in all major groups, fiefdoms exist which can block these mechanisms. I recognize that there were defects in the monitoring of certain of our French and foreign subsidiaries, and that it takes time to detect and correct these. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What share of the responsibility are you prepared to accept for Credit Lyonnais' difficulties? [Haberer] As the president, it is natural that I am in the front line. I will not go into details on the major cases for which I am being reproached, but a certain, not insignificant, number were not begun while I was president. But I would point out that the major goal of my strategy -- both the bank for industry and the European bank -- are in no way the cause of the bank's difficulties. This second direction, which is extremely profitable in the long term, has moreover been maintained by my successor. My main mistake is not to have seen the crisis coming nor to have estimated its size. From that standpoint, I am also in pretty good company. And then Credit Lyonnais has not always had the managers which its strategy required. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] Some people are maintaining that you did not always cooperate as you should have with the Treasury and the Banking Commission. [Haberer] Not cooperating with these two bodies is inconceivable! Every time the Treasury or the Banking Commission asked for explanations or documents, I sent them. Moreover, as a public bank, Credit Lyonnais submits all its accounts, quarter by quarter, to its supervising authority, that is the Treasury. As for the Banking Commission, it is finicky, but it is effective and offers good advice. [LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES] What do you mean when you affirm that you received recommendations from the government until March 1993? [Haberer] Pierre Beregovoy believed that it behoved a public bank like Credit Lyonnais to support the growth of French companies. There was no particular request with respect to specific cases, but a desire for backing in his campaign to support growth and employment. I complied with his wishes, which became more urgent when the recession began in 1991. I believe that I can say that many corporate customers appreciated Credit Lyonnais' dynamic approach.
