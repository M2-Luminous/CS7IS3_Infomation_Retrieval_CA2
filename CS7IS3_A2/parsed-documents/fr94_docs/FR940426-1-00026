FR940426-1-00026 FR940426-1-00004 To prevent distribution participants from facilitating a rights offering by creating the appearance of demand for the rights, paragraph (d) of Rule 10b&hyph;8 restricts bids for and purchases of rights. 104 Nevertheless, the restrictions apply only in two situations: 104 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8(d). Purchases of the underlying securities remain subject to Rule 10b&hyph;6. See Paragraph (a)(4)(ix). (1) When the price of the security underlying the rights is being stabilized; or (2) When any syndicate member, dealer-manager, soliciting dealer, or other distribution participant has purchased rights, as principal, without having sold the underlying securities obtainable upon exercise (i.e., when any member of the syndicate has a net long position in the underlying security, assuming the exercise of all rights owned by the syndicate members). 105 Otherwise, there is no restriction on the price or manner in which the rights may be purchased. Where the restrictions are applicable, the amount of rights that a distributor or syndicate may purchase is limited to those necessary to acquire the securities the distributor or syndicate has previously sold or reasonably expects to be able to sell within five business days after the expiration of the rights. 106 105 Accordingly, the restrictions on rights purchases do not apply to distribution participants who purchase rights to cover an existing short position in the underlying securities. There are certain exceptions from the restrictions that are analogous to the exceptions in Rule 10b&hyph;6. See 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8(d). 106 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8(d)(7). Rule 10b&hyph;8 also limits the price at which the underlying securities, or securities of the same class and series, may be offered or sold during the rights offering. 107 The sales price is based upon the last sale price by the manager of the distribution or by a price set by that manager. Such price may be set from time to time, but an offering price set in any day may not be increased more than once during such day. The rule's restrictions on sales are designed to address the relationship that exists between the rights and the underlying security, and are intended to prevent distribution participants from offering the underlying security at steadily increasing prices, which could affect the market price of the underlying security and enhance the attractiveness of the rights. Because a distribution participant may buy rights to the extent such rights are needed to acquire securities that were previously sold, the sales price restriction on the underlying security may limit the size of the participant's short position, in turn controlling that participant's rights purchasing activity. 108 107 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;8(b). 108 Because purchases of rights may have the effect of increasing the price of the underlying security (e.g., non-distribution participant arbitrage sellers of rights would hedge by purchasing the underlying security), restrictions on the price at which the underlying security may be sold reduces any indirect effect on the underlying security through the purchase of rights. Although the rule does not regulate directly the size of the short position in the underlying security, it may do so indirectly to the extent that it becomes economically impractical for a participant in the rights offering to sell the underlying security at prices below the total acquisition cost of the rights plus the exercise price. Question 3.1. To what extent have changes in the securities markets and underwriting practices affected the manner in which rights offerings are conducted? Question 3.2. Is it necessary or appropriate to have anti-manipulation regulation of rights offerings or calls for redemption of convertible securities? If regulation continues to be appropriate, how should it be structured? Who should be covered? Question 3.3. Should transactions in the rights continue to be subject to restrictions and, if so, in what manner? Is the existing distinction between persons with a long position in the underlying security and those with a short position appropriate, i.e., is there greater or lesser incentive to manipulate based on positions in the underlying security? Should limitations be placed on the volume of rights purchases? Commenters should consider the manner in which purchasing rights may facilitate the distribution of the underlying security. Question 3.4. Should sales of the underlying security and related securities during a rights offering continue to be subject to restrictions and, if so, in what manner? Question 3.5. To what extent do the following considerations affect rights offering practices, and can or should any of these factors be taken into account as a means to simplify any continued regulation of these offerings: (a) The risks assumed by the persons participating in the rights offering; (b) The existence or extent of a discount in the rights exercise price to the market price of the security; or (c) The timing of the exercise of rights? 109 Are there any other relevant factors to be considered in the treatment of these offerings? 109 For example, it has been noted that, from an economic perspective, shareholders tend to delay their decision regarding whether to exercise rights until just before the rights expire. See, e.g., E. Bloch, Inside Investment Banking 173 (1986).
