FBIS4-10664 "drlat073_a_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Caribbean Cuba New Plan Reportedly Bans Free Sale of Medicines New Plan Reportedly Bans Free Sale of Medicines PA1404204494 Paris AFP in Spanish 1643 GMT 14 Apr 94 PA1404204494 Paris AFP Spanish BFN [By Alfredo Munoz-Unsain] [Text] Havana, 14 Apr (AFP) -- The free sale of medicines, with the sole exception of oral contraceptives, will be banned in Cuba, according to a drastic plan drafted by the Public Health Ministry which AFP managed to read. A document entitled "Plan for the Improvement of the National Medicine Program" also indicates that aspirin and six other home remedies usually found in first aid kits will only be sold by minimal annual quotas and not in any pharmacy. Each Havana resident will be entitled to 40 aspirins each year, with one-quarter of the total to be distributed every three months. Rural residents will be able to cure fewer migraines, because they will only be allotted five aspirins per trimester. An aromatic balsam and another balsam used as an inhalant, three skin disinfectants, and sodium bicarbonate complete the seven medicines that may be purchased without prescription, but only at the pharmacy closest to home. Quotas assigned to each family are usually minimal: 30 grams of ointments and balsams and three small bottles of disinfectant for external use each year. In comparison, the yearly quota for bicarbonate per family seems to be more generous: 160 grams. Should they be available at pharmacies, another 64 medicines, which used to be freely sold, will now be available under medical prescription, but will be under multiple controls established by new regulations issued by the Public Health Ministry. These 64 medicines to be sold only by prescription involve a visit to a doctor and a visit to the pharmacy later. The inevitable delay in obtaining some of these medicines (for example, Kaoenterin, a diarrhea suppressant) will place ill persons in embarrassing situations. It seems that an equally deplorable possibility, but the opposite situation, will be created by the need to buy laxatives and ointments by prescription to relieve hemorrhoids under prescription. A similar labyrinth will face those who will undoubtedly have to urgently buy lotions to combat head lice and "crab lice" [pediculos pubis] (pediculosis). Other medicines that must be sold by prescription are: antacids, antihistamines, febrifuges, antimycotics [antimicoticos], digestive medicines, vitamins, hydrogen peroxide, and distilled water for shots. The Public Health Ministry deemed as obsolete the active elements [principios activos) of 21 medicines that were eliminated, including milk of magnesia and lime flowers. It also added a list of medicines that are available in Cuba such as garlic syrup, pumpkin emulsion, guava powder, onion creme, fennel tincture, cress sachets, polen capsules, and various kinds of phyto-medicines. It also notes that an oral home serum (water, sugar, salt, and lemon drops) is also available for dehydration cases.
