FR940407-2-00018 FR940407-2-00011 Weighting As in previous price determinations, the Department used the average spot and long-term volumes of U.S. utility and domestic supplier purchases, as reported by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), to weight the spot and long-term components of the observed price. However, with the publication of EIA's 1992 Uranium Industry Annual, we have used purchase data from the period of 1989&hyph;1992, rather than 1988&hyph;1991. During this period, the spot market accounted for 31.39 percent of total purchases, and the long-term market for 68.61 percent. Calculation Announcement The Department determined, using the methodology and information described above, that the observed market price is $11.37. This reflects an average spot market price of $9.91, weighted at 31.39 percent, and an average long-term contract price of $12.04, weighted at 68.61 percent. Since this price is below the $13.00/lb. minimum expressed in Appendix A of the agreements, there will be no quota under Section IV.A. of the agreements available to any signatory republic for the period April 1, 1994 to September 30, 1994. Comments Consistent with the Department's letters of interpretation dated February 22, 1993, we provide interested parties our preliminary price determination on March 10, 1994. We received no comments. Allowing for additional information received since March 10, we have determined that the observed market price for uranium is $11.37/lb. The Department invites parties to provide pricing information for use in the next price determination. Any such information should be provided for the record and should be submitted by September 5, 1994. Dated: April 1, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
