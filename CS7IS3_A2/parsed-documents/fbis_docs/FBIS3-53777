Dr. Faraj met the Kerman governor general on Sunday [2 January] and said that in view of the many common denominators between Iran and Egypt and past cultural ties, cordial relations between the two countries could foster bilateral cooperation in the industrial and agricultural fields. He expressed the hope that by forging ties with Iran, Egypt could further expand its relations with the Central Asian countries. He announced that Egyptian investors were willing to upgrade economic relations with Iran. Kerman Governor General Seyyed Hoseyn Mar'ashi elaborated on the potential resources of Kerman Province especially with regard to agricultural production in pistachios, dates, citrus fruits, and in the mineral industries. It is worth mentioning that in the past few years, the Egyptian Government has made extensive efforts to eliminate obstacles in the path of relations with Iran. The Egyptian regime's desire for relations with Iran stems from the fact that the Islamic Revolution of Iran has emerged as a model and a legend in the minds of Egypt's revolutionary youth. By establishing relations with Iran, the cradle of the Islamic Revolution, Egypt will strive to shatter this pattern and legend and to harm it. Of course, in conjunction with these efforts, the Egyptian Government continues to express its malice and hostility from time to time and to level accusations against Iran. The Egyptian Government also continues to instigate the regional governments of the Persian Gulf against the Islamic Republic of Iran by pursuing active diplomacy in this regard.
