"To write and despatch a note will not take a long time, but we do not want to be hasty: the document should be impeccable from the point of view of the facts," a senior Foreign Ministry official told Interfax. "According to some information, 50 Japanese ships entered Russian territorial waters. This gives rise to the following question: Was it a "demonstration," and why were the ships driven out of our territorial waters, instead of being detained by Russian frontier guards?" Russia has no intention of staging a confrontation, the diplomat pointed out. "That is why we want to obtain an objective and full picture of what happened," he said. According to the official, the "incident" will undoubtedly be discussed, among other things, at the Russian-Japanese consultations to be held in Moscow in mid-February between the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Alexander Panov, and his Japanese counterpart, Hiroshi Fukuda. "It has been mutually agreed that the exact date of these consultations will be announced in Moscow and Tokyo on Tuesday, January 25," he noted.
