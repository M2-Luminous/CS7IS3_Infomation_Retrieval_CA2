The Polish Economic Consortium, established by the Bank of Industry and Commerce S.A. [BPH], Elektrim, Exbud, and Stalexport, is the first such strong economic group in Poland. The Consortium's chartering document was signed by president Janusz Quandt for the BPH, while Elektrim was represented by president Andrzej Marian Skowronski, Exbud by president Witold Zaraska, and Stalexport by president Ryszard Harhala. The main goal of this joint effort is a joint enterprise and the implementation of large economic plans of a material and capital nature, including, as was specifically noted in the signing of the charter, participation in the highway construction program. With these plans and undertakings, the consortium wants to play an active role in the transformation and restructuring of the Polish economy, taking into consideration the needs of healthy market competition. At the same time, the consortium intends to play a direct role in the process of privatizing the Polish economy by means of the purchase of state enterprises; it also intends to create new economic entities and to undertake proexport activities and developmental ventures. It will also be an active participant in the capital market, acting to secure and administer Polish and foreign capital. The consortium also intends to be involved in the restructuring and remodeling of Polish enterprises, including in management. The task of the consortium is also the creation and management of economic entitities, the undertaking of investment activity--it is essential that this latter point include, above all, regions with high unemployment--and active entry into existing economic relationships. The consortium also intends to participate in the National Investment Funds--namely, in the program of mass privatization of state enterprises. The Polish Economic Consortium is not a holding company but only an accord, which does not mean, however, that, in the future, a holding company including these four economic entities will not be created. The consortium counts on the realization of an investment by the State Treasury; it is precisely this expectation that accounts for mention of participation in the construction program of Polish highways. The Bank of Commerce and Industry in Krakow, created in 1989 as one of the commercial banks that emerged from the National Bank of Poland [NBP], is one of the largest banks in Poland. In terms of the value of its own capital, it ranks sixth among Polish banks. It has a wide range of services in national and foreign sales and is an active participant in both the money and capital markets. The BPH cooperates with more than 80 banks worldwide, including the World Bank, Credit Lyonnais, Deutsche Bank, Barclays Bank, and the American Express Bank: The BPH's guarantees are honored by foreign financial institutions. Elektrim was privatized two years ago. In 1992 (1993's results are not yet balanced), sales increased more than 30 percent, while net profit increased by over 170 percent (tax liabilities were over Z762 billion). These positive tendencies, in spite of the continuing recession and unfavorable business outlook, also appeared in 1993. Elektrim is a shareholder in 18 companies in 11 countries. Exbud functions on the principles of, and in its organizational structure as, a holding company. It is made up of 29 companies in which Exbud holds the majority share, as well as five economic establishments and 11 foreign representations. In addition, Exbud has capital shares and also majority shares in 11 Polish and 10 foreign companies of a mixed nature. Stalexport is not only a traditional exporter of steel and metal products but also, for some time now, an investment firm, specializing in the tourist nature. The company is developing dynamically.
