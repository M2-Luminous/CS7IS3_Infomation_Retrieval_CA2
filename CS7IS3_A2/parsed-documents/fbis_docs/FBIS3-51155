After learning that different sectors of the country support Villarzu's views, Hales stated that it would be advisable to include appropriations for the Armed Forces in the National Budget. "Nobody is seeking to deprive the Armed Forces of its financing, rather that it should come from a more legitimate source," he added. The mining minister explained that the allotments derived from the Reserved Law on Copper (No. 13196) -- which came into effect during the military regime -- totalled $313 million in 1989, $287 million in 1990, $223 million in 1991, $204 million in 1992, and $197 million in 1993. He noted that as last year's allotment was lower than the $180 million minimum contemplated in the law plus the Consumer Price Index readjustment, the total for 1993 will be $210 million. "The National Treasury will have to supplement the minimum payment with $30 million. This financial obligation will not be defrayed by Codelco but by the National Treasury," he said.
