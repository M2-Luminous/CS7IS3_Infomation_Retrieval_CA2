FR940425-0-00025 FR940425-0-00017 47 CFR Part 43 [CC Docket No. 93&hyph;5; FCC 94&hyph;84] Elimination or Revision of Certain Reporting Requirements for Communication Common Carriers and Certain Affiliates AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted a Report and Order (``Order'') eliminating the requirement that common carriers file pension and benefits documents. The Order also revises the revenue threshold for certain affiliates to file the Securities and Exchange Commission Annual Form 10&hyph;K reports with the FCC. The FCC issued this Order to fulfill its obligation to review reporting requirements as they meet current regulatory needs. The change will result in savings to the public by reducing industry reporting burdens and to the Commission by reducing the cost of processing these filings and maintaining them in storage. EFFECTIVE DATES: July 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kenneth M. Ackerman, Federal Communications Commission, Accounting and Audits Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Washington, DC 20554, (202) 634&hyph;1861. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This is a summary of the Commission's Report and Order, CC Docket No. 93&hyph;5, adopted April 7, 1994, and released April, 1994. The full text of this Commission's decision is available to inspect and copy during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (room 231), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The full text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, ITS, Inc. 2100 M Street NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. In the Order, the Commission eliminates Section 43.42, Reports on pensions and benefits that communications common carriers with annual revenues of $100 million or more file with this Commission. Because the laws that provide for the oversight of pension plans and the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to pension have brought about a greater degree of uniformity in the process of estimating and accounting for pension and benefit costs, the Commission has concluded that there is no need to require carriers to file the underlying details of their pension and benefits plans. The Commission can use the pension data currently being reported by the carriers in the Commission's Automated Reporting and Management Information System. In the Order the Commission revises Section 43.21(c) to require a communication common carrier that directly or indirectly controls any communication common carrier that has annual operating revenues in excess of $100 million to file the Securities and Exchange Commission Annual Report Form 10&hyph;K. The Commission concluded that there is no need to receive financial reports from a controlling company when the controlled communication common carrier does not have annual operating revenues in excess of $100 million. This revision raises the reporting threshold from $2.5 million to $100 million and makes the reporting threshold ยง43.21(c) consistent with other part 43 reporting requirements. Public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average one hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications Commission, Records Management Division, Paperwork Reduction Project (3060&hyph;0514), Washington, DC 20554 and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3060&hyph;0514), Washington, DC 20503.
