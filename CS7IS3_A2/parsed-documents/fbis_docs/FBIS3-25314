This morning everyone was ready for the resumption of the peace talks, which should now discuss the role of the UN Angola Verification Mission-3, including a UN contingent of blue beret forces. The UN special representative's team was the last to arrive, but it is already in Lusaka, and yesterday it met the leaders of the government and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] teams. All this happens at a time when UNITA President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, who is also Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] supreme commander, has expressed optimism and said he is ready for a political solution to the Angolan conflict. He expressed those views in interviews he granted to a Portuguese television station and to Portugal's O PUBLICO newspaper. UNITA said it favors a general cease-fire and asked Luanda to also make political concessions. In those interviews Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi rejected any possibility that there could be a military resolution to the Angolan conflict.
