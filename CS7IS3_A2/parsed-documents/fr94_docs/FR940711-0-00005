FR940711-0-00005 FR940711-0-00002 5 CFR Part 179 RIN 3206&hyph;AF29 Claims Collection Standards; Debt Collection Act of 1982: Salary Offset AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations to govern the collection of debts owed to OPM's administrative accounts by Federal employees. These regulations implement the debt collection procedures provided under the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act). The Act authorizes the Federal Government to collect debts by means of offset from the salaries of Federal employees without the employee's consent, provided that the employee is properly notified and given the opportunity to exercise certain administrative rights. OPM's collection of debts due the Retirement and Insurance Group for payment to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Employees' Life Insurance Fund, the Retired Federal Employees Health Benefits Fund, or the Employees' Health Benefits Fund is governed by other regulatory provisions. DATES: These regulations are effective July 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Anna Wilson, Chief, Financial Policy Division, Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), (202) 606&hyph;5075. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 5 of the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Act) Pub. L. 97&hyph;365) codified at 5 U.S.C. 5514, makes several changes in the way Executive and Legislative agencies collect debts owed the Government. The purpose of the Act is to improve the ability of the Government to collect monies owed it. Under the Act, when the head of an agency determines that an employee of any agency is indebted to the United States, or is notified by the head of another agency that an agency employee is indebted to the United States, the employee's debt may be offset against his/her pay. Before agencies may use the salary offset recovery procedure, certain due process rights must be extended to the debtor. Before the Government may collect a debt by salary offset, an employee-debtor must be provided with notice of the debt and the opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt, enter into a written repayment agreement, and request an impartial hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt. The employee must notify the agency of his/her intent to exercise these rights within the time period prescribed in the regulations. The Act requires agencies to issue regulations for salary offset. This final rule establishes the procedures the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will follow in making a salary offset. OPM has determined that this document is interpretative; it implements a definitive statutory scheme and the requirements contained in regulations promulgated by OPM, codified in 5 CFR part 550, subpart K. Accordingly, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A). In addition, because this rule relates to agency management and personnel, no Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2). For these reasons, a delayed effective date is not required pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(2). Analysis and Comments The Interim Rule was published in the Federal Register on November 19, 1993 (58 FR 60993). The comment period closed on January 18, 1994. Two labor organizations responded with comments. OPM has fully considered all of their comments. Section 179.201␣Purpose One commentor requested that we change the 10 years in the second sentence (i.e., the time allowed for commencing actions brought by the United States) to 6 years. They cited no basis for the request. Section 179.201 is based on 31 U.S.C. 3716 which precludes agencies from initiating offset to collect a debt more than 10 years after the Government's right to collect the debt first accrued, with certain exceptions explained in that section. Section 179.202␣Scope In response to a commenter, we corrected the reference ``Section 179.207, Notice Requirement'' to ``Section 179.207, Hearing.'' Section 179.206␣Notice Requirements Before Offset (a)(16) One commenter wished to insert ``with interest'' after the word ``employee'' in this sentence. While the Debt Collection Act of 1982 requires the assessment of interest, penalty fees, and administrative costs on delinquent debts as a means of strengthening enforcement of collections, it makes no provision to pay interest to the debtor for erroneous collections. OPM is not authorized to make such payments in the absence of a specific statute or authority. This reasoning applies also to the same comment regarding section 179.215 Refunds. Section 179.207␣Hearing Both commenters objected to the perceived inequity in treatment of parties who fail to appear (§179.207(j)). We have inserted the following language: *␣*␣* proceed with the hearing as scheduled and make his/her determination based upon the oral testimony presented and the documentary evidence submitted by both parties. With the agreement of both parties, the hearing official shall schedule a new hearing date. One commenter suggested several other changes to this section, §§179.208 and 179.209 but provided no bases for the changes. Since the regulation as published complies with requirements of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, the suggested changes were not made. Executive Order (E.O.) 12291, Federal Regulation OPM has determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.
