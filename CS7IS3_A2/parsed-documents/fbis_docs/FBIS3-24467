Mikushin: "We Are Relying on Ourselves"] [Text] Chelyabinsk--Several railroad managers have already spoken in GUDOK about the results of work last year and the beginning of this year, and analyzed results of the meeting between railroad employees and V. Chernomyrdin, the head of government. Our discussion on this topic today is with Ivan Pavlovich Vorobyev, chief of the South Urals Railroad. [Vorobyev] I will not repeat what has been said by my colleagues from other mainlines, but the situation in transport is really very serious. And this is directly linked with the overall economic crisis not only in Russia, but the CIS countries as well. I realize that the government and the parliament want very much to stabilize the economic situation in the country, but alas, there are no opportunities--primarily financial opportunities--for this. Last year we were given roughly 20 percent of the state subsidies needed. Judging by the results of the past 2 months, we cannot receive this now, either. [Mikushin] It appears that the government is counting on all sectors of the national economy to support themselves, including railroad transport. [Vorobyev] That is true to a certain extent. But I also know that the process of determining the most important and promising sectors which require state investments (and which are profitable for the country) is being continued. I do not think the government will leave the railroads without support. [Mikushin] What kind of specific assistance do you expect from the top? [Vorobyev] I have never believed that the ministry should be "milked" endlessly: give, they say, give here and give there... We can earn for ourselves, as the results of last year show. But the picture changed drastically beginning in November: the increase in federal and local taxes instantaneously "consumed" all our profit, more than 60 percent of which we gave to the budgets. Essentially, the state put the hen that lays golden eggs on starvation rations. All of us, both railroad workers and our clients, are being squeezed by nonpayments. We are owed about 120 billion rubles [R]. And we owe nearly R90 billion. It appears that the final result is in our favor, but what kind of benefit is this, and who benefits from it? Let us take the land tax as an example. Last year we paid about R70 billion for this. But why so much, we ask, if part of the transport service is unprofitable for us? We are meeting the local authorities halfway, but they are demanding more and more new deductions for their budget, at times without any consideration for the problems facing railroad workers. [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, would it not be better in this case to shut down a number of unpromising routes? Even if only to avoid losses. Then let the persons managing the oblasts and rayons decide whether they need the services of the railroad or not. [Vorobyev] I have had the same thought many times. Let us take the 200-kilometer Berdush-Druzhinino route. A pair of freight trains and the same number of passenger trains use this route daily. The same situation applies on the Miass-Uchaly section, where the daily traffic consists of just 30 railcars. On the railroad as a whole, there are about 1,500 kilometers of such unprofitable routes. Without receiving any incomes, we are still compelled to keep hundreds of people, locomotives, and railcars there and maintain service. Based on market conditions, routes such as these should be closed. But another question arises: what is to happen in this case to the people living in the towns, settlements, and villages along the mainline, where there is practically no other form of transportation? So we must think hard before making such a decision. And a few more words about taxes. The regions which have acquired a certain amount of economic independence are setting rent, as an example, for the same land that is called "from the lantern." In Kurgan we are paying the local budget R50 per square meter, in Magnitogorsk we are paying R27, in Beloretsk (Bashkiria) R10, and in Samara just R1 for the same area. Tell me, please, is there any logic here? What basis are the local authorities using in setting the prices for land? I will not dwell on the problems of passenger service, since my colleagues have already written about them sufficiently in GUDOK. I agree fully with their conclusions that losses cannot be covered just by raising the price of a ticket. This deprives us of competitiveness with other forms of transportation. I will stress once again: we need subsidies here both from the state (for long distances) and the local budgets--for suburban services. This is being done in all civilized countries, incidentally. [Mikushin] And just how do we resolve the nonpayment problem? By waiting for appropriate government decisions and the granting of credits? [Vorobyev] I have already stated. The minister does not have a bottomless pocket. We can and should earn for ourselves. As an example, this is the second year the railroad has been using the system of mutual credits, when a client settles accounts with us for transportation service with his products--metal scrap, lumber, machine tools, machinery, consumer goods, produce, and the like. We use some of these products for our own purposes, and some we sell at a profit for us through commercial structures. Another way is by developing subsidiary and ancillary activity. Over the past 2 months we have received over an additional R8 billion through this activity alone. You will agree this is a substantial addition. So Kurgan built its own construction shop at the locomotive depot, where they are turning out reinforced concrete collars for shafts, which are in high demand. In the Zlatoust and Orsk divisions, subunits of civil construction services have put flow lines into operation to make a special beam used in building cottages and garden houses. There is heavy demand for this material, especially since the buildings made with it are resistant to cold and heat and are fireproof. [Mikushin] Since we have mentioned construction, tell us how work in this area is proceeding on the railroad. [Vorobyev] I will proudly note that we hold the leading position in this indicator among Russian railroads. It is sufficient to say that last year we commissioned about 150,000 square meters of housing, which is substantially above the plan. The best results were achieved in the Kurgan, Chelyabinsk, and Orsk divisions. But housing construction in Orenburg has been cut back for several years, and the lines for apartments are increasing every year. I think the division managers are chiefly to blame for this. Now the question is: whether to cut back housing construction or to enlist railroad employees' personal funds for this. Unfortunately, there is no other way. [Mikushin] Ivan Pavlovich, our railroad has suddenly become a border railroad. Has this had an effect on the transportation process? [Vorobyev] Unquestionably it has. Six border crossings have already been established here, and each one has its own customhouse. Naturally, this has entailed changes in technology: additional structures are being established to receive freight and keep a record of railcar crossings. But the Petropavlovsk Division has turned out to be in another state's territory. Calculations are not made in rubles there, but Kazakh (tenge), which creates certain problems. Settlements are conducted at the existing exchange rate. We are trying to maintain businesslike, neighborly relations with Kazkhstan. I do not think it is in their or our interests to disrupt the operation of the Transsib and Turksib [branches of the Trans-Siberian Mainline]. The same may be said about refrigerated shipments, whose volume has been reduced by more than 30 percent. Previously, many dozens of our refrigerated units were found on railroads in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia. Today they are being returned in large numbers to their point of registration--the Troitsk Depot. We want to preserve at least some of them. [Mikushin] All the same, Ivan Pavlovich, will the railroad survive under such extraordinary conditions? [Vorobyev] The conditions are really extraordinary. I will cite just one example. Prevously the Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant unloaded 350 railcars per day. Today it unloads only 60. We used to give the "Uraltrak" Association 200 empty cars every day. Now it uses only two cars. And the same situation exists at most enterprises in the Urals. Incomes are falling, of course. But we do not plan to cut back either production or social programs. And it becomes very annoying when the local authorities put spokes in our wheels even in such an extremely difficult situation. For example, a very zealous property management committee from Miass, where there is a combined motor vehicle and rail terminal, is suddenly putting it up for auction after deciding to sell it to private interests. Why have the people in Miass suddenly forgotten that the railroad built the terminal with its own resources and funds? I direct our specialists' attention to the fact that they cannot remain idle in the situation today. They have to think about how and where to earn something additional and how to maintain high discipline on the railroad. Take the periods for paying wages, for example. The Kurgan and Petropavlovsk divisions are issuing money without delays, seeking every opportunity for this. But in Orsk, Zlatoust, and Kartaly, wage payments are being held up. All the same, I look to the future with optimism. The recession cannot continue forever. I hope the government will finally find a way out of the crisis.
