The State shall designate or create an identifiable State dislocated worker unit or office with the capabilities and functions identified in paragraph (b) of this section. Such unit or office may be an existing organization or new organization formed for this purpose (section 311(b)(2)). The State dislocated worker unit or office shall: (1) Make appropriate retraining and basic adjustment services available to eligible dislocated workers through substate grantees, and in statewide, regional or industrywide projects; (2) Work with employers and labor organizations in promoting labor-management cooperation to achieve the goals of this part; (3) Operate a monitoring, reporting, and management system to provide adequate information for effective program management, review, and evaluation; (4) Provide technical assistance and advice to substate grantees; (5) Exchange information and coordinate programs with the appropriate economic development agency, State education and training and social services programs; (6) Coordinate with the unemployment insurance system, the Federal-State Employment Service system, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and other programs under this chapter; (7) Receive advance notice of plant closings and mass layoffs as provided at section 3(a)(2) of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (29 U.S.C. 2102(a)(2) and part 639 of this chapter); (8) Immediately notify (within 48 hours) the appropriate substate grantees following receipt of an employer notice of layoff or plant closing or of any other information that indicates a projected layoff or plant closing by an employer in the grantee's substate area, in order to continue and expand the services initiated by the rapid response team (section 311(b)(3)(D)); (9) Fully consult with labor organizations where substantial numbers of their members are to be served; and (10) Disseminate throughout the State information on the availability of services and activities under Title III of the Act and this part. (b) Rapid response capability. The dislocated worker unit shall have one or more rapid response specialists, and the capability to provide rapid response assistance, on-site, for dislocation events such as permanent closures and substantial layoffs throughout the State. The State shall not transfer the responsibility for the rapid response assistance functions of the State dislocated worker unit to another entity, but the State may contract with another entity to perform rapid response assistance services. Nothing in this paragraph shall remove or diminish the dislocated worker unit's accountability for ensuring the effective delivery of rapid response assistance services throughout the State (section 311(b)(12)). (1) State rapid response specialists should be knowledgeable about the resources available through programs under this part and all other appropriate resources available through public and private sources to assist dislocated workers. The expertise required by this part includes knowledge of the Federal, State, and local training and employment systems; labor-management relations and collective bargaining activities; private industry and labor market trends; programs and services available to veterans; and other fields necessary to carry out the rapid response requirements of the Act. (2) The rapid response specialists should have: (i) The ability to organize a broad-based response to a dislocation event, including the ability to coordinate services provided under this part with other State-administered programs available to assist dislocated workers, and the ability to involve the substate grantee and local service providers in the assistance effort; (ii) The authority to provide limited amounts of immediate financial assistance for rapid response activities, including, where appropriate, financial assistance to labor-management committees formed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section; (iii) Credibility among employers and in the employer community in order to effectively work with employers in difficult situations; and (iv) Credibility among employee groups and in the labor community, including organized labor, in order to effectively work with employees in difficult situations. (3) The dissemination of information on the State dislocated worker unit's services and activities should include efforts to ensure that major employers, organized labor, and groups of employees not represented by organized labor, are aware of the availability of rapid response assistance. The State dislocated worker unit should make equal effort in responding to dislocation events without regard to whether the affected workers are represented by a union.
