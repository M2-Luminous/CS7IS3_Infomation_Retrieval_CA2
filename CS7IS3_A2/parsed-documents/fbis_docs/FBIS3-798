A man calling himself "Mabuto" telephoned SAPA at 7.15am and said Azanla was behind "the attack". When asked if he meant the attack at Mdantsane's Baha'i centre, near East London, he said: "That's right". He said he was telephoning from the Eastern Cape but when pressed for further information, the caller said he was "in a rush". Three men were killed in an apparently racially motivated attack by gunmen who burst into the centre, lined them up against a wall and then shot them dead in cold blood. SAPA could not independently verify the authenticity of the call.
