He said that its program could be seriously changed by the death in the family of the U.S. President. Despite this, it is envisaged that the first day of the talks will have a bilateral Czech-U.S. character, while the second day of the visit will be devoted to consultations with representatives of other Visegrad countries. As to the much discussed question of our relation toward NATO, Josef Zieleniec said: [Begin Zieleniec recording] The fact is that we are seriously discussing with our Western partners, and thus also with the United States, our future membership, and we are expecting a statement saying that NATO is an open alliance.
