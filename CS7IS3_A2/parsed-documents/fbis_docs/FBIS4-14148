The statement came following the response of Morocco to the Algerian diplomat's "vigorous and deluding" statements before the conference and after a Moroccan official source wondered whether the Algerian diplomat was expressing his own standpoint vis-a-vis the situation in the Sahara or that of his country which repeatedly claimed it was observing restraint regarding the Sahara issue. The ambassador had said that the present deadlock in the Sahara issue was due to "the hesitations of one of the two sides...while the Polisario [Popular Front for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] has always showed a high spirit of maturity". The Algerian source, quoted by the official news agency "APS" said the Algerian ambassador is plenipotentiary and was attending the conference as Algeria's official representative.
