Ltd., took up their scissors. Soon, three red flowers dropped onto a platter. After 38 years of unremitting efforts, XIZANG RIBAO, while marking its founding anniversary on 22 April, also said goodbye to its "lead and fire" history and ushered in a "light and electricity" era. From now on, both the Chinese and Tibetan editions of the XIZANG RIBAO will be typeset by laser, and the paper, like all other provincial-level papers in the country, has upgraded its typesetting with new technology. Danzim, a veteran XIZANG RIBAO newsman and deputy secretary of the regional party committee, expressed what was in the hearts of the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff. He said: "With the use of laser typesetting technology, the long-cherished dream of veteran newsmen has been realized, and the frontier areas' journalistic development has made one step forward." Representing the regional party committee and the regional people's government, Danzim warmly congratulated the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff and thanked the Beida and Fangzheng Groups for their unselfish assistance and energetic support. Lie Que, member of the regional party committee standing committee and secretary of the Lhasa Municipal Party Committee; Pucung, vice chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee; and Ga Jin, deputy political commissar of the Tibet Regional People's Armed Police Corps; as well as persons in charge of relevant departments, bureaus, committees, and offices in Tibet, leaders in charge of propaganda in various prefectures; and journalists of various news units in Lhasa, also came to XIZANG RIBAO to extend their congratulations. Gao Yanxiang, XIZANG RIBAO editor-in-chief, said excitedly: Although XIZANG RIBAO is the last newspaper in the country to begin using laser typesetting technology, the use of this technology has great significance. It represents a leap forward and a revolution in Tibet's newspaper publishing history. He added: The regional party committee and government set strict requirements for the laser typesetting project and always expressed interests in its progress. Despite financial restraints, planning, financial, banking, designing, and construction departments made sure that special funds for the project were available and the project was meticulously designed and installed. Postal, telecommunications, and power departments made positive efforts in coordinating our paper's normal publishing and distribution; civil air transport and the Lhasa Air Command [kong zhi 4500 2172] airlifted the machinery to Lhasa safely and in the quickest way possible; and newspapers and publishing units of central authorities and all provinces and municipalities gave us their warm encouragement and support. All this reflected the great importance which people of all walks of life inside and outside Tibet attached to XIZANG RIBAO's news reporting and propaganda; reflected the spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance; and reflected the warmth of our Motherland as a big family and the fraternal ties among people of all nationalities. Speaking on behalf of the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff, Gao Yanxiang pledged that the entire XIZANG RIBAO staff would continue to carry forward the spirit of waging arduous struggle, being ready to dedicate themselves, and working hard in unity in operating the newspaper. He said the XIZANG RIBAO staff will continue to emancipate their minds, press forward, and bring forth new ideas to create a good and stable environment for Xizang's spiritual and material construction. At yesterday's ribbon-cutting ceremony, Du Tai, deputy head of the regional party committee propaganda department; and Wang Yuchuan, vice chairman of the Beida and Fangzheng Groups and president of the Chengdu Fangzheng Electronics Corp. Ltd., also gave warm speeches. Following the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the leaders and visitors toured the laser typesetting room with great interest.
