The council had to content itself with a mere "appeal to all parties involved" to comply with their international obligations. Thus, any one-sidedness toward North Korea was avoided, the only "party involved" in the controversy that is suspected of noncompliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The UN secretary general, the U.S. secretary of state, the Japanese prime minister, and the South Korean president were told in Beijing that pressure on North Korea would only be "counterproductive." Russia agrees with China on this issue. Thus, China has backing for the political protection of North Korea in its conflict with the United States. North Korea is not isolated, which is what Washington and West Europe had hoped, but U.S. policy has been blocked in the same way as the United Nations itself. West Europe and Japan are neutralized in this constellation, France and Britain, the two West European veto and nuclear powers in the Security Council, have been outmaneuvered. If the United States, whose Defense Secretary Perry only recently stated that his country would even "wage a war" to prevent North Korean nuclear arms, is unable to enforce compliance with this treaty, North Korea will remain free to build nuclear bombs. It will even be able to pass them on to other countries, particularly the Middle East, thus receiving valuable foreign currency and initiating proliferation. In view of the hesitant and wavering U.S. policy, China and Russia, both of which are not interested in a nuclear buildup in North Korea, will take over mediating efforts in Asia, thus getting closer to their parallel objectives -- namely to force back Western influence.
