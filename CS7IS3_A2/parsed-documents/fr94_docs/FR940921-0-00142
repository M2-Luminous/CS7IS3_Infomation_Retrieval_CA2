D1945 4.0 Odorant 1 1The natural gas at ambient conditions must have a distinctive odor potent enough for its presence to be detected down to a concentration in air of not over 1/5 (one-fifth) of the lower limit of flammability. (2) Natural gas-fuel representative of commercial natural gas-fuel and which will be generally available through retail outlets shall be used in service accumulation. (3) Other natural gas-fuels may be used for testing and service accumulation provided: (i) They are commercially available; (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided to show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service; and (iii) Written approval from the Administrator of the fuel specifications must be provided prior to the start of testing. (4) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section shall be reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (f) Liquified petroleum gas-fuel. (1) Liquified petroleum gas-fuel used for exhaust and evaporative emission testing and in service accumulation shall be commercially available liquefied petroleum gas-fuel. (i) Manufacturers shall recommend the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation. (ii) The Administrator shall determine the liquefied petroleum gas-fuel to be used for testing and service accumulation. (2) Other liquefied petroleum gas-fuels may be used for testing and service accumulation provided: (i) They are commercially available; (ii) Information, acceptable to the Administrator, is provided to show that only the designated fuel would be used in customer service; and (iii) Written approval from the Administrator of the fuel specifications must be provided prior to the start of testing. (3) The specification range of the fuels to be used under paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(2) of this section shall be measured in accordance with ASTM D2163&hyph;91 and reported in accordance with §86.094&hyph;21(b)(3). (g) Fuels not meeting the specifications set forth in this section may be used only with the advance approval of the Administrator.
