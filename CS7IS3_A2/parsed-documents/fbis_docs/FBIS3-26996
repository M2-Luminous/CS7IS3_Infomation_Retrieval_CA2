In an interview with XINHUA, Monory, who will pay an official visit to China on February 22-27, said that his trip will aim to "further improve our relations, especially economic, financial, and political, which have now entered an active and positive phase." Monory will be the first French Senate president to visit China since the two countries established diplomatic ties 30 years ago. Noting that he had recently met with Prime Minister Edouard Balladur on Franco-Chinese relations, Monory stressed that "the french government has declared that there will be no more arms sales to Taiwan," and that this expresses "the government's intention to develop friendly economic and political ties with China." He added that he fully supports the government's position. Monory said that France, as a major European country, should play an active role in promoting political and economic ties between China and Western Europe. Monory said he believes there is great potential for Franco-Chinese cooperation, and China's rapid economic growth is also in the interest of Europe. He said he will attempt to give medium and small enterprises in France a full picture of China's opening policy and economic situations after his return in order to expand bilateral cooperation beyond large enterprises and big projects. Monory visited China in 1988 when he was the French minister of national education.
