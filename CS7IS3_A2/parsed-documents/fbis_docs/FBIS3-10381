Virtually harassed by the commission deputies who asked him to explain the details of the program, Pereira conceded the government expects at least 5,000 workers will join the program per year. He added $89 million in foreign financing is being sought in 1994 to carry out the program. Pereira kept contradicting himself when he answered deputies' questions. For example, he denied the Mifin [Finance Ministry] is pressuring ministries to reduce their budget when only a few days ago Education Minister Humberto Belli told the commission he was told at Mifin: "Either reduce your budget, or we will reduce it for you." He was told he had to reduce his budget by 13 million cordobas. Sandinist Deputy William Ramirez has described the minister's appearance as "disastrous." Pereira was accompanied by his deputy ministers, Mirna Somarriba and Rene Vallecillo. There was a moment when Ramirez complained to the officials, asking them why they had given the information little by little. The officials had to face pressure from the deputies for more than four hours. They were demanding, among other things, a list of government offices that will be mainly affected by the Labor Mobility Program and the reduction of 140 million cordobas in public spending, measures demanded by international financial organizations.
