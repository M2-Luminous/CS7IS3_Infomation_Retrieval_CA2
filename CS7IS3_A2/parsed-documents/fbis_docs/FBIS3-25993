Song Hanliang, secretary of the regional party committee, made a summing up speech. He emphatically pointed out: To further promote Xinjiang's reform and development, the most crucial thing is to emancipate our minds and seek truth from facts. In the minds of some of our comrades, the problem of being socialist or capitalist has not been fundamentally solved. The old ideology of planned economy still restrains the minds of some of our comrades. The traditional oasis economy of seeking self-sufficiency has been firmly established in the minds of people. It has generated deep-rooted ideas of closed economy, self-satisfaction, and conservatism. When discussing reform, some comrades often stressed special conditions in the region and warned against taking big strides. They wanted to do things slowly and hoped to receive more special consideration. This kind of backward ideology has adversely influenced our work. Song Hanling said: Without deepening the reform and changing our ideology, we will not be able to achieve the goal of enabling the people to lead a fairly comfortable life. In the course of emancipating our minds, leading cadres at various levels must stand at the forefront and set examples for others. We should conscientiously study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm the minds of cadres of various nationalities with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and plunge ourselves into the great practice of reform and construction. Song Hanling said: Xinjiang should have a sense of urgency in promoting development with high speed and high efficiency. We must now pay particular attention to the following points: 1. We should accelerate adjustment of the industrial structure and raise the overall efficiency of the national economy. 2. We should improve the allocation of productive forces and give favorable consideration to both special areas and special industries. 3. We should break away from the structure of single ownership and vigorously develop private economy. 4. We should change the operational mechanism of and invigorate state-owned enterprises. 5. We should successfully complete construction of the international passageway in the Northwest and further open up to the outside world. Song Hanling said: Adhering to the policy of grasping two links [no further elaboration; the term "grasping two links" was explained in detail in Jiang Zemin's report to the 14th CPC National Congress] simultaneously and attaching equal importance to both are basic requirements for building socialism and are integral components of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must persist in grasping the two links in our actual work. On the issue of maintaining social and political stability, Song Hanling pointed out: First, we must correctly handle the relationship between stability and development. Second, we should foster the idea of making efforts over a long period and heighten our consciousness regarding the work of maintaining stability. Third, leading cadres at various levels should oppose national splittism with a clear-cut stand. Fourth, we should exert all our efforts to grasp the work of maintaining stability. Fifth, we should firmly trust and rely on the masses of various nationalities. Song Hanling emphatically pointed out: To realize the strategic goals set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the tasks put forward by the current meeting, to accelerate reform and opening up and to promote Xinjiang's rapid and efficient economic development, the key lies in strengthening and improving the party's leadership and, in particular, strengthening party leadership over economic work. Members of party committees at various levels must spend more time in study and less time in social activities, undertake more investigation and study and reduce their subjectivism, do more practical things and limit empty speech, concentrate their efforts on effectively resolving contradictions and problems arising in the course of reform and development, and ensure the true implementation of various principles and policies of the party Central Committee and the autonomous region.
