The Commission issued a notice of the filing on January 7, 1994 (HCAR No. 25971) (``January 7th Notice''). In the January 7th notice, EII proposed to acquire a limited partnership interest for $11.5 million in a Canadian limited partnership (``Partnership'') being formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 22.5 megawatt wood and oil fired cogeneration facility in Brooklyn, Nova Scotia, Canada (``Project''). Applicants anticipated that the Project would quality as an exempt wholesale generator as defined by section 32(a)(1) of the Act. EII proposed to secure its equity contribution to the Partnership through an irrevocable letter of credit for $11.5 million with GPU unconditionally guaranteeing EII's obligations. Alternatively, should the Partnership elect to borrow $11.5 million from lending institutions to provide a portion of the construction financing, GPU proposed to guarantee unconditionally EII's repayment obligations. Applicants now propose that GPU make a capital contribution to EII of up to $11.5 million. EII proposes to use such funds to acquire its interest in the Partnership.
