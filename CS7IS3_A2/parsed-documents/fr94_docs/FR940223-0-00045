FR940223-0-00045 FR940223-0-00020 40 CFR Part 271 [FRL&hyph;4840&hyph;2] Missouri; Interim Authorization of State Hazardous Waste Management Program; Revisions AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Immediate final rule. SUMMARY: Missouri has applied for interim authorization of revisions to its hazardous waste program under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has reviewed Missouri's application and has made a decision, subject to public review and comment, that Missouri's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for interim authorization. Thus, EPA intends to approve Missouri's hazardous waste program revisions. Missouri's application for program revision is available for public review and comment. DATES: Interim authorization for Missouri shall be effective April 25, 1994, unless EPA publishes a prior Federal Register action withdrawing this immediate final rule. All comments on Missouri's program revision application must be received by the close of business March 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Gary Bertram, USEPA Region VII, RCRA Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101. Copies of Missouri's program revision application are available for inspection and copying during normal business hours at the following addresses: Hazardous Waste Program, Missouri Department of Natural Resources, Jefferson Building, 205 Jefferson Street, Jefferson City, Missouri 65102, Phone: 314&hyph;751&hyph;3176; USEPA Region VII Library, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101, Phone: 913&hyph;551&hyph;7241. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary Bertram, USEPA Region VII, RCRA Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101; 913&hyph;551&hyph;7533. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program. In addition, as an interim measure, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (Public Law 98&hyph;616, November 8, 1984, hereinafter ``HSWA'') allows States to revise their programs to become substantially equivalent instead of equivalent to RCRA requirements promulgated under HSWA authority. States exercising the latter option receive ``interim authorization'' for the HSWA requirements under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), and later apply for final authorization for the HSWA requirements. Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 266, 268 and 270. B. Missouri On November 20, 1985, EPA published a Federal Register notice announcing its decision to grant final authorization for the RCRA base program to the State of Missouri (50 FR 47740). Authorization revisions to the Missouri hazardous waste program were published on February 27, 1989 (54 FR 8190) and January 11, 1993 (58 FR 3497). Today, Missouri is seeking interim authorization of its program revision in accordance with 40 CFR 271.24. EPA has reviewed Missouri's application, and has made an immediate final decision that Missouri's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for interim authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant interim authorization for the additional program modifications to Missouri. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until March 25, 1994. Copies of Missouri's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations identified in the `` Addresses '' section of this action. Approval of Missouri's program revision shall become effective April 25, 1994, unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision, or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision. The State has adopted and applied for interim authorization for the corrective action portion of the HSWA Codification Rule (July 15, 1985, 50 FR 28702). For a full discussion of the HSWA Codification Rule, the reader is referred to the Federal Register cited above. The State will assume lead responsibility for issuing permits for those program areas authorized today. For those permits which will now change to State lead from EPA, EPA will transfer copies of any pertinent file information to the State. EPA will be responsible for enforcing the terms and conditions of federally issued permits while they remain in force. When the State reissues federally issued permits as State permits, EPA will rely on the State to enforce them. C. Decision I conclude that Missouri's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, Missouri is granted interim authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. Missouri now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out the aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. Missouri also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of Missouri's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. Authority: This action is issued under the authority of sections 2002(a), 3006 and 7004(b) of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42 U.S.C. 6912(a), 6926, 6974(b). Dated: January 25, 1994. William Rice, Acting Regional Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4055 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
