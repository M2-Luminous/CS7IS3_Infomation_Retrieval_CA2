He yesterday submitted to Gonzaga Motta, PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] deputy for Ceara and coordinator of the special committee in the Chamber of Deputies that is analyzing the minister's second economic plan, a new proposal blocking 7.5 percent of the fund tranfers to state governments, and leaving municipal funds untouched. The original proposal was to retain 15 percent of funds for state and municipal governments. The blocked funds will be used for the creation of the Emergency Social Fund. After meeting with Cardoso and special Finance Ministry advisor Edmar Bacha, Motta said that "it was unfair to affect municipal governments, because 80 percent of them survive on fund transfers." By blocking 15 percent of transfers the government expected to collect approximately $2.7 billion, $1.4 million from municipal funds and $1.3 billion from state funds. With the new proposal, collected funds will drop to $650 million. Gonzaga Motta said that the difference will be compensated for with an increase on the taxable percentages of the tax on manufactured products, the IPI, which will affect exports, and through the withholding -- by the Union -- of the income tax of federal public employees. This will put the federal public servants' income tax outside the cake that is shared with states and municipal districts. "I believe the PMDB will like the changes in the economic program," Motta said. Last Friday, a fiscal adjustment subcommittee chaired by Luiz Roberto Ponte, PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, approved a proposal by which fund transfers to state and municipal governments will be 5-percent higher, in real terms, than in 1994. The modification announced yesterday by Minister Cardoso shows that the government has reviewed its figures and has preferred states to be partners of the fiscal adjustment instead of mere creditors. The modification, however, involves a source for political complication, as it maintains the block on fund transfers to state governments. This could be another proposal for negotiation.
