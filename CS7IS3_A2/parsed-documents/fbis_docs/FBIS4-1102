The results of the February poll were invalidated in these three constituencies by the Supreme Court as a result of "disturbances" observed during the second round, and the "ineligibility" of the deputies' alternates. These three polls saw the victory of opposition candidates -- two from the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and one from the Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]. At the end of the elections, the opposition had obtained an absolute majority -- 43 out of 81 seats -- at the National Assembly. The Rally of the Togolese People [RPT] -- the former single ruling party -- is presenting a candidate in each of the three constituencies, while the Alliance of Democrats for the Republic, which did not obtain any seat in February, is presenting one candidate in the first constituency of Oti. The opposition, after contesting the Supreme Court's decision, finally agreed to present candidates "as a safeguard." The UTD and the CAR presented single candidates in the three constituencies -- one for the UTD and two for the CAR. Since the Supreme Court's decision to invalidate the election of the opposition deputies, there has been an impasse in negotiations to select the future prime minister, who, according to the Togolese Constitution, must come from the parliamentary majority. However, President Eyadema has again met -- twice early this week -- with CAR Chairman Yao Agboyibor, as part of consultations undertaken since 15 March.
