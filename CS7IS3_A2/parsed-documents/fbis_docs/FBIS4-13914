According to the source, Saudi Arabia has always claimed that its unique relations with Yemen make it necessary that all attempts to find a solution to the problem go through Riyadh. The source added that Egypt had remained patient since Saudi Arabia rejected any Egyptian intervention when the crisis broke out. Saudi Arabia claimed to be confident that the parties in Sanaa and Aden were capable of resolving their differences without outside intervention. The source added that Egypt responded favorably at first but its patience ran out when the crisis became exacerbated in a way that, according to Egypt, threatened the region. It said that some Egyptian Foreign Ministry experts prepared a study on the possible deterioration of the situation in Yemen and came to the conclusion that leaving things as they were could make the situation worse and make some parties push to take the case to the United Nations, which would mean allowing a Western presence in Yemen in the name of international legitimacy, a development that Egypt regards as detrimental to Arab interests. The source added that Egypt decided to intervene either unilaterally or in coordination with the United Arab Emirates [UAE], particularly as the evidence convinced it that some Arab parties are intent on exacerbating the situation in Yemen and impeding any efforts to resolve it. The source said: Egypt noticed that the Gulf Cooperation Council did not discuss the Yemeni crisis at its recent meeting in Riyadh. Egypt is strongly opposed to undermining Yemen and bringing down its regime because of its stance during the second Gulf war. The source revealed that another issue, Iraq, has intensified the crisis between Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is accusing Egypt of working covertly to improve the atmosphere between Baghdad and some Arab and Western capitals and says that the Arab League's reconciliation initiative is only a back door for returning Iraq to the Arab fold. It added that Saudi Arabia brought up this issue with Egypt several times and stressed that it adopt the Gulf stance, which is opposition to reconciliation with Iraq. The source did not rule out a possible Egyptian move to raise the level of its diplomatic representation with Iraq as a means of pressure. The source expressed the hope that the cloud marring Egyptian-Saudi relations would disappear and stressed that Saudi Arabia and Egypt need each other. On the other hand, Arab diplomatic circles are pessimistic about the prospects of Egyptian-UAE mediation between Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid. These circles expect this mediation to fail for several reasons, the most important of which is that the fundamental problem lies in the struggle for power and not in implementing the "Pledge and Agreement" document. They note that implementation of the document will neither strengthen the unity nor remove the specter of secession. They add that non-Yemeni parties have succeeded in planting fear within the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and that this fear has been bolstered by financial aid that has exceeded $1 billion in cash and military aid. These parties, the Arab circles said, gave al-Bid forged reports saying that Salih rigged the elections in favor of his party so he could appear later as magnanimous when he offered the prime ministership, Defense Ministry, and some other noninfluential posts to the YSP so that any future legislative elections would appear to the people to be honest and objective if the lists of the winners or ministers appeared without any southern name. The circles say that these non-Yemeni parties have stressed to the southern Yemenis that if Egypt's efforts to achieve an Arab reconciliation continue, it will only strengthen 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's position, who in his capacity as president has the authority to sign any Yemeni reconciliation with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. The non-Yemeni parties added that this would mean the immediate severance of communications between the Gulf and Aden and that the Gulf prefers to cooperate with the YSP, either through al-Bid's assumption of the presidency of the Republic or through the restoration of the south's independence. An informed Arab source said that the Gulf parties that have direct ties with intelligence organs there handed al-Bid documents and lists of names that reveal that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's relatives assassinated some YSP members to pull the rug from under the feet of the leadership in the south. It added that these parties stressed to al-Bid that some of those who carried out these operations were half brothers of President Salih on his mother's side. [passage omitted]
