To begin with, the Federation says there can be no question of a moratorium on strikes. The unions, it says, reserve the right to collective action if the government fails to comply with accords on pay and work conditions, employment, and social security guarantees. The Federation insists that the government must clear its debt of back wages in the first half of 1994 rather than later in the year and help keep intact the existing system of free secondary and vocational education, something that the Accord does not guarantee. The Federation also demands that its special view is made known to the conciliatory commission and used as a basis for further talks with government officials on controversial points of the Accord.
