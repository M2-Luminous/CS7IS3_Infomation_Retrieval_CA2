The program begins with a short biographical account of Blades' professional, academic, and personal history and is followed by the interview. Famania says Blades has proposed a democratization of the economic process and asks him to explain the term. Blades replies: "We must create conditions that will allow a true distribution of economic opportunities." He says this goal will be accomplished "in two phases; employment and investment," and notes the need to "disperse investment" to the countryside. Famania then asks Blades if he plans to change the entire government system, which has traditionally been centralized. Blades says "it is not a matter of changing a system but an attitude." "We must design a national strategy leading to a national economic development plan, which is what we define as democratizing the economic process. All provinces must be included in this plan." Regarding investments, Blades says that "the reason for the current paralysis is simple: We have not defined our national economic objectives. The government and the private sector are not working together, and the people are waiting to see what happens. In reality, no serious steps have been taken to repair the national infrastructure or to encourage investment. No effort has been made to expedite procedures to facilitate investment. No effort has been made to reach a concerted agreement among various sectors -- labor, business, and government -- as the Mexican Government did in a very intelligent move that culminated on 3 October 1993 with a pact for stability and employment. We have done absolutely nothing to give the country direction. Investment will not come to Panama unless we offer investors certain conditions." Famania states: "You have spoken about investments and the formula for investment and employment. To what type of investment are you referring; state, private, or foreign?" Blades responds: "All types," adding that investments in Panama "are based on foreign credits, and all our revenues are used for public expenses, a situation that should not continue." Further on he adds: "Credits should be used for specific objectives that will not only create new jobs but will eventually pay the debt." Blades continues: "Our basic problem -- and what has made it impossible to renegotiate our debt under favorable terms -- is that we are seen as a country that improvises. There is an uncertainty that undermines confidence in us, and for that we are paying a high price." He then stresses that if the country were to present to the international financial institutions "a specific program with all our projects, I am sure they would agree to grant us anything from a moratorium on debt payments to an increase in credits." Asked how he would renegotiate the debt differently from the current administration, Blades says: "We must define our economic objectives; for example, Panama as an international tourist center, a maritime center, a telecommunications center, a financial center, and an export center. We must develop rural areas. We must create conditions for exports to bring foreign exchange to the country." He adds: "We must take immediate steps to help the agricultural and industrial sectors define their markets." Asked if the country is ready for a commercial opening, Blades answers: "No, not yet. We are not prepared for a commercial opening. I think that would be crazy" because "it would hurt our industries and our small and midsize enterprises." On the subject of privatization, Blades says: "I do not agree that privatizing assets has a strategic value for the nation because those assets belong to the country." He specifically mentions electricity, water, and telephone services, clarifying that "some areas in those services could be privatized." He notes that there could be some mixed enterprises. Blades then elaborates on MPE proposals to reform the Labor Code to encourage investment. He says that "the labor and business sectors should sit down and study points of contention, discuss them, and arrive at a decision" to eliminate any perception that could discourage investment. He again uses Mexico as an example, saying that "the three sectors had to sit down and finally sign a pact of stability, competitiveness, and employment in October 1993. We should do the same thing in Panama." Regarding the use of price controls on staples to reduce poverty, Blades says: "We must look for a solution to and directly attack the problems of hunger and poverty in Panama." Famania turns to other topics, asking Blades which option he prefers to deal with problems in the health sector: coordination, integration, or open coordination with the private sector. Blades replies: "We must look for a formula among the various groups involved through a concerted effort and without excluding anyone." He adds: "We all want efficient and continuous health services for everyone at a national level." Blades also reiterates his proposal that the government pay its debt to the Social Security Fund, noting that "this is one of the most serious problems affecting the Social Security Fund." "We must also consider the possibility of privatizing some services." Famania says some analysts believe that one of the main obstacles to establishing effective public security and police forces is a fear of militarism. Blades, however, has proposed supporting the National Police with funding and logistical support to fight crime and drug trafficking. Famania asks: "Aren't you afraid of militarism?" Blades answers: "I am not afraid of militarism in that sense. Obviously we need an efficient police service with motivated, well equipped, and well paid policemen who are respected by everyone." "We must realize that we all have to protect the democratic system. I do not see why we should be afraid of an efficient, well trained police force." Asked "to what extent the country could be militarized in the defense of national sovereignty and the Panama Canal," Blades replies that "a special team or force could be created." He explains that one way to obtain the funds needed to raise policemen's salaries would be from the confiscated properties of criminals, which would also be a way to prevent corruption and bribery. He adds: "I sincerely believe that we will not return to the military past. The country will not allow that. We must have confidence in the police and support them." Blades is then asked for his views on the future of U.S. military bases. Famania notes that the MPE's position has been that the military bases should not remain in Panama. He asks Blades what his plans are for the Panamanian employees and what he proposes as a replacement for that parallel economy. Blades says: "It is my personal opinion that the current system that benefits those employees should not be altered." Regarding the military bases, he says: "We believe we can use the areas now occupied by those military bases in such a way that the benefit from economic development will greatly exceed the economic benefits and employment the properties generate today." As for use of the reverted properties, Blades says there are many proposals, including transferring public offices and using some areas for housing projects, all of which will require careful study. Commenting on the Interoceanic Region Authority, Blades says: "I think it is a little dangerous for an institution to determine the guidelines for that sector because there could be a conflict with the executive branch on the use of those areas. I think this situation should be corrected." Asked what kind of relations Panama or a government headed by the MPE would have with Fidel Castro, Blades replies: "I think we should maintain relations with all governments. In Cuba's case, we must facilitate an internal democratic transition. I see no problem whatsoever in maintaining diplomatic relations with Cuba or China."
