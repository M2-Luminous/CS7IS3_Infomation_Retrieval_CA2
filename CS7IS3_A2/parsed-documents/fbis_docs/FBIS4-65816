It is unacceptable that it is not in the contact group on Bosnia," [Foreign Minister Antonio] Martino said in Washington. Tomorrow he will tell the U.S. secretary of state about the "continuity" of Italian foreign policy provided there is "a correct relationship with the allies." "We consider that leaving out Italy from the enlargement of the UN Security Council to 10 members would be an unacceptable exclusion," he said. He said that the Treaty of Osimo is "fully valid." On Istria and Dalmatia, he said: "We have no requests to make."
