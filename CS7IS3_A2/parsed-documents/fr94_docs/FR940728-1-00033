FR940728-1-00033 FR940728-1-00011 NO X emissions contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of VCAPCD's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to the CAA requirements cited above. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action In determining the approvability of a NO X rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110, and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for this action, appears in various EPA policy guidance documents. 3 Among these provisions is the requirement that a NO X rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of NO X emissions. 3 Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post-1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987 Federal Register Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the Federal Register on May 25, 1988). For the purposes of assisting state and local agencies in developing NO X RACT rules, EPA prepared the NO X Supplement to the General Preamble, cited above (57 FR 55620). In the NO X Supplement, EPA provides guidance on how RACT will be determined for major stationary sources of NO X emissions. While most of the guidance issued by EPA on what constitutes RACT for stationary sources has been directed towards application for VOC sources, much of the guidance is also applicable to RACT for stationary sources of NO X (see section 4.5 of the NO X Supplement). In addition, pursuant to section 183(c), EPA is issuing alternative control techniques documents (ACTs), that identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of NO X . The ACT documents will provide information on control technology for stationary sources that emit or have the potential to emit 25 tons per year or more of NO X . However, the ACTs will not establish a presumptive norm for what is considered RACT for stationary sources of NO X . In general, the guidance documents cited above, as well as other relevant and applicable guidance documents, have been set forth to ensure that submitted NO X RACT rules meet federal RACT requirements and are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. Rule 74.15 limits the discharge of NO X from boilers, steam generators, and process heaters to 40 parts per million volume (ppmv) or 0.048 pounds per million Btu (lb/MMBtu). Rule 74.15 satisfies all the requirements of RACT for California with the added stringency of a lower emission limit. The rule's compliance date of March 2, 1992, satisfies the CAA's NO X RACT implementation date requirement of May 31, 1995 (ยง182(b)(2)). The District expects this rule to provide a 50 to 60% reduction in NO X emissions for this source category. This reduction corresponds to 1.34 tons per day based on the District's inventory. Rule 74.16 requires all drilling operations to be powered by utility electricity unless, under Section C.1, its installation is not cost effective. The exemption may be granted if a Best Available Control Technology (BACT) evaluation shows that the cost of control exceeds the BACT guideline cost. The costs used in the analysis are limited to the costs of installing sufficient and compatible electric capacity to power the drill rig. For drilling operations claiming an exemption from this requirement, the emissions of NO X from diesel-powered engines shall not exceed 515 ppmv or 6.9 grams per brake horsepower-hour (g/bhp-hr). Compliance must be demonstrated annually by source testing. Section C.2 also grants a limited exemption for shallow drilling projects which use smaller rigs with engines that cannot meet the emission limit. This exemption applies only if the Section C.1 cost effectiveness exemption also applies, and, in any event, expires on June 1, 1995, when manufacturer certified low NO X engines are expected to be available. A more detailed discussion of the sources controlled, the controls required, and the justification for why these controls represent RACT can be found in the Technical Support Documents (TSDs) for Rules 74.15 and 74.16, date November 19, 1993. EPA has evaluated the submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations and EPA policy. Therefore, VCAPCD's Rule 74.15, ``Boilers, Steam Generators and Process Heaters,'' and Rule 74.16, ``Oilfield Drilling Operations,'' are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a), section 182(b)(2), section 182(f) and the NO X Supplement to the General Preamble. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. 4 4 Section C.3 of Rule 74.15 references VCAPCD Rule 32. VCAPCD Rule 32 was not submitted to EPA with Rule 74.15 and has not been approved by EPA for inclusion into the SIP. Therefore, this NPRM for Rule 74.15 does not constitute action on or approval of Rule 32 into the SIP. Both Rules 74.15 and 74.16 reference California Air Resources Board's (CARB) Method 100, which has been cited for certain deficiencies by the Emissions Measurement Branch. CARB has committed to correct these deficiencies in 1994, and final approval of Rules 74.15 and 74.16 is contingent on these corrections.
