Having familiarized himself with the state of interethnic relations in Ukraine, his mission there is to get an opportunity to make certain recommendations to the government in order to prevent the emergence of conflict situations. Mr. van der Stoel visited Crimea and Donetsk Oblasts. He intends to pass his recommendations to the Ukrainian Government in the near future. Although there are certain problems in the regions, I did not notice any symptoms of interethnic hostility, the high commissioner noted. He also noted the liberality of Ukrainian legislation in issues of ethnic minorities. As far as the situation in Crimea is concerned, I did not notice any cases of forced Ukrainianization in the autonomy. On the contrary, one could describe some of the Crimeans' views as separatist ones, van der Stoel noted, and emphasized that the international community is in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity. The CSCE high commissioner noted that consultations between the leaders of the state and the regions would be of great benefit to both sides and stressed the necessity of avoiding any provocative actions, which could lead to the situation becoming more complicated.
