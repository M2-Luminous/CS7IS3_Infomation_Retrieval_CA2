The handler shall pay the balance due producers on or before the date for making payments pursuant to such paragraph next following receipt of the full payment from the market administrator. (b) The payments required in paragraph (a) of this section shall, upon the request of a cooperative association qualified under §1124.18, be made to the association or its duly authorized agent for milk received from each producer who has given such association authorization by contract or other written instrument to collect the proceeds from the sale of the producer's milk. All payments required pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the second day prior to the dates specified for such payment in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(d) Each handler pursuant to §1124.9(a) that received milk from a cooperative association that was a handler pursuant to §1124.9(c) shall pay the cooperative association for such milk as follows: (1) On or before the second day prior to the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the Class III price for the preceding month; and (2) On or before the 17th day after the end of each month, for milk received during the month an amount of money determined in accordance with the computations specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, minus any payment made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (e) None of the provisions of this section shall be construed to restrict any cooperative association qualified under section 8c(5)(F) of the Act from making payment for milk to its producers in accordance with such provision of the Act. (f) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall provide each producer, on or before the 19th day of each month, with a supporting statement for milk received from the producer during the previous month in such form that it may be retained by the producer, which shall show: (1) The identity of the handler and the producer; (2) The total pounds of milk delivered by the producer, the pounds of butterfat and nonfat milk solids contained therein, and, unless previously provided, the pounds of milk in each delivery;
