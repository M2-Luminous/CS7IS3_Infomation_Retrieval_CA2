The plan gives a new role to the Ministry of Insurance and Social Affairs with regard to absorbing part of the unemployment problem through productive family projects. The Ministry of Agriculture will also share in solving the problem of unemployed graduates, through conveying ownership of reclaimed land. Indicators also confirm that the government's commitment to assigning graduates will be limited to appointing graduates of medical colleges and nursing institutions to the health sector, and graduates of teaching colleges and supplementary studies to the education sector. A responsible source in the Ministry of Planning stated that the government's role in the coming plan is confined to appointing specific career specialties to serve directly in service areas. Its present role is to concentrate on indirectly increasing employment through encouraging the private sector, and on the role of the Social Fund to encourage small projects in cooperation with local administrative agencies and banks. Moreover, the government intends to issue a number of administrative decrees, such as early out for retirement, encouraging departures, and offering loans for an indefinite period. By establishing manufacturing training centers, the government is aiming at requalifying the work force and graduates, commensurate with labor market needs, either domestic or in the Arab countries. Educated Unemployed 'Usam Fahmi, head of the Central Office for Labor and Human Resources in the Ministry of Planning, confirmed that the state's plan to employ graduates is based on several studies that have been conducted recently by the Cabinet and the Ministry of Local Administration, in participation with the Ministry of Planning. Initial results make it clear that the largest percentage of unemployment is among the educated, while it is lower for the uneducated, since their jobs do not require specific qualifications and it is easier to go from one job to another. It is different for the educated, whether highly qualified, above average, or average. The number of unemployed graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was about 1.425 million out of a total of 3.438 million graduates. In this study, conducted in 21 governorates--excluding the border governorates--it was noted that the highest percentage of educated unemployed was in Port Said, where it totaled 16.5 percent, followed by Suez at 13.5 percent and Kafr al-Shaykh at 11 percent. The Upper Egyptian governorates of Bani Suwayf, al-Minya, Asyut, and Aswan were 11.2 percent, 11.7 percent, 11.4 percent, and 11.4 percent respectively. The unemployment rate was 10.9 percent in the governorate of al-Daqahliyah, 10.7 percent in al-Sharqiyah, and 10 percent in al-Minufiyah. It dropped in al-Jizah, where it was less than 5.6 percent. It was also clear that the highest unemployment rate was among 1992 graduates, totaling 12.4 percent, while the lowest rate was among 1983 graduates at 5.5 percent. A study of unemployment distribution by skills showed that the highest rate was in the intermediate range, followed by above average and highly qualified. With regard to graduates of average skills, the highest unemployment rate was for graduates of commercial institutes, representing 67.8 percent, followed by industrial school graduates at 28.7 percent, and social services at 1.5 percent. Agricultural school graduates were at 0.7 percent, hotel training 0.3 percent, and health technicians 0.2 percent. It was found that the highest unemployment rate for highly-skilled graduates, during the period from 1983 to 1993, was for graduates of the Business College, which was 34.6 percent, followed by graduates of fine arts colleges at 15.3 percent, and law and agriculture at 14.6 percent and 14.5 percent respectively. The lowest rate was for graduates of engineering colleges at 3.8 percent.
