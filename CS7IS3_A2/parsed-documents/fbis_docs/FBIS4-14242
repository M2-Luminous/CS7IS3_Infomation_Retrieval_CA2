Shiddu responded to a statement issued by the U.S. Embassy last week, in today's issue of AL-INQADH AL-WATANI. Shiddu stated: We know all our responsibilities and do not need guidance on this issue. He declared the government's rejection of the United States' evil deeds against Sudan both inside and outside the country. The U.S. Embassy claimed that Amnesty International's findings, which confirm that Sudan's human rights record is much better than that of the United States, Great Britain, and Israel, were not correct. The U.S. Embassy statement referred to alleged human rights violations in Sudan, and urged the government to take what it called serious steps to stop these violations.
