SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Summary of State Submittal On November 15, 1993, the TNRCC submitted to the EPA a SIP revision, incorporating PAMS into the ambient air quality monitoring network of State or Local Air Monitoring Stations (SLAMS) and National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS). The State will establish and maintain PAMS as part of its overall ambient air quality monitoring network. Section 182(c)(1) of the Act and the General Preamble (57 FR 13515) require that the EPA promulgate rules for enhanced monitoring of ozone, oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) no later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of the Act. In addition, the Act requires that, following the promulgation of the rules relating to enhanced ambient monitoring, the State must commence actions to adopt and implement a program based on these rules, to improve monitoring for ambient concentrations of ozone, NOX, and VOC and to improve monitoring of emissions of NOX and VOC. The final PAMS rule was promulgated by the EPA on February 12, 1993 (58 FR 8452). Section 58.40(a) of the revised rule requires the State to submit a PAMS network description, including a schedule for implementation, to the Administrator within six months after promulgation or by August 12, 1993. Further, §58.20(f) requires the State to provide for the establishment and maintenance of a PAMS network within nine months after promulgation of the final rule or by November 12, 1993. On August 23, 1994, the TNRCC submitted a PAMS network description for the State of Texas, including a schedule for implementation. This submittal is currently being reviewed by the EPA and is intended to satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 58.40(a). Since network descriptions may change annually, they are not part of the SIP as recommended by the Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR part 58. However, the network description is negotiated and approved during an annual review as required by 40 CFR 58.25 and 58.36, respectively, and the revision to be codified at 40 CFR 58.46. The TNRCC approved the proposed revision to the Texas ozone SIP on November 10, 1993. On November 15, 1993, the TNRCC submitted the SIP revision to the EPA. This submittal was included with the State's 15% Rate of Progress SIP; however, in this action, the EPA is only acting on and approving the PAMS section of the SIP, and this section will be referred to as the PAMS SIP revision. The EPA will address the remainder of the 15% Plan in later FR documents. The EPA sent the Governor of Texas a letter on January 14, 1994, finding the submittal administratively complete. Texas PAMS SIP revision is intended to meet the requirements of section 182(c)(1) of the Act and affect compliance with the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR part 58, as promulgated on February 12, 1993. The TNRCC held public hearings on the PAMS SIP revision on August 23&hyph;26, 1993, and no comments were received either during the public hearings or public comment period with the exception of the comment by the EPA as referenced below relating to the need for public access to a description of the monitoring network and the implementation schedule. II. Analysis of State Submittal The Texas PAMS SIP revision will provide Texas with the authority to establish and operate the PAMS sites, secure State funds for PAMS and provide the EPA with the authority to enforce the implementation of PAMS, since their implementation is required by the Act. The criteria used to review the proposed SIP revision are derived from the PAMS regulations, to be codified at 40 CFR part 58, the Guideline for the Implementation of the Ambient Air Monitoring Regulations 40 CFR part 58 (EPA&hyph;450/4&hyph;78&hyph;038, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, November 1979), the September 2, 1993, memorandum from G. T. Helms entitled Final Boilerplate Language for the PAMS SIP Submittal (Helms boilerplate memorandum), the Act and the General Preamble. The September 2, 1993, Helms boilerplate memorandum stipulates that the PAMS SIP, at a minimum, must: enable the monitoring of criteria pollutants, such as ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide and non-criteria pollutants, such as NOX, Nitric Oxide, speciated VOC, including carbonyls, as well as meteorological parameters; provide a copy of the approved (or proposed) PAMS network description, including the phase-in schedule, for public inspection during the public notice and/or comment period provided for in the SIP revision or, alternatively, provide information to the public upon request concerning the State's plans for implementing the rules; make reference to the fact that PAMS will become a part of the State or local air monitoring stations (SLAMS) network; and provide a statement that SLAMS will employ Federal reference (FRM) or equivalent methods while most PAMS sampling will be conducted using methods approved by the EPA which are not FRM or equivalent. The Texas PAMS SIP revision provides that the State will implement PAMS as required in 40 CFR part 58, as amended February 12, 1993. The State will amend its SLAMS and its National Air Monitoring Stations (NAMS) monitoring systems to include the PAMS requirements. It will develop its PAMS network design and establish monitoring sites pursuant to 40 CFR part 58 in accordance with an approved network description and as negotiated with the EPA through the 105 grant process on an annual basis. The State has begun implementing its PAMS network as required in 40 CFR part 58. The Texas PAMS SIP revision also includes a provision to meet quality assurance requirements as contained in 40 CFR part 58, appendix A. The State also assures that the State's PAMS monitors will meet monitoring methodology requirements contained in 40 CFR part 58, appendix C. Lastly, the State assures that the Texas PAMS network will be phased in over a period of five years as required in §58.44. The State's PAMS SIP submittal and the EPA's technical support document are available for viewing at the EPA Region 6 Office and the TNRCC Austin Office as outlined under the ``Addresses'' section of this FR document. The State revised its PAMS SIP to include Region 6's comment on the draft SIP that the description of the monitoring network and implementation schedule should be made available to the public. The final PAMS SIP for which the public hearing was held included a statement that the network description and implementation schedule will be on file for public inspection. III. Rulemaking Action In this action, the EPA is approving the revision to the Texas ozone SIP for PAMS. The EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in the FR publication, the EPA is proposing to approve the SIP revision should adverse comments be received. Thus, the action will be effective December 5, 1994 unless, by November 3, 1994, adverse or critical comments are received. If such comments are received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent document which will withdraw the final action. All public comments will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on December 5, 1994. The EPA has reviewed this request for revision of the federally-approved SIP for conformance with the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments. The EPA has determined that this action conforms with those requirements. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing, or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. The EPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D, of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S. Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by December 5, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review, nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements (see section 307(b)(2)). This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the FR on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993, memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.
