Oregon is not requesting FEMA review of the Oregon Hanford Plan section. Copies of the Manual are available for review and copying at the FEMA Region X Office, or they will be made available upon request in accordance with the fee schedule for FEMA Freedom of Information Act requests, as set out in subpart C of 44 CFR part 5. There are 510 pages in this document; reproduction fees are $0.10 per page, payable with the request for a copy. 44 CFR 350.10 also calls for a public meeting prior to approval of the plans. This meeting will be held in accordance with 44 CFR 350.10 in Hermiston, Oregon, in advance of FEMA approval. Dated: April 14, 1994. Lloyd F. Hara, Regional Director.
