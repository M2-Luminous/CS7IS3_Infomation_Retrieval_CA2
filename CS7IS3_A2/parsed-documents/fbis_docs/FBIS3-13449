He also stressed that it was Syria which opened the doors to peace by accepting the U.S. initiative, on the basis of which the peace process started in Madrid. The paper explains that Syria accepted the U.S. initiative because it was very clear and stipulated the implementation of UN resolutions, particularly 242 and 338, and the land-for-peace formula. The paper says that in his speech the day before yesterday, President Hafiz al-Asad explained that Syria seriously wants peace, while Israel only speaks about peace without making one step in that direction. The paper notes that the Washington talks have confirmed Syria's serious desire to achieve the just and comprehensive peace in the region. This was confirmed by the questions which Syria raises for discussion. Syria emphasizes the substance, while Israel avoids it. Israel always raises questions that are very far from the peace process and that run contrary to the endeavor to establish a just and comprehensive peace in the region. AL-BA'TH stresses that Syria will accept nothing short of implementing the UN resolutions, on which the peace process is based. It also notes what President al-Asad has stressed; that world developments will not force us to relinquish any of our rights. The paper says the world is now fully aware of the details of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Consequently, this world now knows very well who wants and works for the genuine peace and those who work against it. Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH urges the world community to play its presumed role and compel Israel to implement UN resolutions out of concern for the world's peace and security and in order to entrench the principle of international legitimacy. On the same subject, AL-THAWRAH says: As he does every time he speaks about peace, the peace process, and the obstacles blocking the realization of the objectives of that process, President Hafiz al-Asad explained that the peace which the Arabs and Syria want is the just peace that is based on the UN Security Council resolutions stipulating complete withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and the return of the Palestinian Arab people's rights. AL-THAWRAH says: This explanation, which President Hafiz al-Asad adds at this phase as a new confirmation of the firmness and clarity of Syria's position on the peace process, entails a specific message; the peace which Syria seeks is so clear that it does not need any explanation, as claimed by Israel, and that the obstacle facing the achievement of peace in the region lies in Israel's policy and positions. The paper notes that despite the fact that the UN resolutions clearly stipulate that peace can be achieved through complete withdrawal, and despite the fact that the U.S. initiative was founded on this clear and logical explanation of the peace formula when it based the peace process and the achievement of its goals on the land-for-peace formula, the Israeli rulers still insist on specifying the meaning of the peace which Syria wants, although the world unanimously agrees that Syria's view of peace is fully compatible with the view of the international legitimacy. AL-THAWRAH notes the innumerable pieces of evidence of Israel's rejection of peace, the most important of which can be seen in Israel's extortionist and impossible requests, in the studied aggressive escalation against Lebanon and its southern part, and in the programmed mass murders against the Palestinian Arab people. AL-THAWRAH stresses that the peace which the Arabs want and agree on is, as President Hafiz al-Asad has said, a comprehensive and complete peace. Unless peace is comprehensive, there can be no peace. In another commentary, AL-THAWRAH says: When he states the Syrian position on the peace process and stresses that the kind of peace we want is the complete and comprehensive peace, the peace of the brave that would return the land and the Palestinian people's rights and guarantee that each party gets what is rightfully his without humiliating the other party, Leader al-Asad is stressing the constants, the principles, and the firmness that govern the Syrian policy, which cannot -- under any circumstance -- bargain over or relinquish a grain of soil or national right. AL-THAWRAH says: He who thinks that we are fighting the battle for peace from a weak position is mistaken. Syria is strong enough and it still holds the reins of the initiative. Our position, as stressed by President Hafiz al-Asad, is very strong and gives us confidence and assurance. We are advocating our rights and the world developments will not force us to retreat. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: When the nation puts its weight behind Syria, it is because it realizes that the Syrian position, under the leadership of President al-Asad, expresses the Arab dignity and consciousness and is the only guarantee for the return of pan-Arab rights.
