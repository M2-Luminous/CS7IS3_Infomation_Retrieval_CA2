FR941125-1-00020 FR941125-1-00007 (2) Maintenance of existing control programs. The IEPA commits to continue enforcement of all State-adopted emission control measures included in the Illinois SIP. This will include review and issuance of stationary source permits and inspection of emission sources consistent with the USEPA-approved Illinois program plan. This commitment insures that future VOC emission levels will not exceed current levels in Jersey County. (3) Compliance with Act requirements for the Metro-East St. Louis area. The IEPA notes that the Act requires the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis ozone nonattainment area to achieve additional VOC emission reductions beyond the current emission levels. For example, the area will achieve an additional 15 percent VOC emission reduction from the 1990 emission level by 1996 as the result of Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) requirements. Accounting for source growth and emission reductions expected in the Metro-East St. Louis area through 2004, the IEPA expects an 18 ton per day VOC emission reduction between 1990 and 2004 (ten years after the year in which the USEPA is expected to approve the redesignation of Jersey County). This emission decrease does not account for the additional emission reduction that will occur in the St. Louis/Metro-East St. Louis area as a result of the attempt to attain the ozone standard by 1996. (4) Contingency measures. After Jersey County is redesignated to attainment, the trigger for contingency measures will be a violation of the ozone standard based on quality assured data and a notice from the USEPA that the State of Illinois has failed to maintain the ozone NAAQS. After these triggering conditions have occurred, the IEPA will select the appropriate contingency measure(s) to prevent a violation of the ozone standard from reoccurring. The State commits to apply such a contingency measure within 18 months after the receipt of the notification from the USEPA of the NAAQS violation (A time schedule for the actions leading to the implementation of emission control measures was not given in the maintenance plan. It is assumed that the State will adopt necessary regulations earlier than 18 months, such that the regulations can be implemented within the 18 month time period). The contingency measure(s) to be considered will be selected from the following list or from measures deemed appropriate and effective at the time the control measure selection is actually made: a. lower reid vapor pressure for gasoline b. reformulated gasoline program c. Stage I and breathing controls at gasoline service stations d. Stage II vapor recovery controls at gasoline service stations e. extended geographic coverage of existing control measures f. requirements for RACT for existing source covered by USEPA Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) issued in response to the amended Act g. application of RACT to non-major sources h. implementation of one or more transportation control measures sufficient to achieve at least a 0.5 percent reduction in Jersey County VOC emissions. The transportation control measures will be selected from the following: i. trip reduction programs, including but not limited to employer-based transportation management plans, areawide rideshare programs, work schedule changes, and telecommuting ii. transit improvements iii. traffic flow improvements iv. other transportation control measures in widespread use that the State and local governments deem to be appropriate i. alternative fuel programs for fleet vehicle operations j. controls on consumer products consistent with those adopted elsewhere in the United States k. requirements for VOC emission offsets for new and modified major VOC sources
