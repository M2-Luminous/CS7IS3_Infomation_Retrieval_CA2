[passage omitted] The RPF would be happy to see a humanitarian force which would be tasked with establishing security zones in the east and south of the country, but the Front rebels will not hear of an intervention force to halt the fighting. Faustin Twagiramungu, a Hutu member of the opposition, who should have become prime minister in the framework of the Arusha peace agreement, agrees with this. He was the guest on our magazine programme at 0820. Francois Rijkmans asked him what he wants from the West: [Begin Twagiramungu recording] They can do a lot. For example, first by stopping the massacres, by putting pressure on the clique which is currently massacring people. And second, by giving substantial aid to the survivors, to the refugees. And third, by helping to ensure that (?this force can come), with a [word indistinct] redefinition of its mandate, as part of humanitarian aid, because aid is needed both in the zones occupied by the RPF and in the zones that are not occupied by the RPF. There are unfortunate victims everywhere in both these cases. [end recording]
