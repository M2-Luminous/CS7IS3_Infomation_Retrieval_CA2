He said the negotiations, which continued over six long sessions, identified 12 points of difference. These are now being worded to be presented to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres before their upcoming meeting in the Swiss city of Davos Saturday [29 January] night and Sunday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. If 'Arafat and Peres reach an agreement on those points, Kamal added, a committee will meet in Taba next week to work out the final wording of a protocol on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement, to be signed by 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, so that there will be a complete Israeli withdrawal before 13 April in accordance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. MENA has learned that the formula includes an agreement to raise the Palestinian flag outside the administration building that will control the border crossings. Other points are: No Palestinian security man in military uniform shall be seen on the same crossing leading to King Husayn (Allenby) Bridge. The Israeli security man watching arrivals in the Palestinian autonomous region of Gaza and Jericho shall stay inside the building behind a dark glass barrier. The Israelis agreed that the arrivals be inspected electronically. In case of suspicion, however, anyone can be inspected by Palestinian security men while the Israelis watch. Some differences remain. The Palestinians want Israel to give the self-rule authority administrative as well as religious supervision over the areas of Jabal al-Qarantal and al-Maghtis on the River Jordan and Maqam al-Nabi Musa on the main road to Jerusalem. The Israeli delegation will leave Cairo later today immediately after the working session, which is scheduled to last until evening.
