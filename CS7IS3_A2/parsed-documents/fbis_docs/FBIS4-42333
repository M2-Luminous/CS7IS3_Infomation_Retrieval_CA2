The Cypriot minister told MENA that his country will study that report. He noted the importance of the secretary general's proposal to hold an international conference on the Cyprus issue, to adopt intensified measures to implement the UN resolutions, and to hold a meeting of the peace guarantors: Turkey, Britain, and Greece. He added that the confidence-building measures will yield economic benefits for Turkish Cypriots, particularly if the Turkish Cypriot city of Famagusta is opened to both sides for the sake of touristic and trade development. The Cypriot minister noted that the secretary general's report demands the opening of Nicosia airport to both sides. This will enable Turkish Cypriots to travel without any difficulties.
