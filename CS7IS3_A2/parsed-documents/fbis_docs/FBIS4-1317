Saunders] [Text] Port Elizabeth April 26 SAPA -- The elderly and disabled trickled to the polls without fanfare in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday to cast their votes on the first day of the country's first all-race elections. The busiest voting booth was at Louis le Grange Square police headquarters in Port Elizabeth where over 400 police personnel, who qualify for special votes, had voted by 10AM and 100-odd prospective voters were standing in line. Elsewhere only small queues could be found by mid-morning. Local police liaison officers were however concerned at the time taken by voting: five minutes and 20 seconds for one person to cast a double ballot. "If it's still like this by Thursday voters will be frustrated. If some don't get to vote when the polls close I can guarantee you unrest," said Col Louis Botha.
