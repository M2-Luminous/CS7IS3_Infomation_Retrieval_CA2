A senior naval officer has told Interfax that the Ukrainian side did not display enough flexibility over the issue on separate naval bases for Russia and Ukraine. In his opinion, the Russian negotiating team accepted a tough compromise, that was not simple to do, as it offered Kiev to deploy Ukrainian ships close to the key Balaklava base near Sevastopol. The officer disclosed that the area is the chief submarine base for the Black Sea Fleet. "If the Ukrainian delegation accepted the proposal, the naval command would confront the problem of submarines' redeployment. But Kiev ignored even such an offer by Moscow," the officer said. In his opinion, the only reason for Kiev's intransigence is the lack of funds to modernize wharfs, build headquarters, and develop an infrastructure at a new place. Meanwhile, he recalled that the Black Sea Navy Command had already cut electricity supply to some Ukrainian army units. "If Kiev fails to pay off the debts, the command reserves the right to apply similar sanctions to other Ukrainian military units," he said.
