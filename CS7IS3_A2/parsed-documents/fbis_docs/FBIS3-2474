The second lecture, entitled: "The Industry and Business Tax System," is given by Jin Xin, deputy director of the State Administration of Taxation. Jin Xin begins by noting that tax reform is one of a series of reforms for building a socialist market economy drafted in the decision on establishing a socialist market economy adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. He goes on to discuss five issues concerning China's reform of the industry and business tax system: 1. The purpose of tax reform: Jin says: "Tax reform is conducted to meet the needs of developing a market economy." He explains the reasons why it is necessary and imperative to reform the tax system on a large scale and supports his arguments by pointing out that shortcomings in the tax system already implemented have hindered the development of a market economy. 2. The guiding ideology for tax reform: Jin says: "Tax reform should follow the guiding principles of unifying tax laws, imposing taxes fairly, streamlining the tax system, dividing power rationally, rationalizing distribution relations, standardizing distribution methods, ensuring revenue, and establishing a tax system in conformity with a socialist market economy." He goes on to expound the guiding ideology and outline of the draft for tax system reform. He also names seven major categories of taxes which have come into force in the tax reform package: Value-added tax, consumption tax, business tax, institutional income tax, individual income tax, resource tax, and increment tax on land value. 3. The main points of tax reform: Jin says the scope of the current tax reform includes the reform in the turnover tax system, enterprise income tax system, individual income tax system, and most local taxes. Jin defines turnover tax as "a general designation of all taxes imposed on the production and circulation of commodities and on the sale or operation of labor services," and emphasizes: "The reform of the turnover tax system is the crux of this tax reform, because turnover tax has been the main category in the structure of the tax system since China's founding." He also elaborates on the reform of value-added tax, consumption tax, and business tax, which are included in turnover tax, as well as other taxes; and gives examples for each one. 4. Tax reform, and the policies and principles for solving some important problems: Problems arising from tax reform are reflected mainly in the burden of taxes and the enforcement of a preferential tax policy. Explaining the turnover tax imposed on foreign-invested enterprises after the new tax system comes into force, Jin notes: "In order to maintain the continuity and stability of the tax policy for foreign investors as well as China's reform and open policy, proper measures should be taken to solve the problem that taxes have actually increased for some foreign-invested enterprises." To solve such problems, policies and measures will be adopted to make sure nobody suffers a sharp increase in taxes and the state does not lose sources of revenue. 5. The reform of tax collection and management: To ensure effective tax collection and management, and enforcement of tax laws, Jin puts forward six proposals, including establishing the system of declaring taxes, promoting the system of taxation agencies (such as accounting firms and law offices), stepping up the computerization of tax collection and management, establishing a strict taxation auditing system, establishing separated central and local taxation systems in line with the tax assignment system, and stepping up taxation legislation. At 1359 GMT Jin concludes by saying that tax reform will play a positive role in strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, in stepping up taxation legislation, advancing reform and opening, and promoting sustained, healthy, and rapid economic growth as all relevant measures are unfolded.
