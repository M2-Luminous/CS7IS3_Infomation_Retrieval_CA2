It also means how a person lives his life. One year after his release from Huaiji Prison near Guangzhou, Mr Wang is still trying to pick up the pieces he left behind when he was locked away 13 years ago for urging greater political freedom. But to the authorities, the 45-year-old Marxist philosopher is still a target of surveillance, a dangerous person who has to be watched. To them, Mr Wang is also a criminal. Repeated appeals to clear his name have proven futile and he is still required to report to his neighbourhood police station every Friday and cannot travel outside Guangzhou without special permission. Contacts with foreigners are still a taboo. Not only is he prohibited from speaking to foreign reporters, he has also been warned that he should not write articles for foreign magazines. Because of his criminal record, he cannot take part in any elections or run his own business like everybody does. Although nominally the boss of a jewellery shop in Guangzhou, the company is registered in other person's name. Even meetings with friends can be a problem, as he can only write to them, and even clients who met with him are often questioned by the police. The pressure from authorities notwithstanding, Mr Wang has shown no signs of repentance. "If the time does not permit me to be a political activist now, then I will do what everybody does. I go into business," Mr Wang said. "It doesn't mean I have given up. Instead, I want to prove that we--democracy activists--are not only good at politics but we can also run a successful business," he said. The jewellery business, he said, is his bridge to a modernised China. "I have been locked away for so many years. I have lost touch with the people ... Since everyone is now in business, I feel it is only right that I follow the trend of the society and join the business world. "I may spend one year in this business. If I am successful, then I may open a bookstore and I plan to write a book on the democracy movement in Guangzhou if the conditions permits," he added. However, Mr Wang admitted that he might not share the same view with other political activists who believe that they should play a more active role in the democracy movement. "I may not agree with everything they say. But we can disagree," he said. "I don't think we (activists in the 70s) are up to anything now. But one thing for sure, we are not going to disappear though," he added. But not everyone is as lucky and optimistic as he is. According to Mr Wang, many activists are having difficulties in finding jobs and the authorities have never stopped their harassment of these people.
