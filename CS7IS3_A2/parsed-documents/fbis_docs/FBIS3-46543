"The North Korean nuclear problem, which is of ultimate importance to the survival of the 70 million Korean people, should be solved early this year at the latest," Kim said in a New Year's ceremony at Chongwadae [presidential offices] attended by presidential secretaries and guards. "We had many difficulties trying to solve the nuclear problem because we needed inter-Korean negotiations and because we had a counterpart to negotiate with." He also mentioned rice market opening. "It is important for us to save our agricultural communities. Rice will be imported beginning next year, but the government will buy and process it all for reexport," he said. On industrial relations, he emphasized stability and said that the businesses need stable relations between labor and management to develop advanced technology and make excellent goods, which is necessary to win the competition on the international market.
