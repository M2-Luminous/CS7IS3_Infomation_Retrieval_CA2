And in Soviet times also Leninakan was "singled out" in a military respect. The permanent presence of quite a tangible contingent of military always creates a distinctive atmosphere and makes its mark on the tenor of urban life. Gyumri has always treated people in military uniform with affection and respect. But even against this background the border guards were a special, privileged caste, as it were. As we know, according to a number of agreements, the guarding of the "exterior" border of Armenia (with Turkey and Iran) has been entrusted to units of the border forces of the Russian Federation. On 20 May the Gyumri border detachment celebrated its 70th anniversary. On this occasion and in connection with the fact that 28 May is Border Guards Day we decided to meet with a representative of the Gyumri Border Detachment and chat about the present times. Our interlocutor is Lieutenant Colonel Pavel Igorevich Ilin, deputy chief of the border detachment for personnel and work with the staff. [Arutyunyan] A few words about the history of the detachment, if you will. [Ilin] Our detachment, the oldest on the territory of Armenia, was formed in 1924. Two heroes of the Soviet Union: Colonel Dudko, who fell in the fighting for Berlin, and Colonel Leonov, chief of the detachment, who was posthumously awarded the title of hero of the Soviet Union for the events of 15-16 March 1969 on Damanskiy Island on the Ussuri River, were raised here. [Arutyunyan] Previously the border troops were officially called the border troops of the USSR KGB. What is the troops' present status and what is their place in the overall system of the armed forces of Russia? [Ilin] Our relationship with the Armed Forces is relatively undefined. An edict of the president of Russia has formed the Federal Border Service, which is subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation directly. [Arutyunyan] It is symbolic that your holiday--Border Guards Day--coincides in Armenia with our national holiday--Independence Day. And independence begins with the sanctity of the border. How in this sense do you see the functions and missions of the border troops of Russia stationed in Armenia? [Ilin] The status and functions of the border troops here are defined by mutual agreements between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Armenia. And the border troops' mission is to defend Russia's interests on the territory of the Republic of Armenia and to guard the exterior borders of the CIS--in this case, the border with Turkey. And, in accordance with the agreement, the troops are deployed here to carry out this mission. [Arutyunyan] We have already observed that there has always been a friendly attitude toward the border guards in our city. How are relations shaping up with the authorities and the public currently? [Ilin] We are building relations with the authorities at practically all levels--from the leadership of the rayons through Mr. Kocharyan, authorized government representative for the Shirak zone. They consider all our problems their own. And they settle practically all the questions that we put to them for support for the guarding of the borders. In the past 18 months there have been no conflict situations with the local populace or any provocations in respect to the border guards. We met just before the detachment's anniversary with the leaders of almost all enterprises of the city, and they all expressed a single thought: The ties of sponsorship that had been established back in the so-called stagnation times needed to be restored and more meetings with representatives of the enterprises and organizations needed to be held. We have already reserved sponsorship for some enterprises. [Arutyunyan] The image of the border guard was for many years here associated with that of the fair-haired Russian type. What is the national composition of your detachment, say, now? [Ilin] Representatives of 26-28 nationalities have customarily served in our detachment. There are now, in fact, just two--Russians and Armenians. More precisely, when draftees come from Russia, we come across Bashkirs, say, but mainly representatives of the two nationalities (we would add that the fact that Armenians also serve in the unit could have been guessed without the clarifying question: almost 100 vehicles at the gate of the unit and attempts to squeeze through the gate and the fence, with a throng at the checkpoint, in a word, the painfully familiar native "Armenian landscape"--V.A.). [Arutyunyan] We know from past years that the so-called border regime was quite strict. What kind of changes have there been in the essence of the border regime? [Ilin] By a decision of the Government of Armenia a number of forces that used to enter the border zone now no longer do so, and the procedure of the drafting of the papers for crossing the line of engineer structures has been simplified. We are now seeing, however, and the local leadership has appealed to us repeatedly in this connection, that it is altogether necessary to tighten the regime. This applies particularly to the area of the Akhuryanskoye Reservoir and questions of fishing. For the inhabitants of some villages have been issued permits for agricultural work beyond the line of the engineer structures, and they are not cultivating the land but fishing. On the other hand, not a tightening up exactly but simply greater strictness in the permit procedure is required. Because Turkey remains Turkey, and questions of the safety of the inhabitants that work in the vicinity of the border cannot be left unattended. [Arutyunyan] Are the violations of the border and provocations from "that side" frequent? [Ilin] There are violations both on the part of Turkey and from our rear. [Arutyunyan] More detail, if you can: What are the violations from the rear? [Ilin] These are mainly mentally defective people. If we take the border itself, however, we have on the part of the contiguous territory the rustling of livestock and a violation of the border regime almost daily. Rustling of livestock on our territory. This also remains at the level of protests as yet--on the part of the border commissar. [Arutyunyan] Do such generally quite petty phenomena pursue the actual aim of inflaming the atmosphere or are these simply chance occurrences? [Ilin] I would not say that the atmosphere on the border is being inflamed on Turkey's part today, I could not today say this. But there are instances of a violation of the border regime that pursue the goal of a test of our strength and of the border that we guard. Flights by Turkish combat aircraft along the border, say. [Arutyunyan] Living conditions in Armenia are quite difficult today. What is life like for the detachment under these conditions? [Ilin] We are attempting first and foremost to resolve the lighting problem. There are border posts that have not had lighting for months. In connection with the agreement signed on 15 March in Yerevan, the Government of Armenia has now allocated us cash for the local purchase of flour and to pay for the water, lighting, and the products of the meat-packing plant that we purchase. But this is not enough for us, all the same. In accordance with this agreement, Armenia will assume 50 percent of the expenses on the maintenance of the troops, and the amount that Armenia should contribute for the upkeep of the troops and the border military units on the territory of Armenia has been determined. There are problems with firewood and coal. The firewood problem is being resolved, it would seem, the coal problem, no. We are supplied with gasoline from Russia. There is no water at all at our base in the village of Akhurchik, there is no water supply. [Arutyunyan] And how has the question of the employment and education of the members of the families of the border guards been resolved? [Ilin] There is always work for our wives in the detachment, this problem has been resolved. Positions to enable women to work, on contract included, have been determined at the border posts. We have our own kindergarten and our own high school, which is attached to School 25 of the city of Sochi. We recruited the teachers on a competitive basis--95 percent of them are local, and there is a professor and candidate of sciences.
