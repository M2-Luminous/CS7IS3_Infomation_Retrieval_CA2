Although no official statement has been issued, a commission spokeswoman said the State Council, China's Cabinet, had denied reports of Mr Liu stepping down from the job he has held since the CSRC was created in 1992. "We confirm that there is no news of Mr Liu's resignation. And this confirmation is from the State Council," she said, referring to the State Council Securities Policies Committee (SCSPC). The CSRC is an executive agency of SCSPC. Reports of Mr Liu's departure have been in the Hong Kong media in the past few weeks. "Such reports will have an adverse impact on the stock market and they should not be issued without our confirmation," she added. As the man most identified with China's stock markets, Mr Liu is instrumental in laying the groundwork for the historic listing of mainland corporations in Hong Kong. Another feather will be added to his cap when five of the 22 companies in the second batch of enterprises slated for overseas flotation head for Wall Street next year.
