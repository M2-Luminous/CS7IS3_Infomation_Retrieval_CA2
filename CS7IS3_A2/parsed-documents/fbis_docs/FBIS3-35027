These demands have either obstructed or provoked a stalemate in the negotiations since they began as a series of rounds more than two years ago. This is also happening in the new format, which is meant to serve as a prelude for more rounds and is confined to the heads of the delegations. Negotiations in the new format stopped for two weeks at Israel's request. This gave the impression that Israel might change its negative position. But no sooner had the negotiations resumed than Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin began to play the same old tune -- played earlier by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres -- of calling for secret talks, upgrading the level of the talks, and spelling out the concept of peace. This confirms in advance that Israel does not have any serious desire to see the Washington talks reach positive results. Rabin knows all attempts to hold public or secret talks with Syria will fail. His recent insistence on this confirms that Israel is still determined to defeat the formula that is the basis of the Madrid peace conference and the peace talks, evading the foundations of a just, comprehensive solution in the region. Israel plans to do this by taking on the Arab parties one at a time, as it did with the secret Oslo talks. The Arab parties went to the Madrid conference and the Washington talks in order to achieve a just, comprehensive peace in the region, based on the implementation of Security Council resolutions. Throughout the past 12 rounds, the Arab parties have emphasized that peace cannot be achieved without Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories. On the eve of the resumption of the bilateral talks in Washington, Rabin has reiterated his preconditions about what he calls Syria's spelling out the concept of peace. Obviously, Rabin's aim behind this is to obstruct and prolong the talks, keeping them spinning in a vicious circle to deflect them from their desired goal. Since the Madrid conference, Syria has emphasized its desire for, and efforts to achieve, a firm, lasting peace in the Middle East. This peace is founded on the exchange of land for peace. During the sixth round of the Washington talks, Syria presented a paper based on the relevant resolutions of international legitimacy. Israel, however, is still evading the Madrid formula and the comprehensiveness of the solution. Israel refuses to declare its willingness to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. Syria, through President Hafiz al-Asad, said in Geneva that peace is not a transitional aim, but a strategic option. This clear, unequivocal Syrian position was welcomed and appreciated by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the world at large. Israel alone is still trying to circumvent the results of the Geneva summit. Israel is mistaken if it thinks that it can impose its conditions and continue to adopt a hard-line, inflexible approach, maneuvering, casting doubts, and double-dealing. These methods are now exposed to the whole world and will only pass up the current peace opportunity, on which the Arabs and the world pin great hopes for a just, comprehensive peace in the region.
