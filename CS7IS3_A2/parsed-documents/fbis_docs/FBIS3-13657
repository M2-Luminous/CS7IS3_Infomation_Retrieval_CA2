[Qasim] Jerusalem Day is a well-known annual day which we celebrate every year. Actually we staged a symbolic unarmed parade. It is untrue that there were no security forces there. There was a security cordon around Ba'labakk in cooperation with the security forces in anticipation of any emergency, especially after the talk of possible bombings or security infiltrations. The symbolic parade was clear to everyone, and it was unarmed. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] There are reports that Hizballah took the state's place and assumed the task of maintaining security in Ba'labakk. [Qasim] You can ask internal security forces whether or not we prevented anyone, and whether or not they performed their duties. I can confirm that everything some media services said is untrue. And that some quarters tried to put the spotlight on us to conceal other quarters. These quarters were behind the release of some erroneous reports. [Shuqayr] Are we to understand that the measures were taken in coordination with security forces? [Qasim] Security forces are responsible for security, anyhow. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] It is said that Hizballah acted in Ba'labakk as though it is under the resistance's control. [Qasim] There are no problems in Ba'labakk that require extraordinary measures. This is why matters were normal and will remain so. No comparison should be made between Ba'labakk, which is under state control, and other areas said to have a link with some of the bombings that have taken place. Matters are normal in Ba'labakk. As for the areas where there are bombings and dangers to citizens, it is natural to have precautionary measures to prevent them from happening. Such measures were taken in the al-Ghubayrah area when an explosive charge was discovered in a school two days ago, and in other areas as well. In principle, there is no need to take extraordinary measures except in the areas that need it. As for whether the measures were fair or exaggerated, this requires a discussion of the details and the circumstances. It is not true at all that we acted as an authority in Ba'labakk. We do not take any measures that should be taken by the state. Our fight is limited to the South and western al-Biqa' against the Israeli enemy. But to have discipline in Ba'labakk as a result of Hizballah's extensive popular presence is a positive factor which spares the competent agencies extraordinary measures. [passage omitted] [Shuqayr] Some people say that Lebanese Forces leader Samir Ja'ja' was cornered and the demonstration came to rescue him. [Qasim] Jerusalem Day is marked annually, and the parade was not armed. Anyone who wants to look for excuses to conceal matters or justify something can easily discover or justify anything he wants. If there had been no Jerusalem Day, the talk would have been about suppression of freedoms, sectarian imbalance, and other matters. [passage omitted]
