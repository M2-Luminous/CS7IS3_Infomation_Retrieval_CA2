Each side is insisting on its stance vis-a-vis a number of fundamental issues. Palestinian sources have said that the Israeli side in the negotiations is insisting on its position regarding the topic of travel documents that the self-rule authority will provide to the Palestinian citizens. They are insisting on writing State of Israel on the cover while the Palestinian side stresses that this is unacceptable because it deprives the self rule of all authority. The other fundamental point of contention is the subjugation of the coasts of Gaza to an Israeli authority, especially in the Khan Yunis area. Regarding passage between Jericho and Gaza, the Israeli position has retracted in the new round of negotiations, expressing reservations over the passage linking the two areas. The Israeli side is proposing to make the link by air in order to avoid accidents in the future. The Israeli side also refuses to grant the right of the self-ruling authority to issue postage stamps under the pretext that what is being negotiated is a transitional self rule, while the travel document and the stamps represent manifestations of a state.
