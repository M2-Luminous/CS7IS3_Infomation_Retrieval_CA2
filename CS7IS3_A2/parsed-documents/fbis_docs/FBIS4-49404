The Singapore Government and Singapore companies are also "confident that China's policies of modernisation and growth are irreversible," Ker, who is also the minister of state for education, said at the official launch of the manpower training programme for Shandong personnel. Noting that the economic relations between China and Singapore have progressed steadily, Ker revealed that Singapore companies have invested nearly one billion U.S. dollars in China, cumulatively. In 1993, bilateral trade expanded by 25 percent to reach a record of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars, he said, adding that in the first two months of this year, trade between the two countries had already exceeded 625 million U.S. dollars, or 30 percent more than the same period of 1993. He also said that the cooperation between Singapore and China's Shandong Province created ample opportunities for trade and investments, not only for the two countries, but also for bringing in third countries like Germany into partnership to develop the potential of Shandong Province. The German state of Bavaria has signed a letter of intent with Singapore and Shandong Province to explore possibilities for greater tripartite economic cooperation. In regard to the manpower training programme for Shandong personnel, the minister said," It is an important component of Singapore's economic ties with Shandong," since Singapore is ready to share its know-how in economic management, urban planning and public administration with China. "Singapore's experience may be relevant to China at its present stage of modernisation, if it is adapted to fit China's conditions and needs," he said.
