Mr. Rene Degni-Segui of Cote d'Ivoire has been appointed to investigate the massacres in Rwanda and report to the UN secretary general. The UN Commission on Human Rights, sitting in Geneva on 24 May 1994, condemned what they called the silence of the government in Rwanda on the massacres that have been going on. What the UN Commission on Human Rights failed to pronounce is that the illegitimate government in Rwanda did not keep quiet about the massacres in Rwanda, but the government directed the massacres. The president and the prime minister of the illegitimate government in Rwanda have been using Radio Rwanda and Radio RTLM [Radio- Television Libre des Mille Collines] to instruct the Rwandan Government forces and the Republican National Movement for Democracy and Development militias to kill all the people of Tutsi ethnic groups and everybody who does not support the self-imposed government. This government has said that whoever is not ready to kill the political opponents of the government should be killed.
