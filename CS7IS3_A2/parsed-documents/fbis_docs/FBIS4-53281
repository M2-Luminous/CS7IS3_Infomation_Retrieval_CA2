FBIS4-53281 "dreas096_a_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Roundtable Views U.S. Ties, Framework Talks Roundtable Views U.S. Ties, Framework Talks OW1805083394 OW1805083394 BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Newstar TV Network in Japanese at 1100 GMT on 8 May, in its "Sunday Project" program, carries a 30-minute live roundtable discussion on Japan-U.S. ties and framework talks. The discussion is moderated by Soichiro Tahara. Guests include Kyoto University Professor Masaaki Kosaka; Hajime Takano, chief editor of INSIDER magazine; Kenichi Omae, head of Heisei Restoration Group (Heisei Ishin No Kai); Bill Totten, president of Assist Corporation; and Yoshihiro Tsurumi, New York City University professor. The first 11 minutes of the discussion are devoted to former Justice Minister Nagano's remarks on the Nanjing massacre in China and Nagano's resignation. At 1111 GMT, Tahara begins to review the series of events took place during the Hosokawa administration over the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Noting the recent report of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tahara asks Omae if Japan-U.S. economic ties have reached the worst situation possible. Omae says that economic relations between the two countries are good, that most U.S. companies in Japan are doing well, and that the USTR, contrary to the true state of affairs, is creating a commotion. He continues to say that the USTR is a "tradesman" representing a very small number of U.S. companies having difficulties in Japan. He adds: "The policy of truly first-class companies is not to use the USTR." Tsurumi also says: "Japan-U.S. relations are not bad at all as far as the economy is concerned. It is true, however, that for political reasons, many people in Japan and the United States are stirring up the situation." Tsurumi then says that the Clinton administration is bashing Japan to avoid criticism by U.S. citizens directed at the U.S. Government and that "the $60 billion trade deficit with Japan is a lie." Asked what he thinks of Omae's comments on the USTR, Totten says: "The USTR is accepting bribes in addition to using U.S. citizens' tax money. The money Motorola and other companies pay to the USTR is bribe money in terms of Japanese law. Americans calling it lobbying." Omae and Tsurumi urge Japanese politicians to realize the true intentions of the United States and not to respond to their unfair demands. On resumption of Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, Tsurumi says: "There is no reason for Japan to resume the framework talks." He reiterates that Japan will gain nothing from resumption of the framework talks and states: "It is the Clinton administration which will be in trouble if the framework talks do not start again." Citing the examples of U.S. discussions with China over human rights and Singapore's refusal of President Clinton's demand for Singapore not to cane an American youth, Omae says that the Japanese Government should resolutely refuse the USTR's recent three-point demand for resumption of the framework talks.
