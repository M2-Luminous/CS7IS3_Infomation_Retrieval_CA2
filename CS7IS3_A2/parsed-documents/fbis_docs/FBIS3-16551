This is nothing to be surprised at, as it seems that the only stabilizing force in this unsettled country, which is, moreover, surrounded by local conflict zones, is the "man armed with a gun." The Russian Federation president noted that the reforms in the Army and Navy are going according to plan, in accordance with the concept of the Armed Forces' organizational development elaborated at the Ministry of Defense, the Russian Federation Law "On Defense," and the defense minister's orders. Since spring 1992 (after the presidential edict on creating a Russian Army), 11 laws and more than 100 normative legal acts have been elaborated and adopted. The Armed Forces' strength has been reduced by 457,000 men. Three military district directorates, eight army directorates, the army corps directorate, 19 divisional directorates, and eight military schools have been disbanded. The process of reducing the number of large strategic formations (Army -- corps) and combined units (divisions), military higher educational establishments, scientific research institutes, and redundant command and control organs is continuing. At the same time new structures are being formed which respond to the demands of the new times. Who could earlier have thought that the Moscow and North Caucasus Military Districts would have ended up on the border? Now new force groupings are being formed within them. However, there is every sign that the Armed Forces' basic structure will be preserved until 1996. Military experts consider this to be necessary for two reasons. First, they say, we have had enough "revolutions," the evolutionary route for the Army and Navy's reform is preferable. Second, the ailing Russian economy will not be able to "stand" a fundamental restructuring of the Armed Forces. Our strategic nuclear forces continue to be the main guarantor of this country's security. The principle of mobile defense lies at the heart of the general-purpose forces' organizational development. The priorities for military technical policy have been given as the maintenance of nuclear security, the equipping of mobile forces, and the supplying of the Armed Forces with up-to-date facilities for military command and control, communications, intelligence, and electronic warfare. The reforms are in general under way, moving forward, and expanding. We must wait and see what results they will bring. Informed sources in the Ministry of Defense claim that three things are important for the Russian Army and Navy's reform. First, money. Second, money. And third, money yet again. Incidentally, the military budget for 1994 has not yet been confirmed. The monthly "rationed" injections of cash for the Army are practically speaking only being used for wages and plugging "holes"....
