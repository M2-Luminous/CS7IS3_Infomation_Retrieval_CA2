The three big names are New World Development Co. Ltd, Sun Hung Kai and Co. Ltd and Henderson Land Development Co. Ltd. The project is estimated to cost each of them at least five billion yuan. Wuhan, a city with rapid economic development, has become a hot spot for overseas investors since the central government stressed the opening strategy along the Chang Jiang River. The New World Group has injected more than two billion yuan into the city in the past two years. The other two companies have also invested in the country's pioneer cities in the reform drive, such as Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou.
