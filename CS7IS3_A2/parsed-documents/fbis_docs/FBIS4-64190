While CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze explained that Germany was well on its way to coming out of the recession following a CDU Presidium meeting, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping only talked of a "slight economic recovery." Nevertheless, speaking in Mainz yesterday, the SPD candidate for chancellor said that the number of unemployed will increase in 1994. If it takes over the government, the SPD wants more money for the creation of jobs and for unification. By contrast, Hintze felt that what he has been saying has been confirmed, because the coalition had always rejected the SPD's expenditure program and has thus practiced a "policy based on a lot of staying power." In contrast to the Social Democrats, Hintze said, the CDU/CSU [Christian Social Union] and the FDP [Free Democratic Party] had placed Germany's future as a center for industry and the competitiveness of the German economy at the center of their policies. They would place more emphasis on what has been achieved in maintaining a stable currency. According to Hintze, the CDU Presidium has come out against reviewing the solidarity surcharge in three years' time as the FDP has called for. The general secretary said that the CDU was not now prepared to set a fixed period of time over which the surcharge would be levied. Yesterday, the SPD Bundestag Group's spokesman on environmental matters, Michael Mueller welcomed "the greater emphasis on ecology" in the Social Democrats' government program. The Government Program Commission and the SPD Presidium had previously agreed on improvements. Thus, the program will include a much clearer stance in support for "ecology taxes" and give precise form to a new course on energy, said Mueller. The section dealing with energy policy envisages a new law on energy. The entire preamble of the present draft has been dropped and will be replaced by personal introduction by Chairman Scharping, which will be presented to delegates to the SPD party conference in Halle on 22 June. Although the SPD's plan does not mention a specific speed limit, in view of the general pattern in Europe, the Social Democrats are considering a limit of 130 km per hour. The improvements to the environmental section of the government program have nothing at all to do with a "U-turn," explained Mueller. He said it was a good thing that Scharping had taken up suggestions from within the party. That is evidently not enough for some Social Democrats. Yesterday, the chairman of the SPD Bundestag Group, Hans-Ulrich Klose, called for a more detailed section on the environment. "The program is not good enough in this respect," he said in Bonn. It requires a more concrete form and a precise description of ecological taxation reform and its implementation. SPD General Secretary Guenther Verheugen announced that employment would remain the key element in the election campaign debate, but the second lime of attack would focus on public finance. The SPD would actually fulfill the present government's promise of "a solid and consistent fiscal policy."
