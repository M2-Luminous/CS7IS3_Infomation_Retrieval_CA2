Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu met for one and a half hours in Seoul and confirmed that planned U.N. Security Council sanctions against North Korea are aimed at encouraging Pyongyang to hold dialogue for a negotiated solution, the officials said. Kakizawa and Han pledged close bilateral cooperation in dealing with North Korea's suspected nuclear arms development program, they said. The Japanese foreign minister made clear that Japan will "make utmost efforts within the Constitution" if the Security Council decides to adopt sanctions. Kakizawa dismissed reports that Japan is intransigent on taking punitive steps against North Korea, in an apparent denial of an article published in THE NEW YORK TIMES on Thursday claiming Japan is reluctant to levy sanctions. They also verified a trilateral agreement between Japan, South Korea and the U.S. on June 4 that the three countries would hold close contact while the U.N. discusses measures. The ministers reiterated that China's role in defusing the nuclear crisis is important, saying they must urge China not to use its veto when the Security Council votes on sanctions. Kakizawa told Han he will urge China to play an active role in settling the nuclear dispute when he visits China on Sunday. In Beijing, Kakizawa is expected to ask Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen for China's support for a resolution by the Security Council against Pyongyang. China has repeatedly expressed hope that the North Korean nuclear crisis could be resolved through negotiations. Kakizawa also held a meeting the same day with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam, in which Kim said relatively lengthy U.N. Security Council discussions on sanctions against North Korea may help Pyongyang return to the negotiating table, the officials said. Kim called such discussions a meaningful process for urging North Korea to make its nuclear program more transparent, they said.
