A statement issued by the group and distributed in Cairo yesterday, a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, said that the leadership of retired Lieutenant General Fathi Ahmad 'Ali, the Army's former commander in chief, "has not moved from the theorization stage to the implementation stage -- which has adversely affected its performance, reputation, and status inside and outside the country. In fact it has focused primarily on political action and ignored its main duty, thus losing its credibility and status in opposition action." [passage omitted] The officers decided to "dismiss Lt. Gen. Fathi and Major General al-Hadi Bushra (the third man in the organization) and to form a new leadership committee after consulting with the organization's offices in Europe and Britain." The breakaway group stressed that it "has nothing to do with any agreements, decisions, or statements issued by the leadership. And we stress our commitment to the principles and charter of the Democratic National Grouping" [passage omitted]
