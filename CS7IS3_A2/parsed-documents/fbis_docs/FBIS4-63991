Vice-Premier Valeriy Shmarov told journalists that the sides took "time out of 10-12 days" after which an agreement on the first state of the Black Sea Fleet's division may be signed "on the basis of almost prepared text of the document." He noted that despite efforts of both delegations "which worked for three days in two shifts," work has not been completed because every "subject of the division required great attention." Shmarov pointed out that the delegations of Russia and Ukraine "were on the verge of the document's readiness," however "some technical details had to be specified." In the opinion of a member of the Ukrainian delegation, Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk, the final document was not signed at the talks "not at the fault" of Kiev. He believes that the Ukrainian delegation "showed enough flexibility and readiness for compromise." Tarasyuk said that the Ukrainian side offered during the talks five various drafts agreement. At the same time he believes that the Moscow talks allows to speak about "burgeoning breakthrough," which "justifies the delay with the signing of the document." Tarasyuk hopes that within 10 days Ukraine and Russia will manage at the level of experts to specify and coordinate conditions of the division of the Black Sea Fleet and the Russian Naval bases in Ukraine.
