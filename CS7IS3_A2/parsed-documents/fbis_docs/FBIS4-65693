These are the words -- kindly taken from the "memorandum for the new government" published here on 8 May -- that the prime minister chose to describe his government's economic policy line in his program speech to parliament. It was not an obvious choice. The election platforms of some of the parties of the majority raised a fundamental question. Will the new majority's social base and political representatives, I wonder, be able to display impatience with state control, with rigidity, and with unproductive situations without, however, being taken over by impatience with the discipline of the state budget and with the rules that must govern the market? Of course, this question remains. It will be answered by actual conduct, not by policy statements. But by espousing the concept of "disciplined and strict economic liberalism," the prime minister accepts that it is on the basis of this criterion, and no others, that his government's economic policy must be judged. A negligent laissez-faire attitude to the rules that must govern the market, or a correct market economy accompanied by an unbalanced public finance situation are as much to be rejected as the state control that it is intended to combat. A government that espouses this aim and that accepts being judged on the basis of this aim is accepting an even clearer and stricter constraint, I think, than if it had submitted a program full of figures. Of course, the time for figures and specific measures will come soon. For the time being, the bare guidelines of the program permit us to hope that the anxieties expressed in our "memorandum" will be kept well in mind. The aim for the "first 100 days" is indeed to boost the economy -- but less to the detriment of the state budget than was expected. Of the seven measures announced for the first 100 days, six are, appropriately, directed toward enhancing the flexibility of the markets; and only one places a burden, at least in the immediate term, on the budget (tax relief for firms creating new jobs). Further tax incentives seem to have been postponed for a later stage. It was correct to say: "Intervention in support of the economy...will only really be such if they are compatible with the reform of the public finance situation." Still with regard to public finance, the idea has been accepted -- indeed, how could it not? -- that, despite the work begun by the Amato and Ciampi governments, the legacy inherited is a very onerous one. But if it is so, how could a policy to boost the economy be based on placing a further burden on the budget? As for the government's position on Economic and Monetary Union [EMU] -- another fear in recent weeks -- the following wise statement was made: "A careful examination of the Maastricht Treaty must not delay the implementation of the unification program." Public finance reform and European Union. If we connect these two matters --the prime minister did not do so, but perhaps his program speech was not the right place for this -- we must consider two necessities. First, the need for Italy not to evade the monitoring procedure connected with the next installment of the Community loan -- a useful and visible stimulus to the correction of the state budget for 1994, though from a currency viewpoint the loan will certainly be less necessary than was estimated at the beginning of 1993. Second, the need in a few months' time -- once a stringent finance bill for 1995 has been introduced -- for new lira exchange rates within the EMS [European Monetary System]. With fluctuation bands as broad as those currently permitted for all countries (15 percent either way), the decision should not impose impossible constraints and should at the same time enable Italy not to be excluded a priori from the EMU if it were to materialize in 1997. Indeed, according to the Maastricht Treaty, it will be necessary to observe the normal fluctuation bands during the previous two years, that is, 1995 and 1996.
