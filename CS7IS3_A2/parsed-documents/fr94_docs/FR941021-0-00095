FR941021-0-00095 FR941021-0-00019 50 CFR Part 675 [Docket No. 931100&hyph;4043; I.D. 101494A] Groundfish of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI). This action is necessary to prevent exceeding the 1994 apportionment of the Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI. EFFECTIVE DATE: 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), October 17, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, 907&hyph;586-7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the BSAI exclusive economic zone is managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 675. In accordance with §675.20(a)(7)(ii), the Pacific cod TAC for the BSAI was established by the final 1994 initial specifications of groundfish (59 FR 7656, February 16, 1994) and increased by an apportionment from the reserve (59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994) to 191,000 metric tons (mt). The 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear is 92,040 mt pursuant to §675.20(a)(3)(iv); 59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994; 59 FR 21673, April 26, 1994; and 59 FR 42776, August 19, 1994. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director), has determined, in accordance with §675.20(a)(8), that the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI soon will be reached. Therefore, the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 91,540 mt, with consideration that 500 mt will be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the BSAI. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance has been reached. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Pacific cod by vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear in the BSAI, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., October␣17, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Directed fishing standards for applicable gear types may be found in the regulations at §675.20(h). Classification This action is taken under §675.20 and is exempt from review under E.O. 12866. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq . Dated: October 17, 1994. Joe P. Clem, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
