FR940725-1-00067 FR940725-1-00010 Proposed §23.1585(c) for multiengine airplanes would require compliance with (a) plus the following information requirements from current paragraph (c): approach and landing with an engine inoperative; balked landing with an engine inoperative; and V SSE as determined in §23.149. Current paragraph (c) requirements for information on procedures for continuing a takeoff following an engine failure and continuing a climb following an engine failure would be moved to proposed (e) for normal, utility, and acrobatic multiengines. Proposed §23.1585(d) would apply to normal, utility and acrobatic airplanes. These airplanes would have to comply with paragraph (a) and either (b) or (c). These airplanes would also have to comply with the normal takeoff, climb, and the abandoning a takeoff procedures, which are currently contained in paragraph (a). As discussed above, §23.1585(c), for normal, utility and acrobatic multiengine airplanes, would require compliance with proposed (a), (c), and (d) plus requirements for continuing a takeoff or climb with one engine inoperative, which are now in current paragraph (c) (1) and (2). Proposed §23.1585(f) would require commuter category airplanes to comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) plus the normal takeoff requirements from current paragraph (a)(2) revised; accelerate-stop requirements, which are new, and continuing takeoff after engine failure, which are in current paragraph (c)(1). Proposed §23.1585(g) would be the same as current paragraph (d) on identifying operating conditions, which necessitate fuel system independence. Proposed §23.1585(h) would be the same as current paragraph (e) for disconnecting the battery from its charging source. Proposed §23.1585(i) is based on current paragraph (g) on the total quantity of usable fuel and adds information on the effect of pump failure on unusable fuel. Proposed new §23.1585(j) would require procedures for safe operation of the airplanes' systems and equipment. Although not currently required, this is current industry practice. Present §23.1585(h), commuter category airplane procedures for restarting turbine engines in flight, would no longer be necessary because the requirement would be covered under paragraph (a)(4). Section 23.1587␣Performance Information Proposed §23.1587 would rearrange existing material, delete ski plane performance exceptions, delete the option of calculating approximate performance, delete stall altitude loss data, and require overweight landing performance in §23.1587. Stalling speed requirements of current paragraph (c) (2) and (3) would be combined and moved to paragraph (a)(1) and would reference the stalling speed requirement of §23.49. Information on the steady rate and gradient of climb with all engines operating would be required by proposed paragraph (a)(2). This is revised from current paragraph (a)(2). The reference would be changed to proposed §23.69(a). Proposed (a)(3) would require, as is now required, that landing distance be determined under §23.75, and would add that this must be provided for each airport altitude, standard temperature, and type of surface for which it is valid. Proposed paragraph (a)(4) would require information on the effect on landing distance when landing on other than hard surface, as determined under §23.45(g). Proposed paragraph (a)(5) would cover information on the effects on landing distance of runway slope and wind. This would provide the pilot with data with which to account for these factors in his or her takeoff calculations. Current requirements in §23.1587(b) on ski planes would be deleted. Proposed paragraph (b) would add a steady angle of climb/descent requirement as determined under §23.77(a). This requirement would apply to all non-WAT airplanes. Proposed paragraph (c) would apply to normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, rather than all airplanes as in current paragraph (c). The proposed (c) would delete stall altitude loss requirements that are in current paragraph (c)(1). As mentioned, current stalling speed requirements would be moved to proposed paragraph (a)(1). Current paragraph (c)(4) on cooling climb speed data would also be deleted since all airplanes would cool at scheduled speeds. Proposed paragraph (c)(1) would pertain to the takeoff distance determined under §23.53 and the type of surface. Proposed paragraph (c)(2) and (c)(3) pertain to the effect on takeoff distance of the runway surface, slope, and headwind and tailwind component. Proposed paragraph (c)(4) would impose a new requirement pertaining to the one-engine inoperative takeoff climb/descent performance for WAT-limited airplanes. This pertains only to reciprocating engine-powered airplanes. It would provide the pilot with the information determined under proposed §23.66. Proposed paragraph (c)(5) pertains to enroute rate and gradient of climb/descent determined under §23.69(b), for multiengine airplanes. Proposed §23.1587(d) for commuter category airplanes would incorporate the present data plus the addition of accelerate-stop data, overweight landing performance, and the effect of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces. In addition, in order to consolidate all of the requirements for what must appear in the AFM in subpart G, proposed §23.1587(d)(10) would contain the requirement, found in existing §23.1323(d), to show the relationship between IAS and CAS in the AFM. Section 23.1589␣Loading Information Proposed §23.1589(b) would make editorial changes to simplify the text, with no change in requirements. Appendix E Appendix E would be deleted for the reasons given in the proposed change to §23.25.
