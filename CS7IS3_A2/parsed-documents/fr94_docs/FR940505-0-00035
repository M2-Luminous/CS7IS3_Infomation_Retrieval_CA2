FR940505-0-00035 FR940505-0-00009 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;41; Amendment 39&hyph;8907; AD 94&hyph;09&hyph;18] Airworthiness Directives; General Electric Company; CF6 Series Turbofan Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;6/&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines, that requires an inspection for cracks in the stage 1 high pressure turbine (HPT) disk rim bolt holes, and stage 2 HPT disk rim and inner bolt holes; and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. This amendment is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage 1 HPT disk failure which resulted in an aborted takeoff. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage 1 or stage 2 HPT disk failure, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to the aircraft. DATES: Effective June 6, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from General Electric Aircraft Engines, CF6 Distribution Clerk, room 132, 111 Merchant Street, Cincinnati, OH 45246. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Ganley, Aerospace Engineer, Engine Certification Office, FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; telephone (617) 238&hyph;7138; fax (617) 238&hyph;7199. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6&hyph;6/&hyph;45/&hyph;50 series turbofan engines was published as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on October 19, 1993 (58 FR 53893). That action proposed to require an eddy current inspection for cracks in the stage 1 high pressure turbine (HPT) disk rim bolt holes, and stage 2 HPT disk rim and inner bolt holes; and replacement, if necessary, with serviceable parts. The inspection, and replacement, if necessary, would be performed in accordance with GE CF6&hyph;6 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;1002, dated February 12, 1993; CF6&hyph;6 SB No. 72&hyph;1003, Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 72&hyph;1057, Revision 1, dated June 17, 1993; and CF6&hyph;50 SB No. 72&hyph;1059, dated February 12, 1993. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the rule as proposed. One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed rule should be replaced by 1,000 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly. One commenter states that the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in compliance paragraph (b)(6) of the proposed rule should be extended to one year after the effective date of this AD, in order to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs in part. The FAA agrees that the current compliance end-date may cause forced engine removals; however, an extension of this date alone may still cause an undue burden on low cycle/low time operators. A cyclic definition in lieu of a compliance end-date will help alleviate this potential problem. The manufacturer has informed the FAA that a typical operator accumulates approximately 1,000 CIS in one year. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. Therefore, the compliance end-date of February 28, 1994, in paragraph (b)(6) in the proposed rule has been replaced in this final rule by 1,000 CIS after the effective date of this AD. Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(2) should be removed, and 4,500 cycles since new (CSN) should be replaced by 5,400 CSN to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly. Two commenters state that the compliance end-date of May 31, 1994, in compliance paragraph (a)(3) should be replaced by 1,400 CIS after the effective date of this AD to avoid forced engine removals. The FAA concurs. This change is consistent with the results of the failure analysis performed by the manufacturer, and is supported by the positive inspection results to date. This final rule has been revised accordingly.
