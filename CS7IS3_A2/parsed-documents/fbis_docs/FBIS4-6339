FBIS4-6339 "dreas076_i_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-076 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Cambodia Public Charges of Thailand's Aiding KR To End Public Charges of Thailand's Aiding KR To End BK2004042494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 20 Apr 94 p A3 BK2004042494 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Cambodia has promised to stop publicly accusing Thailand of continuing to aid the Khmer Rouge [KR] according to Sakthip Krairiksh, Thailand's Ambassador to Cambodia. "(Cambodian Foreign Minister) Prince (Norodom) Sirivudh assured me that Cambodia will no longer speak of such things to the press so that the situation gets better," Sakthip said in a telephone interview. Sakthip visited Sirivudh on Monday to lodge a formal protest over Cambodia's allegations that Thailand provided refuge to a Khmer Rouge leader and allowed the Maoist faction's troops into its territory. According to the Ambassador, the six-point protest tells of Thailand's stance on the intemal affairs of Cambodia and its dissatisfaction over allegations made by some Cambodian leaders that Thailand assisted the faction in fighting against Phnom Penh government troops. It also urged Cambodia to take measures to ensure that fighting there will not seriously affect Thais living along the border. The protest also called for evidence for every allegation made by Cambodia, Sakthip said. "I informed the (foreign) minister that he could call me any time for explanation and discussion when questions of such kind arose. It is better to solve this sort of problem through diplomatic channels." Sakthip said, adding that the situation could return to normal as soon as the two parties stopped speaking through the media. Sakthip said that Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen had been due to visit Thailand after Cambodia's traditional New Year day (April 13) but said no official contact over the trip had been made between the two governments. "Therefore, this cannot be called a cancellation since we never had it officially confirmed," he said. "Besides, we will not be ready to receive Hun Sen since Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will be in Malaysia and Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri in Burma at the time (of the visit)," he said. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak said the military was ready to protect the country from future attacks by Cambodian government forces. "The Army is prepared to maintain security along the border," he told reporters. Vijit insisted that Thailand has been sincere in dealing with Cambodia and the Army has followed government policy of not getting involved in the internal affairs of the war-torn country. He also said that as neighbours the two countries should solve this problem as soon as possible. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan yesterday said Thailand and Cambodia are becoming aware that public slanging matches concerning the Khmer Rouge are counter-productive and should stop forthwith. Surin said civilians of both countries living along the border have to shoulder the effects of misunderstanding between both countries. The effects include fighting spilling over from western Cambodia. "Thai Ambassador to Phnom Penh Sakthip Krairiksh has submitted a protest note to Prince Norodom Sirivudh, the foreign minister. So far Cambodia has not responded, which indicates that Cambodia doesn't want to prolong the issue," he said. According to Surin, the country is still waiting for evidence from Cambodia to support Prince Ranariddh's claim that he has photographic evidence proving Thailand's support for the Khmer Rouge. The dispute should be a good lesson for both countries that criticism made publicly cannot solve bilateral misunderstandings, he said. An informed source said U.S. Ambassador Designate to Cambodia Charles Twining, recently informed a hearing organized by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the Thai government genuinely wants to support the legitimate government of Cambodia.
