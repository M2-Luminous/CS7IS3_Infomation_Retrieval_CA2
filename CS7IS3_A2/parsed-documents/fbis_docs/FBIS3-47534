When asked if there were any U.S. POWs left behind in Laos and if Laos is doing enough on the POW/MIA issue, he said that this issue had received extensive review in both the legislative and executive branches. Following its year-long investigation into the POW/MIA issue, the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA affairs noted in its final report: "American officials did not have certain knowledge that any specific prisoner or prisoners were being left behind." The counselor added that cooperation on the POW/MIA issue is a priority in the U.S. relations with Laos. The U.S. will continue to press for additional cooperation and progress on this issue. 505 Americans remain unaccounted for in Laos. Last year, the U.S. and Laos conducted six joint field activities. However, more than 80 percent of the persons unaccounted for in Laos were actually lost in areas under the control of the North Vietnamese. This demonstrates the importance of the first-ever trilateral operation with Vietnam, which was completed on December 20, said the release. The release also added that the first field activity for 1994 was scheduled to begin later this month.
