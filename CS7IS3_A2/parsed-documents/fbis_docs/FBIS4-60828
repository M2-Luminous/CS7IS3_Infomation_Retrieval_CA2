Andrey Kozyrev is True to Russian Tsar Precepts"] [Text] A ministerial meeting on the Bosnian conflict settlement may take place late next week. This was announced by Andrey Kozyrev on returning from Geneva and Bonn where he talked with Warren Christopher, Alain Juppe, and Klaus Kinkel. The conflicting sides are not to take part in the talks. According to the minister, it is important now to hammer out a "consolidated approach to the problem," something to be taken up by representatives of the United Nations, the EC, Russia, the United States, Great Britain, and France. Kozyrev voiced satisfaction that the Western partners "do not become locked into forcible solutions." He believes that the meeting of six ministers may become a "major stage" in the preparation of a summit in the same format. Since the talks with Christopher had left a somewhat painful aftertaste, your SEGODNYA correspondent thought it fitting to ask if a Bosnian settlement might become victim to the Atlantic unity Europeans treasure so much. Kozyrev replied that Russia also treasures partnership with the United States, but this only favors the search for a shared conception. Reports from Gorazde, where General Rose stated that the Muslim side had deluded the world community as to the number of victims and extent of destruction in the city, lent Kozyrev's trip some poignancy. Kozyrev said to this that the Muslims would of course be doing all they can to provoke air strikes against their enemy. In his view, the important thing is not to reply to provocations, but that the Serbs' reply was "absolutely inadequate" to the situation. Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked the minister if he thought he had really been too carried away with political infighting, as some newspapers believe. Kozyrev answered: "We would have been good-for-nothing politicians and good-for-nothing democrats had we not paid attention to public opinion." The matter is, the minister went on to say, precisely which amendments to make, and with whom to compromise. "Some criticize us for having sold ourselves to the Bolsheviks, others for having sold ourselves to the Americans. This is normal, this keeps us on the ball," Kozyrev said. He underlined that thanks to Moscow's vigorous actions, the NATO plan was cut back "50 or so percent." An alternative for Russia would have been a categorical "no" with no regard for the situation whatever. In the minister's view, this is "extremism toward the other side." Kozyrev thinks that all the talk about Russia's being robbed, that it has once again been passed over and denied its fair share, is nothing but a symptom of an inferiority complex. It is an inferiority complex that boosted the political career of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. "It is on this crest," he underlined, "that dictatorial regimes are made. As for democracy, this means self-respect. It is out of self-respect that we cannot protect barbarity." He recalled in this connection that it was none other than the Russian tsar who first had the idea for the convention banning uncivilized methods of warfare -- this tradition should be maintained. In Kozyrev's words, one should not think that every word of Moscow is going to be taken as an eye-opener. "You cannot say the men in Moscow know precisely what to do. But then they do not know it in Washington either," the minister concluded.
