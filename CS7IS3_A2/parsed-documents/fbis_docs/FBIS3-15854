The new concept is aimed at enlarging Latvia's contacts with the European Union, the West European Union and NATO, said committee head Alexander Kirsteins. Latvia should prepare a free trade treaty with the European Union and to join the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly as an associated member, Kirsteins said, commenting on the most urgent diplomatic tasks. Goodneighborly relations with Russia is another mainstream of Latvia's political activities. Russia, as the legal heir of the collapsed Soviet Union, should recognize that Latvia was forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. This recognition could be regarded as a landmark for building better relations between the two countries, said Kirsteins. Latvia must soon adopt a citizenship law and a document regulating the rights of non-citizens, Kirsteins noted. Kirsteins also praised President Boris Yeltsin's initiative to draft a uniform human rights convention to ensure mutual guarantees in the field of human rights preservation in Latvia and Russia. The Latvian prime minister plans to address a Saeima plenary session with a more detailed version of his security report.
