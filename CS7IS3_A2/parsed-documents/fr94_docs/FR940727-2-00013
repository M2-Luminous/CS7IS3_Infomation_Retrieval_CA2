FR940727-2-00013 FR940727-2-00010 DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY Morgantown Energy Technology Center Financial Assistance Solicitation Availability Notice (Cooperative Agreement) AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Morgantown Energy Technology Center. ACTION: Notice of Availability of a Financial Assistance Solicitation. SUMMARY: On or about August 2, 1994, The U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, plans to issue a Solicitation for Cooperative Agreement Proposal (SCAP) No. DE&hyph;SC21&hyph;94MC31176 for the solicitation of applications in support of research and development entitled ``Utility Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) Technology Readiness Testing and Pre-Commercial Demonstration.'' Authority for this action is the DOE Organization Act Public Law 95&hyph;91 and the DOE Financial Assistance Regulations 10 CFR part 600. DOE anticipates multiple awards with a project duration of approximately 60 months. DOE plans to make available funds totalling $197,000,000 over the project duration; a minimum cost share of 35% for the readiness testing effort and 50% for the pre-commercial demonstration effort is required. DATES: Proposals are due 60 days after release of solicitation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Crystal A. Sharp, IO7, U.S. Department of Energy, Morgantown Energy Technology Center, P.O. Box 880, Morgantown, West Virginia 26507&hyph;0880, Telephone (304) 291&hyph;4386, Procurement Request No. 21&hyph;94MC31176.000. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The objective of the project is for participants to successfully demonstrate, at full-scale, a highly efficient, natural-gas-fired gas turbine system for utility-scale power generation. To accomplish this objective, participants shall first show (at an appropriate scale) technology readiness of parts and subsystems critical to their ATS. Participants will design parts that are critical to the ATS and plan and execute tests of components and subsystems to prove the technology readiness of the design. Having established technology readiness, participants will finalize the design, build the ATS at full scale, and demonstrate that the ATS meets performance targets. Copies of the SCAP may be obtained by submitting a written request to the address provided above. The solicitation package will be provided on electronic media utilizing WordPerfect Version 5.1. Telephone requests will not be honored. A separate Federal Register notice will be issued for Solicitation Number DE&hyph;SC21&hyph;94MC31173 research titled ``Industrial Advanced Turbine Systems (ATS) Development and Demonstration'' program.
