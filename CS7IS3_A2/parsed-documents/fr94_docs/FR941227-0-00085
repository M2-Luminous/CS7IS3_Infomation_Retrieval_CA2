FR941227-0-00085 FR941227-0-00016 33 CFR Parts 1 and 153 [CGD 91&hyph;225] Delegations of Authority Under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, As Amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, As Amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is redesignating and revising certain regulations relating to delegation of authority. The changes incorporate amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) made by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90); provisions added to the United States Code by OPA 90; and certain provisions of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). These statutes relate to discharges and releases of oil, hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants. The changes reflect, in large part, additional responsibilities assigned to Coast Guard On-Scene Coordinators to direct responses to spills of oil and hazardous substances. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: CDR K. W. Keane, Chief, Pollution Response Branch, G&hyph;MEP&hyph;2, (202) 267&hyph;2611. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Drafting Information The principal person involved in drafting this document is Ms. Jacqueline Sullivan, Project Manager, OPA 90 Staff. Background and Purpose The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) [Pub. L. 101&hyph;380] amended several provisions of section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) [33 U.S.C. 1321] relating to the prevention of and response to discharges of oil and hazardous substances. Several new functions under both OPA 90 and the amended section 311 of the FWPCA were vested in the President. Others were vested in the Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard is operating. Executive Order 12777 [3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 351, 56 FR 54757, October 22, 1991] assigned many new functions and reassigned many preexisting functions to the Secretary of Transportation, and the Secretary reassigned many new and preexisting functions to the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (l), (m), and (ll)]. The Commandant, by internal directive dated March 19, 1992, redelegated most of the functions under OPA 90 and section 311 of the FWPCA. Copies of the Commandant's redelegation memorandum are available by calling G&hyph;MEP at the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. The amendments to 33 CFR subpart 1.01 in this rulemaking reflect much of that redelegation. These rules also delegate authority to Coast Guard officials to carry out certain functions under CERCLA, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9601, et seq ., Pub. L. 96&hyph;510, 94 Stat. 2767, as amended by Pub. L. 99&hyph;499, 100 Stat. 1613] relating to the release of hazardous substances. Executive Order 12580 delegated the President's functions under CERCLA, as amended, to the heads of various Executive Branch departments and agencies, including the Secretary of Transportation [3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 193, 52 FR 2923, January 29, 1987]. The Secretary of Transportation has redelegated certain functions to the Commandant of the Coast Guard [49 CFR 1.46 (ff) and (gg)]. This rule further delegates authority to designated Coast Guard officials under CERCLA relating to the enforcement of financial- responsibility requirements, including the assessment of civil penalties. Discussion of Rules The revisions, removals, and additions to the regulations in 33 CFR parts 1 and 153 are organized in the following manner:
