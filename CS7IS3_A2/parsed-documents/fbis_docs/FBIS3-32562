O ESTADO has learned that the minister is not willing to be questioned by the German Government, which conditions participation in programs including the transfer of high technology to Brazilian guarantees that it will use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. The Senate Foreign Affairs Committee must ratify amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and to the quadripartite agreement signed between Brazil, Argentina, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC). After months of negotiations, Senator Dirceu Carneiro (Brazilian Social Democracy Party - Santa Catarina), who coordinates the Committee's project for nuclear safeguard, endorsed on 3 February amendments to the text of the quadripartite agreement for the supervision of nuclear research in Brazil. The text, however, was not voted on for lack of quorum. There will probably be no quorum in the next meeting of the Committee, which will take place on 10 February, one day before the Carnival weekend begins. Foreign Minister Amorim has not officially confirmed if he will postpone his trip. He admitted on 4 February, however, that he would like to continue negotiations with the German Government. He said: "It would be much better if I could take with me two ratified accords. Instead of being questioned about them, we would be free to begin talks about scientific cooperation and access to technology," adding: "I believe Congress is fulfilling its duty and analyzing the texts." The minister admitted that Germany may be "concerned" about possible consequences of a delay in ratifying these agreements. "Nonetheless, Germany is aware that the delay is not caused by lack of interest," he said.
