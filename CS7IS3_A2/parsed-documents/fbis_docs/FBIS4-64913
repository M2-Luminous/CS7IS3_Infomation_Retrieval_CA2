Doubters need only read the following interview to be convinced. Looking for all the world like he could not care less about the scandals he has been plagued with, he rises gamely to the fight. This man plays a mean poker game; blessed with psychological insight and unafraid to resort to bluff, he goes for high stakes. Should he win the game (10 percent or more in the European election), nobody will be able to ignore him. Especially nobody within the Left, as success for him would dash [Socialist Party, PS, First Secretary] Michel Rocard's hopes [of being appointed the party's presidential candidate]. While President Francois Mitterrand and his entourage maintain they have had no hand in the Tapie phenomenon, it is crystal clear that, over the past few years, Mr. Mitterrand has used Mr. Tapie as a wild card. Has the president developed a fascination for the self-made, sligthly loutish billionaire, or does he merely view him as a pawn in his anti-Rocard strategy? Either way, the president has backed Bernard Tapie too often for his denials to sound genuine. Therefore there is no need to give a detailed account of the improbable and grotesque session in which he supposedly chided his aides for squandering their benevolent attention on Mr. Tapie. The truth is simpler. The Tapie move has already been successful beyond the president's wildest dreams. So continued overt support to Bernard Tapie might damage the PS' party presidential image. This would not be the best way to go about imposing on this party another candidate than Michel Rocard. Mr. Mitterrand must change tack somewhat, but nobody is likely to be fooled. Should Bernard Tapie's list "be a success," as he himself puts it, one can foresee major disruptions on the French political scene. As the new leader of the MRG [Left Radicals Movement], he has adopted a resolutely left-wing stance. For the time being, that is. He has already warned that his next battle will entail an attempt at breaking the "binary" rhythm which has traditionally dominated French politics. This means -- although he denies it -- that he might model his conduct after Silvio Berlusconi's. In any case, one thing is now certain: The political class will not get rid of Mr. Tapie by merely calling him supposedly ignominious names such as "populist" or "demagogue." Mr. Rocard may become his first victim, but everybody else has now good reasons to worry. [passage omitted] [Reinhard] You head a list for the European election. Do you have a plan for Europe that distinguishes your list from the others? [Tapie] I am positively certain that Europe can only work if we build a federal Europe. [Reinhard] This is not exactly the most popular position these days. [Tapie] Actually, it is the most unpopular there is. Which goes to show once more that I am rather less of a populist than all the others, including those "Europeans at heart" who want to build Europe, albeit not this one because their first concern is to tell the public what they think it wants to hear. Quite frankly, I think that is disgusting. [Reinhard] This is supposed to be the position of Dominique Baudis [who heads the majority's list]; why are you making his territory your own? [Tapie] Because I believe in a federal Europe and I am not afraid of saying so. Baudis does not have the guts to do it because that is unpopular. [passage omitted] [Reinhard] Your list is mostly disruptive for the Left. Why are you fighting the people who took you to the top? [Tapie] These people never respected me. They used me. [Reinhard] What will happen if Rocard suffers a severe setback in the 12 June election? [Tapie] Can one change everything without changing anything? Are we one day to acknowledge at last the fact that we cannot change anything without shuffling things and people around a bit? If Rocard succeeds, it will mean his presidential potential is good. Will that be enough to beat the Right? This is a question that is rather more pressing for the Right than for the Left. If they keep up their internal bickering, everything is possible. [Reinhard] But what if Rocard fails? [Tapie] If Rocard fails, not only the Left will suffer. There will be a general redistribution of all political cards. French politics has traditionally been an unavoidable binary system which had nothing to do with the aspirations and opinions of the electorate, nor with what has been going on elsewhere in the world. Thanks to the European election, this nonsense has now been exposed for what it is. For example, the Rocard list has much more in common with the Baudis list than the latter has with that of De Villiers [leader of the anti-Maastricht list], or Rocard's has with that of [former Socialist Defense Minister Jean-Pierre] Chevenement. [Reinhard] However, the presidential election will take place in a year, and the Left needs a champion. So if Rocard is not it, who else? [Tapie] If Rocard fails, this does not mean that the Left will collapse. It will redefine itself around someone else. [Reinhard] Someone from the Socialist Party? [Tapie] We shall see. If Rocard fails, there might not be anybody else that is able to win. However, there is no shortage of men on the Left. There are Delors, Lang, and Kouchner. And why not Badinter, or a newcomer. [Reinhard] You said recently that you did not feel ready for the part. Are you betting on becoming the game's referee, short of being the Left's candidate? [Tapie] Of course I am. This is why they do not want me to obtain a good score. I wish I could be there when they pick their man, so as to be sure that those who are with me are well represented. [Reinhard] What is your measure of Rocard's hostility toward you? [Tapie] Rocard refuses to have a debate on television with me. And yet, left-leaning French people would certainly like to know exactly where the Left stands today. They want to understand the difference between Radicalism and Socialism. [Reinhard] And what is the difference? [Tapie] There are those who think that solving the unemployment problem is a matter of working only four days a week for four days' worth of pay, and those who, like myself, believe that we need to work more than we used to. I think that we need to work six days a week, not five, because the only way to create wealth is to work harder. Rocard thinks the solution is working less rather than working more. There is a difference here, and people have a right to understand why. [Reinhard] Rocard will not debate with you, and that is fair enough. Is this the only thing you hold against him? [Tapie] There is also the anti-Tapie lobbying campaign that Rocard's buddies have been conducting. This lobbying of the editors of LE MONDE, LIBERATION, LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, or LE POINT is being led by lawyer Tony Dreyfus. And that is intolerable. It is ineffective and intolerable. It is such an irritant that I might lose my temper during the last days of the campaign. [Reinhard] Some commentators believe that the president has helped you recruit people for your list. A case in point is Catherine Lalumiere, whom he reportedly encouraged to join. [Tapie] First of all, my list is a good list. And we did not need anybody's help to put it together. As far as Catherine Lalumiere [former Council of Europe Secretary General] is concerned, she did not ask the president's assent, and had she done so, she would not have got it. [passage omitted]
