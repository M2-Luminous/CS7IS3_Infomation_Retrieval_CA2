Villar Anleu, who represents the northern Quiche Department and is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, won the support of 70 of the 91 deputies who attended the regular evening session of Congress. The Guatemalan Christian Democracy [DCG], the Solidarity Action Movement [MAS], dissidents of the Union of the National Center [UNC], the Guatemalan Republican Front [FRG], and minority parties supported Villar's slate, made up of three vice presidents and eight secretaries. DCG Secretary Alfonso Cabrera and Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla Vega, who returned to his seat on 12 January after losing an eye in an attack in May 1993, headed the negotiations to draw up Villar's slate. Villar, who was head of the DCG bloc last year, ran against the slate headed by Carlos Perez Castaneda and made up of UCN and FRG candidates, which received the remaining 21 votes. Neither the 12 deputies of the National Vanguard Party (PAN) who had resigned nor their alternates attended the regular session headed by Lobo Dubon. Villar will be sworn in on 14 January by Lobo Dubon, who acknowledged Villar's victory on 12 January at a solemn session. One of Villar's first tasks will be to listen to the government report that President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will present on 15 January. This directorate will not complete its one-year term as established by the Constitution because if the yes vote wins in the 30 January referendum, Guatemalans will elect a new Congress this year. The Congress Directorate is composed as follows: President: Marco Vinicio Villar (DCG) First Vice President: Jorge Alberto Monroy (formerly of UCN) Second Vice President: Marco Tulio Merida (MAS) Third Vice President: Juan Francisco Alfaro (formerly of UCN) First Secretary: Clodoveo Dominguez (DCG) Second Secretary: Eduardo Mendez Pinelo (formerly of UCN) Third Secretary: Francisco Reyes Ixcamey (formerly of FRG) Fourth Secretary: Rafael Oliveros Ramirez (MAS) Fifth Secretary: Edna de Ruano (formerly of UCN) Sixth Secretary: Felipe Franco Trujillo (MAS) Seventh Secretary: Pedro Gomez Chavez (formerly of UCN) Eighth Secretary: Jose Aguirre Quinteros (PID) [Democratic Institutional Party]
