"It is shocking for the US government to show contempt for the norms governing international relations and blatantly undermine the sovereignty of China and try to split China," foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a weekly press briefing. Provisions contained in the Foreign Relations Authorisation Act adopted by the U.S. Congress on April 28 instruct the director of the US Informations Agency "to seek to establish an office" in the Tibetan capital Lhasa. The office would promote the discussion of human rights, promote U.S. private sector involvement in educational and cultural activities, advise Washington on Tibetan popular opinion and disseminate information on the United States. "What the US government is going to do in this connection must have prior consent on the part of the Chinese Government," Wu said, adding: "We will definitely not agree." Wu slammed the act for "even going so far as to name Tibet as a country" and demanded that Washington strictly abide by the principle that Tibet is an integral part of China. While President Bill Clinton has agreed in principle with the sentiments contained in the relevant provisions, he has expressed reservations that their formulation may infringe on the president's prerogative in negotiations with foreign governments. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs said Wednesday that Washington was keen to see more progress from Beijing on the question of Tibet, most notably on U.S. calls for a meeting between Tibet's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, and Chinese officials.
