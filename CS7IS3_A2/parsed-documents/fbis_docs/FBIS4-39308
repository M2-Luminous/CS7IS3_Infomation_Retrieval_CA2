And this applying of the brakes is no coincidence: The large-scale exposure of the Ames couple entailed a huge scandal in the United States over how, indeed, this was allowed to happen, and why it was overlooked. Skillfully steering the course of events, the state has made a move which is not without interest. The intelligence services have been given the task of uncovering the exact extent of the damage done by the Ames. But even a battle waged by the most talented investigators will prove of no help if the main defendant does not want to "own up." [passage omitted] While Ames and the jury think things over, the effects of the outburst of "spy fever" are starting to be felt in the United States, according to information from the serious newspaper THE WASHINGTON POST. Many CIA staffers feel that they are being subjected to a wage freeze and that rejections of promotion requests and threats of disciplinary financial penalties and enforced separations are becoming more frequent. Punitive measures are primarily affecting those intelligence staffers who, in the nature of their service, either directed or worked with Ames. What is curious is that these investigations were triggered by a certain "former Communist Party official knowledgeable about the activities of Soviet intelligence." He proffered information to American counterintelligence bodies which narrowed the circle of the search and put them on the trail of A. Ames. It is no secret that there is another version too: A. Ames was allegedly betrayed by a Russian Foreign Intelligence Service staffer. This information, to put it mildly, does not accord with reality, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA's correspondent was told at the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service Bureau for Public and Media Relations. This story was told in some form by one Lyubimov, former chief intelligence officer in Copenhagen, and nowadays it is periodically given play by the radio, television, and LITERATURNAYA GAZETA. According to claims by THE WASHINGTON POST, a draft law is currently under preparation in Congress designed to improve the system for vetting staffers and safeguarding security in the CIA. In contains provisions which envisage setting up a national center for the purposes of the speedy and effective discovery of spies, and which endow the FBI with extensive powers concerning the counterintelligence security of the CIA, including in the sphere of vetting its staffers. Naturally, this is opposed vigorously by the intelligence department leadership, which is concerned about the deterioration of relations not only with the FBI, but also with the American legislators.
