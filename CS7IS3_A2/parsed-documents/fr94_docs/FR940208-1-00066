The owner or operator of each storage vessel greater than or equal to 75 cubic meters used to store gasoline shall equip each storage vessel according to the requirements in §60.112b(a)(1) through (4) of this chapter. At new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations, compliance shall be achieved upon startup. Existing bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations shall be in compliance as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than February 8, 1997 §63.424 Standards: Equipment leaks. (a) Each owner or operator of a new bulk gasoline terminal or new pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart shall comply with the requirements of §60.482&hyph;1 to 60.482&hyph;10 of this chapter, except as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. At new bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations, initial compliance shall be achieved upon startup. (b) Each owner or operator of an existing bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart shall: (1) monitor pump seals in accordance with §60.482&hyph;2 of this chapter, except the frequency of monitoring specified in §60.482&hyph;2(a)(1) of this chapter shall be on a quarterly basis; and (2) monitor valves in accordance with §60.482&hyph;7 of this chapter, except the frequency of initial monitoring specified in §60.482&hyph;7(a) of this chapter shall be on a quarterly basis. The provisions of §60.482&hyph;7(c) of this chapter do not apply.

(d) Owners or operators of bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations subject to the provisions of this subpart shall not cause or allow gasoline to be spilled, discarded in sewers, stored in open containers, or handled in any other manner that would result in vapor release to the atmosphere. §63.425 Test methods and procedures. (a) Each owner or operator subject to the emission standard for loading racks in §63.422(b) shall conduct a performance test on the vapor processing system according to the test methods and procedures in §60.503 of this chapter, except a reading of 500 ppm shall be used to determine the level of leaks under §60.503(b) of this chapter to be repaired. If a flare is used to control loading rack emissions, and emissions from this device cannot be measured using these methods and procedures, the provisions of §63.11(b) shall apply. (b) For each performance test conducted under paragraph (a) of this section, a monitored operating parameter value for the vapor processing system shall be determined using the following procedure:
