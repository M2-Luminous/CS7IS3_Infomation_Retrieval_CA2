Asked to predict the outcome of the meeting, at which PDP members were expected to consider pulling out of the coalition, Chuan said tersely: "Breakup". Chuan was speaking after lunching with the four deputy prime ministers Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri (PDP deputy leader) and Industry Minister Sanan Khachonprasat (Democrat). Asked why he looked so happy even though there are problems in the PDP, Chuan said there was nothing wrong with the PDP. He simply smiled when asked whether he would cancel a pending visit to South Korea. Members of the PDP's religious faction have on several occasions called for the party to withdraw from the government in a bid to regain popular support. They have also threatened to oust Deputy Prime Minister Bunchu Rotchanasathian as party leader. Sanan, the Democrat secretary general, said the PDP can handle its internal problems, but he said he didn't know what would happen in the event of the PDP withdrawing from the government. "The decision will rest with the prime minister," he said. Sanan dismissed speculation that he had approached opposition parties to replace the PDP. He believes the PDP's internal problems will be solved before Parliament debates the Budget Bill for the 1995 fiscal year. "I'm confident the government partners can stay together," he said. In the meantime, he added, there no reason for the government dissolve the House of Representatives -- and there would be no problem if the PDP withdrew from the government. Phinit Chantarasurin (Chat Thai-Lampang) said no opposition party will join the Chuan administration choosing instead to maintain a clear and united stance. "Opposition parties have promised not to join the Chuan government, but I can't do anything if one of then joins the government," he said. Phinit said the government should reshuffle Cabinet line-ups so it can run the country in the interests of the people. The opposition should have a joint resolution to file a no-confidence motion against the government. Deputy Solidarity leader Khanin Bunsuwan said his party has done nothing wrong and will not pull out of the coalition. Nor has the government any reason to sack Solidarity, he said. If the Solidarity Party supports a motion sponsored by 21 PDP rebels, it would have to consider the new conditions, Kanin said. The party vowed to support the motion last week, but the motion was not debated.
