FBIS4-34868 "drlat123_b_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-123 Daily Report 24 Jun 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Senators React to U.S. Visa, Green Card Suspension Senators React to U.S. Visa, Green Card Suspension FL2406224094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in Creole 1030 GMT 24 Jun 94 FL2406224094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio Creole BFN [Report by correspondent Daly Valet] [Excerpts] Many people might consider U.S. Government officials, both past and present, the leaders of the putschists and the leaders in stalling tactics, following the failure of the Washington and Governors Island agreements. If the United States truly controls everything in Haiti, an important step has been taken with Bill Clinton's latest decisions. This important step has caused many Haitians problems, lavalassian [Aristide partisan] and putschist alike. If you (?doubt that), go to Rue des Miracles and see the Bank of Boston; if you go to Delmas 18, you will see that the Bank of Nova Scotia is closed; if you go to Citibank on Delmas Road, you will see that all its doors are closed. Not one penny is available to the Haitians, regardless of their political positions. Consequently, many people (?are angry). You can visit parliament in the meantime. The U.S. Government has revoked the green cards and visas of many legislators who set up Jonassaint's de facto government. The visas and the green cards of Thomas Eddy Dupiton, Dejean Belizaire, Bernard Sansaricq, Osny Eugene, and Romel Manigat have been revoked. Sen. Dupiton says he did not expect the United States to take such a step since he has always considered it a democratic country, a country where all citizens' opinions are respected even though they differ. [passage omitted] Many Haitians who are used to traveling abroad say that Sen. Sansaricq has many businesses in the United States, so you can imagine his discontent. Sen. Dupiton has relatives, children, and so on. The Artibonite senator admits that he regrets nothing, even though he considers the decision to cancel his green card unjust. [passage omitted] Not all legislators close to Jonassaint have had their visas revoked. Some of those who have not been hit by the measure, such as Margareth Martin, say, however, they are waiting their turn. This 18 January, legislators protested the fact that many of her Senate colleagues have been hit by the measure because of their political positions. Margareth Martin blames the decision to revoke visas on senators close to President Aristide. Sen. Martin says they are the senators who used to point accusing fingers at legislators who do not side with the president-in-exile: [Begin Martin recording] It is scandalous that the U.S. ambassador or the U.S. Embassy cancels the immigrant visas of Haitian citizens who support the government. I have yet to receive my letter; I am waiting for it; I am waiting for them. They can revoke my visa and take back their green card. I will stay in my country and help establish democracy. [end recording] [Signal FM adds in a report in French, during the same newscast: "President Emile Jonassaint's provisional government issued a communique on 23 June noting that foreigners from countries that require Haitian nationals to have visas will be required to have a visa to enter Haitian territory. This measure concerns U.S. citizens and Canadians, who did not need a visa to enter the country before now. The French have been obliged to hold visas for several years, as a sign of reciprocity with Paris. The government communique states that foreigners will have to pay a $50 tax upon arrival at Haitian ports and airports."]
