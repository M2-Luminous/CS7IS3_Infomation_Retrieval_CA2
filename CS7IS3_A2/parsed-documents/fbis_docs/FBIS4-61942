Zvyahilskyy: `It Is By Force of Habit That We Speak About the Crisis'"] [Text] Whereas inflation reached 91 percent in December 1993, it was 19.2 percent in January 1994; 12.6 percent in February; and 5.7 percent in March. This enabled us to adopt a decision on reducing the annual rate of the National Bank to 210 percent. At the same time, it is possible to regard the catastrophic decline in the volume of production from a different point of view: The decrease in the production of electric energy, for example, amounts to just 18 percent, while the production of some foodstuffs and the output of individual branches of the national economy, including metallurgy, is even increasing. These and other facts were quoted to correspondents by acting Prime Minister Yu. Zvyahilskyy during a meeting in the UNIAN office. According to Zvyahilskyy, the government currently controls the situation on the currency and credits and finance markets and has come out decisively against the resumption of auctions at the Interbank Currency Exchange, which would ensure a free exchange rate of the Ukrainian karbovanets relative to the U.S. dollar. In his opinion, this is risky as long as the energy sources account for 68.9 percent in the country's import and there exists a real threat that the prices on the consumer market may get out of control. For the same reason, "it is necessary to be more cautious in accepting recommendations and demands of international financial organizations." Asked by a correspondent "if everything is so good, then why are we talking about a crisis?" Yu. Zvyahilskyy shrugged his shoulders: "Force of habit."
