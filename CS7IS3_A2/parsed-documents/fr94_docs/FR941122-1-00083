FR941122-1-00083 FR941122-1-00019 With regard to Areas G, H, I, and J, major airspace modifications are proposed because of the implementation of the STAR (Southern California Terminal Airspace Realignment) plan and the resultant increase in the traffic routed inbound to LAX from the south. The Coast Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility (TRACON) sequences traffic from Asia and the Pacific arriving over the Santa Catalina Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) with arrival traffic from Mexico, South America, and San Diego routed over the Seal Beach VORTAC (SLI). It is important that this traffic descend in a timely manner, as delays could affect the eastbound departure traffic. To facilitate this mix of traffic, the proposed Areas G, H, and I are designed to facilitate both the arrival and departure traffic without interfering with existing VFR routes. Area G would allow aircraft arriving from the south to remain within the Class B airspace as they descend to the final approach course. Depicted VFR flyways at 3,500 and 4,500 feet MSL will remain unaffected. Area H would allow VFR aircraft to climb eastbound, east of the Seal Beach VORTAC, while enabling Los Angeles approach to utilize altitudes compatible with the final approach course. Area I has been proposed using geographical coordinates and terrain features to facilitate the efficient use of this airspace. Area J would allow VFR flight at 7,500 feet MSL which user input indicated was a commonly used altitude for VFR flight to and from Santa Catalina. This proposed area would not eliminate established VFR transition routes. Area K. That airspace extending upward from 5,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 33 ○45 ’34 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○27 ’01 ’ ’W. (LIMBO Intersection); to lat. 33 ○35 ’58 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○25 ’39 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○32 ’52 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○36 ’54 ’ ’W., to lat. 33 ○44 ’27 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○42 ’23 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○45 ’14 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○32 ’29 ’ ’W. (INISH Intersection); to the point of beginning. Located entirely offshore, Area K is designed to accommodate high performance traffic departing LAX, via the LAXX ONE Departure, as well as arrival traffic when Los Angeles is in an east flow configuration. This area is not utilized by VFR aircraft on a routine basis; however, based on the recommendations of local pilots, the area was designed to accommodate GA operations offshore south of Palos Verdes, CA. Area L. That airspace extending upward from 2,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 33 ○45 ’14 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○32 ’29 ’ ’W. (INISH Intersection); to lat. 33 ○44 ’27 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○42 ’23 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○59 ’44 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○55 ’22 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○00 ’08 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○45 ’01 ’ ’W.; to the point of beginning. The proposed Area L aligns with V&hyph;27. This would allow navigation along V&hyph;27, while in the Class B airspace area. Area M. That airspace extending upward from 7,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 34 ○06 ’00 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○56 ’33 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○06 ’00 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○47 ’06 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○00 ’08 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○45 ’01 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○59 ’44 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○55 ’22 ’ ’W.; to the point of beginning. The proposed Area M would contain high performance aircraft arriving from the north, when LAX is in an east traffic flow configuration. To mitigate the impact of this area on VFR traffic and to prevent adverse effects, the floor of the Class B airspace area in this area is proposed to be 7,000 feet MSL. This would provide additional airspace for VFR operations. Area N. That airspace extending upward from 5,000 feet MSL to and including 10,000 feet MSL bounded by a line beginning at lat. 34 ○06 ’00 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○47 ’06 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○06 ’00 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○14 ’27 ’ ’W. (Railroad Freight Yard); to lat. 34 ○02 ’49 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○21 ’48 ’ ’W.; to lat. 33 ○00 ’20 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○23 ’05 ’ ’W. (West Los Angeles College); to lat. 33 ○57 ’42 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○22 ’10 ’ ’W. (Manchester/405 Hwy); to lat. 33 ○57 ’42 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○27 ’23 ’ ’W. (Ballona Creek/Pacific Ocean); to lat. 34 ○00 ’33 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○32 ’56 ’ ’W.; to lat. 34 ○00 ’08 ’ ’N., long. 118 ○45 ’01 ’ ’W.; to the point of beginning.
