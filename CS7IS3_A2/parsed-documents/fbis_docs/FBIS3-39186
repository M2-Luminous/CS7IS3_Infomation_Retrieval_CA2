He believes that there is little chance of Belgium having to take part in air strikes. In the House of Representatives during question time, Mr. Delcroix was grilled on the subject of the safety of Belgian troops in the Croatian area of Baranja, and in Central Bosnia, following the NATO ultimatum imposed at 1300 on Friday [11 February]. He stated that "we are 100 percent behind the decision made by NATO," but added that "the safety of our troops comes first." The minister warned against issuing orders from within one's own country to troops who are operationally under the command of UN generals Rose and Cot [in Bosnia], "as other countries sometimes do." He also denied that plans to withdraw the peacekeeping forces and humanitarian aid missions were already being considered. The Ministry of Defense, the Army, and UN command were already doing their utmost to ensure the safety of the Belgian troops, he continued. For instance, the troops were now better armed. In the Baranja region, they would henceforth be equipped with Milan rockets (that can destroy a tank from a distance of 2 km), and with armored vehicles. The roughly 750 troops in the Baranja area have been concentrated from 12 sites to just five. Minister Delcroix later stated that he had not completely ruled out the possibility of Belgium supplying additional troops for NATO air strikes at a later stage, but stated that this was not the case for the time being.
