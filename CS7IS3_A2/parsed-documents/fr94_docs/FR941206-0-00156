FR941206-0-00156 FR941206-0-00019 Response: The EPA maintains that the management of organic-containing wastes in containers at TSDF is a potentially significant source of organic emissions that is not adequately regulated by existing regulations. Control requirements for containers under the subpart CC standards are needed to: (1) Ensure that containers used for storage of organic-containing waste use covers effective for organic emission control; (2) Control organic emissions from treatment of organic-containing wastes in containers by waste stabilization and other processes; and (3) Prevent circumvention of the containment and control strategy that serves as a key component of the integrated approach to implementing RCRA section 3004(n). The EPA disagrees with the commenters' conclusion that existing regulations are sufficient to control organic emissions from containers used to manage hazardous waste at TSDF. Existing RCRA regulations under 40 CFR 264.173 require containers used to store hazardous waste at TSDF to be closed except when necessary to add or remove waste. This requirement for closed containers during storage does not specify organic air emission controls for these covers. Furthermore, no RCRA requirements exist that address organic emissions associated with other container operations such as hazardous waste transfer or treatment in open containers. The EPA also disagrees with the commenters' conclusion that managing hazardous wastes in containers is not a significant potential source of organic air emissions. The baseline analysis to estimate nationwide TSDF organic emissions by waste management category is not the only factor that the EPA considered in assessing the organic emission potential of containers. The revised nationwide baseline emissions from storage of hazardous waste in TSDF containers is estimated to be approximately 5,000 Mg/yr. However, this emission estimate for containers does not include organic emissions from hazardous waste treatment in containers. As described in the BID for the final rule, the EPA estimates the total organic emissions from waste fixation operations performed in containers to be approximately 11,000 Mg/yr. Information obtained by the EPA representatives during site visits to TSDF conducting waste fixation operations indicates that use of containers for waste fixation continues to be a common industry practice. Thus, treatment of hazardous waste in containers is a large potential source of organic emissions that is not regulated by the existing RCRA regulations. The air emission control requirements for the subpart CC standards are based on applying a containment and control strategy to TSDF tanks, surface impoundments, and containers from generation of the waste through treatment of the waste to remove or destroy the organics in the waste. Requiring control of only TSDF tanks and surface impoundments but not containers creates a significant potential organic emission source if large quantities of hazardous waste currently stored or treated in tanks required to use air emission controls under subpart CC standards are transferred to containers not using air emission controls. This would allow organics in the hazardous waste managed in uncontrolled containers to escape to the atmosphere prior to treatment and, thus, reduce the effectiveness of the containment and control approach.
