The Russian ambassador handed the head of state a letter from the Russian Federation president in which Boris Yeltsin expresses profound confidence that friendship and cooperation between Russia and Georgia will continue for the benefit of our states. Eduard Shevardnadze and Ambassador Zemskoy discussed the decision to introduce Russian peacekeeping forces into the Abkhazian conflict zone. This decision was adopted by the Russian Federation Council. The head of state noted that he attaches particular significance to this decision. In his opinion, this international move by Russia is of historic significance, not only for Georgia. The success of this move may serve to guarantee stability in Transcaucasia. In that event, Russia's prestige in the world will grow considerably, because the responsibility taken by an individual country in cooperation with an international organization for such a serious move acquires the power of positive example for other countries.
