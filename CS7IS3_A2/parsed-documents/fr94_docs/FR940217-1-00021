FR940217-1-00021 FR940217-1-00005 2. Elements of Transaction Information Paragraph (d)(2) of the reproposed rule would provide the elements of information required to be maintained for all transactions. The Commission believes that these elements incorporate, to the extent possible, existing recordkeeping requirements under the Exchange Act and SRO rules for the electronic bluesheet system and, thereby, minimize the burdens imposed on registered broker-dealers. Due to changes to the LTID disclosure requirements, the recordkeeping requirement for LTIDs found in paragraph (d)(2)(x) of the reproposed rule would now require a broker-dealer to maintain only the LTID of the controllers of a fully disclosed account, or the custodian or nominee of an omnibus account. In addition, paragraphs (d)(2)(v) and (d)(2)(vii) of the reproposed rule have been modified to incorporate suggestions made by the commenters. Paragraph (d)(2)(v) has been modified to include the designation of exercises or assignments of option contracts. Paragraph (d)(2)(vii) has been modified to clarify that the personal accounts of officers, directors, or employees of a broker-dealer are not required to be aggregated with accounts owned or controlled by such broker-dealer. In addition, the reproposed rule includes three new elements that the Commission believes are necessary to reduce the burden of maintaining multiple LTIDs and execution times. First, paragraph (d)(2)(xi) of the reproposed rule would provide that broker-dealers must maintain the ID System numbers of agents, broker-dealers, institutions, and other interested parties otherwise maintained for the account for which a transaction is effected. 51 The use of ID System numbers would have the effect of limiting the number of LTIDs that a broker-dealer must maintain and report with respect to a given account. The Commission understands that broker-dealers currently maintain these ID System numbers in their automated name and address records. 52 The Commission specifically solicits comments on the appropriateness of the use of ID System numbers and whether other information, systems, or procedures may further reduce the burden of multiple LTID recordkeeping. 51 See supra n. 17, describing ID System participants. 52 These automated records, and the ID System numbers contained therein, provide the data processing mechanism for the automated issuance of affirmations (i.e., confirmations) to the respective parties to an ID System trade. Under the proposed Interactive ID System, a Standing Instructions Database (``SID'') is planned to be implemented. This database would establish a standing repository for customer account and settlement information furnished by institutions, agents, and broker-dealers. This information would include the customer name, agent for the customer, the agent's internal account number, and interested parties. When entering trade data to the ID System, a broker-dealer could simply refer to account designations contained in the SID, and the system would automatically add details (e.g., customer name, agent, and interested parties) to the confirmations of the trade. The Commission notes that, absent large trader recordkeeping and reporting requirements, the proposed SID may eliminate the need for broker-dealers to maintain this information in their internal records. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33010 (October 4, 1993), 58 FR 53007 (October 13, 1993). Second, paragraph (d)(2)(xii) of the reproposed rule would provide that broker-dealers must maintain the code, identification, or sequence number assigned to a transaction that was routed or effected through an automated order routing system maintained by an SRO, such as the NYSE SuperDOT system. These numbers are uniformly maintained and used by broker-dealers and SROs to route reports of executed transactions to the appropriate broker-dealer branch offices or to research the status of unexecuted orders. The Commission would use these numbers to ``link or match'' transaction reports to the applicable SRO audit trail, in order to determine or verify the reported execution time. Finally, paragraph (d)(2)(xiii) of the reproposed rule would establish a miscellaneous or unspecified field that would provide the Commission with flexibility to accommodate future changes or problems. This flexibility also could be used to facilitate specific requests that would reduce the burdens of the reproposed system for a given broker-dealer. The Commission believes that the reproposed recordkeeping requirements would assure that the information necessary to accomplish the objectives of the Market Reform Act would be maintained. The Commission also believes that these reproposed requirements would reduce burdens substantially. D. Trade Reporting Requirements of Brokers and Dealers Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act specifically authorizes the Commission to require registered broker-dealers to report transactions that equal or exceed the reporting activity level effected by or through such broker-dealer for persons who they know are large traders, or any persons who they have reason to know are large traders on the basis of transactions effected by or through such broker-dealers. 53 The Commission also is authorized to require broker-dealers to report transactions to the Commission or an SRO designated by the Commission on the morning following the day on which the transactions were effected or otherwise immediately upon request of the Commission or designated SRO. Further, the Commission is authorized to require that such transaction reports be transmitted in any format that it may prescribe, including machine-readable form. The Commission is reproposing paragraph (e) to implement the transaction reporting provisions of Section 13(h)(2) of the Exchange Act. 53 15 U.S.C. 78m(h)(2) (1990). 1. General Requirements The general reporting requirement would provide that every registered broker-dealer that carries accounts for large traders, or other persons for whom records must be maintained, shall electronically report transactions in machine-readable form and in accordance with instructions issued by the Commission. Transaction reports would be required to contain all elements of information for transactions effected through accounts carried by such broker-dealer for large traders and other persons for whom records must be maintained, which equal or exceed the reporting activity level. The Commission continues to propose that transaction reports be transmitted through the existing electronic bluesheet system. 54 The special reporting requirement for trades of ``unidentified large traders,'' has been reorganized without changes into paragraph (e)(5) of the reproposed rule. 54 See Proposing Release, 56 FR 42557, at text accompanying nn. 85&hyph;86.
