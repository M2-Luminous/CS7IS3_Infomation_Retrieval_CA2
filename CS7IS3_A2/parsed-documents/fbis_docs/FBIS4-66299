Since Deng Xiaoping made his important speech during his inspection tour of southern China, it has changed every year, and every three years, it has changed greatly, displaying its strong vitality and developmental staying power, becoming a new growth spot and comprehensive trial zone for developing Shanghai's economy. It has received wide and close attention from everyplace, both overseas and domestic, and especially in financial, investment, enterprise, and transportation circles. With the coming of the new year of 1994, in order to gain a deep understanding of the new achievements and new steps in developing Pudong, and answer some questions raised by Hong Kong and overseas people concerning that development, a delegation headed by the Director of our magazine XIE MINGGAN [6200 2494 1626] recently made a special trip to Shanghai to interview the Deputy Mayor Zhao Qizheng, who is in charge of Pudong's development. Deputy Mayor Zhao met Xie Minggan's group in a tastefully decorated guest room in Pudong's New District Administrative Committee. Outdoors it was harsh winter, but indoors it was as warm as spring. The host and his guests chatted cheerfully and humorously. Deputy Mayor Zhao is very busy in his work, but he is an energetic and quick-witted person. He is very familiar with Pudong development, and after exchanging a few words of greeting, we came to our topic. Question: In 1993, Pudong New District tried to strengthen its general supportive function for city construction on a base of stressing doing well the job of developing the role of key small districts, strengthening comprehensive treatment of social development, as well as making further exploration of developing the operation of the socialist market economic system. Please outline 1993's achievements in these areas. Answer: On New Year's Day 1993, the Shanghai government established the Pudong New District Administrative Committee to speed up Pudong's development and implement comprehensive and unified administration for the new district. During the year, Pudong New District has developed rapidly in various areas. (1) There was a great deal of growth in the domestic economy. --The gross domestic output value has achieved "doubling in three years." Last year, the gross domestic output value in the New District reached 16.4 billion yuan and, if calculated by comparable prices, it increased 100 percent since 1990 and 30 percent since 1992. Meanwhile, service industries have been increasing at the same rate as the gross domestic output value. Last year, the increased value of service industries reached 4.66 billion yuan, a 46.6 percent increase by the same rate, higher than that of secondary industry. --Fixed asset investment increased one-fold over 1992. The investment mix tended to be more reasonable. Construction of the city's infrastructure and the rate of investment in service industries increased significantly. --Financial income increased at the same rate as the gross domestic output value. Last year, the district level financial income took in 1 billion yuan in the New District, which was a more than 70 percent increase over 1992. --The financial ability of financial organs in the New District increased one fold. Last year, the balance from deposits and loans in 10 domestic banks Pudong branches was over 50 billion yuan, a one-fold increase over 1992, which showed fully the significant achievement of the strategy of "finance is first" in Pudong development. (2) Overall achievements in urban construction. Enthusiastically helped the city to complete such big and important projects as the Yangpu bridge, the Pudong section of the inner circle, two massive interchanges, the new port zone of Waigaoqiao, the Linqiao water works, etc. Paid close attention to projects for widening and remaking seven backbone roads such as Yuanshen Road and Longdong Road which connect small development districts and major municipal works. The total length is 20 Km, with total investment of 1.2 billion yuan. After working day and night for half a year, it was finished completely in December of last year, which further improved the environment for investment in Pudong. (3) Key small districts in the New District have entered a new stage of functional development. In keeping with the State Council's strategic decisions concerning Pudong's development and opening, last year we set out new development objectives for fostering and strengthening functional development in each key, small, development district. At present, construction is fully under way on 50 financial and trade buildings in the Lujiazhui Finance and Trade Zone, an emerging, embryonic form of China's CBD zone; the 200 projects imported to the Jinqiao Export Processing Zone are listed as number one among all development zones in China from their average investment of US$15 million per project. In addition, the production rate of 30 projects has put them into a profitable phase; the Waigaoqiao bonded zone has $2.3 billion total investment from foreign business, and the Shanghai bonded production materials market, the largest such in China, has gone into full operation; the Zhangjiang High Technology Zone is also following closely, with mutual development of each key, small district's support function, creating the conditions for the New District to accomplish its historical mission. (4) Strengthened comprehensive treatment of social development in the New District. The New District gives considerable attention to building moral civilization and comprehensive social treatment, insisting on anti-corruption, advocating honesty, and promoting legal construction. First of all, we established the Chuansha Police Office, and hired 14 legal specialists and well known lawyers to make up a legal consulting group for the New District; the Labor Department in the New District adopted positive reform measures, arranging appropriately compensation for farmers whose land was taken for the New District; as for the social problems brought on by a large number of migrants, the New District promptly researched countermeasures, strengthened administration, and vigorously went after a small number of criminals to guarantee a stable social environment for developing and building Pudong. (5) Positively studies the establishment of a socialist market economic system of operations. This includes, primarily: centered on the strategic goal of building up Shanghai as an international economic, financial, and trade center, the New District has enthusiastically invited foreign capital banks to establish branches in Pudong, and attracted international capital through multiple channels (there are now 26 foreign capital branch banks, and foreign capital or joint venture financial corporations). The first one established was the Waigaoqiao bonded production materials market (to date, there are four branch markets). We established a State-owned assets administrative corporation in the New District, to strengthen administration of State-owned assets. We have enthusiastically developed a personnel market and a technology market, and experimented with the reform of an agricultural cooperative joint stock system. Question: You have proposed that 1994 should be Pudong New District's "year of image-making." Could you tell us what kind image will Pudong have before the world in 1994? Answer: We call 1994 our "year of image-making," because Pudong has a three step goal of laying a foundation by 1995, forming the primary framework by 2000, and then establishing ourselves as an international economic, financial and trade center by 2010, so the primary image for the "foundation" of 1995 should make its general appearance in 1994. Primarily, this means: --The image of infrastructure: while there will be support for the major and important municipal works associated with the eastern and western parts of the city, the key lies in 10 infrastructure projects in the New District, including supporting projects in the Pudong section of a double line tunnel, an axial highway, the project to widen Zhangyang Road, around the periphery of the river, and a group of interchanges, transformers and substations, etc., add 200,000 cable TVs and 170,000 telephones and a group of gasoline stations. This will basically establish a networked system of modernized transportation, telecommunications and energy, displaying the primary framework of a modern urban area. --The image of municipal appearance and environment: focusing on the 10 fundamental municipal works already completed during the Eighth Five Year Plan, we will begin a comprehensive project of afforestation and environmental protection around the tourist routes and major scenes in Pudong. We will especially increase forest construction, starting to build such forestry projects as Central Park, Dezhou Park, etc., adding 2 million square meters of wooded areas in the new district. This will further improve the municipal appearance and environment of Pudong New District. ---The image of the new city center area: in 1994, on the other side of the Bund, the Eastern Shining Pearl TV tower and the first section of Bingjiang Avenue will be completed, and construction will start on Fudu World. Meanwhile, more than 30 buildings around that area will reach over 40 meters of their major structure on the ground, and nearly 20 buildings will be completed. This will give Pudong's new Bund a beautiful appearance. ---The image of a modernized processing zone for exports: in the Jingqiao processing zone for exports, six square km of "seven throughs and one flat" will be developed and built, which will bring in a total of more than 300 domestic and foreign capital projects. There are now 200 projects under construction, and nearly 100 enterprises including Hitachi Electric and Sharp Air Conditioning, have finished construction and gone into production. This has achieved a yearly output value of three billion yuan, becoming the processing base for export with the shortest construction cycle, richest technical content, fastest economic efficiency, and best environment protection in China. --The image of a free trade zone: in 1994, in the Gaoqiao Bonded Zone, construction will end on 6 square km of "seven throughs and one flat," and a 4 square km area will be closed and put into operation. For the more than 1,000 Chinese and foreign capital enterprises which are engaged in entrepot trade, or international trade, the volume of their import and export business will be double that of last year. The Shanghai bonded production materials exchange market has been formed to a certain degree, with a focus on steel, construction materials and textile raw materials. --The image of commercial culture: the Wendeng Road commercial street will be finished comprehensively, forming the New District's first street for tourist sightseeing and shopping. Covering 600 thousand square meters, equivalent to about two Nanjing Roads, its commercial facilities are under accelerated construction. Meanwhile, a group of projects consisting of a newly established elementary school, high school, hospital, welfare facility and sports center, a golf course, etc., have gone into construction. In the Zhangyang Road and Huamu areas, these will create a brand new image for the Zhangyang Road commercial center, developing and building an attractive commercial, tourist and cultural center, complete with municipal government, culture, and central park. Question: In 1994, the Chinese government will implement important reforms in the tax system. What affects will these have on Pudong New District's development and construction? Will the environment tend to be loose or tight? Answer: On 1 January, 1994, China launched tax reforms in areas dealing with foreign investment enterprises, abandoning unified industrial and commercial taxes, implementing a value added tax, a consumption tax, and a business tax. The principal objective is to simplify the tax system and correspond to the international tax system. Internationally, and especially in the developed nations of the West, a value added tax is collected on the value added part of goods sold; while China formerly collected a uniform industrial and commercial tax on goods sold by foreign nationals' enterprises, the tax linked to goods sold could not be deducted directly within the borders of China, but would have to be waived or returned to customers or import-export organs in accordance with the regulation of duty free or tax return. This way takes a long time, has many steps, and is quite complicated. Now, having our system in line with the western tax system will totally resolve the problem of deducting and returning the tax. After the new tax system has taken effect, the Chinese Government will adopt certain measures to protect the profits of foreign businesses. We have already made it clear that to ease the added tax burden tax reform causes for foreign enterprises, within a certain period we will adopt such measures as tax rebates, temporary delays in collecting the tax, etc. This will enable foreign investment enterprises to maintain their former tax burden, and not increase the circulating tax burden. In addition to this, Pudong New District will not make any changes in the preferential income tax policies for foreign investment enterprises and foreign enterprises. Therefore, the Chinese Government's major reforms in the tax system will be favorable for regulating the investment environment in Pudong New District, giving it a better investment future. Question: How about the scale of the enterprises investing in Pudong New District with the three types of capital? What have you done to attract the world's famous transnational corporations to invest in Pudong, and what do you plan to do in the future? Answer: At the end of 1993, Pudong New District had approved a total of 1,625 enterprises invested with foreign capital, having a gross investment of $6.546 billion, and agreements to absorb $3.269 billion in foreign capital, with a per enterprise average investment of $4.02 million with the three types of capital, and $2.01 million agreed to on absorbing foreign capital. This makes us fourth nationally, and higher than the average investment level ($2.3 million). Among these, 178 enterprises invested with the three types of capital have over 5 million dollars' gross investment, constituting 10.9 percent of the total foreign invested projects in Pudong, 65 percent of the gross investment, and is up to $4.255 billion. There are 117 enterprises which have over $10 million gross investment, constituting 7.19 percent of the total number of projects, 59.03 percent of the gross investment and is up to $3.864 billion. At the end of 1992, the average project had 45 percent foreign capital content, while in 924 projects approved throughout 1993, the average foreign capital content had increased to 55.3 percent. [passage omitted] Question: Currently, land leasing in Pudong still mostly takes the way of approving leases through agreement. From now on, will you go the way of inviting vendors or auction, which is more common in the world, bringing land to full efficiency in market competition? Answer: We always persist in valuing land as if it were gold. Since establishing the New District Administrative Commission, we comprehensively strengthened land development administration, and initiated a chargeable land using system. In Pudong New District, development and construction on whole pieces of land is generally done through investment by the city government or the New District Administrative Commission, and chiefly by state-owned corporations buying the land from the state, conducting "seven throughs and one flat" construction on it, after which there is another transfer. In addition, a small amount of land is directly approved for rental to foreign business and their domestic associated enterprises. To date, nearly 50 square km in whole parcels of land have been taken and transmitted by the six big state-owned development corporations, and one-third of these have completed development. In 1993, in order to strengthen land administration, we put a stress in our land management work. By persisting in approving land according to the projects and approving projects according to their efficiency, we achieved orderly land development, with basically no land available for "land speculators." While chiefly going the way of approving leases to transfer lands, we are breeding the means of inviting vendors or auction, which are common throughout the world. In the first part of this year, we will extend initial invitations to vendors on a piece of land about 6 thousand square meters (Zhangyang Road 23-G). We are now preparing the plans for this.
