The news that the ban had returned to the agenda after Germany had apparently withdrawn its threat was received in Westminster "like a bolt from the blue." Britain and Germany are now heading for a bitter diplomatic battle over a proposal which Whitehall regards as illegal under the European Union [EU] single market rules. The row flared up again when German Health Minister Horst Seehofer said today: "I can't wait any longer. It would be a culpable delay with all the possible legal consequences." He said he intended to introduce the ban this month. "We have a legal basis for the import ban in our meat hygiene law. We have checked this very carefully. If Brussels should stop us in whatever way, then Brussels will have to take responsibility for it." But Mrs. Shephard did not agree. She told PA News: "It is on the agenda for the German Cabinet next week. Knowing this I was in touch with the EU Commissioner last week insisting that he should, before the Cabinet meeting, remind the German Government that imposing a unilateral ban within the EU obviously could not be allowed under European law. He agreed to do so. That was a pre-emptive strike because this is not allowed and they will have to end up in the court if this happens." Mrs. Shephard said German Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert disagreed with Mr. Seehofer on the issue. "The whole business is being regarded with great resentment by the German beef producers, who also want to prevent the German Cabinet from doing this. It is not a happy scene and we do know that it is politically motivated. The utterances of Mr. Seehofer make that absolutely clear." She said that each time this had come before the Council of Ministers, "Germany has gone away empty-handed." Condemnation of the German threat came from all quarters of the Commons. Shadow agriculture minister Gavin Strang said: "There can be no justification for a unilateral ban on British beef." Dr. Strang's front-bench colleague Elliott Morley said: "There is no evidence whatever, scientific or medical, to support the German fears." He agreed it was "cynical" for the Germans apparently to withdraw the threat just before last month's summit between John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl. "It is clear they tried to put it on the back-burner so it would not interfere with negotiations at the summit," he said. Paul Tyler, the Liberal Democrat agriculture spokesman, said: "This shows that the much-vaunted special relationshsip between John Major and Chancellor Kohl is worthless. We had understood that this issue had been sorted out."
