Decisive, rapid, immediate, and radical intervention! Extremists' jails have become totally chaotic and an absolute farce. The silence about them is a crime, and to remain silent is a tragedy. This is what is going on in your ministry's jails, Mr. Minister! - Legal opinions to shed blood and assault criminal prisoners: - Abducting officers and guards in prison cells and releasing them only after negotiations with the prison administration; - A declaration made inside prison: We will kill Christian prisoners; - Extremists deciding to abolish radios, impose censorship on newspapers and magazines, and ban children's pictures. After the uproar accompanying the announcement of mediation between security forces and the extremists, "decrees" were hastily issued by the extremists' leaders in Tarah Penitentiary, changing the amirs of certain groups in various Egyptian prisons, who had classified themselves as moderate doves, and replacing them with hard-line hawks. This affair, therefore, resembled the hasty ministerial change. Furthermore, an amir of extremists in prison is only appointed by decree from his leaders in Tarah. Not only that, but strict instructions were issued in other decrees from Tarah to the new amirs to intensify the rules and penalties against criminal prisoners, who refuse to join up today, and against prisoners affiliated with other movements. These rules are also to be enforced against prison guards, including guards and officers to be tried in special courts inside prison cells, even if it reaches the point of shedding blood by special legal opinions. This is nothing new. The extremists are running the prisons. However, what is new is that they have decided to govern them in a more dictatorial fashion, and their bloody mentality is for the purpose of compensating them for their failure to apply their ideas in society. In this context, the massacre in Abu Za'bal Penitentiary, in which three were killed and 87 criminal prisoners wounded, occurred after a trial--conducted by the extremists' amir in his prison cell--of five criminals, in which legal opinions to shed blood were issued. Used in the massacre were sharp instruments, pocket knives, wooden clubs, and faucets and water hoses after they were uprooted to be used as weapons. The massacre continued for five straight hours. Prison guards were unable to do anything except watch. The oddity is that the same prison experienced another, no less serious, incident two months ago, where some extremists were able to abduct an officer and a guard from the guard force. They stripped them of their weapons and held them inside a cell, threatening to kill them unless the prison administration complied with their demands, or if anyone tried to approach them. It took several hours before the two were released, after difficult negotiations, during which the prison administration promised not to harm the extremists. Before that, one of the extremist prisoners had gouged out an eye of one of the officers in the prison courtyard because the officer had dared to ask him not to make disturbing noises. At one time, the most prisoners could do to express complaints and issue protests was to bang on the iron doors with aluminum dishes and utensils and shout hostile threats, abuse, and insults. Today, the extremists protest inside prisons by gouging out the eyes of officers and guards, or detaining or killing them. Egyptian prisons have had armed clashes between extremists and prison administration at one time or another. Mostly, the guard force of officers and men are unable to end the extremists' rebellion and cannot even enter the cells. If one of them dared to enter any cell, he would be trampled by the extremist prisoners. Ultimately, this situation requires summoning black-uniformed special forces, who use tear gas thrown into the cells, and then storm the barracks. The extremists' tricks are unable to stop the tear gas. An infamous clash occurred several years ago in al-Qanatir Prison, which was like a war between special security forces and extremists. The extremists resorted to a clever trick--one that only combatants would know--to thwart the effectiveness of the tear gas. They placed buckets inside the cells, filled with water. As soon as the canisters landed in the cell, they threw them into the buckets to try to extinguish them. But, in the end, they surrendered because they were unable to continue resisting. However, they succeeded in capturing the commander of the guard and detained him in one of the cells. They stabbed another officer with a sharp instrument and tipped the scales to their advantage again. The clash continued until night time. The prison commander, Colonel Muhammad Marsa, suffered a stab wound in the stomach, and about 100 officers, guards, and extremists were wounded before security forces were able to gain control of the situation. The rebellious extremists were transferred to the Appeals Prison in central Cairo. The oddity is that the clash occurred after the extremists announced that they were an independent state inside the prison, which would not carry out anyone's orders. They declared their insurrection and stated they were not obliged to carry out the instructions of the prison administration. Their efforts for power do not stop even after their arrests. They are working to build their hypothetical state behind iron bars. They will not accept less than everyone's submission to them. The extremists call these clashes, "intifadah." They remember them as if they were history. They say: "The intifadah of al-Qanatir Prison," the Abu Za'bal Revolution, and the battle of Tarah." Even inside the prisons, the extremists stir up sectarian strife and do not hesitate to kindle it. In al-Qanatir Prison, one extremists clashed and fought with a Christian prisoner. A rumor circulated in prison that the extremists would kill all Christian prisoners. The Christians gathered together inside the prison in a state of alarm and despair. When an officer intervened to break up the fight, the extremists hit him. The beaten officer went to the area director, Brigadier General Muhammad al-Wakil, took off his uniform, threw it on the floor, and asked him to restore the honor of the police and discipline the prisoners. Brig. Gen. al-Wakil asked the group's amir to turn over the prisoner who had attacked the officer, so that he could be punished. The amir refused, and al- Wakil gave them a 1600 deadline. When the deadline expired, he summoned the black-uniformed special security forces. They stormed the cellblock and arrested the wanted prisoner. The extremists' influence transcends the prison to the prisoners' dock in the courtroom. Aside from acrobatics, abuse, and insults that are uttered inside the wire cage during the trial, after the session has begun the extremists mostly resort to sit-ins inside the cages, refusing to return to prison. The security forces encircle the cages and point gas canisters at the prisoners, forcing them to go to the transport vehicles, but only after long hours of negotiations. The extremists' control over Egyptian jails is demonstrated by the fact of families inside the prisons. There was the Islambuli family and the al-Ramaz family, but the most famous was the al-Dumayri family, which totalled eight persons under detention. They were called the Al al-Dumayri. Extremists look at criminal prisoners--perpetrators of crimes of murder, robbery, etc.--with an air of superiority, because they consider them corrupt elements. They try to proselytize and recruit them to get them to submit to the extremists' leadership. Those who refuse to yield are subjected to a special trial in one of the cells. They issue decrees and legal opinions against them, which could lead to bloodshed, as happened in the Abu Za'bal incident. The extremists forbid the criminals to listen to the radio, play backgammon or cards, appear in Ministry of Interior uniforms, or dress in shorts, as per promotion of virtue and suppression of vice. Much of the friction and clashes between the extremist and criminal prisoners is due to these prohibitions. This is especially true when applied to playing backgammon, which the extremists make from cardboard, while the dice are cut from the center of a bread loaf and distributed among the criminals for entertainment. The extremists are not prepared to offer any concessions to the criminals regarding these prohibitions. On the contrary, sometime ago through comprehensive strikes, they forced the prison administration to gather up all radio sets in the possession of criminal prisoners, on grounds that the songs coming out of the radios could be heard in the extremists' cells. In fact, an officer went to the cells, accompanied by a guard carrying a large carton, in which the radios were placed. This is a well-known fact that reveals the extent of the prison administration's weakness and the criminals' passivity vis-a-vis the extremists. However, most of the clashes between extremists and criminals in Egyptian prisons occur because of the practice of wearing Ministry of Interior uniforms, or shorts, by some of the criminal prisoners. Moreover, those who write articles and stories inside prison are considered by the extremists to be in violation of Islam. In all these cases, they conduct special trials inside cells. The group's amir issues verdicts to flog the violators. In the face of that, a large number of criminal prisoners are forced to let their beards grow and to demonstrate loyalty to the extremists and their amir, out of fear of their ruthless action. The extremists have formed an internal system to censor newspapers and magazines that entered prisons. They cut out all pictures, even pictures of children, using batteries to do that. Commercial activities, carried on by extremists, have spread inside prison. They deal in food, beverages, and tea. In this regard, they also have succeeded in making certain special games for children, which they then sell during visits. In prison, extremists do not belong to just one movement. There is Jihad, the Islamic Group [al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah], the Repudiation Movement, the Qutbiyun, and others. Clashes between these movements are increasing and, in many cases, turn into fistfights and battles with sharp instruments. Putting believers in different movements in the same cell is a smart ploy that the security forces use to take advantage of the arguments between them. In this way, they can learn new information and secrets that might be revealed during their debates. Prisons have been the scene of bloody battles among the various Islamic movements. For example, when the Salafiyahs in al-Istiqbal Prison stated the legal opinion that those who murdered the Central Security personnel in Asyut must repent and atone for the crime that they had committed, the Islamic Jama'ah adherents were furious. They assembled inside the prison and gave speeches, analyzing the terrorist deed that they had carried out. The scene quickly changed into fist and knife fights. Within prison, the extremists do not trust the Muslim Brotherhood. They accuse the Brotherhood of being in alliance with the administrations of the detention camps, which always allows activities in the prisoners' barracks to be led by young men belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood also plays a major role in negotiations between extremists and the camp administration. They are the communications link between the administration and extremist groups that refuse to reach an understanding with security forces. They insist on chaos, strikes, and sit-in strikes in the prison and will not obey orders and instructions from authorities. When disputes among the various movements, to which the prisoners belong, end up in serious fights and clashes, many of these clashes are peculiar and strange. One reason for this is that the al-'Azmawiyah Group forbid the killing of insects because they are life created by God. They do not permit killing them under any circumstances. They reject and condemn this out of consideration that they are God's property. It is foreordained for man, just as death is total, i.e., by fate and divine decree. Battles between the extremists and the al-'Azmawiyah have not stopped for a single day, but perhaps the most famous and strangest was what happened at Abu-Za'bal Prison, when fistfights and knife battles broke out between some extremists who belonged to Jihad and prisoners from the al-'Azmawiyah Group. The clash was caused by mosquitos. The extremists have various movements. Each has its special laws, which it tries to apply on the streets, in the homes, and even in prisons. Perhaps there, behind bars, was where their dreams for power were established. Many of the terrorists' plans are devised, hatched, and issued by their leaders from inside jails, which have been turned into operations rooms for the extremists. In the case of the assassination of Dr. Faraj Fawdah, one of the accused confessed that he had received details of the plan from the leader of the military wing, Safwat 'Abd-al-Ghani, imprisoned in Tarah Prison and charged in the case of the assassination of Dr. Raf'at al-Mahjub. When the prison agency was alerted to the assassination plans, bombings, and terrorism that spread on Egyptian streets, some of which were coming out of the prisons, it intensified measures of custody and sentencing, in order to suppress the terrorists. But the extremists threatened the prison commander and, in fact, carried out their threats and tried to assassinate the commander of Tarah Prison. However, the real joke, revealed through the deficiency of the Egyptian prison system, was the number of cases of extremist escapes. At the beginning of the year, the amir of the Islamic Jama'ah in Bani Suwayf, Ibrahim Muhammad Sayyid Ahmad, was able to escape from jail. He dressed in the clothes of a veiled woman, brought to him by one of his relatives during a visit. He was able, in fact, to leave with the visitors, but the prison administration discovered the operation. The police forces quickly pursued the amir who was killed by gunfire from the prison guards. However, he had in fact gotten outside the prison gates. Prior to this, a well-known major escape incident occurred, in which extremists 'Isam al-Qamri, Khamis Muslim, and Muhammad al-Aswani managed to escape from jail. This incident revealed a major defect in Egyptian prisons, led to the resignation of the prison agency's director, and changed the guard force and administration in Tarah Penitentiary, who were investigated. Despite the fact that the escape plan was simple, its organizational level poor, and the resources used by the escapees meager, the plan basically relied on the chaos of Egyptian prisons. The amazing thing is that there are four authorities that supervise, organize, and operate Egyptian prisons. This confirms that the regulations are strong and that the creation of a new supervisory agency is not required. - The prison administration, responsible for administering the prison's affairs in all its management, financial, culinary, health, social, and punitive aspects. It manages the affairs of prisoners and the guard force. The prison has a doctor to supervise the prisoners' general health. There is a social supervisor to solve their problems, a culinary supervisor to ensure the safety and suitability of their food. There is security supervision represented at the top of the prison pyramid by the commander, his deputy, officials, officers, noncommissioned officers [NCO], and troops. - Prison secret police. This is a bureau subordinate to the agency, out of consideration that the prison is an independent community in itself, where crimes peculiar to it occur and of which the prisoner himself is the source. Crimes are committed through the visitors who bring in prohibited items to help spread corruption inside the jail. Moreover, the crime may be in collusion with an NCO or a guard and the prisoner. Therefore, prison secret police officers use informers among the prisoners to supply them with information. - State security secret police. They concentrate on political prisoners and everything concerning them, either inside the prison, during visits, or when being transported. - Finally, there is the role of the prison guard force which, if necessary, rely on special support forces to operate with them to put down cases of rebellion and riot. These guard forces are also supported by forces from Public Security and Central Security, if necessary. As for outside prison guard forces, they are supported by rapid fire automatic weapons. In the past, the guard forces depended on volunteers in the police, but today they rely on troops of the third screening--army rejects. The majority of them are illiterate. In Egyptian prisons, there are no modern monitoring or control systems. Despite the fact that some of these systems were installed in Tarah Prison during Sadat's regime, the contracting company has not as yet operated them. Officials of the prison agency concede the existence of two gaps that contribute to the anarchy in Egyptian prisons and aid in allowing knives to get to the prisoners. They are: - Collusion by NCO's and troops because of economic, social, and cultural factors. In addition, and more serious than that, is the fact that many of these guards are from Upper Egypt and rural areas. Clan and family allegiance play a role in the occurrence of collusion. In addition, the conscripted guards' commitment is temporary and conditional to a definite degree. Their illiteracy contributes to inferiority and negligence. - The second gap is the family visits that are always accompanied by a desire to bring prohibited items to the prisoner, by using all kinds of tricks. In addition, there is a "housing crisis" in Egyptian prisons. The prison agency is forced to house the political prisoners with the criminal prisoners, and clashes occur. According to the latest reports, the present number of political prisoners in Egypt, in custody and sentenced, totals 3,000. We asked an official in the prison agency: How do you deal with incidents of disorder and anarchy in Egyptian prisons, carried out by extremists who, in fact, control these prisons? He replied: "When disorder occurs, such as sit-in strikes, strikes, and protests, the prison commander or his deputy must intervene, along with his officers, to conduct a dialogue with the prisoners and learn the causes of the disorder. In cases like these, the degree of maximum readiness, either in the prison administration, or the guards, or the secret police, rises in accordance with the circumstances. Visits are forbidden, additional forces are called in, and a cordon of prison guards is placed around the disorderly group." If the disorder is accompanied by acts of violence, intervention is done with tear gas or smoke bombs, in order to gain control of the situation. The prison agency conducts investigations into the incident, and the disorderly are punished by isolation, loss of visitor privileges, and are given additional work. The prison agency does all this to keep the prisoners from gaining control over the jails. Shortly after the recent Abu Za'bal massacre, we made a quick visit to the prison. Some 500 meters from the main gate, there is a black gate on which is written "Industrial Security Prison." Close to that was a huge sign: "Prison is Discipline, Correction, and Reform." Visiting was permitted from 0900 to 1500, and no one needs a permit. Only personal identification has to be shown at the gate. Therefore, it is extremely easy. Attached to the prison is a long hall to receive visitors. This hall measures more than 20 meters long and 10 meters wide. The extremists decided to paint it white, which is their favorite color. The hall contains a large number of cement benches and floor coverings. The daily number of visitors ranges from 200 to 300. Only one day before the Abu Za'bal massacre, a prisoner named 'Abd-al-Sattar Rashwan--who was one of the extremists--died after an electrical shock while warming food on an electrical hot plate in his cell, despite the prohibition against electrical hot plates and appliances. We met with a prisoner named 'Ali, a student in Asyut University. He told us: "Bringing prohibited items into jail is easy and allowed, despite an informer who searches the men and a woman who searches ladies. Everything is available in jail, especially prohibited electrical appliances. The Islamic Jama'ah controls Abu Za'bal Prison. When they meet a political prisoner who belongs to another movement, they try to gain control of his mind, by entering into dialogues with him over the course of weeks. Most of the time the matter ends with his embracing their ideas and joining them, willingly or not." The prisoner related a strange story: "One day, I was in cell 26, and I heard voices rejoicing and saying `God is great.' Then, one of the extremists called to all prisoners, demanding that they say the prayer of thanksgiving, because a prisoner who belonged to the Muslim Brotherhood had renounced the Brotherhood's ideas and had joined the Islamic Jama'ah, thanks to the efforts of Shaykh 'Abdallah." - Who is Shaykh 'Abdallah? - "A prominent leader inside prison. His real name is different, but he likes this alias. He is 45 and leads a group of extremists who collect money by force from visitors. Each visitor pays 2 Egyptian pounds. This is a tax extorted with the knowledge of the prison administration. Mostly the visitors pay a larger amount, after being persuaded that this money is being collected to buy food and cleaning materials for the prisoners." - But, how do you buy the food and cook it? - It is very easy. I have seen Shaykh 'Abdallah reach an agreement with a prison guard to buy food on the outside, in exchange for a commission on each order. He buys macaroni and rice from a street vendor and cans of sauce, which are stored in an empty cell that has been vacated because of its unsuitability. Prisoners from the Islamic Jama'ah use it like a restaurant, cooking the food and distributing it to the group's supporters." - How do you spend your day in jail? - "I wake up early, because the dawn prayer is compulsory. Then, one of the brothers helps us memorize the Koran, before we go out for free time in the prison courtyard at 0800. After that, we assemble in groups and train in karate and Kung Fu, which members of the Islamic Group [prefer]. We have breakfast, and then the period of religious lectures begins, which continues until 1700. During this period, which lasts for nine continuous hours, group leaders have an opportunity to gain new recruits from among criminal prisoners, trained to deal with the police. We are separated from them by barbed wire, but the extremists quickly eliminated that as a factor. They go back and forth, in order to recruit criminal prisoners, especially those who are close to getting out and can be made use of." Therefore, the extremists control Egyptian prisons. Instead of their power weakening after they go to jail, the opposite happens. Their members increase, because they are successful in recruiting criminal prisoners and converting them to terrorists, at their own volition or despite themselves. This matter, therefore, requires special consideration after the Abu Za'bal massacre. The prisoner in Abu Za'bal revealed a surprise when he said: "Extremists refuse to sign their release papers; they want to remain in jail for a longer time!"
