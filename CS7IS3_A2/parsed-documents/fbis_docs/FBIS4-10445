This situation is really alarming. Tourists usually would rather hire private taxis rather than licensed taxis. Why is this? Is the work done by one or the other more or less efficient? These are questions I intend to answer, one way or another, during the course of this research within the next few days. I want to begin by interviewing a private driver, one of those who are usually called pirates. [Unidentified driver] No. I am a hired driver. [Santana] A driver hired by whom? [Driver] Hired by tourists staying in this hotel. [Santana] And how can you do this forbidden work? [Driver] Well, we know that many things are forbidden here; but we have to do it. [Santana] How do you do this work? [Driver] We wait for tourists who leave the hotel and are looking for a taxi to go somewhere in town. We propose the trip to them and they agree to hire us. [Santana] What proposals do you make? Just the price? [Driver] No. In addition to the price proposal, which is much lower than that of the taxi driver, we also propose a trip through town, to take them to special places. [Santana] Do you establish fixed prices or do the prices vary? [Driver] The price depends on where they want to go in the Havana downtown area. [Santana] Are the prices low or high? [Driver] Our prices are much lower than those of taxi drivers. [Santana] And are you aware of the prices charged by the taxi drivers? [Driver] Sure, we know the prices charged by taxi drivers. [Santana] Are there many private drivers like you working in front of the hotels? [Driver] There are a few of us. [Santana] And you surely charge the tourists in dollars, because the tourists do not have Cuban pesos. What do you do with the dollars? [Driver] I use the dollars to buy things that are not found in the market -- soap, oil, and other things not found in the (?state stores). [Santana] Where do you buy those items you need? [Driver] I buy them on the street, on the black market where they are much cheaper than in the state stores. [Santana] Do you have children? [Driver] Yes, I have three children. [Santana] What do your children do? [Driver] They study. They are still in school. [Santana] What is your name? [Driver] Well, you told me that this would be an interview without giving names. If I tell you my name, you might [words indistinct]. [Santana] Where do you work and what is your profession? [Driver] I am not going to tell you my name or where I work. But I am an engineer. [Santana] And what would you prefer to be called: engineer or driver? [Driver] For the time being, because of the work I am doing, I would rather be called a driver. [Santana] These remarks by this private driver give you an idea of the nature of the work and how it affects the economy of taxi drivers. It is obvious that the currency they earn is outside the country's funds and therefore is not reinvested in social programs like health and education. Tomorrow, I will continue this work by discussing the subject from the point of view of the official taxi drivers, so we can draw our conclusions on the causes of this problem.
