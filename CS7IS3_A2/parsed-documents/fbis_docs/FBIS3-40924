When the media, noted P. Krawchanka, report that such compensation will total $12 billion, I laugh at such dilettantism. This is a sum which must be divided between four CIS countries. However, it will not be paid at one time, but rather over the course of several years. Today, it is even hard to say when the United States will begin to buy the uranium from Russia, added the minister.
