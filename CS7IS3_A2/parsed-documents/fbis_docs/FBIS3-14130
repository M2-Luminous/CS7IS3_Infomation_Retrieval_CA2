He said the country has put behind its first national development plan and is about to embark on the second 5-year plan with more confidence. "The first plan worked a lot for the country and the effects of it will gradually become apparent. The first effect of it is that the country has acquired strength against conspiracies and unwelcome incidents. We have solidified the infrastructure of the country. "In the cultural, educational and political sectors our people are at a high level of intelligence in the area of religion and politicis. Their presence on the scene and their Islamic conduct and their observance of Islamic dictates is among the peculiarities of this nation throughout the world, and we take pride in this nation," said the president. He took note of reconstruction and development efforts and said the difference between the deprived areas before and after the plan is really very much. "Our people have heard the statistics and the figures. The infrasturctural works such as water, electricity and gas and attention to the water and power of the villages, roads, airports, telecommunications and post for all has progressed at a very good level, which has brought us ahead of the development plan, and our people understand the presence of these communication affairs. "Our country is not at all comparable to five years ago. The level of production has increased very much and we have approached self-sufficiency. In the area of foodstuffs, cattle, poultry, fisheries, forests and others, thanks God we have advanced with coordination," elaborated the president. In the use of the resources of the country mines and industries have been activated and strengthened, and today Iran is an exporter of steel, copper and aluminum, three major elements for the industrialized world, he added. Rafsanjani pointed out that exports of the country during this period has almost quadruppled, and "if this movement continues, the second plan, God willing, can make us to a large extent independent of oil revenues...I think such successes are mainly because of the supports of the people and their presence on the scene." He said that for youth this year and in the future years there are new programmes, because "from the point of view of population our country is a young country, and our young forces require guidance and help so that they will be able to pass the course of the revolution well." The hojjat ol-eslam lauded the effective role played by Iran's Muslim women in the era of the revolution, and said "grounds for their added activity in the social affairs and this policy will continue to be exercized so that this year from the point of attention to the spiritual needs of our youths and especially women we will have a successful year." He was all praise for the armed forces and the unknown soldiers who serve the country and said their vigilence and sacrifice, saw Iran come out with flying colours during the era of holy defense (1980-88). The president spoke of big accomplishment in the heavy industries field and the procurement of raw materials for plants such as steel and petrochemicals. "We supplied all kinds of our needs for minerals, most of them can stand on their feet. We can control the market up to some degree, and we hope the shop keepers and the respectble traders will cooperate with us and will consider equity. We, too, will support them. "Of course, we agree with their balanced profit, and God willing, we will provide them with administrative facilities, especially for the people active in exports." He was hopeful that "with the support of self-sacrificing people and with the presence on the scene of the war disabled and the former pows and their proud families and with the efforts of those who work for the people with sincerity," Iran is fully geared up to welcome the second five year plan and to embark on the tasks ahead. He said "fortunately, in the last weeks of this past year foreign exchange constraints that had been created because of the fall of the oil price were removed, and in the coming year we will live without any constraints. Next year we will find a chance to have more power on the market." Turning to problems on the world scene, Hojjat ol-Eslam Rafsanjani said the Islamic society is having much headache. "Still in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kashmir, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Karabakh, Iraq, Somalia and many other places Muslims have difficulties and this indicates the spite world arrogance has towards Muslims and Islam." He said Iran was trying its best to to help Muslims and will continue to contribute towards the resolving of their problems. "Our foreign policy is nowhere clashes and strife, and I think problems can be solved by negotiations, peacefully and with cooperation," he was confident.
