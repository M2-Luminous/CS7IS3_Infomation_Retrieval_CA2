[Bekesi] Even if we assume that the MSZP will adhere to its program -- which in itself is brave, but I hope that this is what people voted for -- it is very dangerous to launch it on its own. It is true that we have a mathematical parliamentary majority, but the MSZP will have to keep this 54 percent, otherwise the one-party government will fail. Out of the 209 deputies, 149 won in individual districts and it is their moral obligation to firmly assert the interests of their own district already at the beginning of the cycle. Therefore, they will make serious demands on distribution: area development and infrastructural demands, the need to support unviable enterprises, and so on. However, we do not have the resources for this at the moment, and will not have them in 1995, either. [Emod] Can the trade unions also make similar demands? [Bekesi] Obviously. In addition to this, a social pact will have to be drawn up. If the MSZP governs on its own then it will have to yield to the powerful trade union demands, whether it likes it or not, which will obviously lead to overdistribution. Therefore, it is possible that the MSZP will deviate from the program's line to preserve the majority -- in the wake of unavoidable, well-meant compromises. This can result in the country's ability to meet its foreign payment obligations becoming endangered by the end of 1995. [Emod] Is it because this danger can only be avoided with a coalition that you will not accept a ministerial post in a one-party government? [Bekesi] It is. In my view, the coalition is not simply a parliamentary requirement because there is no such thing. It is not a political exigency, either, because this does not exist either. The coalition is a strategic necessity for the MSZP, the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], and the country, too. This is the reason I am saying that I do not see a guarantee for the program that I drew up to be implemented without a coalition. [passage omitted] [Emod] The most serious dilemma has not been solved because the structure of state spending has hardly changed. Do you agree with this? [Bekesi] Yes, nothing much has happened. The basis is the same; the budget is financing the same institutional system and tasks as in 1990. [passage omitted] [Emod] If this is so then the question seems superfluous: Can the reform of state finances be delayed any longer? [Bekesi] Not a minute, if we assess the consequences; later we can also look at the causes. The planned consolidated deficit of the state finances will be 330 billion forints. [passage omitted] As the population's savings will not be more than 220-240 billion forints even in an optimal case, a 100-billion-forint gap can already be seen. As for foreign financing, let us look at the current payment balance. Data of the first four months show a $1 billion deficit, so a $3-billion to $4-billion deficit can develop by the end of the year. [passage omitted] [Emod] I believe you wish to continue with the debt servicing, which is extremely high.... [Bekesi] More than $4 billion. In other words, $4 billion plus $3 billion in fresh money has to be brought into the country this year whether we like it or not. If we presume that we can sell some concession rights, that the privatization of medium-size enterprises is started, and that foreigners even buy from the share packages of some banks, then we can bring in $2 billion at best. Therefore we still have $5 billion which is nearly impossible to be brought in from abroad. [Emod] Do you still maintain this if we manage to make a new medium-term agreement with the IMF? [Bekesi] This is what I wanted to continue with. The new government will obviously announce a serious stabilization and modernization program. This is only realistic in the case of a coalition government because this is what the two parties represent, therefore, it can be the basis of the joint government program. On this basis, we can complete an agreement on financing a medium-term modernization with the IMF. Naturally, this can only be successful if we can make the IMF accept our 1995 and our longer-term economic program. [Emod] In an optimal case, how much can we borrow from abroad in 1994? [Bekesi] If the above conditions are met then we have a realistic chance to borrow $2 billion to $3 billion in the rest of the year. [passage omitted]
