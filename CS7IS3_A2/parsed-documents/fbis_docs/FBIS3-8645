[Drnovsek] Thank you! [Frelih] How do you see the political center? [Drnovsek] The Liberal Democracy of Slovenia [LDS] will definitely be a party of the political center. I personally see the political center in this party being a moderate party of moderate political views, devoid of any special ideology. We do not wish to change the world like various ideological parties have aspired to in the past, but to merely survive in this world in the best possible way. For this reason, this will be a party that will primarily emphasize the need for stability in Slovenia, the need for political and economic stability, a party that will build on maturity in the leadership of the country and experiences gained in it, and a party that will build on a firm financial and economic system, which would give as much as possible leeway to the free initiative of our people so that we can assert ourselves in the spheres where I believe the Slovenes are the strongest--namely, hard work and lots of initiative. We will offer what we have been offering in the LDS for the last two years, what is already producing results, and what is leading Slovenia out of the crisis. [Frelih] A new large formation has been created. You will command one-third of all seats in parliament. What do you fear more--internal frictions in the new party because of, shall we say, strong personalities or coalition disputes in the government itself? [Drnovsek] The LDS has been a big party even so far. The new LDS will also be a big, even bigger party. In any big party there are different people and different interests that need to be mutually coordinated. One must seek a balance between them. As the leader of this party I have been doing this even so far, relatively successfully, I trust. I am doing the same as the head of the government coalition and the prime minister. In a way, I am constantly juggling various interests; therefore, I do not expect any major problems of that nature in the future. I expect that we will manage to maintain and pursue a balanced policy within the party and within the government. Regarding powerful political personalities, there have been many in the LDS so far. There are many in the present government coalition and there were some in the previous coalition, too, however, in both cases things functioned fairly well, I guess.
