FR940831-0-00023 FR940831-0-00010 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;05&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8994; AD 94&hyph;16&hyph;04] Airworthiness Directives; Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH55A Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters, that requires a one-time visual inspection to detect missing or damaged tail rotor pedal bulkhead gussets (gussets), loose or missing gusset rivets, and initial installation of missing gussets or replacement of damaged gussets and rivets, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by reports of missing or damaged tail rotor pedal bulkhead gussets and loose or missing gusset rivets. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the tail rotor pedal support structure that could result in loss of tail rotor control and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective October 5, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 5, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Schweizer Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 147, Elmira, New York 14902. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jeff Casale, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, New York Aircraft Certification Office, Airframe Branch, ANE&hyph;172, New England Region, 181 S. Franklin Avenue, Valley Stream, New York 11581, telephone (516) 791&hyph;6220, fax (516) 791&hyph;9024. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Schweizer Aircraft Corporation and Hughes Helicopters, Inc. Model 269A, 269A&hyph;1, 269B, 269C, and TH55A series helicopters was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 1993 (58 FR 26264). That action proposed to require, within the next 100 hours' time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, a one-time visual inspection to detect missing or cracked gussets, elongated rivet holes, and loose or missing rivets. Also proposed, before further flight, was the initial installation of any missing gussets or replacement of cracked gussets, gussets with elongated rivet holes, or gussets that contain loose or missing rivets.
