UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink said eight armed UNPROFOR officers and three unarmed military observers had reached the enclave, where more than 60 people are reported to have died since a Bosnian Serb offensive began 10 days ago. The team, which set out from Sarajevo, was stopped by Serb forces at Rogatica, around 40 kilometres (25 miles) from Gorazde, the spokesman said. They were held up for several hours for administrative formalities despite having received all necessary authorisation, Annink said.
