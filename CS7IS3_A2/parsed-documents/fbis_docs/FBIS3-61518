It is prepared on the basis of cow's milk with a special serum lactis or whey, vitamins, trace elements (Fe and Cu), and other biologically active components. The product has good organoleptic indicators and contains 2.5-2.7 g of protein, 2.4-2.6 g of fat, and 3.6 g of carbohydrates per 100 ml. Clinical tests of the new preparation were carried out at the Alma-Ata oblast hospital on anemic patients and patients diagnosed with chronic gastritis. The behavior of the hemoglobin, erythrocyte, color index, serous iron, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (SOE) in the blood before and after treatment with Zhiger, the behavior of certain hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients against the backdrop of gastritis before and after treatment with Zhiger, and the behavior of certain hemopoietic indicators in anemic patients before and after therapy (control group) are summarized. The findings demonstrate that Zhiger leads to a verifiable change in the hematologic indicators when used on patients with anemia of first degree. In patients with anemia of second degree, treatment resulted in positive blood indicator dynamics. Tables 4.
