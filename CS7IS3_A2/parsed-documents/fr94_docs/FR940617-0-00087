FR940617-0-00087 FR940617-0-00019 40 CFR Part 61 [FRL&hyph;4893&hyph;5] Interpretive Rule for Roof Removal Operations Under the Asbestos NESHAP AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Interpretive rule. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') is today publishing an interpretive rule regarding roof removal operations under the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Asbestos (``Asbestos NESHAP''). The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP to cover; and specifying roof removal work practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations where the NESHAP applies. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 17, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Thomas Ripp at (703) 308&hyph;8727 at U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Stationary Source Compliance Division. For copies, contact Mr. Larry Tessier at 1&hyph;800&hyph;368&hyph;5888 or at (703) 305&hyph;5938. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 20, 1990, EPA published in the Federal Register (55 FR 48406) revisions to the Asbestos NESHAP, which is codified at 40 CFR part 61, subpart M. Members of the roofing industry have expressed confusion regarding the asbestos NESHAP and have requested clarification from EPA with regard to how compliance with the NESHAP can be achieved for roof removal operations. EPA is today publishing, as a new appendix A to subpart M of 40 CFR part 61, the interpretive rule that is set forth below. The purpose of the interpretive rule is to clarify the Asbestos NESHAP as it affects roof removal operations by: (i) Specifying which roof removal operations EPA construes the NESHAP to cover; and (ii) specifying roof removal work practices that EPA deems to be in compliance with the NESHAP in roofing operations where the NESHAP applies. The new appendix A to the Asbestos NESHAP does not supersede, alter or replace the Asbestos NESHAP; nor does it change the scope or stringency of the NESHAP. Rather appendix A interprets the NESHAP as it applies to roof removal operations, in order to provide particularized guidance which, if followed, would promote compliance with, and more effective and consistent enforcement of, the NESHAP in such operations. This interpretive rule is intended as guidance to the roofing industry and the public and does not constitute an action which is subject to judicial review under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1), or under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704. In addition, because the rule prescribed in this notice is an interpretive rule and does not promulgate or revise a standard or regulation listed in section 307(d)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(1)), the procedural requirements for rulemaking under the Clean Air Act and the Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to this action. See 42 U.S.C. 7607(d); 5 U.S.C. 553(b). It is the present intent of EPA that if this interpretive rule is revoked or withdrawn before new regulations regarding asbestos emissions or work practices for handling of asbestos containing materials during roof removal operations under the Clean Air Act are promulgated by EPA, then EPA shall replace the interpretive rule with another interpretation or guidance document that would address how the NESHAP applies to roof removal in renovation and demolition operations. It is also the present intent of EPA that prior to replacing or substantially revising this interpretive rule, EPA would consult with the public regarding such action.
