Walhi urged the government to take action against these companies by pressuring them to return the toxic waste to the country of origin, and if necessary, take legal action against them. Walhi's program director Muhammad Sifaudin Zulkarnaen disclosed the findings to reporters at his office in Jakarta on 17 March. Zulkarnaen was accompanied at the news conference by Walhi's information manager, Lili Hasannudin. The 10 companies are based in Jakarta and have imported at least 68 containers of plastic waste through Tanjung Priuk Port since 25 November 1992. In Ministerial Decree No. 349 dated 21 November 1992, the trade minister banned the import of industrial waste or plastic waste into the country effective 25 November 1992.
