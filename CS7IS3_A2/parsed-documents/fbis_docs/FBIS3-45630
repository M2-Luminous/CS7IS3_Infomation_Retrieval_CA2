Tsai] [Text] Taipei, Jan. 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan investors are welcome to explore the insurance market in Mainland China, a senior mainland insurance executive said here Thursday [20 January]. Li Yumin, president of Mainland China's insurance association, made the remark upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. Li led a 20-member delegation to Taiwan for a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait insurance cooperation. The mainland's insurance market is expected to be liberalized after Mainland China becomes a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Li noted, adding that prospects for the mainland insurance industry are good. At present, there are no Taiwan investments in the mainland's insurance industry, while more than 30 foreign insurance companies have established representative offices in Mainland China, he pointed out. Li, also chairman of the People's Insurance Company of China, and his 20-member mainland delegation will attend the cross-strait insurance forum January 22-25 at the Grand Hyatt Taipei. The three-day forum will be the second of its kind. The first was held in Beijing and Shanghai in September 1992. [separate sessions were held in those cities] Sponsored by the National Insurance Institute, the forum will focus on insurance rules and regulations, future trends, and the division of social and business insurance.
