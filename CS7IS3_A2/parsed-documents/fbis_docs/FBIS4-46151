Menon in Hyderabad, and Uday Mahurkar in Ahmedabad] [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In mid '88 -- the post Operation Black Thunder period -- terrorist success, even against the famed National Security Guard [NSG], had become directly proportional to demoralisation within the state police. Gill decided to make commandos out of his own policemen, a tactic based on the simple reasoning that a properly motivated and trained commando force having roots in Punjab would fight terrorists better. Drawn from the Punjab Armed Police, six companies of the police personnel underwent six months of training by army and Border Security Force [BSF] instructors, and were then deployed in Tarn Taran in 1989 on an experimental basis. Heartened by their progress against the militants, four more commando battalions were raised, a final moment of truth being "Operation Night Dominance" in late 1992 when the commandos finally pushed the terrorists to the wall. All doubts about the efficacy of this brainchild were erased by the figures: till January 31 last year, the commandos were involved in 117 encounters in which 222 terrorists were killed, including 56 hardcore ones, and 283 weapons seized. Only 14 commandos were killed in the anti-terrorist drive since 1989 as against more than 1,300 police casualties during this period. Today, Punjab has a 10,482-strong commando contingent, the biggest in the country, and as IG [Inspector General] (Commandos) P. Lal says: "They are the finest fighting machine." The repercussions of this success story were immediate. The Assam Government, for example, requisitioned two battalions from the Punjab Police to deal with ULFA [United Liberation Front of Assam] insurgents, and even sent down a batch of 90 Assam Police officers for commando training in Punjab. Training depends on each state's requirement, whether it be urban terrorism in Bombay or guerrilla warfare in the jungles of Andhra Pradesh. Commando tactics, parajumping, defensive driving, rock climbing, sniper training and field survival techniques, once absent from the policeman's dictionary are now an intrinsic part of his vocabulary. Physical and written tests are de rigueur, and equally common are psychologists in the state selection panels. Every sort of terrorist situation is simulated and Andhra Pradesh's Special Security Force (SSF) commandos are forced to understand and undergo the same rigours of a militant by spending a week in the jungle without food or water. Not surprisingly the drop out rate is steep. In Punjab about 25 per cent while at the Special Security Group of Tamil Nadu (SSG), of the 6,000 officers and constables initially selected, not more than 200 will eventually make the grade. With training comes weaponry. Standard weapons now include automatic assault rifles and 9 mm pistols. Tamil Nadu has imported 50 MP-5 rifles -- a close-quarter battle rifle -- and 70 fibre glass Glock pistols at a cost of Rs 50 lakh. The SSG is the only elite force equipped with imported Motorola communication systems. The Punjab commandos have 51 mm mortar and will soon have 450 imported sniper rifles. Yet, despite every effort, shortcomings in some states remain. Incentives are often not enough and facilities and equipment not always available and affordable. Although some units, like the Special Operations Squad (SOS) in Maharashtra get 50 per cent more pay than their counterparts, a special clothing allowance and injury compensation, it is not always the case. The West Bengal commando draws the same salary as any other policeman there, forcing a top police official to remark: "In the absence of special incentives, motivation to become commandos is lacking among our police ranks." In Delhi sub-inspectors get Rs [rupees] 100 extra and a special diet allowance of Rs 4 a day. Funds are a source of worry too. West Bengal's commando unit is floundering because of lack of resources. In Haryana the situation has necessitated some improvisation. The commandos there are using a railway bridge on a canal as a water obstacle course. And in Madhya Pradesh, a police officer admits that "if we get the guns we don't get the ammunition." There is also the question over their role, for there are states where the commando has become a glorified bodyguard, in danger of becoming a footman for every VIP with a security paranoia. Yet, commando operations in some states are advancing rapidly. Haryana has set up a 40-acre commando complex near Karnal which cost Rs 3 crore while the SSG has an exclusive 100 acre shooting range for reflex shooting training. Punjab, which has constantly set the pace, is as usual ahead of others. The police will shortly set up a computerised combat shooting range at a cost of Rs 1 crore, a facility which only the NSG has. Also being acquired are an Infantry Weapons Effect Simulator System whereby an actual combat situation can be simulated, and a Small Arms Training System to sharpen shooting ability, both of which will cost Rs 23 lakh. Also in the pipeline is a Rs 80 lakh water obstacle course and the purchase of 270 sighting telescopes. A creditable spinoff in raising crack outfits has been that it has ushered in a commando culture within police forces. The basic purpose is to upgrade the policing without involving elite commandos in normal law and order problems. In Punjab, about 4,500 policemen have been given commando training and they are called district commandos. The SSG has trained more than 8,000 inspectors and sub- inspectors in batches so far and the Gujarat commandos have trained more than 400 policemen from districts. The SSF has raised a smaller commando unit -- City Guards -- to check terrorist activities in Hyderabad. The message is clear. India's police force, a target for taunts, will no longer turn their untrained backs on crises any more. In a nation where so many areas are torn by internal and external strife, the police commando has emerged to play a significant role. Says Haryana DGP, Kalyan Rudra: "The emerging complex security scenario requires the police forces to acquire deterrent teeth." They have, and they are ready to bite.
