Udaltsov February 28 do not reflect official Russian government policy. Despite continuing attempts by the Russian side to make withdrawal conditional and despite a spiraling Russian campaign of accusations and intimidation, the Estonian negotiating team described the withdrawal agreement as "practically ready" going into the current round of talks being held March 1-2 outside Tallinn. The final date for full withdrawal, August 31, 1994, was agreed upon at the 16th round. The Russians still have not presented a timetable, however. The slow-down in both the withdrawal of troops and the turn-over of military installations to Estonian authorities began in October 1993 and has continued to date. Although the number of Russian troops stationed in Estonia is now about 2,600, hundreds of military sites, bases, training fields, depots, airfields, housing units and intelligence and communications centers remain under Russian control. These are mostly located in the capital city of Tallinn and in surrounding Harju County. About 70 of these are of particular concern to Estonia due to their size, strategic importance or the presence of hazardous materials. Important Russian military storage facilities include Maenniku and Klooga ammunition dumps (3500 tons), the 2748th Mine Storage Facility, the 2753rd Mortar Shell Base (7500 tons of ammunition and explosives), the 690th Chemical Storage (300 tons), the 2577th Technical Storage, the 2754th Mine and Torpedo Base, the 2394th Mine and Torpedo Storage, and the 3063rd Fuel Storage (above ground tanks plus underground storage 400 meters long). High levels of radioactivity detected at the Chemical Storage has caused further delays there. On the positive side, according to the Russians, the number of mines stored on Naissaar has been reduced to 450, all scheduled to have been burned by April 1. The Russian armed forces are primarily stationed at the Tallinn Naval Base, the 144th Motorized Division, the 93rd Naval Training Center with two nuclear reactors in Paldiski, the Russian Navy's Radio Intelligence Unit, and the Naval Auxiliary Control Center. According to Russian negotiators, nearly 6,000 of the pensioned Russian military in Estonia are men under the age of sixty. Over 1,000 of these are under the age of fifty, with fully 360 younger than 45 years of age. In addition, there may be as many as 5,000 officers who have left or are leaving the Russian military without qualifying for pensions. There is no way for Estonian authorities to record or check such individuals. According to the Estonian Security Police Board, the continuing presence of former Soviet occupation troops in Estonia increases political tensions, destabilizes society, and directly increases crime.
