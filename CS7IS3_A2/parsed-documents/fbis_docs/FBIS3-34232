We could have signed the agreement in Davos last week. Rabin, however, refused. I am telling you this in no uncertain terms -- Rabin deliberately delayed the signing. [Peri] Dr. Sha'th, Peres and 'Arafat will meet in Cairo in three days. Is there any chance they will sign the agreement this time? [Sha'th] I have no expectations and I also do not know what to think. I wish I could put my finger on the real reason that Rabin is delaying the signing. [Peri] Is Rabin delaying? 'Arafat was the one who agreed and then backtracked. [Sha'th] I want to tell you unequivocally that in Davos last week we could have signed, but Rabin spoiled it. I do not understand why he did this. Perhaps it is because the agreement with Syria is more important for him; because of the over-sensitivity of your senior defense establishment, or because of the tension between your number one and number two men. I have witnessed this tension between the number one and number two men on our side as well. I recognize the symptoms. [Peri] Tell us your version of what exactly happened at Davos. [Sha'th] I think that Rabin is now trying to play the game he believes we played in Cairo when Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] and Peres reached an agreement and 'Arafat canceled it at the last minute. Let me tell you what happened at Davos. We sat in one room with Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa and everything was almost wrapped up. Peres said: I have to make a final phone call to Rabin. He was radiant. Then he went to make his phone call and returned completely downcast. We immediately understood things did not go well. Peres returned to the table and said: I am sorry, I do not have time, I have to fly to Washington. He offered no explanations, but we gathered that Jerusalem decided to hold back. [Peri] What happened after Peres left? [Sha'th] We agreed to continue the talks in Cairo on Tuesday [1 February]. The Israelis, however, failed to appear. I phoned Amnon Shahaq, the head of the Israeli delegation, and asked him why he did not show up. Shahaq said: I did not receive any instructions. Later I called again, but Shahaq repeated the same words without offering any explanations. I asked him: When will you come? Why don't you send Yo'el Singer meanwhile? Shahaq answered: I do not know. [Peri] Do you think Rabin does not want to reach an agreement? [Sha'th] He is behaving strangely, with a mixture of positive and negative elements. I think he is acting out of anger. Since Rabin assumed power he has been changing his priorities every month. Once it was al-Asad, and then it was 'Arafat. One month he is talking about 'Syria First,' the next month he opts for the 'PLO First.' Now 'Arafat is the good guy and al-Asad the villain; next month it will be exactly the opposite, with Rabin giving al-Asad and 'Arafat opposite roles. [Peri] You claim that Rabin is conducting his policy out of anger. My colleague Sever Plotzker wrote that 'Arafat is conducting a policy of "coitus interruptus." [Sha'th, laughing] This term is inappropriate. Can anybody suspect 'Arafat of not being interested in an agreement and a withdrawal? If you want to speak about "coitus interruptus," then look at Rabin-Peres. It is there you will find a coitus interruptus, not among us. 'Arafat was never as positive, flexible, realistic, warm, and humane as he was in Davos. You should have followed the deluge of telephone calls from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to the Israeli delegation. Every five minutes there was a phone call from Rabin or Baraq. You would think that your entire army and defense establishment took on your diplomatic echelon at Davos. [Peri] People in Israel believe 'Arafat wants to delay the signing of the agreement in order to squeeze more concessions out of Israel. [Sha'th] Let me tell you in no uncertain terms: Your boss does not want the agreement to be signed now. He also does not want anybody else to do the job for him. At the same time I am not saying Rabin has backtracked. He is interested in the agreement, but he is in no hurry to adhere to the timetable, even if everything has been prepared. [Peri] How long will it take to finalize the agreement? [Sha'th] It is possible to finalize it next week. Although some issues still need to be settled, such as the border crossings and the security of the Gaza Strip and Jericho area settlements, altogether we reached reasonable standards in Davos. If there is a will to sign, it will be possible to wrap things up. You will not believe how diligent and productive Singer and I can be. In Davos we worked around the clock. I did not even see the door of my hotel room. I reached Davos by helicopter and was driven to the (Zehof) hotel, where we worked until 0600. Everything went fine. I thought to myself that this time we are going to finish things up. Peres was very cooperative and happy -- until Rabin's phone call. [Peri] What did you think when Peres reentered the room with such a dejected look? [Sha'th] It reminded me of my university days. We had a lecturer who was always late or absent. I decided to punish him by not coming to some of the lectures, but in the end I lost credit for that course. [Peri] If you decide to punish Rabin you could lose the chance for an Israeli withdrawal. [Sha'th] Rabin cannot afford to let this go. He stands to lose too much. [Peri] What do you think about the criticism leveled at Peres after everybody saw him holding hands with 'Arafat? [Sha'th, laughing] I read in the newspapers that Rabin was angry. Could it be that he was jealous? I do not want to intervene in this unique relationship between your number one and number two men. However, I really do not understand why Peres has to apologize for "holding hands" with 'Arafat, and why Rabin had to immediately flex his muscles. 'Arafat did not want to get Peres in trouble when he took his hand. On the contrary, our number one man tried to evince warmth, to be communicative and positive with the man you sent to conduct the negotiations. It was a demonstration of the desire for peace. Instead of a positive reaction, however, there was an uproar in Israel. A simple humane gesture was blown all out of proportion. [Peri] Now, in this interview from your Cairo home, you seem to be upset and bitter. [Sha'th] I have good reason to be frustrated at a personal level. I was invited, along with Shim'on Peres, by U.S. Vice President Al Gore, to receive a prize from the "Buds of Peace" organization. I had to apologize to the organizers and tell them I was waiting in Cairo for Shahaq and Singer to finalize the draft agreement. However, they did not come because, as they put it, "they did not receive any instructions." I know very well who was it who did not give them those instructions.
