If the administration is not efficient in this aspect, there is no chance of success, even with the proper resources, or even if there is a guaranteed demand for the product. Cuba is different from the majority of Latin American countries and thanks to wise, humanitarian policies, has a population with a high educational level. Nevertheless, for various reasons, including administrative errors, that enormous resource is seldom fulfilled today. The editorial adds: These causes relate to the depressed state of our economy and the nonexistence or inadequate systemic structures within the administration of the enterprises. Although this does not justify administrative errors, it is true that the improper use of human potential in our work centers is in part due to what many call the spider web, a thick bundle of structures, mechanisms, formulas, and outdated regulations that deprive management of the autonomy, authority, and capacity for decision-making. TRABAJADORES points out, however, that many of these administrators use this situation to evade responsibility for the results of their work and display very little initiative. Under today's difficult conditions, two very different attitudes are clearly observed among administrators -- those who justify themselves, and those who work. Those who do the justifying are experts at inventing excuses for their management problems -- I was not oriented, they did not comply. The economic efficiency assemblies, among other merits, classify the groups to which the administrators belong -- either to the group that is expert at excuses, or to that which struggles and strives to achieve respect within a collective that needs managers, not rehearsed excuses. The editorial adds: When the workers do not have water to quench their thirst, when there are excess workers or when there are not enough workers for the needed production, when there is unused land that is not organized for self-sufficiency planting, the administrator is responsible. When the by-products of the primary production are not utilized or equipment is underutilized, fundamentally, the boss is responsible. Attention to man, in the broad sense of the concept, forms an essential part of the administrative function -- the ability to reach goals through the conscious cooperation of a collective of workers. All our administrators should understand that attention to man, communication with workers, and joint action does not depend on the amount of a material incentive because the human will is not merchandise. The TRABAJADORES editorial adds: To win the will of the workers, practical, systematic, and daily action is needed to establish that the workers are the principle protagonists. They are the ones who possess the greatest reserve of economic and technological talent. They are the ones who can judge whether or not administrative management serves national economic interests and the workplace. The editorial concludes that these analyses have come about in the efficiency assemblies and are not meant to distance administration from the workers, but rather, to unite them in a joint project.
