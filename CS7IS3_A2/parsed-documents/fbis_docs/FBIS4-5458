When the ambassador entered the office of the Burmese minister, the latter reportedly slammed a copy of one of Thailand's English-language dailies on the table before the Thai envoy could take a seat, and demanded: "What's the meaning of this? Why does your government allow the press in your country to publish lies about us?" The Thai diplomat was stunned by such behaviour coming from a high-ranking official. He had not even had time to calmly reply that there is such a thing as freedom of the press in his country. It seems, however, the words of a Thai diplomat hold no water in a country where the word freedom is rivalled by its powerful nemesis -- imprisonment. Now we hear that the Thai Foreign Ministry has invited Burmese Information Minister Myo Thant to Bangkok on Wednesday to explain the Government's policy on a free and liberal press. The invitation is aimed at erasing Rangoon's doubts that the Government supports press criticism of the State Law and Order Restoration Council, according to sources in the Interior Ministry. The sources added that the visit will provide Brigadier General Myo Thant the opportunity to see that the Thai press has the freedom to express its opinion without Government control. How the Government is going to do this, we do not know, but one thing we do know is that it will be a waste of the Thai Government's time, money, and energy to expect a non-believer in basic human rights to understand what freedom of speech means. As members of the press, we strongly object to the Government's plans to display us like freaks in a sideshow to the Burmese military while at the same time pursuing a policy of "constructive engagement" with the so-called Burmese government, which has been shunned by most of the international community. We do not believe in the staging of a Richardson-Suu Kyi-like circus to try to fool the world into thinking that authoritarianism does not exist in Burma, when in fact it does. In short: Don't use the press like Khin Nyunt does, for his own selfish reasons. If freedom of press does exist in this country, as the Government claims, then there is no reason to shout it for the rest of the world to hear, especially Burma, which is calling itself Myanmar and has changed its flag without the consent of its people. The Thai press knows how much freedom it has and where to draw the line when reporting on events that affect national security or when criticising a high-ranking government or military official. This is called responsible journalism or self-censorship, depending on how one looks at it. It is said that the press in Thailand is the most free of all those in the ASEAN countries. We praise the Government for showing such a high degree of tolerance for the fourth estate. The Rangoon government already knows the Thai press has the freedom to air its opinions, if and when it sees fit, without government control, even when criticising Burma or other countries. This paper has even assailed Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri's decision to invite Rangoon to attend the ASEAN conference in July as guest of the host country. The generals in Burma also know that the press in Thailand has a voice of its own because it refuses to address that country as Myanmar and its capital as Yangon, despite the acquiescence of this Government and the United Nations. The BANGKOK POST and THE NATION have turned down repeated requests by the Burmese Embassy on Pan Road to stop calling its country Burma. We choose not to comply with their request because doing so would mean recognising an illegitimate government. As one prominent Thai editor put it: "Burma remains Burma until the Burmese people decide for themselves after elections whether the name of their country should be changed." So if this Government is to invite the Burmese Information Minister here just to prove that there is a free press in this country, then it is wasting its time. It's plain stupidity to cast pearls before swine, or as the Burmese themselves say, to woo a buffalo with the melodious sounds of the harp. Instead, we suggest that the invitation be extended to the silenced members of the Slorc-controlled media. They would appreciate the chance to see for themselves how their counterparts in Thailand practice journalism in a free society without interference or intimidation from the powers that be.
