FR940628-1-00070 FR940628-1-00014 Forty-two comments concerning the ANPRM and the Planning Document were received. A Summary of Comments was placed in the docket on September 15, 1993. Ten commenters addressed the Planning Document, eight of whom had also commented on the ANPRM. Responses to the Planning Document, for the most part, were abridged forms of the commenters' responses to the ANPRM. All the commenting vehicle manufacturers asserted that, while stability metrics are statistically related to the rates with which single vehicle accidents result in rollovers, they are not causally related to rollover. Therefore, the manufacturers asserted, the agency cannot issue a regulation based on any one of these metrics solely because of its statistical correlation with accident data. Automotive Testing, BMW, Ford, GM, the American Automobile Manufacturers Association (AAMA, then known as the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association), and VW claimed that stability metrics are insufficient by themselves to explain a vehicle's degree of involvement in rollover crashes. These commenters stated that driver and environmental factors outweigh the contributions of vehicle factors to the likelihood of a single vehicle accident becoming a rollover. Nevertheless, most commenters addressed the relevancy of several of the individual metrics the agency considered for a vehicle stability rulemaking. Tilt table angle, one of the metrics being proposed in this notice, appeared to be more acceptable to the commenters than the other stability metrics. While side pull ratio was favored by Automotive Testing, Chrysler, GM, and Nissan, all these commenters also commented favorably on aspects of tilt table angle. Static stability factor was favored by only Perrone Forensic Consulting, who also commented favorably on tilt table angle. All other commenters who indicated a preference among the metrics discussed in the ANPRM favored tilt table angle. However, Chrysler, Ford, GM, Isuzu, and VW claim vehicle changes made to improve a vehicle's tilt table performance may degrade a vehicle's control and handling attributes. Chrysler said that the repeatability of results from the tilt table procedure was unknown. On the other hand, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the International Organization of Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, and GM stated they believe that the procedure is repeatable. Chrysler and AAMA also commented that the tilt table test is not a standard practice and its measurement error has not been established. Commenters did not respond directly to the idea of using critical sliding velocity, which is also being proposed for use in this notice. However, most manufacturers commented that center of gravity height (a measurement necessary to calculate critical sliding velocity) is difficult to measure and that the measurement is not repeatable. Therefore, according to these commenters, any metric which uses center of gravity height would be impracticable. The commenters also focussed on crashworthiness improvements. By far the most favorable crashworthiness countermeasure cited by the commenters was increased seat belt use to prevent ejections. In general, commenters believe that more benefits could be gained through increased seat belt use than through any vehicle related crashworthiness or crash avoidance countermeasure. Some commenters also favored improved roof structures including roll bars or cages, but Ford, GM, Nissan, and VW believe the installation of a roll bar or cage raises the vehicle's center of gravity and decreases rollover stability. Other suggestions were for improved glazing, improved latch/lock/hinge systems for doors, anti-lock brakes, bumper height regulations, removal of drunk and otherwise impaired drivers from the road, stricter enforcement of speed limits, and improved public awareness of the causes of rollover crashes as ways to reduce rollover casualties. Finally, Chrysler, GM, AAMA, and Toyota claimed that labeling vehicles with a stability metric would be simplistic and could mislead consumers, giving them a false sense of security in a vehicle labeled with a high stability metric (i.e., a metric indicating comparatively high resistance to rollover). These commenters believe that consumers could consider the metric to be an absolute measure of rollover likelihood, regardless of driver behavior or roadway conditions.
