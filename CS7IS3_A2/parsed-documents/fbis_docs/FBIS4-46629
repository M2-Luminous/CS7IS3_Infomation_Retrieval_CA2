He served first in the Kartalinskyy Division, in an OS missile regiment, and then went to the Academy imeni Dzerzhinskyy. After graduation he was assigned to the Plesetsk test range. Colonel Oleksandr Serdyuk returned to serve in Ukraine in 1992. We was deputy chief of the directorate for missile and space weaponry. and then was named by order of the Minister of Defense to the position of chief of the Center for Administrative Management of Strategic Nuclear Forces of the Ministry of Defense [MO] of Ukraine. [S. Zhurets] A Ukrainian delegation headed by Vice Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov recently returned from the United States. There they discussed, among other things, the question of deactivating the missile systems stationed in Ukraine. How do you, directly heading up the structure of the MO that is performing this crucial and difficult work, regard the status and prospects for the nuclear disarmament of our nation? [O. Serdyuk] The fulfillment of deactivation is naturally an additional demand on the officers of the 43rd Army and the officers of our Center, insofar as the task of removing the missile systems from combat duty and performing the tasks of deactivating them are being added to the everyday tasks of maintaining the missile and special equipment in proper condition. These tasks are work of enhanced security in and of themselves, and their performance requires quite a bit of human and material resources. The principal burden of performing this work lies on the officers of the 43rd Missile Army, with considerable organizational activity performed by the specialists of our center as well. [S. Zhurets] And Ukraine will be able to fulfill unconditionally the obligations it has assumed at the international level, for the deactivation of the 46 SS-24 missiles, within the ten-month time period stipulated in the trilateral statement of the presidents? [O. Serdyuk] There are no grounds today to say that we will not be able to perform those tasks. The removal of the combat systems from duty is proceeding according to plan, and we are fulfilling the schedule that was approved by the government, as well as the schedule that was stipulated in addition to the trilateral statement of the presidents. We have already performed more than half of the deactivation work. [S. Zhurets] The separation of the warheads from the strategic missiles is perhaps the simplest of what awaits the servicemen of the 43rd Army, with the more difficult problems--in particular the subsequent destruction of the launch stages and the missile silos, and the ecological support for that process--still ahead. That work, as is well known, envisages a comprehensive program of gradual cutbacks and the elimination of land- and air-launched nuclear weapons. How is the fulfillment of that program proceeding? [O. Serdyuk] We are doing work in the preparatory stages of fulfilling this comprehensive program that was approved by the government. Ukraine, in accordance with the decree of the Supreme Soviet ratifying the START-1 Treaty, is to eliminate 36 percent of the launch stages and launchers. Disarmament, as we see, is thus a very prolonged process, which must be provided with financial resources first and foremost. We have gotten into a paradoxical situation today--it is much cheaper to maintain the missile systems, to keep them in a proper state, than today, under conditions of harsh economic crisis, when we have to strain to remove those systems from duty. That process is not an advantageous one for us economically. The amount of money that we need for that has already been noted in the press. Without sufficient financing we could get into a situation where we will be forced, whether we want to or not, to lengthen the time period or halt the work. I have in mind here not the deactivation, but the work on the elimination itself. And it would be a shame, of course, if the funds that are allocated for the elimination measures (talking here about the trillion karbovantsi allocated by the budget of Ukraine for 1994 for elimination measures) were received very irregularly. As of today, with a whole quarter virtually gone by, we have received only approximately 27 billion karbovantsi of that required. That is far too little. The more so as the comprehensive program is not only, and not so much, the elimination measures alone. It is also the resolution of the social problems of servicemen in the strategic forces, which we have always put in first place. The discussion here concerns the building of housing for officers, the creation of jobs, medical support for the servicemen who take part in the elimination measures and deactivation work. The officers of the strategic forces are laboring under highly strained conditions today. They have to perform three tasks simultaneously--be on combat alert duty and maintain combat readiness, remove the RS-18 missiles from service, and carry out the deactivation process. These are one and the same crews, one and the same people. And they, in performing their crucial work to destroy one of the largest strategic arsenals in the world, have to be certain of their future, of their social protections. That is why under today's conditions, with inadequate financing, it would be expedient to adopt a model of the elimination process whereby that elimination is carried out in stages. After all of the work has been performed on one missile system--that is, it has been removed from duty, broken down and the equipment dismantled, social problems have been resolved and work has been completed on recultivation of the terrain--only then should the elimination of the next ballistic-missile system begin. And not the way it could occur--all of the missiles taken away, the silos closed up in accordance with the START-1 procedure, the holes left and the social problems of the servicemen unresolved. [S. Zhurets] What assistance can we expect from the United States--so much talked about, especially lately--under these conditions? [O. Serdyuk] Comparative indicators of our expenditures on the path of nuclear disarmament with the actual payments to this process on the part of the United States is far from to the advantage of the latter. As of May, we have received just 2,000 tonnes of fuel, three truck cranes and six specialized vehicles out of the promised American aid, defined as 185 million dollars. The principal shortcoming of the American aid is moreover not so much the amount of it, as the very narrow area for its utilization. This was caused by the restrictions of Nunn-Lugar, which does not permit that aid to be directed to the resolution of such topical problems of the Armed Forces as social protections for servicemen who will be discharged from the Army owing to the elimination of the nuclear weapons. There will be, after all, no "real" money, we will receive only the material and technical means for the elimination work in the indicated amount. It must be pointed out that the assistance of the United States should be considered not an act of charity, but rather as natural compensation for the military and economic losses of Ukraine connected with their nuclear weapons. [S. Zhurets] One could perhaps recall here that one of the recent consultations pertaining to the distribution of the additional financial assistance of the Americans insisted that 50 million dollars be directed, first and foremost, to dismantling the 46 SS-24 missiles. [O. Serdyuk] Yes, that was the approach. The Americans have a vested interest in that elimination, and that is naturally why they pose such questions. We have, in my view, so many problems with regard to the elimination of those missiles whose guarantee periods have expired, the RS-18s, that to say that we should begin the elimination of the SS-24s would be absurd. Ukraine has not assumed any international obligations whatsoever on that score. [S. Zhurets] We are to salvage more than a third of the launch stages. A considerable portion of them were manufactured in Russia. Wouldn't it be more advantageous to resolve the problem with the salvaging of those missiles at Russian plants, rather than invest funds in the expansion of a salvage base in Dnipropetrovsk that will scarcely be needed after that work? [O. Serdyuk] The decision has already been made pertaining to the the building of a yard and neutralization station at the Pivdenne KB [Design Bureau]. That work has already started. That is first; second, the Russian Federation has actually offered to take those missiles for salvage. Those proposals, however, were far from being free. Taking into account the fact that the construction of the neutralization station is being done at the expense of the American funds, that approach would obviously be expedient. [S. Zhurets] How do matters stand with fuel storage? [O. Serdyuk] The construction of storage facilities for the missile-fuel components is being done today at the expense of that trillion for elimination, which is being allocated in very erratic fashion. Quite a bit of effort will have to be applied here to fulfill that task. More than half of the heptyl could be used for the needs of the national space program. The guaranteed storage time of heptyl (close to fifteen years) would make it possible to count on such an option. [S. Zhurets] Since you have already brought up the prospects, one fundamental issue concerns the future of the infrastructure of the 43rd Missile Army. It would be regrettable, after all, if those multi-billion facilities were to be reduced to nothing. [O. Serdyuk] The infrastructure of the missile systems stationed on the territory of Ukraine could doubtless be preserved and used again, with the corresponding government decision and with the corresponding capital investment. It could be preserved and used or wasted irreversibly, since after the elimination of the missile launch silos in Ukraine, the aura that is created by the status of a nuclear-missile state would essentially be destroyed as well. This decision is doubtless exceptionally important for the future of Ukraine. A considered approach, in my opinion, has been demonstrated by our parliament in designating a quota for the elimination of launch stages and missile silos--36 percent. The rest of the potential could and should be used for the accomplishment of tasks connected with ensuring the country's security. If all of this is destroyed, then we cannot expect that Ukraine will be able to restore that infrastructure some other time. [S. Zhurets] Thank you for the interview, and I hope that NARODNA ARMIYA, with your assistance, will return again to the complex and exceptionally important topic for Ukraine of nuclear disarmament. As the material was being prepared for press, it became known that an agreement has been signed between the governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation on the fulfillment of the trilateral declaration of the presidents in Moscow. That document stipulates deadlines for the removal of nuclear weapons from the territory of Ukraine--no later than 1997--and the obligation of Russia to send fuel for nuclear-power plants to Ukraine and account for the value of the tactical weapons that were removed from our territory, to be counted toward our debt to Russia for power carriers.
