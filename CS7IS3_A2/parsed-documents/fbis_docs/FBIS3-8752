E.": "The Czech Army Does Not Shop in Vlasim"] [Text] Vlasim--Yesterday, Defense Minister Antonin Baudys festively launched the production of the newly developed NATO 5.56 x 45-mm cartridges at the Vlasim enterprise Sellier & Bellot. This cartridge is standard issue in the NATO member countries, and we are the first former socialist country to produce something like that. The Vlasim enterprise used to supply ammunition to the Czechoslovak Army, but the shipments completely stopped after 1989. To the question of where the Czech Army gets its ammunition now, if not in the Czech arms factories, Minister Baudys replied that our oversize Army has a large stockpile of ammunition and is gradually using it up. It is necessary also for the sake of expediency--many of the older cartridges will not fit future modern equipment. "If the Czech Army will have arms of this caliber, one that is used by NATO, it will certainly purchase its ammunition in Vlasim," the defense minister added. Sellier & Bellot is a stockholding company privatized in the first wave of coupon privatization. The company has not made use of the originally considered stock reserved for a foreign partner and recommended that the shares be placed in the second wave of coupon privatization. It has successfully made up for the decline in domestic demand by exports. "Today, we do not need foreign capital, although the munitions business is not as lucrative as people believe," said the chairman of the board of the stockholding company, Jiri Hanak.
