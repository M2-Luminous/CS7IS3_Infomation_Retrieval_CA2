FR940214-0-00021 FR940214-0-00004 19. Section 1944.215(a) Comment: Two respondents expressed agreement with this section. Another respondent voiced an opinion that to require more expensive building materials and, even though maintenance costs will be less, is contradictory to cost containment goals. FmHA response: The Agency has witnessed what happens when cheaper building materials are used to initially control costs. The results have been high maintenance costs over the life of the materials and the ultimate replacement of the materials. While construction costs may be lower using the cheaper building materials, these savings are more than overshadowed by the high maintenance costs necessary to prolong the use of the materials. FmHA strongly advocates the use of low maintenance and long life materials in its construction. 20. Section 1944.215(a)(1) Comment: There were several comments expressed about the costs being ``locked in'' to either our cost tracking system or to the Marshall & Swift estimates, thereby not allowing any inflation increases. It was also noted that projects with abnormally high or low costs should not be entered into the system and that only newer (one year old) projects be tracked. It was felt that the borrower should not be responsible for resolving differences between a proposed project's costs and those costs in the FmHA tracking system or in the Marshall & Swift estimates. Another respondent suggested that the tracking system allow for a comparison of bedroom sizes rather than project to project comparison. One respondent felt that the tracking system should provide for a distinction between new construction and rehabilitation. FmHA response: The new cost tracking system will allow FmHA to track by line item the costs of construction. For instance, the final estimated cost of concrete for a proposed project will be recorded in the system at the time the loan is obligated. Once the project has been built and the costs are certified (identity of interest projects), the certified cost of concrete will also be recorded in the system and will become the basis for establishing a benchmark on costs. This should take into consideration the inflationary escalation of costs during the construction period. Thereafter, the line item costs for each new proposal will be compared with the amounts recorded in the tracking system. Local FmHA offices will allow for future inflationary increases just as they do now. Only the projects received and processed after the tracking system comes on line will be entered. We intended that significant differences between an applicant's cost estimates and the estimates of our established tracking costs or Marshall & Swift be resolved since FmHA will not arbitrarily accept any estimates which appear out of line or unreasonable. We foresee the borrower's responsibility for resolving the differences in cost as either providing justification for the differences or taking whatever action is required to ensure the best estimates are being considered in the construction. This method of tracking construction costs will make no distinction between numbers of bedrooms or new construction vs. rehabilitation; costs will be tracked on a line item basis and not on a project basis. 21. Section 1944.215(a)(2) Comment: A few respondents suggested that FmHA establish timeframes for District and State Offices to follow during preapplication and application review processing. Another respondent suggested that the AD&hyph;622 cover only the authorization to develop plans and specifications and that the balance of the application not be pursued until receipt of the plans and specifications and after the appraisal is completed. It was felt that this would reduce the time between signing of the construction documents and the start of construction. FmHA response: From periodic assessments made of the multi-family housing program by FmHA's National Office, it is apparent that the field staff's time is being utilized to its fullest extent. The large volume of preapplications being filed has placed a considerable burden on the field, particularly when those preapplications which will not continue to be processed because of their rating must still receive some degree of attention. To place timeframes on the field for each step of processing would be unrealistic since they would most likely be impossible for the staff to meet. We do not agree that authorizing just the completion of plans and specifications would reduce the time between signing of the construction contract and the actual start of construction, since there are many other items needed to complete the application and these could not be addressed until we authorized the applicant to proceed to a full application. The cost estimates should be updated at the time the construction contract is signed so that the most up-to-date estimates are obtained prior to approving the loan. 22. Section 1944.215(a)(3) Only one comment was received and the respondent agreed with this section. 23. Section 1944.215(a)(4) Only one comment was received and the respondent agreed with this section. 24. Section 1944.215(a)(5) Comment: There were numerous objections to establishing a set number of units per acre because of the size, shape, and condition of sites.
