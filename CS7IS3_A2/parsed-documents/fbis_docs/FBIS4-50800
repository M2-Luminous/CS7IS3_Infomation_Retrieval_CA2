Ren Jianxin, member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the CCCMPS, pointed out: Vigorously and conscientiously implementing the central authorities' policy, party committees, governments, and various departments at all levels have adopted many realistic and effective measures and done a large amount of difficult and painstaking work in maintaining stability. Judging from the present situation, we think it is possible to maintain sustained social stability so long as we conscientiously make unremitting efforts to handle the task. CCCMPS Vice Chairmen Luo Gan and Cao Zhi, CCCMPS members in Beijing, and comrades in charge of all the relevant departments of the central authorities participated in the plenary session. CCCMPS member and concurrently CCCMPS General Office Director Chen Jiping [7115 0370 1627] gave a briefing on a tentative plan to hold a national work conference on the comprehensive management of public security in rural areas; comrades attending the plenary session expressed their views on how to successfully hold the conference and on the various tasks and measures to be proposed during the conference. In his speech, Ren Jianxin stressed the importance and necessity of improving comprehensive management of public security in rural areas. He said: The situation of public security nationwide remains very grim since early this year. Party committees and governments at all levels must attach a high degree of importance to the issue. On the one hand, judicial and public security departments must step up their crackdown on serious criminal activities and serious economic crimes; on the other hand, other measures for the comprehensive management of public security must be conscientiously implemented. At present, the number of public security problems has greatly increased in some rural areas. The masses strongly complain about this. We must under no circumstances underestimate the impact that rural areas' public security problems will have on the situation nationwide. We must proceed from the overall situation of the work of the whole party and the whole nation to understand this issue. Ren Jianxin emphasized that while continuing to do a good job in harshly dealing with serious crimes, waging a thoroughgoing struggle to strike severe blows at serious economic crimes, and making greater, more comprehensive efforts to improve public order in large- and medium-sized cities, it is necessary to launch a unified and concentrated struggle to improve social order in rural areas. He demanded: The party committees and governments at all levels should attach great importance to improving the social order in rural areas through comprehensive measures. All central departments concerned and all quarters concerned should take an active part in the struggle, vigorously support it, truly place the work on daily agenda, and concentrate strength on doing it well. Great efforts should be made to implement the system of leaders assuming full responsibility for improving public order through comprehensive measures, promote the implementation of the measures, safeguard social stability, and create a good social environment for reform, opening up, and economic development. Ren Jianxin pointed out: This year is very crucial to the deepening of reform. In light of the characteristics of this year's situation, the party Central Committee has put forward the main points of the work of the whole party and the whole country. It has particularly emphasized the great importance of understanding correctly and handling well the relationship among reform, development, and stability. He called on the leading cadres of party and government organizations at various levels to immerse themselves among the masses at grass-roots units, understand the masses' demands, and proceed from improving the people's living standards and solving practical problems -- the problems about which the people are concerned -- to resolve social contradictions. It is reported that the CCCMPS, after serious study, has decided to take effective, comprehensive measures and make great efforts to improve social order in rural areas. According to today's meeting, the improvement of social order in rural areas needs the following efforts: 1) it is necessary to combat crimes with greater force, ensure the implementation of various measures at grass-roots units to impose severe punishment on serious criminals following swift trials according to law, and deal harsh blows against those who commit serious crimes in rural areas; 2) people who commit minor crimes in disrupting public order should have their bad behavior corrected by listening to lectures on the legal system; 3) it is necessary to rectify any paralyzed or semi- paralyzed village party branches, villagers' committees, and mass preventive organizations, strengthen the force for improving public security through comprehensive measures in townships and towns, implement the system of leaders assuming full responsibility for maintaining law and order, truly "have someone in charge of the work of maintaining law and order," and ensure peace and stability in the area; and 4) it is necessary to manage villages according to law and correct the unhealthy social climate of "bad people always getting away with bullying good people." We must strive to improve remarkably the social order in rural areas within a fairly short period of time.
