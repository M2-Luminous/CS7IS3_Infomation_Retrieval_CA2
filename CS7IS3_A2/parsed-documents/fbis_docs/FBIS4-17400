In an interview with INTERFAX Friday [22 April] he said that the need to take such a step is conditioned by the fact that the Euro-Asian space of the former Soviet Union is now subject to dangerous bargaining in the West and this, he said, violates the fragile balance of forces and is fraught with global cataclysms. Too many people in Russia and the world are not interested in the stabilization of the Euro-Asian space of the former Soviet Union and Russia, as well as in the restoration and strengthening of its might, said Dudayev. "After a thorough analysis of the situation I came to the conclusion that the restoration of the CIS defensive power and Russia's status as a great power is the only way out of the imbalance of forces taking shape in the world, said Dzhokhar Dudayev.
