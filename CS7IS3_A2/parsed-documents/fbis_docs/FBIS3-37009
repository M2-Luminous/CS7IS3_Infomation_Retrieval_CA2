Yuriy Dubinin, head of the Russian delegation to negotiations with Ukraine, told Interfax: "It is still difficult to make out what kind of decision on the START-I treaty the Supreme Soviet of Ukraine took on February 4, 1994, and why it preferred not to immediately join the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons." On Monday, Dubinin said in an interview with Interfax that there were several moot points in the Ukrainian legislature's resolution ratifying START-I. It is unclear, for example, what proportion of the nuclear weapons stationed in Ukraine are to be destroyed. "There hasn't been any more clarity since Monday," Dubinin said. He said Russian-Ukrainian talks which took place in Kiev and ended on Thursday had been held "in a good atmosphere and produced positive results." In particular, agreement was reached on a package of documents to provide for measures to implement the Moscow January 14 accord between the presidents of Russia, the United States and Ukraine, under which America is to provide funds for the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine and their dismantling, while Ukraine is to receive compensation. Dubinin declined to go into details about the results of the Kiev negotiations, which, he said, had to be reported to President Boris Yeltsin before being made public. "We hope the drafts will be approved by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk and will help to find a final solution to the problem of the nuclear weapons stationed on Ukrainian territory," he said. The Ukrainian delegation to the Kiev talks included Deputy Premier Valeriy Shmarov and Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk.
