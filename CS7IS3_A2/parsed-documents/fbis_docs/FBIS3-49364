Discussing the forthcoming Prague meeting, Jeszenszky said the main aim of the talks is for the new American Administration to be familiarized with the views of Central Europe, and for Washington to acknowledge that the road to Moscow leads through Central Europe. The Prague talks should, according to the foreign minister, also focus on the steps that could best promote the survival, or intensification of the favorable, democratic processes in Russia. As regards the expansion of NATO, Jeszenszky again stressed that opening the organization towards the East would not strengthen the conservative forces in Russia. "In my view, the contrary of this is true: Expanding NATO is a Russian interest as well," he said. Jeszenszky said he does not agree with the position whereby the American "Partnership for Peace" proposal conceals the intention of delivering Central-Eastern Europe into the hands of the Russians. "I consider the existence of such a Western intention to be completely out of the question, nor do I believe that the American proposal, or any other Western policy, would result in this," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said.
