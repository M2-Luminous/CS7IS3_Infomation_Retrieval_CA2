FR940524-0-00045 FR940524-0-00011 This amendment also requires that by June 23, 1994, each operator submit to the FAA (AFS&hyph;200) a list of its Stage 2 airplanes that will be covered by this rule change, and evidence (i.e., a binding contract) that the operator has ordered sufficient flight data recorder equipment to meet the May 26, 1995, DFDR compliance date, either by aircraft retirement or planned retrofit. As detailed in the disposition of comments section above, this provision is designed to ensure that operators take full advantage of the time provided by the extension. This amendment is considered as providing significant economic relief to the industry and is consistent with recent recommendations from the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry (Commission), a Presidential task force formed in April 1993 to make policy recommendations about the financial health and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and aerospace industries. In light of the Commission's recommendations and the information submitted, the FAA has determined that a persuasive case has been made concerning the changing conditions and difficulties that operators have encountered in attempting to meet the May 26, 1994, DFDR compliance date for Stage 2 airplanes subject to the noise transition rule. The FAA does not anticipate any significant impact on safety from the adoption of this amendment. As detailed in the NPRM, flight data recorders, regardless of the number of operational parameters they record, have no direct effect on the safe operation of an airplane. The importance of flight data recorders lies in their ability to reveal the status and operational parameters of an airplane after it is involved in an accident or other incident. Depending on what is revealed, such data can be used as the basis for altering the operation of physical characteristics of similar airplanes. Thus, for the amendment to have a negative impact, one of the airplanes covered by it would have to be involved in an accident in the additional 1 year, and information essential to the determination of cause must be a part of one of the five additional parameters recorded on the upgraded DFDR but not on the currently required six-parameter flight data recorders. The FAA has concluded that the chance of these particular circumstances occurring is remote. Further, the FAA has sought to limit this possibility by extending the compliance date only for Stage 2 airplanes, some of which are expected to leave the fleet by December 31, 1994, under the noise transition regulations. By requiring all other airplanes to comply with the DFDR rule as promulgated in 1987, the FAA seeks to maximize the benefit of DFDR installation. The FAA stresses that all airplanes covered under the extension must still be equipped with one or more approved flight data recorders that record those parameters specified in part 121. It is only the upgrade to 11-parameter DFDR's that is extended for a limited number of airplanes. The FAA also stresses that the relief will have no effect on compliance with the Stage 3 transition. The extension is not available for Stage 2 airplanes not subject to the Stage 3 transition rule, i.e., Stage 2 airplanes that weigh less than 75,000 pounds. The FAA stresses that carriers should not consider the extension as a period of deferred retrofit action. The FAA does not anticipate granting any further relief from the DFDR requirements for any airplanes beyond that given here. The DFDR rule was promulgated in 1987 and should have been incorporated into fleet planning by part 121 operators. The FAA acknowledges that circumstances such as the Stage 3 transition rules require some reconsideration of rule impacts, and in light of the reported difficulties in obtaining the necessary equipment and support to comply with the DFDR rule, this extension is an example of the kind of relief that the FAA considers to be justified. To date, no other substantial, quantifiable data has been presented to support further delay in compliance with the DFDR regulation. Paperwork Reduction Act Information collection requirements in the amendment to ยง121.343 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ) and have been assigned OMB Control No. 2120&hyph;0581.
