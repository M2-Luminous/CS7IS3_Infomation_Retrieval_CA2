The consensus is apparently so widespread that even a supporter of the present right-of-center coalition, PESTI HIRLAP, in a 14 April commentary by Ferenc Sinkovics, admitted that "every day it becomes unequivocally clearer: The MSZP will win the election." Most of Sinkovics's commentary was devoted to predicting the problems an MSZP government would face. Noting that the communist system collapsed irrevocably and cannot be reinstated, especially since there is no longer any "Big Brother" behind it, Sinkovics asserted that the MSZP will be "forced to accept building a market economy" and will lose support when it becomes clear that it is no more successful than the present government in lowering prices--which, to Hungarian voters, "is more important than any principle or ideology." Noting that Hungary may follow the example of Poland, where society became "disappointed and impatient" with the leftist government "in a few months" when it failed to improve the economy, Sinkovics noted that "we cannot be sure that the socialist government will last" until the next scheduled election in 1998. Although more ambiguous than the PESTI HIRLAP piece, an editorial commentary by Istvan Csurka--who was expelled last fall for his far right views from the more centrist Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the leading party of the present government--also indicated that the MSZP is likely to win the election. In an editorial published on 21 April in his weekly MAGYAR FORUM, Csurka chastized the MDF for its "arrogant refusal" to accept the proposal of his party, the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP), that they and the other "national" parties--the Christian Democratic People's Party and the Independent Smallholders Party--form a coalition against the left. Unless the moderate right and far right agree to cooperate, Csurka asserted, the MSZP will be in a position to "choose its own coalition," most likely forming a government with the main liberal party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ). The only outcome that would be "even worse" than an MSZP-SZDSZ government would be a coalition of the MDF, the Christian Democrats, the Smallholders and the liberals, in which the "national forces" would be a mere "meaningless decoration," Csurka wrote. The MIEP would not join such a coalition under any circumstances, Csurka declared. Arguing that the election must not be allowed to become a "duel" between the right and left, Ferenc Pallagi in the 14 April issue of the trade union daily NEPSZAVA urged liberals to unite and present a viable alternative both to the present right-of-center government and to the socialists, "whose popularity has grown incredibly in recent months." If the two main liberal parties -- SZDSZ and the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz) -- do not cooperate more effectively, Pallagi said, the "liberal center" will "disappear," leaving only the left and right. Of these, the left has the "bigger possibility" of winning, for there is "little chance" that voters will support the parties of the present government, of which the public is "visibly more afraid," Pallagi argued, "than of the reddest left." Thus, he suggested, unless the liberals regain momentum, the left will get a commanding lead in the election. "And, having won by too much, the Socialist Party will have a hard time trying to form a government," Pallagi said, because no prospective coalition partner will want to lend its "name and political prestige" to a government that "it will hardly be able to influence." It is possible, however, that the left's victory will be so great that it will be able to govern alone, "without any control"--a prospect, according to Pallagi, that may be "just as repellent" as the "right-wing rule" of the present government.
