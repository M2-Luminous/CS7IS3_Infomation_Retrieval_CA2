In a speech to the Bankers Club annual banquet in London's Guildhall, Mr George backed up this optimistic view with the observation that UK underlying inflation was lower than for a generation. But the governor couched his remarks in such a way as to quash any idea that he might argue for a cut in bank base rates from their current 5.5 percent level when he meets Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, for their monthly monetary meeting later today. Instead of discussing the short-term outlook, Mr George spoke of the need to make "sustained, non-inflationary growth a reality over the years ahead." He recalled that the government had the "declared longer-term aim of price stability" and, with the bank, was "making solid progress towards that goal." However, the desired outcome of stable prices, rising output and falling unemployment was "not assured," he said. Mr George said price stability was necessary for avoiding the exaggerated boom and bust cycles that had caused repeated social and economic damage since the second world war. On independence for the bank, he criticised those MPs who last Friday voted against a private member's bill to give it more autonomy on the grounds that the government must retain direct control over short-term interest rates. This stance was hard to understand, given proposals to make the bank more accountable to parliament. On the other hand, he would not wish for independence without a broad consensus in favour of price stability. That would be "a poisoned chalice that I would be reluctant to take up even if it were offered," Mr George said.
