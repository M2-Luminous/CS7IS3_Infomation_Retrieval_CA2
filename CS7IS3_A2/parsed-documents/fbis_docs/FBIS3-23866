"YeES Rossii" includes about 70 regional power systems and about 600 thermal and 100 hydroelectric stations with a total capacity of 210 million kilowatts, as well as electrical transmission lines approximately 2.5 million kilometers in length, and planning and scientific research institutes. Moreover, RAO "YeEs Rossii" has at its disposal large blocks of stock from the power construction industry and power machine building. In 1992 electrical power output by enterprises that now belong to RAO "YeES Rossii" comprised about 1 trillion kilowatts per hour, and thermal energy -- about 790 million gigacalories. Approximately 2 percent of electrical power was earmarked for export. The Russian Joint-Stock Company for Power and Electrification (RAO "YeES Rossii"), the stock of which will be offered at check auction, will be the largest Russian enterprise. Already this winter the shares of the joint-stock society with its 70 billion in authorized capital will be offered at auction for vouchers. The auction rules were explained yesterday to reporters at a press conference organized by RAO "YeES Rossii." RAO "YeES Rossii," organized approximately one year ago in accordance with an edict by the president of Russia within a complex of measures to denationalize the power system, is a unique joint-stock society. RAO "YeES Rossii" fixed capital includes the largest electric stations in the country as well as the entire network of communications that secures the transmission of electrical energy. RAO "YeES Rossii" claims authorized capital of almost 70 billion rubles and at the present time 87 percent has already been organized (contributions from the government and from regional energy systems). The par value of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock has been established at 500 rubles. At the press conference held yesterday by Anatoliy Baranovskiy, vice president of RAO "YeES Rossii," the presidential edict on creating this AO [joint-stock company] with the controlling participation of the government was assessed as a logical step directed at achieving the unity and security of Russia's energy system. In accordance with the general ideology of reforming Russia's energy system and within the framework of creating a single technological and economic space, RAO "YeES Rossii" intends to institute cooperation among its daughter companies, which will be organized as regional energy complexes. Regional and federal analytic commissions, which will establish local rates for services by the power network and for the transmission of electrical power, will be created to regulate the operations of these daughter companies. At the check auction for RAO "YeES Rossii" stock, which in all likelihood will take place already this winter, 20 percent of the total AO stock will be put on the market (at a value of slightly less than 14 billion rubles). There are no plans for the participation of foreign investors at this stage. KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that one of the most active participants in the auction will be the labor collectives of enterprises that make up RAO "YeES Rossii" (total number of employees comprises about 1 million people). It should be noted that even before the carrying out of the check auction, RAO "YeES Rossii" decided to concern itself with the secondary market infrastructure for its stock. Thus, at the present time the AO administration is examining the question of concluding depository contracts (Germes-Invest and Menatep are competing to be "YeES Rossii" depositories). Moreover, as announced at yesterday's press conference, an official dealer has already been selected -- the Russian brokerage house, "C. A. and Co." It will be involved in maintaining the liquidity of the secondary market of RAO "YeES Rossii" stock.
