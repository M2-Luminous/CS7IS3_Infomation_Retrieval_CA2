R."-signed report: "VOMO Director Andrej Lovsin Resigns"] [Text] Ljubljana 6 January -- Andrej Lovsin today stopped working as the director of the Security Organ of the Defense Ministry [VOMO]. At his own request, the government at today's session relieved him of his duty as undersecretary in the Defense Ministry, a statement by the Defense Ministry says. Lovsin started his military career in the former Yugoslavia as an officer of the Yugoslav Peoples' Army. Upon his release from the Yugoslav Peoples' Army in 1985 he took up employment in the Slovene Secretariat for Internal Affairs, and after independence in June 1991, took up the post of the chief of the military intelligence service. Under his leadership the service rather successfully dodged parliamentary supervision, while Lovsin himself was involved in the controversial kidnapping of two Greek arms merchants in Austria. The failure and disclosure of this action gave rise to hints about VOMO's encroachment upon the authorities of the civilian intelligence service and its appetites for control over the civilian sphere, which led to the affair of VIS [Security-Information Service] versus VOMO. On that occasion, Lovsin offered his resignation from the post of the chief of the military intelligence service for the first time, however, Defense Minister Janez Jansa did not accept it. Lately, Lovsin's name again rocked the public in connection with the B.P. case, that is to say, the affair involving the Adit and Safti [companies].
