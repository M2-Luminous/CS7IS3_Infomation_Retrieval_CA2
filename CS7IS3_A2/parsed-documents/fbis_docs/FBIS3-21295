On behalf of detained Islamic Action leaders, he issued an appeal today to youths of the Islamic Groups [al-jama'at al-islamiyah] urging them to make the month of Ramadan a starting point for discarding violence and aggression and for opening a constructive dialogue because it is the course accepted by wise people, because there is an atmosphere of freedom, justice, and security, and because the side that is afraid of dialogue has a weak argument. Concluding his appeal to the Islamic Groups youths, Shaykh al-Hallawi said: Fear God, abandon this sedition, and listen to the counsel of the trustworthy scholars.
