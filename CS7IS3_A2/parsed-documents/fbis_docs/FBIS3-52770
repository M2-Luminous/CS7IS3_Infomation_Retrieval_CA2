The public is feeling gradually disillusioned by the promises of the militants who have hitherto been extorting money on one pretext or the other. They can no more organize public demonstrations at will. The people who are developing faith in the Indian security forces, much against Pakistan propaganda, are walking away from the Pakistan-trained extremists. The rising criminality in militant ranks and intergroup clashes are leading to frequent shooting, extortion, and kidnapping and harassment of women. The militants' guns are becoming a new symbol of power as well as access to easy money. Again, like in Punjab, the militants are resorting to recruit the youth at gunpoint. Pakistan is also now suspicious of the Kashmir militants. The lack of faith in their capacity has resulted in greater infiltration of Afghan and other militants by ISI [Interservice Intelligence] to provide, what Pakistan says, leadership to Kashmiri militants. With most Kashmiri pundits [Brahmans] having fled the valley, militants, especially foreign mercenaries, have turned to making the local Muslims as their target whether on the suspicion of being police informers, settling personal scores, or simple criminalization. More than 1,700 Kashmiri Muslims have been killed since 1990 as against about 350 Hindus. Militants set on fire about 4,000 private houses, over 1,300 schools and government buildings, and have abducted over 1,100 persons. There has been alarming increase in abduction and extortion as the people of Kashmir refuse to shelter the extremists now. More significantly, public response to bundh [strike] calls by militants has been on the decline, especially after the successful Hazratbal [shrine] surrender with all their arms and foreign mercenaries. The cleansing operations in Sopor, Baramula, and Anantnag -- all erstwhile strongholds of the militants -- are now comparatively calm as the security forces have maintained the pressure on extremists and have isolated them from the general public. Headlong confrontation, which has been minimal, has been confined to hard-core Kashmir militants and foreign mercenaries, especially Afghans battle-hardened in the wars against the Russian forces. This has led to increased and indirect involvement of ISI of Pakistan. The Interservice Intelligence of Pakistan is sending highly trained Pakistani and Arab terrorists into Indian territory in a desperate bid to establish a countrywide network and support system of subversion and terrorism. A report of the U.S. House Republican Research Committee says that ISI has developed a professional infiltration route for their operations via Nepal because of pressure on other areas to chalk out plans for carrying out disturbances and sabotage in the Indian territory. The report adds that highly trained terrorists of Jamaat-i-Tulaba with the active support of organizations, such as the Indian Student Islamic Movement, are carrying their activities in Indian soil. The leadership has been taken away from the hands of Kashmiri Muslims, especially JKLF [Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]. Now, there is a direct Pakistan force operating in Kashmir. Pakistan schemed to internationalize the issue and is leaving no stone unturned. The Indo-Pak talks were bound to end in fruitless exercise as was clear from the statements of Pakistan political and military leadership. The statement of Ms. Benazir Bhutto that no talks can move forward unless India concedes that Kashmir has a right to secede only goes to show that she is quite incapable of being reasonable about Kashmir and remaining as a prime minister. She is not prepared to give the same right to Sindhis or northwest frontier area of Pakistan that has all along been seeking the right to secede. The whole world knows that Bangladesh had to pay a very heavy price to the invading Pakistan forces. The failure of Pakistan forces to get Kashmir by proxy war has led to new offensive to seek international mediation. Pakistan was never sincere in holding any talk to improve bilateral relations, much less solve the Kashmir problem. It has no love for Kashmiri Muslims. It only wants to annex Kashmir by whatever means. The leadership in Pakistan knows that it cannot take Kashmir by force, hence it is seeking international support, especially of ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] countries, thinking that in the name of religion, Muslim world would come to Pakistan aid. It reflects a poor understanding of new world order by Pakistani leadership.
