On the basis of the fact that this fascist act is a result of the state's oppressive policies against the AD as the most determined and credible opposition group, seeing here a dangerous escalation of the mthods of political struggle used by the ruling party, and convinced that the Albanian nation has chosen the path of tolerance and dialogue in building democracy, the AD accuses: 1. the ruling PD of organizing systematic verbal and physical violence against the AD, illegally making use of the institutions of the Albanian state; -- the parliament of limiting political and other freedoms in Albania by not recognizing the AD parliamentary group and by approving antidemocratic laws; -- Radio-Television, which is used as an instrument of verbal violence against the AD, of not giving the AD a single opportunity to speak for itself; -- the National Intelligence Service of placing under surveillance and attempting to frame AD leaders; -- the police of being under orders to tear down AD propaganda posters. The PD's orders are to persecute and dismiss from their jobs AD members and sympathizers and to paralyze its normal politics activity, impeding it by means of hooliganism. 2. The AD accuses PD Deputy Chairman Ali Spahiu of being the direct organizer of the group of hooligans and criminals that intervened illegally, disrupted the AD meeting in Shkoder, and finally carried out the murder of Gjovalin Cekini. 3. The AD accuses Sali Berisha, president of the republic, by approving similar activities by the same group at the time of the Socialist Party leader's visit to the same city a few months ago, of encouraging the deeds of these criminals who commuted this murder with his name in their mouths. 4. The AD accuses Prime Minister Meksi and his government, by putting the state authorities under the PD and the influence of criminals, of paralyzing the capacities of the forces of order and the law, thus becoming responsible for a new 2 April in Shkoder. This government, with its illegal privatization, is supporting criminals and thieves to create support for its rule. 5. The AD accuses Albanian Radio-Television and its directors Skender Bucpapaj and Qemal Sakajeva of inspiring a climate of hostility and terror through its attacks and slanders against the AD and its portrayal on the screen of hooligans as heroes in obstructing the political activities of parties. The AD informs the Albanian public that the killing of Gjovalin Cekini is the murder of one of their sons who had struggled for true democracy and human rights since before December 1990. The AD calls on Albanians not to forget this name, not to be scared by hooligans and criminals, and not to retreat a single step on the road on which we embarked in December 1990. The AD calls on its members and supporters throughout Albania to continue on the road of democracy through dialogue and peaceful methods, to keep cool heads, and to avoid all kinds of provocations intended to encourage violent reactions. Dialogue and tolerance are our weapons. The use of guns and terror of any kind will end in failure. In the hope that ideals of December still occupy a place in the minds and hearts of those in power and of ordinary PD members, the AD calls on these people to dissociate themselves from the world of crime and corruption that surrounds them. The AD wishes to draw the attention of the European Community and democratic states to the need to help and support Albania, asking them to call on President Berisha and Prime Minister Meksi to respect democratic standards in Albania.
