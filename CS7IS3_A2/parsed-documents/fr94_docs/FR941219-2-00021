USAMP is a consortium of Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and General Motors Corporation. The proposed cooperative agreement will provide estimated funding in the amount of $1,660,000 by the DOE for a project entitled, ``Automotive Lightweight Materials Program''. The purpose of this effort is to define and conduct pre-competitive, vehicle-related research and development (R&D) in materials and materials processing which will improve the competitiveness of the U.S. automotive industry. USAMP goals are to develop several families of automotive materials that will impact strategic needs of the industry. These funds will be matched equally by USAMP under this cooperative agreement.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The DOE has determined in accordance with 10 CFR 600.14(f), that the unsolicited application for financial assistance submitted by USAMP, is meritorious based on the general evaluation required by 10 CFR 600.14(d) and that the proposed project represents a unique idea, that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation. The applicant is a consortium of the three largest automotive manufacturers in the United States. These competitive companies have come together as several consortia under the United States Council for Automotive Research (USCAR) to work together to jointly advance ``precompetitive'' automotive technologies. The anticipated term of the proposed cooperative agreement is one year from the effective date of the award. This award will not be made for at least 14 days after publication to allow for public comment. Issued in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on December 8, 1994. Peter D.
