His arrival was preceded by direct telephone contacts between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton and between President al-Asad and King Husayn and President al-Hirawi. An agreement was reached to invite the Arab parties concerned with the peace process to hold a meeting soon in order to consider resuming the Washington talks in light of UN Security Council Resolution 904. This resolution strongly denounces the Israeli massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. It calls for international protection for the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and for the concentration of efforts to push the peace process forward. The fact is that Syrian-U.S. contacts have been active since the recent Geneva summit between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton. The U.S. Administration clearly announced that Syria is playing a basic role in making the peace process a success and that Syria exerted major efforts to prevent the collapse of this process after the atrocious Hebron massacre. All members of the international community took the Hebron events and their negative impact on the peace process very seriously. This horrible massacre affirms to the entire world the need to end Israeli occupation of Arab territory and to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based on the Madrid formula and Security Council resolutions. Israeli prevarication for the past 27 months has prevented any real progress. It is no longer acceptable on both the Arab and international levels. It is time for Israel to stop playing with its bargaining chips. Either it demonstrates real involvement in the peace process and a clear commitment to its bases and requirements, or it frankly rejects this process. Real involvement means, first and foremost, a firm pledge to withdraw from the occupied territories in exchange for peace. Rejection will mean pushing the region to the verge of an explosion. It will represent a blatant disregard of all international efforts and of international legitimacy principles and charters. Syria has always shouldered its responsibilities toward peace and has been loyal to UN principles and resolutions. It has worked with all its strength to make the U.S. initiative a success. On several occasions, it effectively contributed to rescuing this initiative from Israel's plots. The meeting between Presidents al-Asad and Clinton in Geneva gave a strong push to the peace process. However, instead of responding to the spirit of Geneva and its results, Israel intentionally cast doubts. The result was the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre that shook the conscience of the world and confirmed the need to move the peace process beyond the impasse caused by Israeli intransigence. Since the start of the U.S. initiative, Syria has made it clear that peace in the region depends on ending Israeli occupation. Peace cannot prevail if it does not provide right and justice and does not end Israel's attacks and its repressive and settlement practices. Syria has repeatedly said peace and occupation cannot coexist. Partial and incomplete solutions that do not end the occupation and remove the settlements will not bring the region any closer to peace. Instead, they will push it away from peace. Indeed, Syria has stressed that such solutions are time bombs. There is no solution except a just and comprehensive solution that restores the territories and rights and realizes a firm and real peace -- the peace of the brave. All events in the Middle East confirm the soundness of the Syrian stand and reinforce the international conviction that Syria's concept of peace is a sound, comprehensive, and integrated concept. The Oslo agreement was not only obstructed, it led directly to the Hebron massacre. Future developments will not be any less negative if Israel does not submit to the will of the international community and complies with the bases of the Madrid conference that stipulate achieving a just and comprehensive peace on all fronts of the conflict based on Security Council resolutions. Syria, along with all the Arabs, are seekers of a real peace. The ball is in Israel's court. Israel must choose between peace and occupation, between security and aggression, between stability and settlement, and between becoming a member of the international community and the law of the jungle and the declaration of a war on human values, principles, and laws.
