Recommended by Melco, Inc. (L7&hyph;187), J.Loften, Asbestos Workers Local Union # 16 (Ex. 137). 8. Specific training for maintenance and custodial workers in buildings that contain asbestos-containing material. Recommended by SEIU. (Ex. 144 at 14). 9. Requirement that building owner respond to knowledge of asbestos in building by establishing O&M plan. Recommended by SEIU (Ex. 144 at 17); AFSCME, (Ex. 141). 10. Change in medical surveillance requirements for maintenance and custodial workers in ACM buildings_they exceed the 30 day limit. Recommended by AFSCME, (Ex. 141). 11. Reduce action level to 0.05 f/cc. Recommended by BCTD. (Ex. 143). 12. Reduce STEL to 0.5 f/cc over 30 minutes. Recommended by BCTD. (Ex. 143), also by SESAC and NIOSH (Ex. 7&hyph;77, 125). 13. Require most effective respirators feasible in all asbestos work. Recommended by BCTD. (Ex. 143). 14. Require more specific and protective brake repair procedures. Recommended by Clayton Associates, Inc. (Ex. 148). 15. Regulate activities involving ``friable'' asbestos-containing material differently from those involving ``non-friable'' asbestos. Recommended by Edison Electric Institute, (Ex. 7&hyph;145 , at e.g., 8 for quantity cut-offs for SSSD activities.) 16. A clearance fiber level of 0.04 f/cc was recommended by SESAC who stated that such a requirement was needed to ``ensure that the asbestos work area is safe to enter by unprotected personnel after the asbestos work operation is completed.'' (Ex. 7&hyph;77). Relationship to Indoor Air Quality Proposed Rule On April 5, 1994 at 59 FR 15968, OSHA proposed a new standard for indoor air quality. The proposed regulation included a clause making brief reference to asbestos. See Paragraph (d)(8) at page 16036. That reference was unintended as OSHA, intends to cover all asbestos issues in the final asbestos rule where full consideration has been given to them. OSHA will not create new requirements in a final Indoor Air Quality Standard that are specifically designed to control asbestos exposures, and will announce that it is withdrawing the asbestos clause in paragraph (d)(8) at the commencement of the indoor air hearing. Accordingly there is no need for parties to submit asbestos-related materials into the Indoor Air record. III. Summary and Explanation of Revised Standards These final standards constitute OSHA's response to the remaining issues raised for the Agency's reconsideration by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The specific issues raised by the Court are: the establishment of operation-specific permissible exposure limits; the extension of reporting and information transfer requirements; the expansion of the competent person requirement to all employers engaged in any kind of construction work; and, the clarification of the small scale, short duration operation exemption from the requirement to establish a negative-pressure enclosure. For convenience OSHA is summarizing here its response to each of these issues. They are discussed in depth below. Also discussed below are the other changes OSHA has made which are not in direct response to the remand. Issue 7. Establishment of Operation Specific Exposure Limits: The court remand causes OSHA to consider establishing operation-specific permissible exposure limits to the extent feasible, as needed to eliminate significant risk of illnesses caused by asbestos exposure. OSHA proposed to decrease the PEL to a uniform 0.1 f/cc. OSHA believes that this limit is feasible for most industry sectors to reach most of the time (55 FR 29720). However, OSHA explained that PELs lower than 0.1 f/cc are difficult to reliably measure. However OSHA has followed a more effective approach to lowering exposures for those sections and operations where lower exposures can be achieved. This approach is triggering protective provisions based on the kind of operation undertaken, rather than measured exposure levels. This approach is consistent with some other health standards (e.g., lead, coke ovens).
