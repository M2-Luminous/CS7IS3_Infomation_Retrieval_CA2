FBIS4-4683 "dreas065__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-065-A Daily Report 28 Mar 1994 ANNEX Japan JNP Intraparty Strife, Future Examined JNP Intraparty Strife, Future Examined OW0504014094 Tokyo AERA in Japanese 28 Mar 94 pp 16-17--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0504014094 Tokyo AERA Japanese BFN [Article by AERA editorial staffer Keiko Ito: "Popular Support Has Declined, and the JNP Is Bewildered"] [Text] Recently, the office of Akio Nakajima, a Japan New Party [JNP] Diet member, has been receiving faxes and telephone calls one after another from his supporters in protesting: "I have doubts about [the planned formation of] a joint parliamentary group with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. (In light of the JNP's philosophy) should not the JNP draw a line between themselves and the former Tanaka faction?" "Are you going to take down the banner you raised during the election campaign?" There have been nearly 10 [figure as published] calls so far. Two months have passed since the relationship between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who heads the JNP, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who heads Sakigake [Harbinger], started to crack. Hosokawa has gradually started to tilt toward Ichiro Ozawa's Shinseito, and some media reported that "the JNP and Shinseito will form a joint parliamentary group." [The protests] were sent immediately after this. "We never abandoned our slogan of clean [politics]," Nakajima explained earnestly at a meeting of his supporters. After graduating from the Chinese Department at the Osaka University of Foreign Studies and the Ethics Department at the University of Tokyo, he worked at the Ministry of Education for 27 years. Since his retirement, he had worked at a private education firm until the JNP asked him to be "a candidate." At the age of 57, he started his political career [as a Diet member] from the Kanagawa No. 3 lower house district. "Frankly, I was elected because there was a `wind [blowing for the JNP].' Dirtying our `clean' image is most problematic," Nakajima says. According to him, [the JNP and] Sakigake, the JNP's parliamentary group partner, are holding special committee meetings and staff meetings together every day, and all of their members get along well. "The images of [the JNP and Sakigake] are similar, and their members are like-minded. At the same time, it is the power of Shinseito that is firmly supporting the shaky coalition cabinet. Both parties are important partners for us." Plan To Form Joint Parliament Group: A Complete Surprise There are many troubled Diet members such as Nakajima. "The secret of Hosokawa's popularity lies in the way he handles both Mr. Takemura and Mr. Ozawa skillfully. Favoring one runs counter to why the people support him" (says Diet member Fumihiko Igarashi). "If we had married Sakigake then [referring to the planned merger between the JNP and Sakigake last year], we would be able to talk frankly with Shinseito now" (says a young JNP member). The talk of forming a joint parliamentary union was "a complete surprise" to most JNP Diet members (says JNP Secretary General Masuo Matsuoka). According to Matsuoka, the misfortune of the JNP and Hosokawa is the fact that "the leader of the small `Hosokawa' party suddenly rose to be prime minister." Since he assumed the post of prime minister in August, Hosokawa has been away from his party headquarters in Takanawa, Tokyo, for approximately seven months. During that time, he was extremely busy with his duties as prime minister and was not involved at all with party affairs. [The frequency of] visits made by [JNP] party officials to the Prime Minister's Official Residence to brief [Hosokawa on party affairs] was every several days. Matsuoka says that this stood in contrast to the fact that members of Sakigake came to see Takemura, who is also at the prime minister's official residence, so often that members of the other parties would ask ironically, "Is this Sakigake's office?" Hosokawa told JNP members, "I want to make a sharp distinction between the job of prime minister and party affairs. Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka used to do so." And JNP members were said to be refraining from visiting Hosokawa because they thought, "It is not desirable for his `relatives' [members of his own party] to always be hanging around the prime minister." "The owner," who had been managing all affairs, was absent for seven months. As a result, as a young JNP member described, "No `employee' knows what his `employer' is thinking." Often, there were discrepancies in opinions and feelings regarding a change of personnel and party rules between young JNP Diet members, who were elected last summer, and the staff of the secretariat, who have been supporting Hosokawa since his days as governor [of Kumamoto Prefecture] and as a an upper house member. "It is Diet members who develop a party!" "A party has a history of its own!" They shouted at each other, and this was reported as a "split in the JNP," or "internal strife." After all, an agreement could not be reached within the party on the personnel changes for the new leadership for the JNP to begin in earnest as a party, and the matter was left to the leader's discretion. Hosokawa reportedly told Nakajima, who visited the Prime Minister's Official Residence at the beginning of March, "The party and I seem to have drifted apart. I think I should visit the party at least once a week from now on." Approval Rate Down From 17 Percent to 12 Percent According to an opinion poll conducted by ASAHI SHIMBUN at the end of February, the support rate for the JNP declined from 17 percent, at the time of a poll in November, to 14 percent in December, and then to 12 percent. The JNP had difficult campaigns in which four of its eight official candidates were defeated in municipal assembly elections in Hino and Machida in Tokyo in late February. The party has about 30,000 members. Ryozo Nagata, executive director of the JNP, said "due to the controversy over the national welfare tax, party membership has not increased since January." The decline in the JNP's popularity is evident to everybody. Soon after he was inaugurated as prime minister Hosokawa repeatedly told JNP Diet members: "Your greatest task is to be returned once again at the next election. Please devote all your energy to strengthening your home territory." One Diet member commented: "We do not have networks of local supporters or national reputations, very must understand that we would have not been elected if we had not caught hold of the coattails of Mr. Hosokawa." To Study Policies or To Visit Local Districts The JNP has 42 Diet members, 20 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, and more than 10 members in prefectural and municipal assemblies. The average age of JNP lower house members is only 42. Takashi Kawamura, a JNP Diet member, plans soon to launch the "Raison d'Etre Study Group" and he is urging every JNP Diet member to join. The purpose of the group is to study the future course of the JNP in the coalition government. In the 10 years since he started his career in politics, Kawamura has belonged to the Democratic Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party, and he has been defeated twice. In the JNP, which has been ridiculed as "a group of amateurs," he is a senior member. He thinks the JNP, which has been helped by the mood of the country to make progress, needs financial backing and a network of local supporters to become a real political party. Visiting his local district, Kawamura takes bus trips or goes to the theater with his supporters. Young JNP Diet members criticize that as being "LDP-like." Kawamura tells them to, "visit your local districts more," but the young members believe "the duty of a politician is to study policies." "Standing at the bow of a small ship sailing into a troubled sea, I would like to sail out flying the flag of an idealism that we are in danger of losing," Hosokawa said in a declaration on the party's establishment two years ago. The spirit that led to the formation of the party was a search for political ideals, not money or electoral territory, and that must have been why voters supported the JNP. Now that the wind has died down, JNP Diet members find themselves tossed about by the calls for political realignment, and have only just started to work on finding a way for the JNP to survive.
