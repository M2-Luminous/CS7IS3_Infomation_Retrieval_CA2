The study will be launched later this year and will focus on the impact of urbanization and population growth on consumption of energy, a main source of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases believed to cause global warming, the officials said. Scientists say the change in climate could ultimately turn entire regions into deserts. The team of scientists from the ministry's Institute of Population Problems and Institute of Public Health hope to improve long-term forecasts for greenhouse gas emissions in Asia by examining the causes of population growth and the impact of rural migration to cities, they said. The group will also look at how global warming affects the spread of malaria, they said. The results of the study will be used to draw up population and energy conservation policies that could help reduce the impact of global warming. The Environment Agency will incorporate the findings in its "Eco- Asia 21 Plan" and will try to enlist support from other Asian countries, the officials said. World population is expected to increase to 6.3 billion by the turn of the century from 5.3 billion in 1990. According to United Nations population fund forecasts, it will further swell to 8.5 billion in 2025, with more than half of the growth occurring in Asia, mainly China and India. Rural migration is likely to continue, raising the portion of people living in Asian cities from 30 percent of total population to over 50 percent in 2020. The National Institute for Environmental Studies estimates that Asia's energy consumption will show annual growth rates of 3.2 percent, far outstripping the world average of 1.6 percent.
