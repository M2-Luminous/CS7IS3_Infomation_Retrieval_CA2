By the year 2000, the country's nuclear power plants will have a capacity of 6 million kilowatts while new plants with another 6 million kilowatts in capacity will be under construction. You Deliang, a spokesman of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), said yesterday. China's first nuclear power station, at Qinshan in Zhejiang Province, is now safely and efficiently operating, You added. And, by the end of this year, experts predict it will have generated 1.73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity since it was linked to the national grid in December 1991. Work on Qinshan's second phase, two generators with a capacity of 600,000 kilowatts each, has also begun. Meanwhile, Generator No 1 at the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is expected to go into commercial operation soon, while Generator No 2 will go into commercial operation before next June. Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station, near Shenzhen in Guangdong, is the country's first joint-venture nuclear power plant. Its two generators are designed to generate 10 to 12.6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year, he said. The power will be sold to Guangdong Province and Hong Kong to support their economic development. CNNC President Jiang Xinxiong said the establishment of the two power stations was a milestone for China's nuclear power industry. The Chinese began late in this field and must strive to make advances to fuel the country's economic growth, he said. China's booming economy has also provided a huge market for nuclear energy, Jiang said. Provinces, especially in Southeast China's coastal areas, consider nuclear power an important means to meet their increasing energy demands. Jiang said the corporation had also made big strides in developing nuclear fuel. A production line, introduced from France to produce pressed water reactor (PWR) nuclear fuel has been built and is due to go into production next year. Jiang said CNNC's industrial output in 1993 rose 37.7 percent compared to last year. In addition, CNNC is trying to grab a share of the international market by exporting its nuclear power generators. Pakistan is negotiating with China to import a second 300,000-kilowatt generator now that the first one is being built.
