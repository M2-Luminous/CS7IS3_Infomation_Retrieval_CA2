ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA is proposing to approve Maine's revised ``111(d) plan'' for the control of total reduced sulfur (TRS) emissions from existing kraft pulp mills into Maine's State Implementation Plan (SIP). The revised plan was submitted by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on April 27, 1994. The revised plan consists of a revised regulation entitled ``Chapter 124: Total Reduced Sulfur Control From Kraft Pulp Mills.'' The revised plan satisfies EPA's requirements for adoption and submittal of a plan to control TRS emissions from designated facilities in accordance with section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial revision amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to that direct final rule, no further activity is contemplated in relation to this proposed rule. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this document. Any parties interested in commenting on this document should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received by November 3, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Linda M. Murphy, Director, Air, Pesticides and Toxics Management Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building, Boston, MA 02203.
