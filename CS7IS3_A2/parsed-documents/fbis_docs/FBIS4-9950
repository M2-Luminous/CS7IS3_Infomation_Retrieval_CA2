Ross added that the decision was made on the basis of union dues contributed by the workers and which is their gift to the youngest organization in Cuba on its 33d anniversary, adding that 8 million pesos are already earmarked for that goal this year, thanks to expenditure reductions by the CTC. Ross pointed out that over the past three years, CTC expenditures have been less than 30 million pesos, and that in 1993 they were 28 million as the result of reductions in personnel rosters and other expenditures.
