ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the animal drug regulations to reflect the approval of a supplemental new animal drug application (NADA) filed by Roussel-Uclaf. The supplemental NADA provides for use of halofuginone hydrobromide (Stenorol) in the feed of replacement cage laying chickens and replacement broiler breeder chickens for the prevention of coccidiosis. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Melanie R. Berson, Center For Veterinary Medicine (HFV&hyph;135), Food and Drug Administration, 7500 Standish Pl., Rockville, MD 20855, 301&hyph;594&hyph;1643. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Roussel-Uclaf, Division Agro-Veterinaire, 163 Avenue Gambetta, 75020, Paris, France, is the sponsor of NADA 130&hyph;951, represented by Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., P.O. Box 2500, Rt. 202&hyph;206, Somerville, NJ 08876&hyph;1258. The NADA provides for use of halofuginone hydrobromide (Stenorol) Type A medicated article to make Type C medicated broiler feed used for the prevention of coccidiosis. The sponsor filed a supplemental application which provides for the use of 2.72 grams per ton (3 parts per million) halofuginone hydrobromide for replacement cage layers and replacement broiler breeders for the prevention of coccidiosis. The supplemental NADA is approved as of October 12, 1994 and the regulations are amended in 21 CFR 558.265(c) to reflect the approval. The basis for approval is discussed in the freedom of information summary. This approval is for use of a Type A medicated article to make a Type C medicated feed. Halofuginone hydrobromide is a Category II drug that, as provided in 21 CFR 558.4, requires an approved form FDA 1900 for making a Type C medicated feed. Therefore, use of a halofuginone hydrobromide Type A article to make a Type C medicated feed as in NADA 130&hyph;951, as supplemented, requires an approved form FDA 1900. In accordance with the freedom of information provisions of part 20 (21 CFR part 20) and ยง514.11(e)(2)(ii) (21 CFR 514.11(e)(2)(ii)), a summary of safety and effectiveness data and information submitted to support approval of this application may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (HFA&hyph;305), Food and Drug Administration, rm. 1&hyph;23, 12420 Parklawn Dr., Rockville, MD 20857, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. Under section 512(c)(2)(F)(iii) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360b(c)(2)(F)(iii)), the approval of this supplemental application qualifies for 3 years of marketing exclusivity beginning October 12, 1994 because the supplemental application contains reports of new clinical or field investigations (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) or human food safety studies (other than bioequivalence or residue studies) essential to the approval of the supplemental application and conducted or sponsored by the applicant. The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.
