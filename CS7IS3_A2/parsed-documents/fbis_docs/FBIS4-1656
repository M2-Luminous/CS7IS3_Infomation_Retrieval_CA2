Today, we would like to discuss VAT issues. VAT yields the largest tax revenue of all the taxes since we carried out reform of the enterprise tax system. It accounts for about 40 percent of total tax revenues from enterprises, or more than 60 percent of total tax revenue from all industrial and commercial undertakings. Enterprises, therefore, are very interested in any reform of this tax. Chen Jie, deputy director of the State General Administration of Taxation's Circulation Tax Department, will you please tell us the differences between the old and the new VAT? [Chen] There are many differences between the old and the new VAT. The major ones are: First, the old VAT only applied to certain industrial end-products. We only levied product tax and VAT, with each accounting for about 50 percent of total industrial tax revenue. We did not previously charge VAT on wholesaling and retailing processes. They were only subject to business tax. Under the new VAT system, however, we have imposed VAT on all processes, including production, wholesaling, and retailing. This is the first variation. Second, we have considerably reduced and thoroughly assessed tax rates. In the past we had more than 30 different rates for product tax and VAT. The figure was even higher if you include rates for wholesaling and retailing processes too. Under the new VAT system, we have only two rates, a basic rate of 17 percent and a low rate of 13 percent. Third, we have changed the taxable bases or foundations on which we levy taxes. Previously, we included taxes such as product tax, VAT, and business tax in the sale price. Under the new VAT system, we have listed taxes on all the processes, including production, wholesaling, and retailing, separately from the sale price. Fourth, we have implemented a system of tax refunds according to invoices. In other words, when selling commodities, enterprises should issue to buyers a special VAT invoice, listing the sales price exclusive of tax, and VAT. When applying for tax refunds after making the purchase, buyers can only quote the tax payments listed on the invoices. Previously, we did not use invoices when handling VAT refunds: The value of a tax refund is equal to an enterprise's purchase price of commodities or procurement cost multiplied by the deductible tax rate. Fifth, we have made remarkable improvements in tax reduction or exemption: 1. The number of items eligible for tax reduction or exemption has been greatly reduced. 2. Tax reduction or exemption for individual enterprises has been revoked. Previously, an enterprise with difficulties could apply for tax exemption, but that is forbidden under the new tax system. Why have we instituted these five changes? The reasons are as follows: We want to fully incorporate the principle of equitable taxpaying. Under the old tax system, for instance, product tax was levied in accordance with sales revenues and [words indistinct]; it was charged in accordance with various sales prices at every stage without any deduction. Therefore, the more specialized an enterprise's processes were, the heavier tax burden it shouldered. The more generalized an enterprise's processes were, the lighter the tax burden. This was unfair. Another seemingly unfair aspect was that among enterprises producing identical products, some had to pay tax in accordance with regulations, while others qualified for tax reduction or exemption. Such injustice was gravely detrimental to rational competition among enterprises. [passage omitted] With a built-in mechanism to beat tax evasion, the new VAT system will greatly increase tax revenue and be easier to manage. The new tax system requires that, when making a sale, an enterprise must issue an invoice listing the tax paid. When applying for tax refunds after making the purchase, the buyer can only quote the tax payment listed on the invoice. If the vendor evades tax, he cannot list the tax payment on the invoice; consequently, the buyer will not be eligible for a tax refund. The buyer will, therefore, insist that the vendor issue him an invoice listing tax payment.
