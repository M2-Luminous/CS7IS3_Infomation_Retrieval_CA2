Russia inherited the role of cosponsor of the Middle East conference from the disintegrated USSR. It was inherited under conditions where Russia, running up against economic hardships, not possessing the military potential of the former great power, and having received numerous conflicts in the former Soviet republics, was scarcely able to permit itself to follow an active policy in a region which was sinking ever lower on the scale of foreign political priorities. As a result a very strange situation emerged: formally Russia had certain obligations resulting from its status and related to settlement of the conflict, but at the same time it had practically no approaches of its own to the problem. Russian policy was realized within the framework of a kind of "Siamese twins" notion, spoken of by minister of foreign affairs A. Kozyrev in an interview with KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA on 9 April 1994. This merging with the American position (not only in ends, which was justified, but also as to means) undermined the traditional influence of Russia in the Middle East. The willingness to transfer all the worries of a settlement to the United States, which really did have great capabilities, in no way fit with the obvious fact that Russian interests in the Middle East are not identical with American interests, although they can coincide in part. Let me recall in this connection the role of the USSR in the period of the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Soviet diplomacy of that time supported the U.N. Security Council decisions that envisioned stopping aggression, using military force against Iraq (if it did not withdraw its troops), establishment of the embargo, and so on, but still it operated with its own means. The USSR even resorted to a certain worsening of relations with the United States, which unequivocally favored military force, but it kept its image of a power with its own political personality and view of the situation. The merging with American policy deprived Russia of those advantages which it could have drawn from the ideological reorientation. It is well-known that many Arab regimes who viewed the spread of communism as a direct threat to their existence were inclined to development of closer relations with Russia, which had rejected communism as its official ideology. The Middle Eastern scheme of international relations has always been built on balance. The cessation of the "cold war" and removal of the region from the sphere of the Soviet-American standoff, which were received favorably in the Middle East, did not mean that the states located there were ready to accept, in place of the two rival forces, some ugly and unnatural hybrid which would deprive them of the freedom of political maneuver. Notions of undivided U.S. dominance became widespread in the Middle East, replacing the former bipolar structure. Russian participation in settlement of the conflict remained a formality and this made it more difficult to work out the system of its own interests in the Middle East and their relationship with other foreign policy priorities. A pause in determination of national interests was probably inevitable because Russia had entered a role that was new to it as an independent subject of international relations. It could not help preserving a certain genetic link with the former great power, of which it was a fragment. The duality lying in the very history of the appearance of contemporary Russia in the international arena was reflected in all its political behavior. The natural desire to occupy a worthy place in the world was extinguished by fears that it would be accused of a rebirth of imperial ideas inherited from the USSR. Moreover, the internal political ratio of forces (the predominance of advocates of a complete rejection of the old Soviet policy) led to distortions. Unjustified hostility to any U. S. actions was replaced with equally unjustified "Siamese twinning." Succession and new elements of foreign policy were most closely intertwined for Russia in the question of a Middle East settlement. The USSR, whose peace initiatives were by no means always realistic and often were mere words, consistently called for an international conference on the Middle East and for participation by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the peace talks. It took significant changes in the international and regional arenas (the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories, the crisis in the Persian Gulf, and Egypt's intermediary role) to bring these appeals to practical realization. The Madrid process, which began in October 1991, opened the doors to both multilateral and bilateral talks among participants in the conflict. The coming to power of government of the Avoda [translation unknown] socialist party reordered the focuses in Middle East settlement. Emotions gave way to greater pragmatism. In the system of talks Russia was an honorary cochairman, able to approve agreements that were reached but unable to do anything significant to prepare them or put them into effect. The Palestinians and Israel began to conduct their own game, calling on the United States when necessary and seeming to forget about Russia's existence. This was demonstrated in the Oslo meeting in August 1993 where the PLO and Israel agreed to institute autonomy in Gaza and Jericho, and in September 1993 in Washington where they signed the agreement. By itself the agreement, with all its unquestioned importance, could not signify a smooth transition to Palestinian self-government. Bloody tragedies continued and continue to be played out in the occupied territories. The crime in Hebron where an Israeli settler shot praying Palestinians in a mosque put the whole peace process in danger. In this situation Russia has a special responsibility. The Middle East, which for it has become the "far" abroad, still preserves its special strategic, political, and economic significance. After the events in Hebron Russian diplomacy was able, using its ties with the PLO and the current level of relations with Israel, to prevent a breakoff of the talks. V. Posuvalyuk, a special representative of the RF President, was sent to the Middle East, followed by deputy minister of foreign affairs Yu. Ivanov and minister A. Kozyrev himself. Talks between the Palestinians and Israel were renewed in Cairo. The visits of Arafat and Rabin to Moscow will obviously help consolidate what has been achieved and, despite all the difficulties, strengthen mutual understanding. At the same time Russo-Syrian and Russo-Jordanian contacts, an important element in the settlement, have broadened. The talks are continuing in essentially the "Washington format." Russia's activism, including its proposal to call a second Madrid conference, did not arouse enthusiasm in Washington. It is not just a matter of different approaches to settlement. The steps by Russian diplomacy were perceived in Washington, which has already begun to become accustomed to close partnership, as an affirmation of Russia's desire to distance itself from American policy and receive political dividends for its own initiatives. In actuality a normal process is underway. Russia is developing its own diplomatic style in the Middle East, trying to introduce a contribution that fits its national interests into the resolution of this protracted conflict.
