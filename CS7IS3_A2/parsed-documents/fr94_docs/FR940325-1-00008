FR940325-1-00008 FR940325-1-00004 The study area encompasses the existing TSS which was adopted by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (as the International Maritime Organization was formerly known) on October 28, 1969. A change to the southeastern approach lanes was implemented on March 15, 1976. The TSS Off Delaware Bay consists of two parts as described below: Part I: Eastern Approach (a) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○46.8 ’ N 74 ○34.6 ’ W 38 ○46.8 ’ N 74 ○55.7 ’ W 38 ○47.8 ’ N 74 ○55.4 ’ W 38 ○47.8 ’ N 74 ○34.6 ’ W (b) A traffic lane for westbound traffic between the separation zone and a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○49.8 ’ N 74 ○34.6 ’ N 38 ○48.8 ’ N 74 ○55.3 ’ W (c) A traffic lane for eastbound traffic between the separation zone and a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○45.8 ’ N 74 ○56.1 ’ W 38 ○44.8 ’ N 74 ○34.6 ’ W (a) A separation zone bounded by a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○27.0 ’ N 74 ○42.3 ’ W 38 ○42.2 ’ N 74 ○57.2 ’ W 38 ○43.4 ’ N 74 ○58.0 ’ W 38 ○27.6 ’ N 74 ○41.3 ’ W (b) A traffic lane for north-westbound traffic between the separation zone and a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○28.8 ’ N 74 ○39.3 ’ W 38 ○45.1 ’ N 74 ○56.6 ’ W (c) A traffic lane for south-eastbound traffic between the separation zone and a line connecting the following geographical positions: ␣ 1Latitude 1Longitude 38 ○42.8 ’ N 74 ○58.9 ’ W 38 ○27.0 ’ N 74 ○45.4 ’ W Precautionary Area A precautionary area with a radius of eight miles centered upon Harbour of Refuge Light in geographical position 38 ○48.9 ’ N, 754 ○05.6 ’ W. Issues The study may recommend the following options: (a) Make no changes to the current traffic separation system in the Delaware Bay Approaches. (b) Discontinue the entire Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) in the Delaware Bay Approaches. (c) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic zone. (d) Relocate the Southern Approach TSS, and include a deepwater route similar to the deepwater route in the Southern Approach to Chesapeake Bay, i.e., the deepwater route centered between inbound and outbound lanes. (e) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic zone and retain the current Southern Approach TSS with a midstream Deepwater Port on the eastern side of the inbound traffic lane. (f) Adjust the Eastern Approach TSS by narrowing the separation zone to allow the establishment of an inshore traffic zone, and, relocate the Southern Approach TSS to include a deepwater route similar to the deepwater route in the Southern Approach to Chesapeake Bay, i.e., the deepwater route centered between inbound and outbound lanes. (g) Abolish the Eastern Approach TSS and maintain the current Southern Approach TSS. Procedural Requirements In order to provide safe access routes for movement of vessel traffic proceeding to and from U.S. ports, the PWSA directs that the Secretary designate necessary fairways and traffic separation schemes in which the paramount right of navigation over all other uses shall be recognized. Before a designation can be made, the Coast Guard is required to undertake a study of potential traffic density and the need for safe access routes. During the study, the Coast Guard is directed to consult with federal and state agencies and to consider the views of representatives of the maritime community, port and harbor authorities or associations, environmental groups, and other parties who may be affected by the proposed action. In accordance with 33 U.S.C. 1223(c), the Coast Guard will, to the extent practicable, reconcile the need for safe access routes with the needs of all other reasonable uses of the area involved. The Coast Guard will also consider previous studies and experience in the areas of vessel traffic management, navigation, shiphandling, the effects of weather, and prior analysis of the traffic density in certain regions. The results of this study will be published in the Federal Register . If the Coast Guard determines that new routing measures are needed, a notice of proposed rulemaking will be published. It is anticipated that the study will be concluded by 30 October 1994. Dated: March 22, 1994. W.J. Ecker, Rear Admiral, U.S. Coast Guard, Chief, Office of Navigation Safety and Waterway Services.
