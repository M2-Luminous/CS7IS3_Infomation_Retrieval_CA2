Given that [Prime Minister Nicolae] Sangheli and [Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova Chairman Dimitru] Motpan have encouraged the elections in the South, the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova [PDAM] now has to pay some electoral bills. A last week appeal of Comrat [capital of the Gagauz region] to the Chisinau Parliament says that 85.4 percent of the electors in Gagauz regions "have pleaded for the development of the Gaguz Republic as a national-territorial formation within the Republic of Moldova." Comrat hopes that "representatives of the PDAM and of the Block of the Socialist Party and the Unitate-Edinstvo Movement, which has the majority in the new parliament, as well as the 17 March official declarations made by [Moldovan President] Mircea Snegur and Andrei Sangheli will ease the solution of the problem of the self-determination of regions mostly inhabited by the Gagauz." The session of the Gagauz Parliament adopted on 14 March a declaration that opts for the "recognition of the Gagauz Republic as a national-territorial formation as compound of Moldova, and the legalization in the new [Moldovan] Constitution of the principle of the republic's federalization." Snegur had repeatedly opposed this principle. One of the PDAM leaders, Aurel Talmaci, declared that the agrarians will only support the idea of a special status for the southern regions. Petru Lucinschi [speaker of Moldova's Parliament] declared before the elections that "we should not be afraid of the word `federalization,' as it does not mean yet the republic's dismemberment." The opposition does not feel responsible for the solution of the Gaguz problem. It considers anti-constitutional the inclusion of the supplementary question about the Gagauz' statehood into the bulletins of the 6 March poll.
