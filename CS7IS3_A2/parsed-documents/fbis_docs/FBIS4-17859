They are Private Potapov and Sergeant Vlasov. As the Bosnian side has breached the statutes on the peacekeeping forces, the commander of the Russian UN forces in Bosnia has sent a note of protest to the Bosnian military leadership. At present the Russian servicemen are effectively the prisoners of the Bosnian Muslims.
