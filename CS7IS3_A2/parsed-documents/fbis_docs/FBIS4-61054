Moscow wants to contribute to a settlement of the conflict there as well as in any other region of the world and seeks stability and friendly relations established in the region. Moscow considers this to be in its direct state interests, a Russian expert on this region's problems told INTERFAX in an interview. He suggested that the Russian position on elimination of the consequences of the Iraqi-Kuwait conflict proceeded from the priority of international law. "This means that Baghdad must strictly observe and implement all the decisions made by the world community. The UN Security Council in its turn must adequately response to all positive moves by Iraq," he added. The expert pointed out that three years after the armed conflict Iraq had done much for implementation of the decisions made by the UN Security Council, primarily in the sphere of disarmament. The expert said this had caused the Russian representative to the UN Security Council to propose at its last session that the "work" with Iraq proceed to the next stage providing for international control over the Iraqi military programs. "Moscow, Paris, Beijing and several nonpermanent members of the UN Security Council believe that such specific measures would encourage Baghdad for further cooperation with the Special Commission," the expert suggested. He said Moscow was afraid that a continuing indefinite position on lifting the sanctions and utilization of pressure and threats in dialogue with Iraq might bring results opposite to expectations, such as confrontation with the UN and a closed defense policy.
