The Azerbaijani president gave an interview to our program before staring his visit. [Begin recording] [Aliyev] To answer your questions simply, I can say that the real purpose of this visit is clear. Turkey and Azerbaijan are very close to each other, they are friendly countries. We have a friendship and cooperation agreement with Turkey, and we are in constant touch. Many agreements were signed during my official visit to Turkey in February. Both we and Turkey are working to implement these agreements. On my return to Baku from Belgium, I stopped over in Ankara for a few hours and held talks, conversations, and consultations. Our friendship and fraternal ties with Turkey are developing under conditions that require meetings, talks, and consultations from time to time. That is why Turkish President Suleyman Demirel invited me to Turkey. He requested that I visit him in Istanbul to examine various issues necessary for the continued cooperation between us. I accepted this invitation with pleasure because both Turkey and Azerbaijan need such a meeting at present. Therefore, I am now going to Istanbul to visit the Turkish president, my esteemed friend and brother Suleyman Demirel. I will meet him there and hold talks, and then we will do some other work as well. Such meetings take place not only in capital cities but in various cities and foreign countries. As for the oil issue, the talks between the Western companies and the Azerbaijani state oil company have resumed. These talks are being held in Istanbul at the desired level. There is no need for me to go into this matter at this moment, because I already met with and held detailed talks with the delegation of the Azerbaijani State Oil Company before its departure for Istanbul, during which Azerbaijan's principal positions on this issue were established. The delegation is holding talks on the basis of those positions. Regarding the NATO meeting, our Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov has been invited there. Only foreign ministers are taking part in that meeting. Gasan Gasanov will represent Azerbaijan at that meeting, and will convey our view to it. [Correspondent Seyyat Agababali] Mr. President, I want to ask a final question. You will receive Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev Saturday [11 June] morning. In the meantime, the Russian press has been disseminating certain views on Azerbaijan for the last two days. Also, in his statement today, Pavel Grachev said that if the Russian-sponsored plan is not signed during his meeting with you they will walk away from this issue. [Aliyev] As you know, Pavel Grachev will arrive in Baku on 11 June. His statements are his own personal affair. However, the actual aim of his visit to Azerbaijan -- and we have held talks on this issue, I also held a telephone conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin -- is linked to the huge air-defense object in Azerbaijan--in Russian they call it radiolocatsyone stantsia. This is an extremely important facility, which was built by the Soviet Union to defend against strategic missiles. This is now enormously important for Russia, and it is in operation. However, its status in Azerbaijan has not yet been clarified. That is because it is located on Azerbaijani territory, which means that it belongs to Azerbaijan; it is Azerbaijan's property. At the same time, Russia is using it. Despite the fact that the Soviet Union collapsed two and half years ago, regrettably this matter has not yet been resolved. Although Russia benefits from it, Azerbaijan's rights to it have not yet been established. Therefore, I have raised this problem to the Russian leadership, both to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev. Grachev is coming here to discuss this matter. Undoubtedly, once he is here, many other problems will also be discussed, but one cannot comment on them beforehand. [end recording] The Azerbaijani president was seen off at Bina airport by Prime Minister Suret Guseynov, Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy prime ministers, ministers, company presidents, and other officials.
