According to the provincial government, since 1985 the province has undertaken 15 foreign-aided programs including those introducing talents, technology and funds. The total investment in the programs amounts to 250 million yuan. A Japanese-aided grain program started in 1990 and is being carried out in about 30 poverty-stricken townships mainly inhabited by ethnic minority people. The program has benefited 78,000 households and about 350,000 people. The grain program aims to increase yields to cover 20,000 hectares of farmland and produce 154.5 million kilograms of grain by the end of 1993, an increase of 67.75 percent over the original yield of the farmland. The grain output per capita in the program target townships has increased from 253 kilograms to 439 kilograms and the income per capita from 184 yuan to 311.5 yuan, respectively increasing by 68 and 69 percent. A land-transformation program supported by the New Zealand Government and started in July 1992 has fulfilled its targets in grass cultivation and animal husbandry. A survey of 128 households in the program target areas showed that the grain output in the areas has grown by 34 percent. Investigation in Longli County showed that the grain output per capita already reached 336.8 kilograms last year, increasing by 15.5 percent over the previous year. The income from livestock farming per household was 1,325 yuan. The World Food Program's 3,146 project is the largest agricultural project in Guizhou Province. The project, which was started in 1988, is to help five cities and counties where Miao and Buyi nationalities live to transform low-yield farmland in order to raise grain output. The project aims to construct 3,600 hectares of irrigatable farmland and provide drinking water for 13,000 people and 7,000 cattle. Recently an expert group sent to Guizhou by the World Food Program pronounced its satisfaction with the ongoing program after completing its investigation.
