FR940816-2-00091 FR940816-2-00071 Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,494; 494A] Aileen's South Hill, VA; Aileen's New York, NY; Amended Certification Regarding Eligibility To Apply for Work Adjustment Assistance In accordance with section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 USC 2273) the Department of Labor issued a Certification for Worker Adjustment Assistance on March 24, 1994, applicable to all workers of Aileen's, South Hill, Virginia. The notice was published in the Federal Register on April 7, 1994 (59 FR 16663). At the request of the company the Department reviewed the subject certification. The findings show that a few workers were laid off beginning in January, 1994 at the New York facility of Aileen's. The layoffs were the result of a reduced demand from the South Hill plant whose workers are currently certified for TAA. Therefore, the Department is amending the subject certification to include the New York location. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers of Aileen's who were adversely affected by increased imports. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,494 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Aileen's South Hill, Virginia and New York, New York engaged in employment related to the production of ladies' pants, skirts, blouses, jackets and shirts who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after February 2, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 5th day of August 1994. James D. Van Erden, Administrator, Office of Work-Based Learning.
