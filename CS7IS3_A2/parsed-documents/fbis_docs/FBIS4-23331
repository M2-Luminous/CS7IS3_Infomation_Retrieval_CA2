Chissano said this soon after registering as a voter at the Josina Machel School in Maputo. "We think it was a forced step," he told MEDIAFAX. "We need other forms of relationship before we can have a true Comesa. We shall do all we can however to realize Comesa's objective." Despite the hustle and bustle, we were able to ask President Chissano three [as published] questions. [MEDIAFAX] What do you expect from the World Economic Forum scheduled for next week in Cape Town? [Chissano] "I expect the participants to compare views to discover the world's main concerns with regard to economic development and cooperation in southern Africa, after the end of apartheid." [MEDIAFAX] Is there any other thing you consider important? [Chissano] "Yes. There is a need to convey a message that will convince the international community and businessmen that there is peace in southern Africa and we all intend to establish a harmonious development." [MEDIAFAX] What additional short term regional integration steps can be taken? [Chissano] "I see a greater utilization of the South African potentialities in assisting the development of other countries. I also see increasing trade and exchange of technology between the countries of the region and South Africa. In the past there was activity, but it could not be exploited to the maximum because of apartheid." [MEDIAFAX] Do you accept the zero option and the elimination of customs duty at regional borders? [Chissano] "This is an issue that must be carefully studied because there are already three organizations in the region -- the Southern African Development Community, the PTA, and the Customs Union -- each one with its own rules. The situation must be studied so that no one is put at a disadvantage. In Mozambique, we advocate gradual steps to consolidate economic unity".
