North Korea could use the U.S. congressman's visit as an opportunity to renew its demand that U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea, according to the analysts. Because Dellums' visit has been delayed, some within the government have expressed doubt that the trip would take place at all, they said. It was North Korea, however, that invited Dellums to visit, and preparations for party secretary Kim Chong-il's birthday celebration must have caused Pyongyang's lateness in advising the congressmen when to come, they stressed. Noting that Washington and Pyongyang had met recently in New York and elsewhere with the deadline in the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) standoff with North Korea just a week away, they said the North Koreans and Dellums would make a final decision on the latter's visit if the contacts produced a favorable result. Therefore, they did not rule out the possibility that Rep. Dellums would cancel his visit if the Washington-Pyongyang contacts proceeded unfavorably. But they predicted he would make the visit, though somewhat later than scheduled, in view of Washington and Pyongyang's present relations. One of the congressional security analysts said the Seoul Government should watch a visit by Dellums closely because he is a congressional dove in dealing with North Korea. In Pyongyang, he said, House Armed Services Committee chairman Dellums would meet President Kim Il-song, Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam and People's Armed Forces Minister O Chin-u, with Seoul needing to take special note of these meetings. It is highly likely that if these meetings are held, both sides will raise the issue of arms reduction on the Korean peninsula, including the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea that North Korea has so determinedly pursued on the strength of its nuclear arms development program. In that case, the focus of Washington-Pyongyang contacts would shift from Pyongyang's nuclear program to more fundamental issues related to the future of the Korean peninsula. This scenario would require a smooth solution to the nuclear issue and improved U.S.-North Korea relations as prerequisites. If Seoul felt alienated by an improved U.S.-North Korean relationship, problems would emerge in its ties with Washington, the congressional analyst said, voicing doubt that Seoul could cope effectively with such a change. A recent U.S. General Accounting Office report on the North Korean nuclear problem says that if South Korean military leaders have doubts about President Kim Yong-sam's policy on this issue, South Korea could be plunged into political unrest. South Korea is concerned that it could be alienated by American diplomacy toward North Korea on the nuclear issue, dealing a blow to its North Korea policy, according to the report. A visit by Dellums should be viewed as important not only to the nuclear issue, but also to the far-reaching issue of security on the Korean peninsula, the congressional analysts said.
