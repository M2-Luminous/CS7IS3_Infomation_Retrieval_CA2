D. Sirotenko and Ye. V.

Scenarios of both models of the theory of climate and paleoclimatic reconstructions were used in the computations. The totality of the collected data indicates that the development of warming in scenarios of models of general circulation of the atmosphere would lead to a substantial aridization of the climate of Russia in which it would be reasonable to expect a decrease in agricultural productivity, but the development of a warming under the scenario of an interglacial optimum would result in a universal moistening of climate and a substantial increase in agricultural productivity. The following scenarios of change in important climatic factors by the year 2030 (in comparison with 1990) are visualized: an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide by 20% (CO[.sub]2[/] x 1.2); an increase in the background concentration of tropospheric ozone by 30% (O[.sub]3[/] x 1.3); a decrease in the content of soil organic matter by 20% (HUM x 0.8). It is demonstrated that the direct influence of an increase in the carbon dioxide gas concentration would be capable of offsetting the agricultural losses associated with a climatic change under the most unfavorable scenario. However, the negative impact of an increase in the content of other greenhouse gases, especially tropospheric ozone, and anthropogenic degradation of soils would make this possibility problematical. It is emphasized that with any variant of global warming there will be a need for radical restructuring of the entire agricultural management system. The simulative modeling of this biospheric system, however, may reveal safe and economically feasible ways to bring about such adaptation. References 17: 9 Russian, 8 Western.
