FR940419-2-00033 FR940419-2-00027 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;206&hyph;000] Pacific Gas Transmission Co.; Notice of Change in Rates April 13, 1994. Take notice that on April 11, 1994, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT) submitted for filing pursuant to Section 4 of the Natural Gas Act and §154.63 of the Commission's Regulations thereunder, certain tariff sheets to add Paragraph 39 to the Transportation General Terms and Conditions of PGT's FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1&hyph;A to govern the sales of gas that may be made from time to time, under PGT's blanket sales certificate, to dispose of gas that is in excess of PGT's operational requirements and to grant a limited waiver of the requirements of Order No. 497 with respect to such sales. PGT requests that the Commission act expeditiously on this filing and make Paragraph 39 effective and grant waiver of Order No. 497 no later than April 18, 1994. PGT states that waiver of the 30-day notice period is necessary because PGT may have to dispose of excess gas to maintain the integrity of its pipeline system before the 30-day notice period expires. PGT states that a copy of this filing has been served on PGT's jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 20, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
