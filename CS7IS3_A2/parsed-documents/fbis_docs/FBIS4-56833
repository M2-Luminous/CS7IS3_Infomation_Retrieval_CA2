"Telemetro Reports" has an exclusive report. Ernesto Perez Balladares, virtual president elect, made his first visit this morning to Christian Democratic leader Ricardo Arias Calderon. Perez Balladares paid his respects to the man he called one of the main champions of democracy in Panama. [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Perez Balladares, why are you visiting Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon? [Perez Balladares] Dr. Arias Calderon has been an outstanding champion of democracy in Panama. I have been favored by an electoral process held in a time of democracy. I wanted to tell Dr. Arias Calderon, and I have done so, that he can rest assured that we are also committed to democracy. In addition, with this small gesture, I want to tell the country that we are moved by the best spirit of national reconciliation. There are neither vanquished nor victors in Panama. I think all Panamanians have won, and naturally there is no hatred or rancor. We are planning to work, everyone united, to attain our national goals. I wanted to come and tell Ricardo about this. [Reporter] In a few months you are going to take over as president of the Republic. Are you going to rule with opposing parties in view of the election results? [Perez Balladares] I want to invite all Panamanians, regardless of their political inclination, to make this government what the country needs to enter the 21st century united. That means -- and I am not evading your question -- that I am going to invite some people who have been my adversaries and some who belong to other political parties to form part of the government. I think it is necessary. I am fully aware of the fact that two-thirds of Panamanians chose other candidates. It is true that I have won, but two-thirds of the Panamanians saw better things in other candidates. I have to accept that with much humility, and therefore I want to form a government that will reflect that national feeling. [Reporter] Dr. Ricardo Arias Calderon, you have just heard Dr. Perez Balladares' opinion. What do you have to say about this visit and about the other things that only you and Dr. Perez Balladares discussed? [Arias Calderon] For 21 years I struggled against the dictatorship so we could live in democracy. Now that democracy has born fruit in the most honest and peaceful elections that we have had for as long as I can recall, I admit that he has won the elections honestly and that he is the president-elect of Panama. I appreciate his visit to my home. He has given me the opportunity to talk with him about national problems, about things that worry the people, such as keeping public security demilitarized. He has reiterated his pledge to me -- just like he has done to the country -- that it will be that way. I have strengthened his concern about the administration of justice, that it must be handled so their is not the slightest suspicion of bias or politics. That is something that the country needs. I have spoken of the need for a joint effort, just like he has spoken of it, for an economic development that will stamp out unemployment and help the thousands of men and women who are jobless. We also spoke about how to prepare the country to manage the Canal. I think the president-elect is looking to the future. I am certainly looking toward the future. I will support all measures that are positive for Panama, and I will practice a democratic and constructive criticism in everything that I believe can be improved. He has invited me to voice my opinions frankly, and I have done so. I appreciate his kind gesture today. [Reporter] Dr. Arias Calderon, in the face of this joint task ahead for the president-elect, did he make any offer for the Christian Democratic Party [PDC] to rule jointly with the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] in the pursuit of better social programs for the country? [Arias Calderon] We did not talk about political offers because that does not concern me. I am not the PDC president. The party president is Raul Ossa, and the PDC candidate is Eduardo Vallarino. I have spoken as one Panamanian to another, as a Panamanian who struggled for democracy with a Panamanian who has been democratically elected president. We have not discussed offers at all; that was not part of the agenda. [end recording]
