The director, a cool-headed and fast-talking official, readily consented. "Thanks to the kind attention and support of the regional party committee and regional government as well as relevant departments, and through the joint efforts of all tax officers, Tibet has carried out tax reform in an orderly way and achieved some initial success," said the director with a big smile. He pointed out: Last year Tibet collected a record 210 million yuan in tax revenue. Despite this gratifying achievement, we should not be optimistic. We have to work still harder in order to keep our tax reform in step with the reform of the economic structure nationwide. The director said: The ongoing reform of the industrial and commercial tax system is an important measure aimed at meeting the requirements for establishing a socialist market economic structure and introducing separate central and local taxation systems. Tibet's existing industrial and commercial tax system was generally based on the structure and mode of industrial and commercial consolidated tax from the fifties. While the national tax system has already undergone major changes on several occasions, only minor changes were implemented in the regional system. As a result, the system in Tibet was confusing for laymen and experts alike. The system, which is neither rational nor standardized, was divorced from the national tax system and hindered Tibet's participation in the nationally unified market and international economic activities. In order to make tax reform a success, the Regional Taxation Bureau began preparations for drafting a regional tax reform program last July by organizing tax officers to go down to grass-roots units to investigate the results of experimentation with separate tax systems at selected enterprises as well as tax burdens of individual industrial and commercial units. After in-depth and systematic analyses of the investigation results and a dozen revisions of the draft with arduous efforts for several months, a regional tax reform program was produced. When asked by the reporters about the features of the regional taxation reform, the director spoke with fervor and assurance: 1) While sticking to the basic framework of national tax reform, the regional program has made appropriate adaptations in light of Tibet's realities, specifically differing in terms of the scope of individual tax categories; postponing, retaining, and canceling tax categories; expenses and deductions; taxable amounts and tax rates; and tax reductions and exemptions. The number of tax categories has been cut back by 50 percent from 18 to nine to show special consideration for the ethnic region. 2) After reform, the tax categories are more in line with the requirements for establishing a socialist market economy. For example, the existing industrial and commercial tax is separated; state enterprises are required to pay taxes plus a percentage of profits; income tax rates for enterprises are lowered; the regulatory tax and collection of funds for construction of energy and transportation projects are cancelled; and the original individual income tax, individual income regulatory tax, and individual industrial and commercial household tax are merged as one individual income tax, which is levied on every member of society. Furthermore, the scope of resource tax is broadened; and the original wool and woolen fabric purchase tax is expanded to cover animal products and timber, medicinal herbs, and other farm, forestry, and animal husbandry products. These reform measures can promote fair competition and meet the requirements of market economy. 3) Under the new tax system, though the number of taxable items has increased, the original preferential policies are retained. As a result, the overall tax burden remains the same, thus ensuring the vested interests of peasants and herdsmen. By not adding even the slightest tax burden on peasants and herdsmen at large, the tax reform program reflects the feature of broad-range but low-rate taxation system. 4) The new tax system reflects the continuity of some previous preferential policies. The regional government's preferential treatments to foreign-funded enterprises remain unchanged; and except for a few items, tax exemptions for private enterprises and individual industrial and commercial units set up by peasants and herdsmen as well as village and town enterprises in farming and pastoral areas will continue until the end of this century. Tax reductions and exemptions will continue to be granted to urban collectively-owned productive and processing enterprises; to collective enterprises set up by surplus personnel, disabled people, and the aged; and to certain qualified enterprises of tertiary industry. 5) As a result of the tax reform, the regional people's government has granted some benefits to prefectures, cities, and counties, thereby readjusting their financial revenue structure and building up their capability to become financially self-sufficient. As the reporters wound up the interview, Director Ci Nuo declared with confidence: "So long as all tax officers heighten their spirits, the new tax system can be smoothly implemented in Tibet."
