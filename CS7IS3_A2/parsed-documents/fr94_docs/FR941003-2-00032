ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In accordance with the authorities contained in 12 U.S.C. 1821(c), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was duly appointed receiver for the financial institutions specified in SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. The FDIC has determined that the proceeds which can be realized from the liquidation of the assets of the below listed receivership estates are insufficient to wholly satisfy the priority claims of depositors against the receivership estates. Therefore, upon satisfaction of secured claims, depositor claims and claims which have priority over depositors under applicable law, no amount will remain or will be recovered sufficient to allow a dividend, distribution or payment to any creditor of lessor priority, including but not limited to, claims of general creditors. Any such claims are hereby determined to be worthless. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tina A. Lamoreaux, Counsel, Legal Division, FDIC, 550 17th Street NW., Room H&hyph;11027, Washington, DC 20429.
