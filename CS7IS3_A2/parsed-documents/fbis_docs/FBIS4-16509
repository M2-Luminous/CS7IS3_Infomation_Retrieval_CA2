This is the reason for his today's absence from a meeting of the Commonwealth councils of state and government heads. "The president used to work in a foundry. He lifted heavy things and once overstrained himself. The trauma later developed into chronic radiculitis," he said. "A whole group of physicians is taking care of the president. We are unanimous in the opinion that radiculitis and cold Nazarbayev is suffering from must be cured. That is why, we recommended the president to cancel his Moscow visit," stressed the physician.
