Clinton, speaking on a television talk show, said he is particularly distressed with trade gaps which he said are "structural and permanent." "Our biggest problems are with Japan and now with China," he told the Cable News Network's "Larry King Live," a television talk show that is beamed worldwide. "We are working on both of them," he said. Clinton made the remarks in reply to a question from a caller who asked whether he favors increasing the local content of U.S. products in order to reduce the size of the U.S. trade deficit. "I would like to lower our trade deficit, at least that which is structural and permanent," he said. Clinton said the U.S. Government must, however, be "very careful" over the "Buy American" proposal because it might violate U.S. commitments under international trade treaties. "We do have certain `Buy American' preferences in our laws, but we have to be very careful how far we go without violating treaties and agreements we make with other countries which take our products freely," he said. Japan and China both run huge trade surpluses with the United States. According to U.S. trade figures, Japan's bilateral trade surplus is running at more than 50 billion dollars a year, while China's tops 20 billion dollars.
