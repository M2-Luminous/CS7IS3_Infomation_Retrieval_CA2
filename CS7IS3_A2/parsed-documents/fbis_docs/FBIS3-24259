These are the results of a state of the market survey of 172 enterprise directors in Moscow and the oblast. While earlier only 50 percent of respondents mentioned production decline (December 1993), in February 61 percent mentioned it. The cause of the general decline in industry in February are reports of a substantial reduction in output at machine-building and construction material industry enterprises, where the balance of "increased"--"decreased" replies measured -60 percent and -53 percent, respectively. On the whole, a production increase was registered in February only at woodworking industry enterprises, where the balance is positive (+9 percent). The absence of practical steps to implement the budget and credit policy of the new government has not changed the trend, which had materialized by the end of 1993, of the decline in producers' normal demand for industrial output. In February 1994, 87 percent of enterprises saw demand for their products as insufficient (84 percent in January). The share assessing demand as normal dropped to a record low of all the surveys (8 percent). Dissatisfaction with demand exceeded 90 percent in the machine-building, metallurgy, and petrochemical industries. In the woodworking industry even now at least 30 percent of enterprises see demand for their output as normal. In the summer of 1993 the share of such assessment in the sector was 50 percent. Low demand forces producers to first and foremost cut back on production: 47 percent of the respondents in this group are willing to cut back on production and only 11 percent are willing not to raise prices. Among enterprises that see the demand as normal, 22 percent will try to refrain from raising prices. When the decline in production slowed down somewhat in January, in the environment of shrinking demand it caused a build-up of excess inventories of finished products. In February enterprises already preferred to cut production rather then fill their warehouses with finished products. The balance of inventory estimates dropped by five percentage points and returned to the level of November-December 1993. Nevertheless, an increase in excess inventories was registered at enterprises in machine-building (62 percent, in January--55 percent), woodworking (55 percent, in January--0 percent), and food processing (50 percent, in January--38 percent) industries. The survey results show that enterprises forecast changes in their production practically without taking into account the volume of inventories of finished products. However, inventory estimates do influence producers' price policy--16 percent of enterprises with excess inventories will attempt to hold prices at the same level, and only 10 percent of those with normal inventories will attempt to do so. In February the number of surveyed enterprises expecting production decline was no longer increasing. The differential of "will increase"--"will decline" answers measured -31 percent (-33 percent in January). At the same time, only 36 percent of enterprises hoped to maintain production volume. This is the worst level in the past 17 months. The highest expectations of production cutbacks are steadily registered at very large (54 percent replied "will decline") and large (45 percent) production facilities. During the next few months production cutbacks are most likely in machine-building (balance -42 percent), light industry (-22 percent), and the petrochemical industry (-28 percent). At woodworking and food processing industry enterprises the prevailing forecast for the new year is one of maintaining the current production volume. After the January jump in inflationary expectations, hopes for curbing the price race rose again in February: The share of "will not change" replies comprised 10 percent (5 percent in January and 15 percent in December). Mainly, efforts to keep wholesale prices at the same level will be made in light (21 percent of "will not change" and 5 percent of "will fall" replies), machine-building (12 percent "will not change"), and woodworking (9 percent "will not change") industries.
