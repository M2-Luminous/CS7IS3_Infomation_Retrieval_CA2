His platform should please the military, in light of his proposal to increase federal budget allocations for the Armed Forces from 2.7 percent to 5 percent. The 60-year-old admiral served as commander of the War College from 1991 until his retirement in 1993. He joined the PSC in January with the intention of running for a federal deputy seat. Because it has become impossible for the PSC to nominate Senator Jose Sarney (Brazilian Democratic Movement Party) as its presidential candidate, the PSC has decided to promote Goulart Fortuna's candidacy. Goulart Fortuna said: "The PSC national board has entrusted me with this mission, and I have accepted."
