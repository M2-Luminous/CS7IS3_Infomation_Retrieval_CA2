After making clear what we had come for, Chen Xianjun, deputy head of the satellite observation station, received us warmly. This engineer said only those who visit at night will be impressed by the observation station. Due to technical reasons, the station only conducts observations at night and does not turn on the instrument in the day time. Deputy head Chen led us to the monitoring room, which is equipped with all kinds of electronic instruments. The red signal light kept twinkling and the telecommunications sign sounded clearly and melodiously. Signs and figures moved up and down on the computer screens. Deputy head Chen told us the so-called satellite tracking is to measure the distance between the satellite and Earth at all times. To be more specific, it is to measure the distance between the satellite and the observation spot at all times. We asked: "How many satellites can the station track?" He hit several keys on the computer keyboard and the screen showed the directory of observed satellites and times they were close to the sky over the observation station. There are nine satellites: the U.S. Geodesic Satellite, the Japan Violet Satellite, the European Remote Sensing Satellite No. 1, the French Maritime Hydrographic Satellite, and so on. [passage omitted] Although the principles are very simple, it is very difficult in operation. The furthermost satellite is some 20,000 km from the Earth and is rotating continuously. To ensure the error of measurement does not exceed 4 cm, we should utilize modern science and technology to guarantee the speed. For example, the velocity of light is 300,000 km per second in the physics textbooks; however, here we use an even more accurate speed: 29.9292458 km per second. As for time, one second passes in a twinkle; however, here 10.000000000001 [as published] second, the unit of time, can be accurately counted. Deputy head Chen said proudly most of the instruments ranging from laser devices to precision measuring instruments are produced in China. The turning on of the laser device, sending and receiving the laser beam, as well as data recording and processing are operated by all kinds of instruments in the monitoring room. They are operated automatically by computers by programs designed previously. [passage omitted] "We heard that a foreign laser weapon is used to hit aircraft. Can a laser sent from the station penetrate the human body?" we asked. "It would be OK if a laser strikes any part of the human body, except the eyes. Once the eyes are stricken, serious burns will cause blindness. [passage omitted] Speaking of satellite ranging, engineer Chen was extremely excited. His words brought us to a remote space. He said: "The precision of laser ranging is pretty high. Its error is at the cm level. Think about this, the average value of global sea level obtained with such precision is very precious data. Now it is said that the global weather is getting warmer and less snow falls than melts in the Antarctic Pole; if it causes the raising of the sea level, a rather reliable numerical value can be obtained at the satellite observation station. In addition, the India massif moving northwards not only raises Mount Qomolangma, but also moves the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau northwards close to Tian Shan. A massif's moving rate can be obtained through satellite ranging. [passage omitted] Now through satellite ranging, it is known that Shanghai is moving 2 cm toward Japan annually. Of course, satellite ranging is not limited to this application. We cannot calculate the satellite orbital angle or establish the zero-level global network without it." It is learned from the satellite observation station that, as far as such global data is concerned, it is not sufficient to rely only on the station in Beijing and the other three stations in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changchun. Close cooperation among relevant scientists in the international community is needed. This is a global industry. There are some 40 satellite ranging stations in operation in the world, sending data obtained to the international satellite ranging data analyzing and processing center in the United States. Data will be provided to scientists and technicians worldwide after being processed. As engineer Chen summarized: "Utilize satellite and laser technology to conduct experiments on Earth on which we depend for existence, so that we can give an early warning as soon as we find an abnormal state unfavorable for the existence of human beings." [passage omitted] Do you want to find the station's location? The green light is sent to the universe from 39 degrees 36 minutes 22.3 seconds north latitude and 115 degrees 53 minutes 36.87 seconds east longitude.
