Nuclear Moratorium Alain Chastagnol discussed Mitterrand's opposition to nuclear tests in the 6 May Paris daily LE QUOTIDIEN. While nuclear deterrence was not mentioned in the French Government's defense white paper, the president has consistently opposed renewed nuclear testing, in contrast with Rally for the Republic (RPR) leader Jacques Chirac, who remarked that "French credibility requires that testing start again." To counter this opposition, Mitterrand used "mental gymnastics" to appear as the firmest guarantor of the nuclear strike force while simultaneously opposing renewed testing, Chastagnol wrote. In his latest statements, the president attempted to "impress" by discussing at length the already-existing nuclear warheads, as well as reaffirming that, as president, he has the exclusive right to make decisions in this field. Chastagnol cited him as arguing that President Clinton himself had extended the testing moratorium and that France "did not wish to offend the whole world" by renewing an armaments race and would substitute simulated nuclear tests. According to Chastagnol, these arguments are not convincing. Even if the United States decided to prolong the moratorium until September 1995, it could at that point end it, while relying in the interim on a simulation program admittedly superior to France's. Chastagnol also questioned Mitterrand's stated conviction that his successor in the presidency would not start nuclear testing. France's Council of Atomic Energy (CEA) has launched a study program to prepare for a "limitation" of nuclear tests before achieving successful simulations; however, Mitterrand has rejected previous testing and asked that simulation proceed without it. According to Chastagnol, the president's statement was clearly not aimed at national defense, but at needling Chirac while pleasing ecologists. The statement was also not convincing to those white paper skeptics disappointed by the current delays, postponements, and reduction of forces. "In military issues, uncertainty still reigns," Chastagnol concluded. Writing in the 8 May LE QUOTIDIEN, Philippe Reinhard commented that the goal of Mitterrand's statements on defense was "tactical," not "strategic." Faithful to his custom before elections, the president wished to emphasize the differences between the Right and the Left and sow discord within the majority. He succeeded, Reinhard remarked, as part of the Right is "indignant" over the nuclear test ban while Foreign Minister Alain Juppe "more sensibly and circumspectly" said that the president "cannot anticipate what his successor will do." According to Reinhard, Mitterrand has chosen the "right theme." A unilateral French decision in this field would be unpopular and weaken Paris' international position. While public opinion overall shows little concern over this issue, it is obvious that most of those who care are opposed to ending the moratorium, especially when France is "mobilizing" to close the Chernobyl site, according to Reinhard. It is also important to determine whether tests are needed for continued French deterrence capabilities, Reinhard wrote. A majority of experts, though not all, believe it is. However, a decision entailing troublesome diplomatic consequences for France ought not to be made under the pressure of the "military-industrial lobby." Continued nuclear testing is demanded by those who wish to modify indepth the French doctrine of deterrence. Such a "radical" change can only come after a national debate, Reinhard warned. Presidential candidates should present their proposals next spring and should not be drawn by President Mitterrand into a "politicians' polemic in which the Right has more to lose than the Left." Mitterrand Dubbed `Last European' Alain Duhamel published a commentary on Mitterrand titled "The Last European" in the Paris daily LIBERATION of 13 May. "Alone in the European minefield," Mitterrand is openly in favor of Europe, Duhamel wrote. The European Union (EU) is blamed for "unemployment, insecurity, violence, anxiety, and marginalization." Brussels, Duhamel continued, is seen as a "bureaucratic multiheaded monster." Europe is used either as a "scapegoat," a "foil," or a "scarecrow" by politicians as different as Citizens' Movement leader Jean-Pierre Chevenement, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, rightist Philippe de Villiers, Socialist Party secretary general Michel Rocard, and the Right's Dominique Baudis. Duhamel commented that among his European peers, Mitterrand is also "the last of the Mohicans." Europe, Duhamel wrote, "is in retreat." Mitterrand reminded his listeners that peace and stability require a stronger Europe, that France's "weight and ambition" are strengthened through Europe, and that the only way to fight North America or Southeast Asia with equal economic and political weapons is the EU. Duhamel observed that France, following Germany, will hold the EU presidency during Mitterrand's last six months in office. This will favor Franco-German initiatives and the launching of a more broadly supported European effort.
