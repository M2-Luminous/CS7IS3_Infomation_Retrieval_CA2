FR941206-1-00073 FR941206-1-00007 After much discussion, the Committee agreed upon an approach that satisfied all members. Under this approach, all affected sources must prepare a Formulation Assessment Plan. The Formulation Assessment Plan will help ensure that the averaging approach allowed under the proposed rule does not circumvent the goals of State air toxics programs. The plan must identify all VHAP of potential concern being used by the affected source for finishing operations that are on the list of 10 compounds identified by industry. The list, presented in Table 4, ยง63.803(1), of the proposed standards, includes those VHAP of potential concern that industry indicated were currently in use by the wood furniture manufacturing industry. The plan must establish a baseline level of usage, based on the highest annual usage from 1994, 1995, or 1996, for each VHAP of potential concern used by the affected source. For sources using formaldehyde, the baseline level of usage would be based on the free formaldehyde content of the finishing material. For styrene, the baseline level of usage would be based on an estimate of unreacted styrene, which would be calculated by multiplying the amount of styrene monomer in the coating by a factor of 0.16. The free formaldehyde content of the finishing material was chosen as a method for tracking formaldehyde usage because it is a readily available quantity based on known and agreed upon industry test procedures. However, there is no data available that directly links the free formaldehyde content of a coating to formaldehyde emissions. Therefore, the Committee recommended that if data become available that indicated that formaldehyde emissions were either more or less than those estimated using the free formaldehyde content, the calculation procedure in the formulation assessment plan should be re-examined. Both ultraviolet (UV) and polyester coatings used by the wood furniture industry contain styrene monomer. During curing, styrene monomer reacts to form the dried coating. However, some of the styrene monomer is emitted during the application of the coating and as the coating cures. While EPA has not developed an emission factor for styrene for these coatings, they have developed emission factors for the fabrication of products from polyester resins. These emission factors are presented in Chapter 4 of EPA's ``Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors.'' The industry felt that the emission factors developed for vapor-suppressed gelcoats were appropriate for use in estimating unreacted styrene monomer emissions from UV and polyester coatings. The emission factor for vapor-suppressed gelcoats ranges from 8 to 25. The industry and EPA agreed to use a midpoint value of 16. While a constant emission factor may not be a true measure of actual emissions, it would not adversely affect the facility using these coatings because both baseline emissions and emissions from later years would be estimated on the same basis. The source must track usage of each VHAP of potential concern. If, after November 1998, usage of the VHAP of potential concern exceeds the established baseline levels then the source must provide a written notification to the permitting authority that describes the amount of increase and explains the reasons for exceedance of the baseline level. As long as the source is complying with its State Air Toxics Program or any other State rules or requirements affecting that VHAP of potential concern, any of the following explanations would relieve the facility from further action: (1) The usage level is below the de minimis level, based on 70 year exposure levels, that is specified through EPA's rulemaking pursuant to section 112(g) of the Clean Air Act for that VHAP (for sources using control devices to reduce emissions the usage level can be adjusted to account for the overall control efficiency of the control system); (2) the increase is no more than 15.0 percent above the baseline level; (3) the source is in compliance with its State air toxics regulations or guidelines for that VHAP of potential concern; or (4) the VHAP is used in a finishing material that has a VOC content of no more than 1.0 kg VOC/kg solids (1.0 lb VOC/lb solids), as applied. If the explanation for the exceedance of the baseline level is not one of the four discussed above, the owner or operator must confer with the permitting authority to discuss the reasons for the increase and to determine if these are practical and reasonable technology-based solutions for reducing usage of the VHAP. The evaluation of whether a technology is reasonable and practical would be based on cost, quality, and marketability of the product; the successful use of the technology by other wood furniture manufacturing operations, or other criteria agreed upon by the permitting authority and owner or operator. If the permitting authority and owner or operator agree there are no practical and reasonable solutions, the facility would take no further action.
