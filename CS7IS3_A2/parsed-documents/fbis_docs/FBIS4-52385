In the telephone talks initiated by Premier Hata, President Kim said that Nagano's remarks on Japan's role during World War II have shocked and hurt the Korean people. "There should be no recurrence of a similar incident. The Japanese cabinet member distorted the history of the past to inflict an injury on the Korean people," the president said. The telephone conversation lasted about 20 minutes beginning 5:15 PM. Prime Minister Hata offered a regret over Nagano's remarks. "It is highly regrettable that former Justice Minister Nagano's remarks hurt the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries," Hata was quoted as saying. Hata especially noted that at a Diet session earlier in the day, he regretted Nagano's remarks by saying that his statement had brought both sorrows and anger to many people in other Asian countries, Chongwadae spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. According to Chu, President Kim stressed that what is important in the contemporary age is for South Korea and Japan to cooperate with each other closely toward a new history and march jointly onward toward common interests and peace in Asia. The Japanese premier said Japan will continue to strive to build constructive relations between Japan and other Asian countries including South Korea based on a correct insight into the past.
