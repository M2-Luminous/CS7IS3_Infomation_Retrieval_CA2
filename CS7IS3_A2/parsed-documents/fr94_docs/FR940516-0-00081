ACTION: Final rules. SUMMARY: The Commission has adopted rules for assuring compatibility between consumer electronics equipment and cable systems, as required by the Section 17 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992.

EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective June 15, 1994. The incorporation by reference of a publication listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 15, 1994.

Summary of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making 1. Section 17 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (1992 Cable Act) requires that the Commission issue regulations to ensure compatibility between consumer equipment and cable systems. The goal of Section 17 is to ensure that cable subscribers will be able to enjoy the full benefits and functions of their television receivers and VCRs when receiving cable service. 2. Problems between cable systems and consumer TV equipment generally tend to arise from conflicts between new features in consumer television equipment and the techniques used by cable systems to address security and other technical operating considerations. Examples of TV receiver features affected by cable operating methods and devices include functions that permit the subscriber: _To watch a program on one channel while simultaneously recording a program on another channel; _To record two programs that appear on different channels; or, _To use advanced features such as picture in picture.
