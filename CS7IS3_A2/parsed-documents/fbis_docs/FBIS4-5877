Watanabe, head of the LDP's third largest faction, also expressed his readiness to form a new alliance with Shinseito and Komeito, the two key parties in the governing coalition, in order to "surmount the crises now confronting this country." Watanabe, a former deputy prime minister and concurrently foreign minister of the once-dominant LDP, made the remarks after two hours of talks with Kono. Earlier in the day, Japanese mass media reported that Watanabe had decided to quit the LDP to form his own party. "We held extremely serious talks," Watanabe told reporters after emerging from his bargaining session with Kono, who paid a visit to the factional leader at his political office in his faction's headquarters. Watanabe said, "I told him (Kono) it is necessary for politicians of the same political opinions and doctrine to band together to form an alliance in order to surmount the crises now confronting this country, from the standpoint of making full-fledged efforts to save the country." Watanabe was apparently referring to the political ideals of intra-coalition forces led by the chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito, the core coalition component. Ozawa has advocated the same stand as Watanabe on such key issues as Japan's role in UN peacekeeping missions, tax system reform and the need to take a tough stand against the suspected North Korean nuclear arms program. Kono told reporters he has not given up his efforts to persuade Watanabe not to break away from the LDP, which lost its 38-year lock on power in a 1993 general election following a series of defections. Kono said he told Watanabe he does not have any intention to give up his own bid for the premiership in the Diet election for the post. Kono said he told Watanabe, "I will take the responsibility as the president of the LDP." A majority of LDP legislators have voiced their support for Kono's bid to run for the nation's stewardship, party sources said. Watanabe said, however, he told Kono he also intends to run in the parliamentary vote for a new prime minister. No date has yet been set for the vote to pick a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who announced his resignation on April 8. Watanabe also expressed his intention to change the nature of the current coalition, telling Kono, "I will become the torchbearer who will drive a wedge into the governing coalition's structure by advocating the LDP's policies." The remark apparently reflects Watanabe's long-time criticism of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the largest party in the ruling coalition, which he has repeatedly blasted as "distorting the policies of the coalition." LDP sources said Kono and Watanabe agreed to resume discussion next Monday in an attempt to reconcile their differences over Watanabe's possible defection and his avowed bid to seek the prime ministership, while monitoring whether the coalition parties are able to narrow their gulf over the succession issue. LDP secretary general Yoshiro Mori later told a news conference that Watanabe gave no indication of his possible breakaway from the LDP in the talks. "The point is that Mr. Watanabe and LDP president Kono shared serious perceptions of the current political situation," Mori said. During the meeting, Mori said, Watanabe told Kono that he wants to join hands with those whose basic policies are close to his own as long as the LDP is in opposition and cannot directly take part in the management of national politics. "That's what I call a 'moderately conservative' political setup," Mori quoted Watanabe as saying. Kono retorted, however, that the LDP should take a wait-and-see attitude toward the current political development following Hosokawa's abrupt decision to call it quits last week. "It is evident the coalition government will suffer a major collapse next time around," Kono reportedly told Watanabe. Watanabe and Kono agreed to continue their talks and to hold another round as early as Saturday, Mori said.
