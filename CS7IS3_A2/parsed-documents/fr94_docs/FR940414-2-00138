FR940414-2-00138 FR940414-2-00084 Changes to Section II Section II includes the standards for cancellation of claims resulting from breaches of Temporary Importation Bonds (TIBs). Under current guidelines, if merchandise is exported or destroyed but not within the bond period, or if it was exported but not under Customs supervision (if required), or if it was timely exported or destroyed but Customs was not notified (See C.S.D. 91&hyph;19 for timeliness of notification requirements) so as to cancel the bond, the guidelines call for cancelling the claim for liquidated damages upon payment of an amount between 1 and 5 percent of the ``bond amount'' but not less than $100. This language has caused some confusion, insofar as the bond amount is often the full amount of a term bond. The bond amount can far exceed and double the duty or 110 percent of the duty claim that might arise because of a breach. Accordingly, Customs is amending this guideline by replacing the phrase ``bond amount'' with the term ``the claim.'' Customs has determined that less culpability exists in those cases where the merchandise is exported or destroyed in a timely fashion and the required proof is filed untimely as opposed to those instances where the merchandise is exported or destroyed outside the bond period. Therefore, the former claims will continue to be cancelled upon payment of an amount between 1 and 5 percent of the claim for liquidated damages (usually double or 110 percent of the duties), but in the latter instances (exportation or destruction outside the bond period), the claims will be cancelled upon payment of an amount between 5 and 10 percent of the claim, but not less than $200. Under current guidelines, relief is granted to one times the duty on merchandise which is sold but later exported. This does not take into account whether merchandise is exported within or outside of the bond period. Customs is amending the guidelines to grant relief to one times the duty on merchandise which is sold but later exported within the bond period. For merchandise which is sold but later exported outside the bond period, the claim for liquidated damages will be cancelled upon payment of an amount equal to one and one-half times the duty. No relief shall be granted in these cases involving liquidated damages of 110 percent of the duties. Under current policy, when Customs wishes to supervise the exportation or destruction of TIB merchandise, the entry is designated at the time of presentation for Customs supervision of exportation or destruction. If the importer fails to obtain Customs supervision of exportation or destruction, despite the specific designation by Customs, he receives the same mitigation as the importer who receives the requisite supervision but does so outside the bond period. Customs is of the view that, inasmuch as supervision of exportation or destruction is required so infrequently, the TIB importer who fails to obtain such supervision should receive less generous mitigation. Accordingly, the guidelines are amended to take an amount between ten and twenty-five percent of the claim amount, but not less than $500, when supervision is required but not obtained. TIBs are sometimes taken on goods that are otherwise duty-free. Under the provisions of ยง10.31(f) of the Customs Regulations (19 CR 10.31(f)), the district director is empowered to require a bond amount necessary to protect the revenue. In those instances where a breach occurs regarding otherwise duty-free merchandise, Customs should follow the appropriate guideline based on the circumstances surrounding the breach, but in no case should Customs cancel the claim upon payment of an amount less than two times the applicable merchandise processing fee or $100, whichever is greater. Changes to Section III Section III includes bond cancellation standards for claims which arise from violation of a custodial bond maintained by a bonded carrier. With the proliferation of overnight courier services, the volume of violations involving misdelivery of in-bond merchandise has risen. These result in violations of 19 CFR 18.8 and the assessment of claims for liquidated damages. In many instances, informal entries are filed on the misdelivered merchandise. The claims for liquidated damages are generally cancelled upon payment of $100, an amount that often exceeds the value of the misdelivered merchandise. Accordingly, Section III of the Customs Bond Cancellation Standards is amended to provide for cancellation upon payment of an amount between $50 and $1,000 of any claim for which entry is made and duties, fees and taxes are paid via the informal entry process.
