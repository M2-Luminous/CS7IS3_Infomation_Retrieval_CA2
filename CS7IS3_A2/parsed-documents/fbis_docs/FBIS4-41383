Before his departure, answering a journalist's question, our country's leader said: [Begin Karimov recording] After achieving our independence and sovereignty, small but noticeable changes are taking place in our policy and life and also in international and interstate ties and in politics. From this point of view we are establishing contacts with many countries including the small, the powerful, and the large, but we will be looking at how these countries see us, how close they are to us, how close their people are to us. From this point of view Turkey is very close to us. [words indistinct] The people of Turkey, the Turkic peoples are very close to us. Their language and their heart but primarily their religion and their destiny are very close to us. [words indistinct] Our relations with the Turkish leaders, public, and entrepreneurs are not bad and are currently developing well. For example, there are more than 100 joint enterprises and organizations [in Uzbekistan]. We must, however, be frank that there are forces who want to damage these ties, these close and friendly relations and it would be wrong to ignore these. For this reason such forces must be controlled and we must look at our relations with this close and strategically [word indistinct] state on the basis of a long sighted policy. Raising economic and political ties with this state to a new level is the reason for our current visit. From this point of view I believe that Turkey looks at us with the same wish and hope and I think that this visit will raise our relations with Turkey to a new level -- primarily it will be in the interest of Uzbekistan and the people of Uzbekistan.
