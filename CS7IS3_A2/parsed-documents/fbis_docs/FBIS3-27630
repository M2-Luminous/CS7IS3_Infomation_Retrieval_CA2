The plea, he said, was made at a recent national meeting on SEZs in Zhuhai attended by central government officials. "There are some powers that we believe should be delegated to the SEZs.... Power over the vetting of some projects should belong to the zones. Now the vetting process is too complicated," he said. "These powers have been recentralised during the economic rectification and much (of the sharing of power between central government and the SEZs) has yet to smooth out. In order to allow the SEZs to go one step ahead in reform, these powers and conditions should return to the zones," he added. According to the mayor the SEZs should have the authority to approve most investment projects and investors should be spared the trouble of applying to Beijing for their investment. Meanwhile, Mr Liang confirmed that Zhuhai has for the time being shelved its plan to build the Lingdingyang Bridge linking Zhuhai with Hong Kong. But he said the SEZ, which borders Macao, has already started the construction of the Qiao and Lingdingyang sections. He said these sections were necessary to the development of the island resources of Zhuhai. The project has been delayed partly because of a shortage of funds and queries by Beijing over the technicalities of the project. Mr Liang said Beijing had asked Zhuhai to conduct more feasibility research and at one point suggested Zhuhai consider the option of building a tunnel instead of a bridge. "But we have restudied the idea and still believe that the bridge is a better option." Tunnels, he said, were more vulnerable to disasters such as earthquakes and they cost more. According to Mr Liang, at least eight consortiums had expressed interest in the bridge project and negotiations were under way. While he said the Government would guarantee investors a reasonable return, Zhuhai would not lease out the islands to those who invested in building the bridges.
