Guan Guangfu arrived in Xiangfan on 18 March. During his six-day stay, he went down to a dozen or so factories and rural areas in Suizhou, Zhouyang, Xiangyang, and Yicheng. He talked with the broad cadres and masses to find out about the actual conditions, heard their opinions and requirements, and discussed with them the major plan for accelerating reform and development. Last year, Xiangfan's economic growth rate and returns were higher than the average level in the country and the province, and fulfilled the Eighth Five-Year Plan two years ahead of schedule. This year, Xiangfan has set itself a new target of high-rate growth. Encouraged by the strategic decision of the provincial party committee on building Xiangfan into a large city, people of the whole city are in high spirits, and are striving to catch up with and overtake one another. Since the beginning of this year, the city's economy has maintained a strong momentum of development. Through several days of investigation, Guan Guangfu conducted a discussion meeting with Xiangfan city and county leading cadres. He said: What left the deepest impression on me along the way is a precious state of mind. People have emancipated their minds; they are bold in exploration; they have united as one, from the top to the grass roots; they are going all-out, with the focus on accelerating reform, opening up, and modernization. That the city set itelf the goal of learning from Suzhou, catching up with Xingzhou, aiming high, and creating first-rate results, is an expression of voluntarily assigning tasks and putting pressure on itself, which embodies the high criteria and strict requirements set by Xiangfan's communists on themselves. Guan Guangfu said that without the presence of a few pillars, it would be out of the question for the province to maintain the momentum of a high growth rate. Xiangfan should continue to play an exemplary role in Hubei, and make concrete the measures for achieving the targets this year. He said that today, when the market competition is extraordinarily intense, the gap in the levels of economic development is actually widening between some places. However, we must see that this widening is relative when all places are developing simultaneously. Besides, we should see that some models typical of developing by leaps and bounds have surfaced. Such development by leaps and bounds embodies the degree to which enterprises are linking themselves to the market, minds are being emancipated, and work is being carried out. It is a newborn thing and a fresh experience under the conditions of the socialist market economy, and it represents the orientation of development. Such models typical of developing by leaps and bounds can be found in various places. They should be studied and perceived earnestly, and the law governing such leaps should be explored and used to educate our cadres, complete and perfect our train of thought, and spur us on to pursue high-rate growth. On accelerating rural development, Guan Guangfu reiterated the need to increase the weight of industrial development in the wake of readjusting the ratio between industry and agriculture on the basis of stabilizing agriculture. In the wake of readjusting the ratio between grain, cotton and edible oil, and diversified management on the basis of stabilizing the output of grain, cotton and edible oil, the weight of diversified management should be increased. That is the inevitable and only way to make the county, village, and people rich. In the wake of the provincial party committee making the decision on building several large cities in Hubei, Xiangfan has regarded this as a very good chance to enhance a city's comprehensive ability and develop its staying power. Xiangfan was ahead of others in perceiving this point and was quick to take action. Guan Guangfu was very happy about this. He said: The provincial party committee's decision was an important strategic one to insure Hubei's sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development [jing ji ci xu kuai su jiang kang fa zhan], it was also the pressing need of Xiangfan in its continuous development. In building a modern city system, it is necessary to grasp two points: First, the building of large cities, and second, paying attention to building of small towns. Only by grasping these two points -- while bringing along the middle section -- both industry and agriculture, both urban and rural areas will be taken care of. Guan Guangfu indicated that at present, various places have met difficulties to various degrees, which should be resolved through reform, development, and stabilization, and with the understanding and support of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The greater the enthusiasm the masses show, the more their efforts are prized. Party and government leading comrades at all levels should go deep into realities, carry out investigation and study, conduct organization with care, work in a down-to-earth way, and do a good job in resolving practical problems. Accompanying Guan Guangfu in the investigation and study were Deng Guozheng, member of the provincial party committee standing committee, and Yang Binxin, secretary of the Xiangfan party committee.
