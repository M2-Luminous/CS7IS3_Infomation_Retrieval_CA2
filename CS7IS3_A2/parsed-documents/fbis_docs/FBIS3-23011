"To free the Chinese, the three Yemeni kidnappers want the government to cancel death sentences pronounced against them in absentia," early in January, second secretary at the embassy Luo Xiao Guang [as received] told AFP. The kidnappers are wanted for several murders, Yemeni sources said Monday. "No progress was made by the authorities in their talks with the kidnappers," he said. One of the hostages is chief engineer Yanj Yi [as received], 55, according to the diplomat, who did not name the two others. The hostages are held by members of the Khawlan tribe in Hajana region, 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Sanaa, he added. To win their release, the embassy is in contact with the Ministries of Interior and Planning, and with influential Khalwan tribesmen as well, he said. The engineers were kidnapped Saturday while working on a road project financed by China to link Hajana and Ma'rib, 173 kilometers (100 miles) east of the capital, in the rugged and tribal northeast. The kidnappers also said they wanted the road construction to stop but they did not explain why, the Chinese diplomat said. Almost one-third of the road has already been built, he added.
