We have discovered that the principal enemy of the country is the current political power itself. We consider ourselves entitled to fight, using all legal and democratic means, to salvage our nation. To that end the Democratic Convention of Romania proposes a number of simple and efficient measures: 1. A severe and righteous justice should put an end to plundering and corruption and punish all those who have become rich in unlawful ways. 2. Local authorities should be granted the resources and legal framework needed to administer our everyday life successfully. At least 18 percent of the taxes we pay should be allocated directly to local administration bodies so they can use the money in the interest and under the control of the citizens. 3. The villagers' farms should be strengthened by granting them inexpensive loans to buy seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural machines. By such measures the well-being of both the farmers and the country is ensured. Agricultural taxes should be immediately discontinued, while the handing out of land ownership certificates should be ended within six months, the land property bill should be improved, and abuse and injustice eliminated. 4. Jobs should be ensured by making investments and by privatization. Taxes should be reduced to stimulate private business. There is an absolute need for political credibility and a simple and flexible legal framework to encourage investments. 5. The youth of this country should find their place in society, which should ensure them living quarters and access to jobs. The current parliament session should urgently pass the education bill in accordance with the recommendations of the Council of Europe and ensure funds at least three time larger than the current funds for that domain, so that we can reach the level attained in neighboring countries. 6. Real protection of the unemployed and the socially disadvantaged should be ensured. 7. Budget resources should be ensured for health and culture so as to salvage the biological and spiritual being of our nation. 8. The defense of the country should be strengthened by ensuring the dignity, training, and equipment of the armed forces, integrating them within Euro-Atlantic structures and halting the drift toward other spheres of influence. All the aforementioned measures are at hand; by implementing them Romania could be salvaged from poverty and despair. Romania must be saved NOW! [capitalization as published]
