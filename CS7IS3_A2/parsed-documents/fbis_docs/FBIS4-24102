We received that information this morning from Maximo Dias, secretary general of the Mozambican Nationalist Movement. He was in the area while traveling to Bilene, Gaza Province. [Begin recording] [Dias] Feelings are running high. People are very nervous. A senior army officer who arrived there at 2100 was dragged by the soldiers who detained him. His vehicle was impounded and the driver assaulted. The situation is serious and the residents are traumatized. A solution ought to be found at once. It appears that the situation can be resolved easily. [Unidentified correspondent] What are the troops demanding? [Dias] They want to meet senior officers to discuss their immediate demobilization. They have also asked for the UN Operations in Mozambique [Unomoz] to intervene, but I told them Unomoz had no jurisdiction over the matter. I said the matter can be dealt with by our armed forces. We have a defense minister and the commander in chief who is the president of the Republic. I would like to urge them to take immediate action so that the residents are not subject to this type of behavior. Whenever salaries are not paid, troops barricade roads and begin shooting. Though nervous, the soldiers said they did not want to harass travelers. They have harmed no one. They merely want to go back home. They have families to support. They noted that their pay, food, and shelter are not adequate. [end recording] A Defense Ministry source says measures have been taken to resolve the matter. The source declined to elaborate, alleging that it was a military matter. [passage omitted]
