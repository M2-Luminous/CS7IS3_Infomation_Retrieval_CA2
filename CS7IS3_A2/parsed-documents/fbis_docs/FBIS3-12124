On 4 and 5 April, the Andean delegates will hold a commission meeting in Caracas to debate the Peruvian situation and its tariff proposal. The commission is the top Andean Group body. The proposal will be made by Minister of Industry, Tourism, Commerce, and Integration Liliana Canale. This situation began in August 1992 when Peru asked its Andean partners Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela to cancel its obligations regarding the liberalization program and the minimum external tariff until 31 December 1993. On that date, the deadline for Peru to fully reassume its obligations was moved to 30 April 1994. Peru has engaged in commercial deals with its Andean partners since August 1992 through bilateral agreements, which also will expire on 30 April. The Peruvian Government currently is operating with two types of tariffs, 25 and 15 percent, though the latter is more widely used -- it applies to 99.5 percent of Peruvian imports. Peruvian entrepreneurs, who are rather distrustful of the tariff issue, demand a return to the Andean Group, but respecting the Barahona document in which four tariffs were proposed. The tariffs are 5, 10, 15, and 20 percent, but they are not being enforced yet because tariffs have not been established yet for a group of Andean products. The entrepreneurs claim that setting a single 15 percent tariff will harm several enterprises because the importation of products for production of goods for Peruvians will pay a 15 percent tariff, while the other Andean countries will pay only 5 percent for the same products. In the face of this criticism, the government believes it cannot change its policy just to favor some sectors. The Industry Ministry stated that, contrary to what industrialists have claimed, the Andean market is not vital to Peru because it accounts for only 8.7 percent of Peruvian exports, while the European Union (EU) accounts for 30 percent, the United States for 20 percent, other Latin American countries for 10 percent, and Japan for the same percentage as the entire Andean Group. Consequently, the Andean nations will concentrate their attention on the Peruvian proposal on 4 April and on the way in which the proposal will be considered and processed by Andean Group members.
