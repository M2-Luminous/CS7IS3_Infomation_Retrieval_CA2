The company is a joint venture established by about 150 commercial banks and finance firms to liquidate bad loans. The ministry also urged financial institutions to consider transferring claims for which they have agreed to reduce or exempt interest payments to affiliates. The guidance will be incorporated in a comprehensive package of pump-priming measures to be announced by the government in the near future, the officials said.
