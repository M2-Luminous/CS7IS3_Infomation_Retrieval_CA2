Do you agree? [Andrianopoulos] The Greek Government struggled for two years to prevent countries, particularly European countries, from recognizing Skopje. The Pasok [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] government is now saying that Greece will never recognize a country with the name "Macedonia!" But was there ever such an issue? The government is simply recognizing its weakness and making--hypocritically and cowardly--a 180-degree turn. The essence is that Skopje is not a bilateral issue--at least not politically. It directly concerns Europe and its plans to solve the Bosnian problem. It would be a tragic mistake to ignore this reality. Counterattack [Dhelatollas] The New Democracy chairman said Skopje must return to the EC framework. Should we assume that you have changed your policy, because a while ago you were speaking about the UN procedure? [Andrianopoulos] Abandoning the UN procedure meant that Greece abandoned Europe, because it was its initiative to mediate and avert "Macedonia's" automatic accession to the United Nations and its broad recognition. Bringing the issue back to Europe means a return to the United Nations. But why do we speak around and not on the issue? The truth is that following recent government moves, Greece appears to be losing the battle on Skopje. International relations show that you must not see every impasse and problem as a threat but look at it as a new opportunity. Maybe this is an opportunity to abandon our incomprehensible nationalism on defense, a stance that is unacceptable for our dignity and is also unacceptable internationally, and adopt a more aggressive stance. We intend to live peacefully with this republic but we must make it clear to friends and enemies, Skopjeans and others, that if the tiny neighboring state provokes Greece at all, we will adopt a coordinated policy of questioning its territorial integrity, considering it part of Greek Macedonia. Instead of being concerned that it may have plans against us, we must force everyone to come to us to persuade us not to promote extreme and dangerous pursuits. The message of a strong and dignified country will then be received. I do not see why we should be the ones to be concerned about them and ask others to pressure them to remove their provocation. Why shouldn't they be the ones to be concerned about us? We are a country that does not beg. We are a country that demands. [passage omitted]
