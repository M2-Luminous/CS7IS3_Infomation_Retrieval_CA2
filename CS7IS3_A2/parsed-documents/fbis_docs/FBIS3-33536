This was stated by Tyll Necker, president of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), on Friday during a German-Mexican entrepreneurs' meeting before the Technogerma industrial fair, which will begin in Mexico City on Monday. In the competition of international investment locations, the country benefits from its geographical situation and its membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was established with the United States and Canada on 1 January 1994, he said. Necker and FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of Germany) stressed the successes of Mexico's economic policy in combating inflation, consolidating the budget, and modernizing the economy. Technogerma is to put the attractiveness of Mexico as a business location in its true light, said Rexrodt, who had arrived in Mexico, the third leg of his trip to America, on Thursday. However, in view of the enormous trade balance deficit, Necker and Rexrodt called on Mexican entrepreneurs to pay more attention to the European and the German market. In 1992, German exports were valued at $2.8 billion (about 4.6 billion German marks), while imports from Mexico only amounted to $600 million. Mexican Commerce and Industry Minister Jaime Serra Puche stressed that the establishment of NAFTA does not disadvantage investors from third countries. On account of NAFTA and Mexico's various agreements with other Latin American countries, whoever produces in Mexico has access to the markets of more countries than anywhere else in America, he said.
