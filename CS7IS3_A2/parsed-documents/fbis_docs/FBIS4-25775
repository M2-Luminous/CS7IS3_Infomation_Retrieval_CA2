The DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam faxed his country's notice of leaving the IAEA to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, a senior U.S. official said. Under the IAEA statute, states may withdraw from the IAEA by actually notifying the United States Government, because the U.S. Government is the depository state for instruments of IAEA membership. The senior U.S. official said Kim told Christopher that would leave international inspectors with nothing to do in the DPRK. The official commented that the U.S. administration would have to do something about it and take an accelerated approach to sanctions against the DPRK.
