In order to do so however, the minister emphasized that Poland must take up a more active economic policy. "We are a few months, if not a few years, late in renewing ties with the East," said the minister Tuesday. He stressed that one of the major problems lies in the lack of insurance of transactions and trade contacts with the states of the former USSR. Podkanski further informed the conference that a draft law on insurance of transactions against political risk has already been prepared. However, the issue of mutual indebtedness of Poland and Russia still remains unsettled and there is no efficient system of settlements, he said. According to Podkanski Poland is behind the Czech Republic and Hungary in renewing its economic ties with the former communist states. "Poland's policy must be more aggressive," he argued stating that Poland's turnover with these countries last year amounted to 5 billion U.S. dollars. The minister further declared that the strategic aims and assumptions of Poland's eastern economic policy centre above all on Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and, next on the Baltic states. According to chairman of the world trade and finance centre for the East Jaroslaw Mulewicz any programme of economic cooperation with Russia should embrace several decades since the process of reforms cannot be expected to be completed earlier. Mulewicz also pointed to the threat of "Russification" of the Polish economy, namely of adopting bad examples of the Russian economy. In order to avoid this it is necessary to create a clear system of competition, he said. In his opinion the West's policy of concessions towards Russia is wrong. He stressed that part of the assistsnce funds allocated to Russia are being deposited on private bank accounts. Participants in the conference also familiarized themselves with the assumptions of the partnership for development programme conceived as a complementary programme to the Partnership for Peace plan. The programme designed to support economic cooperation, restructuring processes and adjustment to Western structures would cover the countries of the Central European Free Trade Zone (CEFTA) and other Central European states as well as the Commonwealth of Independent States. The CEFTA states would play the role of a bridge between the East and the West, it was stressed. The conference also discussed on Tuesday the question of Polish community in Kazakhstan. According to chairman of the Polish community association Andrzej Stelmachowski Poland should prepare a long-range plan for repatriation of Poles from Kazakhstan. In the opinion of the Polish Foreign Ministry the decision on the issue of repatriation should be taken by the government. Marek Nowakowski of the government foundation of assistance to Poles living in the East argued that it was necessary to create not a plan of repatriation but rather a programme of education and scholarships for Poles from Kazakhstan. According to the Foreign Ministry's data some 70,000 Poles living in Kazakhstan (70 per cent) want to return to Poland.
