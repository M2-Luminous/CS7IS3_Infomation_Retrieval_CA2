AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''). ACTION: Notice of application for exemption under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Act'').

RELEVANT ACT SECTIONS: Exemption requested under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder. SUMMARY OF APPLICATION: Applicants request an order that would amend a prior order that permitted the Trust to impose a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') on certain redemptions of Trust shares.

Since the order was granted, Shearson's assets were sold to Primerica Corporation and its subsidiary Smith Barney Shearson, and Smith Barney Shearson became the sponsor and underwriter of the Trust.
