According to these reliable military sources, there are nearly 50,000 soldiers in Tuzla at the moment, with new forces coming every day from the former Croat-Muslim front and from abroad. It is known for sure, one is told in Bijeljina today, that Zagreb airport and the Split port are the main points for disembarking arms, military equipment, and volunteers from Muslim countries who are then, it is claimed, immediately sent to Tuzla, regardless of the complaints by Croats from some Croatian cantons. According to what is said in the east Bosnian corps press center today, artillery pieces and ammunition has been disembarked from three ships in the Split port last week and seven NATO cargo aircraft landed on Zagreb airport. The disembarkation was closely followed by the regular Army of the Republic of Croatia and representatives of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Convoys that included UNPROFOR vehicles immediately set off toward Tuzla. Apart from this sea port and airport, the Tuzla Dubrave airport has also been used for deliveries of military equipment recently, despite constant protests by the Serbian side that the airport should exclusively be used for humanitarian purposes and with Serbian representatives being present. However, all the demands made so far have simply been ignored by the international forces who are often using this facility for provocative purposes. According to the announcement the east Bosnian corps of the army of the republic of Srpska issued today, all this that has recently been happening in the Tuzla region shows that peace is still far away in these territories and that the situation on the Majevica and Brcko battlefields has been nearing the boiling point.
