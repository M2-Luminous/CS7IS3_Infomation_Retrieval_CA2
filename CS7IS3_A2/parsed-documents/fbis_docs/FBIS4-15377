Cherniy, special for AKTSENT: "Laxatives for Ukraine"] [Text] The Ukraine Law "On Making Changes and Addition To the Ukraine Law `On Liens,'" signed by President of Ukraine L. Kravchuk on 25 February, went into effect last week. Now the Ukrainian lien law allows a foreign investor, in the event of debtor's delinquency or insolvency, to be compensated by real estate. At the same time, the latest wording of this law dispelled the last doubt regarding the supreme executive authorities' plans for state property and the course of privatization in Dnepropetrovsk, Zaporozhye, Lugansk, and Donetsk Oblasts, whose administrations now have the right to decide on the fate of mortgage deals. Let us recall: "A state enterprise (as a rule, already beached--author's note), to which property is attached with right of full economic maintenance, may on its own mortgage this property, with the exception of an integrated property complex, its structural units, buildings, and structures, which may be mortgaged with permission and on terms approved by the body authorized to administer corresponding state property." It this good or bad? It is so good that it frightens me. It is good because despite completely unfounded resistance on the part of the parliament, President L. Kravchuk did find a way to attract large investors to Ukraine. After all, in the sphere of investment activities Ukraine is hopelessly behind not only Russia, but also Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and other newly independent states. It may happen that a few years from now Ukraine will be studying the phenomenon of growth of, for instance, Kazakhstan, in whose economy about $17 billion in investment will be attracted this year alone. Meanwhile, in the opinion of Aleksandr Savchenko, executive director of a department in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, large Western investors are kept away from Ukraine by inconsistencies in its foreign policy, domestic political crisis, and the lack of political will in conducting economic reforms. That is why at this point Ukraine is getting either insignificant investment in quick-return projects (airports, terminals, oil pipelines, hotels, etc.), or large investment in which the creditor dictates everything and bureaucrats take their share in commissions. One does not have to look far to find examples. The Ministry of Health has been buying laxatives of the "purgen" type in quantities sufficient to provide relief for the whole of Europe for a year. While the Ministry of Agriculture and Food during L. Kravchuk's visit to Washington bought with seven-year interest-free credit 70,000 tonnes of soy at a price exceeding the average by $40-50 per tonne. One should not look a gift horse in the mouth. Especially considering that if anyone does become constipated, it is bureaucrats on foreign junkets--not ordinary folk who are undernourished most of the time these days. In short, the birth of the lien law in Ukraine is, on one hand, a joyous event. One the other, it is scary because, judging by the effectiveness of state regulation, we cannot expect fast changes in industry, which means we will have to play a handicapped hand against foreign capital. But this is not all bad, either: One can avoid compliance even with the president of Ukraine's edict, but there is no way to dodge the commonly accepted rules of the market game, which the leadership of our state fears so much.
