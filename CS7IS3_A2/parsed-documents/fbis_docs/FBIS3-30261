Bretislav Gregr, director of the License Administration at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, said that there are exceptional instances of trade, about which it is not appropriate to inform. "They are concealed from a third country," he said. He refused to provide any more detail. Bretislav Gregr stated that, last year, the Czech Republic exported arms to 52 countries of the world. The value of the exported military material is close to $167 million, which is $17 million more than in 1992. The greatest interest abroad is in aviation technology, the main buyer of which is Egypt, and in handguns, which are exported mostly to Turkey. Although the largest shipments of military material go particularly to African and Arab countries and Southeast Asian states, the Czech Republic has most arms trade business partners in Europe. Arms Imports remain low because the Defense and Interior Ministries do not have funds sufficient for armament. Last year, the Czech Republic imported arms and parts for military technology from a total of 12 countries of the world. There was, for instance, a shipment of special components for aviation technology from the Bahamas. Last year, the Czech Republic did not export any heavy technology, like tanks, armored carriers, or artillery systems. Nor was a single Tamara radiolocator exported, which has a good name abroad. On the other hand, Kuwait has bought a greater quantity of the universal plastic explosive Semtex, which is used there to eliminate the consequences of the Persian Gulf war. Great Britain obtained a small quantity of Semtex, as did several other states that are testing Semtex features to be more successful in the struggle against terrorists who use this explosive.
