Everyone has already become used to gatherings of UNSO members. Nevertheless, compared to other activities of Korchynskyy and company, the meeting was unusual. First of all, the most meritorious participants of the battles in Caucasus received official awards from Georgia. Secondly, the meeting at the Cinema House was held following a two-day congress of Slavic national patriotic organizations, which had been held at the Moscow Hotel at the initiative of UNA and UNSO. Journalists who arrived on Saturday morning to admire Dmytro Korchynskyy and his followers were met by a cordon of militia officers: Law enforcement authorities had received an anonymous tip that a bomb had been planted in the Cinema House. Although they conducted a thorough search, no bomb was found. There were plenty of versions as to the reasons behind this threat: Somebody insisted that this was a communist provocation; others claimed that UNA members prepared the show to attract more attention to their organization. Events that took place inside the building, when it was already clear that there was no danger of the grand assembly blowing up, also resembled a well-directed performance. The main goal of the meeting was to confirm the participants of their strength, and to impress those observing the meeting. Should one be scared of UNA and UNSO? Is it true that these two organizations (in fact the political and military subunits of one organization) represent serious power? I do not intend to assess the real importance or threat represented by Shukhevych's and Korchynskyy's organization, however, only a blind man would not notice its growing influence. The words voiced at the meeting may provoke a reflection of how the organization's image was enhanced. "All other political organizations are losing members. Only we are growing stronger... The policy endorsed by the president and the government leads a manager of commercial bank, a miner, and a UNSO gunner to the same trench, and pretty soon they will be shooting in one direction." Although these two statements by Dmytro Korchynskyy had previously been delivered on two different occasions, their author took the risk of combining them, to demonstrate the principle of propagandist-psychological activities of UNA ideologists. The principle is as simple as mumbling, and it could be brilliantly carried into effect by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, the greatest populist of our times: The people should hear what they want to hear. The thesis about "fulfilling the reform movement with real sense" or "the weighed centrist-reform policy" would be met by the people with less understanding than simple postulates of UNSO: For the people -- a strong state; for the hungry -- a hunk of bread; for the traitor -- the gallows. This rings a bell, doesn't it? The UNA and UNSO slogans, as well as the election promises of Vladimir Volfovich [Zhirinovskiy], can be heard on bread lines and in smoking rooms. Liberal reasoning and discussions on serious matters are prohibited there -- the more straight-forward the statement, the better it is received. An illustrative example of UNSO's logic was presented by one of its members: "Earlier, our country resembled a zone where `legitimate crooks' were in power, now, it resembles a zone where bitches who violated the crooked law are in power. I do not want to be ruled by bitches, I am not a swine." Could you tell me who would admit being a swine? After such words, Korchynskyy's statement that "only UNA member live properly, the rest do not live at all" does not sound shocking. The attractiveness of the Ukrainian Nazi lies in the fact that they have chosen those in power as their enemies, which is very appealing to the common man. Here are those guilty of all the misfortunes -- a bunch of thugs who are stealing away our state and teaching others how to do the same. It would not be so bad if UNA ideologists only exploited the centuries-old desire of the people to seek "extremes," but unfortunately such "extremes" occur pretty often, demonstrating political inertia and corrupting the people. Therefore, Korchynskyy's words about a miner and a UNSO member in the same trench are not simply bravado. The guidelines of populist policy also provide for the necessary existence of myth. The inventive boys from UNA have constantly been refreshing the myth of their power and popularity, since the establishment of their organization. According to Korchynskyy, the Agro detachment that fought in Abkhazia is the best organized military unit. Following the same logic, UNA and UNSO are the best organized political forces in our country. The reasoning is very simple: UNA is the only organization which possesses experience in conducting politics in the situation of complete destabilization, meaning Cisdnestr and Abkhazia. According to UNSO theory, the time of talkative politicians has gone, and a time of "commanders with combat experience" is coming, since only such politicians are able to avert complete disaster, during a period when the people's wrath reaches its apogee, and one must save enemies of the people from that wrath as well as the country from complete ruin and possible occupation. The myth of an apparently existing external threat is yet another example of UNSO's tricks. To root the myth in people's consciousness, and to simultaneously obtain certain support in case UNSO is banned (the 11 November legislation on illegal paramilitary organizations was predominantly aimed at UNSO), Korchynskyy, Luponis, Kovalenko and their comrades organized the congress at the Moscow Hotel. The idea of a united Slavic territory, which was discussed by national-Slavs from Ukraine, Russia, Belarus, and Poland, can hardly be carried into effect. The discrepancies between, for example, Ukraine's Party of Slavic Unity and the Russian People's Social Party or the Belarusian Slavic Union Belaya Rus, are too significant. Nevertheless, the idea of Slavic unity developed by organizations with ultranationalistic image, will undoubtedly attract more followers. Probably, this was the main goal of the congress. The only thing that could scare an average citizen, on whom the UNSO Goebbels count, is open fascism. "Today is that rare day when UNSO does not have to storm anything or beat anybody... Of course, we could chase them all into a corner, but we will soon need some scapegoats... The poor German neo-Nazis look toward Ukraine in hope that maybe salvation will come from there. It will surely come..." These words were delivered by one UNSO leader during the congress. They fall in line with the frantic hail of "Death for enemies!" and the stretched-out and raised right arms. Even the uniforms of certain UNSO members resembled those of Schtrasser and Rem [SS officers]. The brown color seen between the red and black colors of UNSO may either attract or scare someone, as once the possibility to play a real war attracted some UNSO members. By the way, the Nazis were not always the most massive and influential force in Germany. In the beginning, their ideas shocked the people's consciousness, but soon all of Germany hailed the swastika. Western historians have been trying to explain the phenomenon of Hitler. Today, Russian politicians are trying to understand the phenomenon of Zhirinovskiy. Seven people who wanted to play war in Caucasus will never come home. No orders, no assurances that "henceforth our organization will be like one family" will return those sons to their crying mothers and Ukraine, the interests of which, as the UNSO leadership assures, were defended by the gunmen in the Caucasus.
