FR940104-0-00026 FR940104-0-00005 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 625 [Docket No. 921230&hyph;3020; I.D 122793C] Summer Flounder Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notification of commercial quota transfer and commercial quota availability. SUMMARY: NMFS issues this notification to announce that 10,000 pounds (4,536 kg) of summer flounder commercial quota available to the State of North Carolina has been transferred to the State of Rhode Island. This transfer adjusts the commercial quota for the State of North Carolina to 3,121,750 pounds (1,416,016 kg) and adjusts the Rhode Island quota to 1,946,851 pounds (883,086 kg). As a result of this transfer, NMFS announces that vessels issued a Federal fisheries permit for the summer flounder fishery may resume landing summer flounder in the State of Rhode Island until further notice. EFFECTIVE DATES: December 28, 1993 through December 31, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Hannah Goodale, Fishery Policy Analyst, 508&hyph;281&hyph;9101. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Summer Flounder Fishery (FMP) are found at 50 CFR part 625 (December 4, 1992, 57 FR 57358). The regulations require an annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the coastal states from North Carolina through Maine. The process to set the annual commercial quota and the percent allocated to each state are described in ยง625.20. The commercial quota for summer flounder for the 1993 calendar year is set equal to 12.35 million pounds (5.6 million kg) (January 22, 1993, 58 FR 5658). The percent allocated to each state was adjusted by Amendment 4 to the FMP (September 24, 1993, 58 FR 49937) with 15.68298 percent or 1,936,851 pounds (878,550 kg) allocated to Rhode Island, and 27.44584 percent, or 3,389,565 pounds (1,537,497 kg) allocated to North Carolina. An emergency interim rule published August 26, 1993, (58 FR 45075), and extended on November 29, 1993 (58 FR 62556), allows two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS, (Regional Director), to transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota. The Regional Director is required to consider the criteria set forth in ยง625.20 in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations.
