The recent statements by President Clinton and Christopher on the cordial relations between Jordan and Washington and the siege of al-'Aqabah show that the U.S. Administration understands, or almost understands, the great damage inflicted by the embargo on Jordan's economy and trade. Furthermore, there is remarkable U.S. interest in activating the peace process and ending the crises on all tracks. We hope the U.S. secretary will bring something new regarding the U.S. stand vis-a-vis the siege imposed on Jordan. The lifting of the siege would rejuvenate Jordanian enthusiasm on role its in the peace process, particularly if Israel agrees to discuss all unresolved issues, such as water, borders, refugees, and Jerusalem. The important thing is to see the U.S. Administration end its bias toward Israel and work to force Israel to hold negotiations based on withdrawal from all occupied Arab territory in accordance with Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425 and the land for peace formula. The success of the Husayn-Christopher meeting in London today will be an important indicator of U.S. interest in activating the peace process and rendering it a success on all tracks. During his meeting with the U.S. secretary today, King Husayn will speak in the name of all cordon states and will reiterate the principles of the Arab position with regard to the Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese tracks on the basis of the resolutions of international legitimacy. We hope Secretary Christopher will respond to this position.
