The amendments are expected to become law after clearing an upper house plenary session Friday. The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the amendments, which feature changes in the lower house's election system and revised regulations on corporate donations to political fund-raising organizations. Under the amendments, 300 seats will be allocated in single-seat constituencies and 200 by proportional representation based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units. Currently, lower house members are elected from multiseat constituencies. The original government package called for 274 single-seat districts and 226 seats allotted by proportional representation on a nationwide basis. The original package banned corporate donations to politicians and their fund-raising organizations, but the revised bills will allow firms to donate up to 500,000 yen per year during the next five years as a temporary provision. The original package was passed on January 29 at the extraordinary Diet session shortly after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and opposition Liberal Democratic Party president Yohei Kono had agreed that the amendments and date of enforcement would be discussed during the current ordinary session. Lower house elections based on the new political reform legislation can be held once a bill identifying the 300 single-seat constituencies clears the Diet.
