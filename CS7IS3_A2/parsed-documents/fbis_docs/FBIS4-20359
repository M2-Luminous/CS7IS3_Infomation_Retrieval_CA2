Compared to last year export prices have increased 250 yuan per ton because the state procurement price increased more than 10 fen, and domestic and international demand has increased. The forward price for April and May is 2300 yuan per ton. Because demand for red bean exports has increased, and output has declined in some areas due to natural disasters, the price has risen to 5400-5600 yuan per ton. The price of mung beans has remained stable, at present it is 2800 yuan per ton.
