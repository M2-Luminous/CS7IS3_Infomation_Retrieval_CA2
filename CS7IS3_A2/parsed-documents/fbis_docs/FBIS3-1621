This was the consensus of opinion of noted economists from Beijing, Shanghai and seven provinces along the Chang Jiang River who gathered in this capital of Anhui Province to study the position, role in economic development and strategic objective of the valley. The Chang Jiang River valley has a population of 450 million and its gross product accounts for 40 percent of the country's total. According to the economists, the central government should continuously bring into play the role of the coastal areas in economic development while focusing on building economic belts along the Chang Jiang River Valley, which has a dense population, rich natural resources, convenient transportation facilities and a vast potential market. The economists suggested that development of the Chang Jiang River valley should concentrate on Pudong, a newly-established economic zone that is expected to lead in the transformation of Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors, and then tap the advantages of localities so as to update the product mix.
