A very well-informed source told O FILELEVTHEROS last night: "There is now light at the end of the tunnel," adding that the beginning of proximity talks in Nicosia should be considered certain. But the source explained that the talks will most probably open the week after next, since Rauf Denktas will visit Ankara at the end of next week for talks with the Turkish Government. Lamb refrained from making any statement. He simply described the meeting as very good. He justified his refusal [to make a statement] by saying he would give a news conference at the Ledra Palace Hotel today for Greek Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot, and foreign correspondents. According to O FILELEVTHEROS' always-reliable information, Kliridhis made it clear that he would not attend the talks unless it was insured that all of the fenced-off town would be handed over so that 15,000 refugees could return. While he agreed that the return to the area north of Dhimokratia Avenue take place as a second stage, Kliridhis insisted on setting out a clear schedule for this area, saying that the issue should not remain open for an unspecified period in which it might be possible to cancel the residents' return. Concerning Turkish "fears" about security for the Famagusta port, President Kliridhis said he was ready to accept any UN measures that would neutralize these fears. At the same time, Kliridhis asked for safeguards that the area would soon be given to the United Nations (in about two months) and that effective measures would be taken against the infiltration of Turkish Cypriots or Turks and against thefts and other crimes, thus consolidating feelings of safety among those who will start working or settling in the area. The broader issue of safe accession to the area now surrounded by the occupation troops was also raised. It appears that Lamb gave initial assurances although the final arrangements will be made during the talks. [passage omitted]
