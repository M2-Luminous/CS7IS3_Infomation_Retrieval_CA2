In it he discussed the current situation in the country and the SNA's political role. Aidid, who delivered the speech in Nairobi, Kenya, sent warm greetings in which he expressed his confidence and great love for the Somali people. He congratulated them on the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, wished them a successful completion of Ramadan, and further wished them a blessed and prosperous [word indistinct]. Explaining his long absence from the country, Chairman Aidid said that this was due to the difficult situation facing the country. Giving a detailed explanation of the outcome of his talks in Nairobi, the chairman said his efforts were being directed towards: a) bringing the Somalis closer together so as to reach a lasting peace; b) forming a government of national unity, and; c) giving precise information to the world at large on the true situation prevailing in Somalia and on the SNA's program on ways of addressing the issues facing Somalia. On the SNA's contacts with various factions and their supporters, the chairman said: We have established a temporary base in Nairobi, Kenya because members of many Somali organizations are residing in Kenya. This will help us dispel the doubts and skepticism bred in Somalis by the civil war. The chairman added that, because during the past few years Somali communities had had no direct contacts, it was imperative that they engaged in consultations, talks, meetings, exchanges of ideas and detailed discussions, face to face. On the outcome of those steps, Chairman Aidid said: Somalis and organizations we met understood the need for brotherhood and understanding, and declared their readiness to strive to bring lasting peace to the country and to participate in the reconstruction of the Somali nation. He went on to say that the benefits derived from the meetings and understanding reached included consensus on the need to establish peace in every part of the country where hostilities prevail between the Somali communities. He added: We have agreed to ensure that confrontation and fighting in Kismaayo, Lower Jubba and its environs will cease in line with the peace that has been established in the central and northern regions of Somalia. Referring to the overall political scene, the SNA leader and chairman of the USC said that the SNA shared identical views with many individuals and political organizations on issues affecting the Somali people's interests. He said: This paves the way for the formation of a government of national unity. Mr. Aidid said he was delighted that during his stay in Nairobi with his delegation, a fifth peace-loving Somali faction, the Somali peace-loving union, SPLU [preceding word in English] had joined the SNA. He added that other factions had also applied to join the SNA. On the SNA's foreign policy, Chairman Aidid said that he and his delegation got the opportunity to visit several countries in eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, where they held fruitful meetings and exchanged views with their presidents. Mr. Aidid added: We also held talks with high level delegations from other countries, such as America, Russia, Italy, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda and Sudan. We also met delegations from donor countries and the OAU deputy secretary general, ambassadors and many diplomats, all of whom were interested in Somali affairs. He said: During our meeting with these delegations, we realized that the world now understands us and supports our stance that Somalia be left alone to decide its destiny. Mr. Aidid said that the world had realized that the aggression launched by the United States and UN Operation Somalia [UNOSOM] on the Somali people resulting in many being killed and a lot of public and private property destroyed was ill-advised. The chairman of the SNA and USC stated: The whole world has now agreed that the incorrect policy of UNOSOM must be completely changed. This had been stated in two resolutions passed by the UN Security Council on Somalia, 855 and 879. It had also been confirmed that the new organizations assigned to Somalia's reconstruction and rehabilitation would be completely independent of UNOSOM. The change could also be seen in the complete change and removal of those leaders of UNOSOM who were involved in the crisis that took place. The chairman of the SNA and USC said: In response to the UN's new policies, we recently held talks with the new UNOSOM leadership and agreed that Somalia is to be left alone to decide its own destiny, and for UNOSOM to help in this respect, with the UNOSOM forces being confined to safeguarding the humanitarian program and the safety of those working in relief activities. On the need to gain maximal benefits from the international relief program, the chairman said: It is imperative that we devote our total attention and join hands to ensure peace and the reconstruction of our country as we are now free to direct our affairs. He further added: We have a great responsibility in safeguarding the foreigners who have come from distant places -- for no other purpose other than to help us through the difficult situation facing our country. He added: It is worth noting that the international relief program has a time limit and limited resources. That is why it is imperative for the Somali people to facilitate the relief program, so that they can derive maximal benefits whether they are inside or outside the country. Aidid also said: We must ensure that the UNOSOM forces leaving our country are allowed to do so in total peace, and are left to leave our country honorably. In conclusion, the chairman of the SNA and USC greatly lauded the UNSC, the donor nations, the governments of the Horn of Africa and all those who gave a helping hand to change the policies of UNOSOM in Somalia and restore respect for UN on the part of the member states. The chairman also thanked the U.S. Administration and people, who courageously rectified their mistakes after fully realizing the true situation in Somalia. Chairman Aidid similarly thanked the Ethiopian Government, which made great efforts to bring about a change in the policy of UNOSOM on Somalia, as well as playing an important part in reconciling the SNA and the new leadership of UNOSOM. Concluding his speech, Chairman Aidid called for peace, justice, unity and progress.
