At the same time, the communists believe that the development of Russian-Chinese relations should be developed while taking into account interests of the Far East territories and the inviolability of existing borders. Thus, they fully support the Khabarovsk Kray administration's position and demand that the Russian Government renounce the 1991 border agreement as incompatible with existing realities and signed without coordination with Khabarovsk Kray. They further demand full and profound talks with China with the participation of kray representatives. Another announcement states that lately, some mass media have been actively commenting on the situation of DPRK loggers employed at logging camps in the Far East in accordance with an agreement signed by the Russian Federation and the DPRK. This coverage has especially intensified by several steps taken lately by South Korean authorities and aimed at examining the so-called human rights question. These acts go as far as the kidnapping of North Korean loggers from Russian Federation territory. The kray communist party believes that the South Korean authorities' actions amount to no less that interference in the internal affairs of sovereign states who have signed the appropriate agreements, are completely impermissible in relations between states, and constitute an attempt to sabotage the mutually profitable economic relations between Russia and the DPRK. According to the kray party committee, this encourages ethnic hostility and confrontation on the Korean peninsula, which is fraught with many negative consequnences.
