Senior officials from both sides in charge of scientific and technological affairs reviewed the achievements scored in the past 15 years since the 1979 signing of the "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation." They also discussed new prospects for strengthening or expanding scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation. At the meeting, Song Jian, co-chairman of the meeting, Chinese state councilor, and minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, and John Gibbons, assistant to the president for science and technology and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, fully affirmed the tremendous achievements scored in scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries. They also signed a joint communique of this meeting as well as a "Clean Coal Appendix" to the "Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Fossil Energy" and renewed the "Sino-U.S. Protocol on Cooperation in Marine Science and Technology." Following the meeting, Song Jiang pointed out in a speech: This meeting has created new conditions for future Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation. He then said: The fruitful cooperation between China and the United States according to 29 protocols in this regard has yielded some major, inspiring results. Such cooperation is not only of great significance for the two countries' scientific and technological circles but has played an important role in promoting economic development and scientific progress and enhances the friendship of people in the two countries. He expressed the belief that with the meeting's decision on the common objectives for the expanded scale and scope of scientific and technological cooperation, the cooperation between scientific, technological, and economic circles in China and the United States would certainly develop toward ever higher aims and in ever broader fields. Gibbons said in his speech: There are many opportunities in Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation. So it is necessary to promote such cooperation. He then pointed out: The Clinton administration holds that maintaining a stable relationship with a strong and prosperous China is very much in the interests of the United States. He said: As a Chinese proverb goes, a thousand-mile journey is started by taking the first step. China and the United States have taken the first step together toward in-depth cooperation at the joint commission meeting. According to Chinese science and technology delegation members attending the meeting, as one of the important activities in Sino- U.S. relations, this meeting stressed that both sides should expand their cooperation in the development of cancer and AIDS medicines, environmental protection, the exploitation and effective use of energy, and in high-temperature superconducting materials and rare- earth elements. From now on, Sino-U.S. scientific and technological cooperation will focus on these four fields. Four representatives from the American Pharmaceutical Association, the Council of Environmental Industry, the Power Research Institute, and the Auto Engineers Association briefed the meeting this afternoon on opportunities for expanding the scientific and technological cooperation between Chinese and U.S. industries. They earnestly hoped for expanding scientific and technological cooperation between the two governments to enterprises. The "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation" was signed by then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and U.S. President Carter in 1979. Within the framework of this agreement, the two sides signed 29 protocols in education, agriculture, space technology, high-energy physics, industrial science and technology management, scientific and technological intelligence, metrology, atmosphere, oceanography, public health, hydropower, earthquake, earth science, environmental protection, basic science, construction and urban planning, surface water, nuclear safety, nuclear physics, aviation, transportation and communication, statistics, fossil energy, topography, telecommunications, railways, protection of nature, nonferrous metals, and land management. Within the bounds of these protocols, relevant Chinese and U.S. Government departments have undertaken more than 1,000 projects for scientific and technological cooperation and over 10,000 people have exchanged visits over the past 15 years. According to the "Agreement Between the Chinese and U.S. Governments on Scientific and Technological Cooperation," the Sino- U.S. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, which guides the agreement's implementation, holds a meetings once every two years in the capitals of the two countries by turns.
