FBIS3-49642 "dreeu009_b_94003" FBIS-EEU-94-009 Document Type:Daily Report 13 Jan 1994 BULGARIA Zhelev Decree Seen as Violation of Constitution AU1201210194 Sofia TRUD in Bulgarian 7 Jan 94 p 4 AU1201210194 Sofia TRUD Language: Bulgarian Article Type:BFN [Commentary by Lilyana Khristovska: "Whether He Was Duped or Not, Zhelev Has Violated the Constitution"] [Text] Constitutional Law experts claim that the unpublished Decree No. 269 issued by the president of the Republic and his letter filed under No. 02-01-6/24 November 1993 represent a flagrant violation of the Constitution and provide sufficient reason for canceling his prerogatives ahead of schedule. According to the aforementioned experts, both the decree and the letter are invalid as official documents from the legal point of view. This applies to the decree because it has not been published, which the Constitution requires, while the letter has not been classified as an official document. According to the Constitution, a military cabinet attached to the President's Office does not exist. As supreme commander in chief, the president chairs the Consultative Council for National Security that should act as an interdepartmental body rather than being subordinate to the Presidency. According to the Constitution, the status of the Consultative Council should be determined by an act of Parliament, which the deputies have so far been too busy to pass, rather than by the president himself. Nevertheless, it does not mean that the president is entitled to establish a duplicate body which neither the Constitution nor the law have provided for. The Presidency is an auxiliary service attached to the President's Office that has no independent state functions whatsoever. Relations between the advisers serving in the Presidency and the head of state are based on internal organizational principles. The status of the president's advisers is strictly confined to the activities of consulting experts and the president is not entitled to entrust them with any state functions whatsoever. There is even more: The president is not authorized to instruct official departments in connection with assuming any obligations whatsoever regarding his advisers. The president's only prerogatives are those granted to him by the Constitution. Any other initiatives on his part are self-styled.
