Key cabinet members agreed that the suggested hikes in telephone, taxi, medicine and many other public service charges should be permitted if they are "really inevitable" and only after due consideration is paid to their possible impact on the economy. The timing and scale of such hikes should be determined so they will not hurt the economy, the ministers said. They also agreed that the charges should be raised on condition that services operators implement thorough restructuring in the future, officials said. The meeting brought together Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, and other related government officials. It came as public concern mounted over a string of proposed hikes of charges for public services that some critics say will erode the benefits of the government's planned tax cuts and hamper the recovery of the economy. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), for instance, has applied for government permission to raise the basic rate it charges telephone owners by an average 18 percent, as well as hiking its directory inquiries rates. The planned rate hikes run against the Hosokawa government's much-touted policy of paying greater attention to consumers' interests. The cabinet ministers stressed the need to bring Japan's public services rates into line with those of other countries, which are generally lower, officials said. They said the ministers also agreed that the "basic policies" should be complied with when local governments give permission to raise bus fares and other public services charges in their areas.
