FR941103-0-00024 FR941103-0-00005 The Amendment This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) revises the airspace description of the South Florida Low airspace area by excluding the Grand Bahama TCA and the Nassau TCA. The FAA has determined that this regulation is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
