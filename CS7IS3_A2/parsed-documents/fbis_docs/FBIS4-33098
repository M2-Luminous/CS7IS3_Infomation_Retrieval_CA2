FBIS4-33098 "drlat106_c_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 MEXICO PRD Creates `Movement for Democratic Transition' PRD Creates `Movement for Democratic Transition' PA0206032394 Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish 30 May 94 p 15 PA0206032394 Mexico City LA JORNADA Spanish BFN [Report by Rosa Icela Rodriguez] [Text] Yesterday, when the Movement for Democratic Transition [Movimiento por la Transicion Democratica] was created, it was announced that it would support Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' campaign to conduct a democratic struggle to return the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) to legitimacy because it is currently being "held hostage by various factions." Initially, the movement is expected to include some 100 PRD leaders and candidates for the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. A document that served as a basis for a discussion at this meeting at PRD National Headquarters states that the government, with the support of the media, "has unleashed a smear campaign against Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and the PRD" -- a campaign to which "PRD followers have not known how to respond" because "the PRD's internal problems have hampered and to a great extent paralyzed its political activity." The document recognizes that "today's prevailing political climate is one of division and confrontation," and what has caused this is the way candidates for deputies and senators were chosen -- "under the hegemony of internal factions that placed group interests above national interests, thereby seriously hurting internal stability and, moreover, hurting the party's ability to provide the people with solutions to resolve the country's great problems." At the meeting, which was attended by PRD members Francisco Kuri, Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, Rene Arce, Arnoldo Martinez Verdugo, Cuauhtemoc Sandoval, and others, those in attendance criticized the fact that "the PRD structure has been overrun by interest groups calling themselves factions." Likewise, they criticized the fact that "internal disputes have lacked political foresight, programmatic formulas, and tactics. But the most serious aspect of this situation has been the casting aside of PRD members who do not belong to any faction -- those who act separately within grass-root organizations in municipal and district committees." They stressed: "This is not the image of the PRD that is sought or wished by those of us who have gathered together to form this movement" and who have "shared with a large sector of the party's grass roots our opposition to the methods and behavior of these groups, which have made hegemonic decisions at all levels of the party and have even placed at risk the organized activities of the Executive Committee and the National Council." They continued: "In view of this situation, a group of us, all PRD members who took part in the party's founding and have devoted ourselves to the tasks of building the party and developing its policies and programs, have decided to form a group and become an instrument of political work within the PRD, and, in this way, we will fulfill the goals that our statutes establish."
