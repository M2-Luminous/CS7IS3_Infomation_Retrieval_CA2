FBIS TRENDS-06APR94-POLAND Walesa Intensifies Campaign Against Government Walesa Intensifies Campaign Against Government SUMMARY Apparently clearing the way for a reelection bid in 1995, President Lech Walesa has stepped up his criticism of the governing coalition's largest party, the formerly communist Alliance of the Democratic Left (SLD), in an effort to boost his sagging popularity. Walesa has also put the government under extreme pressure by blocking some of its important legislation and appointments, while at the same time threatening to dissolve parliament and call early elections. END SUMMARY Walesa's reelection strategy appears to center on his past credentials as an ardent anticommunist. In recent pronouncements, he has indicated that his decision to run will be based on the country's need for a strong defender against the threat of resurgent communism. During a 30 March meeting with journalists from the Catholic daily Slowo--Dziennik Katolicki, Walesa said that he was becoming "increasingly more convinced" that "once again" he would have to "fight for" the presidency in the 1995 elections. Referring to SLD members in the government, he declared that "once again the Politburo wants to have all the power" and suggested that legislators should present him with "proposals on file-checking and decommunization" to investigate possible collaborators with the former communist regime (Rzeczpospolita, 31 March). Walesa also suggested that other possible presidential candidates, such as Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, are not fit to handle the chaos that "times like these will bring," saying that Pawlak has "no experience with people in the streets, stone throwing, and strikes" and that "some people can already smell gunpowder while some still cannot" (Warsaw Radio, 30 March). Walesa's Actions In a flurry of activity before the Easter holidays, Walesa has also blocked government-sponsored legislation and appointments, challenging the government's legitimacy and accusing it of communist-era tactics in response to SLD protests of his moves. --On 25 March, Walesa rejected the governing coalition's candidate for finance minister, Dariusz Rosati. After the SLD announced that the government would not withdraw Rosati's candidacy, Walesa accused it of "still behaving as if" the nomination "were a decision made by the Politburo" (Rzeczpospolita, 31 March). --On 30 March, Walesa threatened to "omit the Sejm" in passing the Concordat with the Vatican if the SLD musters enough parliamentary votes to block its passage (Rzeczpospolita, 31 March) --On 31 March, Walesa vetoed the government's law replacing the tax on large wage increases in state-run firms with a tax that includes punitive measures against private firms that grant similar wage increases (PAP, 31 March). --The same day, dismissing government questioning of his authority to dismiss Marek Markiewicz as head of the Polish Television and Radio Council, Walesa named Ryszard Bender, a member of the anticommunist Christian National Union, as Markiewicz's replacement (PAP, 31 March). --In a 31 March interview with PAP, Walesa threatened to dissolve the Sejm if the governing coalition attempts to limit his powers, saying that he would "tell the people" that "now we can see a monopoly of the communist type being established. Aren't you afraid that communism is coming back?" Popularity Walesa's campaign against former communists comes at a time when he is suffering from low popularity ratings. According to the Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS), 60 percent of respondents in a mid-March poll agreed that the "president's actions weakened the state" while only 17 percent disagreed (PAP, 28 March). Suggesting that it would be an uphill struggle for Walesa to make a bid for reelection, he finished fourth in a CBOS presidential preference poll with only nine percent, behind SLD leader Aleksander Kwasniewski's 17 percent and the eleven percent of Pawlak and former Foreign Minister Krzysztof Skubiszewski (Rzeczpospolita, 29 March). Implications Portraying himself as an opposition figure battling against a "communist" government, Walesa appears to be making an effort to regain his base of support among staunchly anticommunist voters from the ranks of the former Solidarity movement. Despite the SLD's victory in the fall parliamentary elections, its status as a governing party during a time of continuing economic woes--and Walesa's calculation that he has little to lose by alienating SLD voters--has apparently made the party an easy target for the president. This strategy has been undermined, however, by Walesa's frequent conflicts with virtually all the former Solidarity parties and the Solidarity trade union, and his lack of a strong political base outside of a group that he helped to form, the small Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms, which garnered only five percent of the vote in the fall elections.
