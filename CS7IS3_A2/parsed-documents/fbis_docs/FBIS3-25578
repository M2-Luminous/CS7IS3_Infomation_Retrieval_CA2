The negotiating council in its session at Kempton Park approved a package of concessions by the government and the ANC [African National Congress] and also conceded, among others things, to the extension of the nine provinces' powers. Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi insisted that the concessions did not satisfy the alliance's objections. Gary Alfonso reports: The negotiating council in Kempton Park approved amendments to the interim constitution which, according to the government and the ANC, met the demands of the Freedom Alliance. In a special concession the word "concurrent" was removed from the constitution, which means that the central government may not interfere with provincial powers, except when it was in national interest. That, Dr. Buthelezi said, was not enough. [Begin Buthelezi recording, in English] The powers of regions or provinces as defined in the present constitution are equal to the powers of municipalities, when you talk about abattoirs and gambling as such. To say that when you have not given real regional powers in the first place, to say that you have now removed... [pauses], you are not going to interfere with that -- it's neither here nor there, in fact it's nonsense. [end recording]
