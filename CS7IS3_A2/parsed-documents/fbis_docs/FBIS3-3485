As some deputies attending the Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] put it, "Public funds are cheap." The major cases involving economic crimes recently reported in the press had something in common -- it is too easy to embezzle public funds. A bank accountant a little more than 30 years old was able to embezzle more than 30 million yuan in the light of day; Shen Taifu of the Great Wall Machinery and Electrical Engineering Company was able to embezzle 3 million yuan from funds raised from the public. The NPC deputies said these incidents show that China's legal system is still not well established and the established laws, regulations, and systems still have loopholes. They said in the process of building a socialist market economic system, we must place great importance on this problem. They also said: People committing corruption or accepting bribes may be punished by law; but we can do nothing about many things taking place everyday even we know they are wrong -- such as using public funds to wine and dine, to do sightseeing, for home decorations, and to buy expensive sedans. The public money spent on such purposes usually amounts to tens of thousands of yuan, hundreds of thousands of yuan, or even millions of yuan. But, all these malpractices do not constitute a crime, and so we can only complain about them. But, if there are no effective measures to deal with this kind of problem, simply complaining about them does not yield any results. The deputies hoped for enactment of more laws and regulations and for the refining of established laws and regulations; they hoped that, in appointing and promoting leaders, greater attention will be paid to their personal integrity, and education in honestly performing one's official duty will be regularly conducted among cadres. They also hoped that reform will more closely link personal interests to those of the state so that people will feel that spending public funds is like spending one's own money. They said, if such comprehensive measures can be taken to deal with the problem, there will be hope that "public funds may appreciate."
