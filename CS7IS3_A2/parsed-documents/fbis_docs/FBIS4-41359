The formal reason for this is a letter from Konotop in which the author, indignant that "Prosvita" is supporting a Jew by nationality as a candidate in the elections to the oblast council, demanded that the district commission check the accuracy of the nomination of all the candidates in general. Having demanding all the documents in general from "Prosvita", not only those concerning the nomination of candidates but those dating back to the time when the organization was founded, Vasyl Spivak found some violations, in particular that some adopted changes had not been written in the organization's statute. On this basis, he issued an instruction to the polling station commissions to delete the "Prosvita" candidates from the ballot forms. The oblast "Prosvita" organization and all national democratic parties sent letters of protest to the oblast procuracy and demanded that Vasyl Spivak annul the illegal instruction. The statement from the national democratic forces in Sumy oblast reads that if he refuses, they will reserve the right to turn for help to all national democratic forces in Ukraine as well as to resort to actions of civil disobedience.
