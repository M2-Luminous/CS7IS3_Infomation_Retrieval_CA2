Nursultan Nazarbayev said this in Kiev, where he is on an official visit. The Kazakh president pointed out that he is ready to sign a new agreement with Russia either on a bilateral basis or on a quadrilateral basis involving Ukraine and Belarus. In the next few days he will be going to Washington to discuss these problems with Bill Clinton. Russia believed that the matter of compensation for the nuclear material in the strategic missiles due for removal from Kazakhstan was in principle closed. There are agreements on this point. Almaty, like Kiev and Minsk, should receive its share after deduction of expenditure on the reprocessing of highly enriched uranium and its transportation and storage at Russian plants. However, all the indications are that the method of calculation adopted earlier does not suit the Kazakh side. It intends to follow the example of Ukraine, which succeeded a week ago in obtaining $1 billion on signing the trilateral agreement with Russia and the United States in Moscow. This money is being given to Ukraine out of the sum appropriated by the U.S. Congress for the nuclear disarmament of the CIS countries under the START I treaty. It has become known that Almaty is hoping for similar compensation. In other words, Kazakhstan, like Ukraine, has decided not to wait for funds to come into its account from the sale of uranium by its Russian partners, whom it is not inclined to trust very much. It is obviously safer to get insurance now, in the form of a guaranteed billion out of the U.S. quota. Experts believe that in that event Russia will have to take on additional expenditure for the safe dismantling of nuclear warheads in the possession of its CIS neighbors. It cannot be rule out that Belarus will demand its share in the same way, although some of the uranium has already been shipped out of its territory to Russia for reprocessing. When it hosted Bill Clinton recently, Minsk received $100 million from this same package. But now, REUTER reports, Belarus is laying claim to a further $500 million.
