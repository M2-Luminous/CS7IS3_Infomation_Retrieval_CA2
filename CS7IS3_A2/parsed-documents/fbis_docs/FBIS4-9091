This meeting was proposed by the president himself, and the coalition had been knocking in vain at the president's door for this meeting for several weeks. Literally a dozen or so seconds ago, Walesa's news conference ended at the Sejm. The president did not want to say, however, what the private talks with Kwasniewski were about. He only said: We cleared up certain things that should not have happened in the past. The president did not want to say to what political facts he was referring. The president also said that he did not see any need for a meeting with the entire coalition for the time being. In the president's view, the leaders of the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party should first agree on a new candidate for the post of finance minister and deputy responsible for economic affairs. Only then, after agreeing on this candidate, can a meeting take place. At the news conference, the president said that Dariusz Rosati will not be his candidate for this post. In other words, the president upheld his declaration made earlier during the meeting of the SLD parliamentary floor group that he would not endorse that candidacy. Asked whether he thought that today's meeting with the SLD parliamentary floor group and today's talks with Kwasniewski marked an end to the conflict of the past several weeks, Walesa said that this was not the case at all, that these conflicts will go on, and that he intends to cause them himself. The president indicated, however, that these conflicts are meant to help resolve very serious problems. The president admitted that Kwasniewski's declaration that there will be no changes to the interim Constitution had upset his plans a little, because, as announced earlier, the president is going out into the country on 21 April, where he intends to convince the people of his arguments.
