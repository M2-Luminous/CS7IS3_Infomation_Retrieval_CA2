Kakizawa, 60, replaced Tsutomu Hata in the post, the latter having been elected as prime minister. Conversant in both English and French, he has demonstrated great interest in foreign affairs, having served as chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in 1990 and as parliamentary vice foreign minister from 1991 to 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. During that latter stint, he visited Mozambique to pave the way for deployment of Japanese U.N. peacekeepers there, while he represented Japan at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference. He has shown a particular interest in Myanmar [Burma], having visited the country and met with top junta leaders. After graduating from Tokyo University, Kakizawa served for years as a Finance Ministry bureaucrat and spent time as an intern at the French Finance Ministry in Paris and a diplomat at the Japanese Embassy in Belgium. He ended his career as a bureaucrat in 1977 when he successfully ran for a seat in the House of Councillors as a candidate for the new Liberal Club, a splinter party from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In 1980, he was elected to the first of five terms in the House of Representatives. The following year he left the new Liberal Club, which disbanded in 1986, all of its former members rejoining the LDP. After joining the LDP, he belonged to a faction led by former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and worked on foreign, defense and financial affairs. Kakizawa launched the Liberal Party on April 20 along with five other LDP defectors and one independent amid the political turmoil sparked by the declaration of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on April 8 that he would resign. Kakizawa, hailing from Tokyo's No. 6 constituency, has been elected to the lower house five times.
