As the Constitutional Court last Thursday decided to ban the Democracy Party [DEP] and strip its 13 members from Parliament membership, Ankara State Security Court Chief Prosecutor Nusret Demiral ordered the detention of Sedat Yurtdas and Selim Sadak, the two remaining DEP members. After learning that they will be detained, the two deputies received a call from Deputy Parliament Speaker Kamer Genc who told them that he will not allow the police to enter the premises and will take action before the High Board of Judges and Prosecutors to protect the deputies. He added that Parliament Speaker Husamettin Cindoruk and Demiral disagreed on their detention.
