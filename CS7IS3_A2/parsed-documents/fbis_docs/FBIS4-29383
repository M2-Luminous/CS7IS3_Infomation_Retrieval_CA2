In a literature they said that "the `government' is now trying to avoid the failure of its anti-popular policy by means of increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula through a massive anti-communist campaign." They branded the "training" as "one defining fellow countrymen as the enemy" and strongly demanded its stop. On the 14th, 50 odd young people threw some 40 paint bottles at a police booth near Kyongpuk National University in Taegu and vanished after destroying its furniture.
