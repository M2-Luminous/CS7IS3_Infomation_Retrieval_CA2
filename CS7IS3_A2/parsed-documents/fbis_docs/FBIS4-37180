Dembri had told Moroccan daily "L'OPINION" that a "political solution" to the Sahara issue within a Moroccan framework was possible without the referendum. In a clarification statement to Algerian "EL MOUDJAHID" governmental daily, Dembri said the idea was not his and it was among the ideas raised in 1983 by "top Moroccan political personalities" and namely "the stamp and flag" formula. "What was valid earlier can be accepted today", said head of the Algerian diplomacy, adding that several proposals were made including the idea of an international conference proposed again by Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organisation of African Unity at the OAU summit of Tunis. After recalling the difficulties facing the referendum, Dembri said it is possible that the referendum will confirm after all a political accord and stressed the need to give way to politic and diplomatic initiatives to get out of the impasse. For Moroccan daily "L'OPINION", mouthpiece of the Istiqlal party, said Wednesday Algeria speaks a double language and wondered what Algeria really wants in the Sahara issue a "political solution" or the referendum.
