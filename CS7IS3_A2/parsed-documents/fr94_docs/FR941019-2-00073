Under Public Law 103&hyph;40, the Superintendent of Documents implemented on June 8, 1994, a system of online access to the Federal Register, Congressional Record, and Congressional Bills databases. The purpose of the meetings is to demonstrate the online services made available under the initial phase of the implementation of the Act and to solicit comments from users interested in the system. The initial online services include access to a WAIS Server at GPO offering the following databases: the Federal Register (including the Unified Agenda), Volume 59 (1994); the Congressional Record (including the History of Bills), Volume 140 (1994); the Congressional Record Index, Volumes 138&hyph;140 (1992&hyph;1994); and Congressional Bills from the 103d Congress (1993&hyph;1994). The Federal Register and Congressional Record databases provide ASCII text files, with all graphics included as individual files in TIFF format. Both databases are updated daily. Brief ASCII text summaries of each Federal Register entry are also available. The Congressional Record Index provides ASCII text files with all graphics included as individual files in TIFF format. The Congressional Bills are available as ASCII text files and in the Adobe Acrobat PDF file format. Users with Acrobat viewers can display and print page facsimiles of Congressional Bills. Individuals interested in attending either session should contact Tom Andersen at the California State Library by telephone on 916&hyph;653&hyph;0085, or by e-mail at tanderse@library.ca.gov.
