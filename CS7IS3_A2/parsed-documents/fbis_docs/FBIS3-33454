He was condemned to 18 years of imprisonment for his participation in the robbery of a Lautaro bakery. Marin Correa, one of nine political prisoners still jailed in the Santo Domingo prison, was not informed of the decision until 22 February despite the fact he was scheduled to travel this morning. He told the press that he disagreed with his banishment because in one year he could have obtained his freedom under probation or night imprisonment. Despite pleading innocent, he reaffirmed his support for the struggle against the military regime. Aylwin still has six pending pardon requests, including the most contentious ones related to Hector Maturana Urzua, Juan Ordenes Narvaez, and Hector Figueroa Gomez, who were sentenced to life imprisonment for their participation in an attack against General Pinochet. Miguel Angel Colina, Marco Antonio Mardone Villarroel, and Jorge Escobar Diaz also are awaiting pardons.
