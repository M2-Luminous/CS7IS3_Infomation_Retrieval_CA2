The government brought this decision at an extraordinary session Monday [11 April] devoted to the situation following the bombardment of the Srpska republic around the town of Gorazde, in the east of war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina. The government has also decided to address a protest note to Italy for having allowed NATO planes to fly from its airfields and a letter to the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointing out that the NATO air attacks on the Srpska republic constitute a violation of the U.N charter, it is said in a statement issued by the government. At the same session the government has assessed the U.N. decision about the engagement of NATO airforces in the bombardment of the territory of the Srpska republic as direct involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the side of the Moslems and a dangerous precedent which could have far-reaching consequences. The cabinet of Prime Minister Kontic has also conveyed the solidarity of all Yugoslav citizens with the Serb people in the Srpska republic who are the victims of aggression. The U.N. has brought the decision about the engagement of NATO planes at the request of the peacekeepers on the field who accused the Serbs of attacking the civilian population in Gorazde. According to Serb military sources, however, it was from Gorazde that around 10,000 Moslem troops launched an attack on Serb positions around the town, which should have been demilitarized last spring as a UN-protected area. Reports of the U.N. peackeepers confirm that the combats around Gorazde were provoked by the Moslems. According to Serb military sources the Moslem offensive is aimed at gaining as much territory as possible from the Serbs ahead of the continuation of the peace talks conducted under international mediation.
