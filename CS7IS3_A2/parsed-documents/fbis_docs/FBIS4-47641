FBIS TRENDS-25MAY94-KOREA Pyongyang Sets Up New Body to Replace MAC Pyongyang Sets Up New Body to Replace MAC Seeking to force Washington to accept Pyongyang's unilateral withdrawal from the Military Armistice Commission (MAC), North Korea has notified the U.S. side at Panmunjom of the establishment "a new negotiation body" representing the Korean People's Army. According to the North Korean news agency KCNA on 24 May, a "Panmunjom mission," headed by a North Korean lieutenant general, has been set up with a view to establishing a new "peace arrangement" to replace the MAC. Clearly moving to establish a precedent for its functioning, the mission, through its "chief liaison officer," formally protested the recent shipment of U.S. Patriot missiles to South Korea. Pointedly disregarding the existence of the United Nations Command (UNC), the protest was lodged with the "U.S. Forces side." Pyongyang had been boycotting the MAC since March 1991, when a South Korean general was named to head the UNC, and in April had called for DPRK-U.S. talks on a new peace accord to replace the 1953 Armistice Agreement that established the MAC (Trends, 4 May 1994, pages 3-4).
