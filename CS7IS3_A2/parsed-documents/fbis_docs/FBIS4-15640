It is already clear, however, that the elections did take place, and as a result of them a new Ukrainian parliament was elected. It will replace the previous one contrary to the opinion of many politicians and sociologists, who forecast the apathy of the electorate and, consequently, the failure of elections. On Sunday the elections were recognised as valid in 324 constituencies. According to preliminary information, which was available on April 11 in the morning, 222 legislators, elected during the second round, will be added to 90, elected during the first one. Many of the newly elected deputies were members of the previous parliament; specifically, its speaker Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Ukrainian Socialist Party Aleksandr Moroz, ex-prime minister Leonid Kuchma, chairman of Ukrainian RUKH Vyacheslav Chornovil, ex-vice speaker Vladimir Grinev, acting prime minister Yefim Zvyagilskiy, first deputy chairman of the Supreme Soviet Vasiliy Durdinets and ex-prime minister Vitaliy Masol. The majority, however, are newcomers. The results of the elections and the make-up of the new parliament are sure to be analysed by specialists. It is obvious, however, that it will have a large group of professional economists and lawyers, who can quickly analyse complex situations and find optimal solutions.
