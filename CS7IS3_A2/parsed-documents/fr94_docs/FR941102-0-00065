ACTION: Notice of Deletion of the Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site from the National Priorities List. SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces the deletion of the Ringwood Mines/Landfill site (Site) from the National Priorities List (NPL). The NPL constitutes appendix B of 40 CFR part 300 which is the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP), which EPA promulgated pursuant to Section 105 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), as amended. EPA and the State of New Jersey have determined that no further action is appropriate under CERCLA. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Lance R. Richman, P.G., Remedial Project Manager, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region II, 26 Federal Plaza, Rm. 13100, New York, New York 10278, (212) 264&hyph;6695. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The site to be deleted from the NPL is: Ringwood Mines/Landfill Site, Ringwood Borough, New Jersey. A Notice of Intent to Delete for this Site was published in the Federal Register , on December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64539). The closing date for comments on the Notice of Intent to Delete was January 7, 1993. EPA has received no comments. Therefore there is no responsiveness summary. The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances Superfund Response Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to ยง300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions if conditions at the site warrant such action. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not effect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts.
