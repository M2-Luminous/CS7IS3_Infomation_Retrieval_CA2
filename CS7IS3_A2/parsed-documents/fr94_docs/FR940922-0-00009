FR940922-0-00009 FR940922-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;121&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9030; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;02] Airworthiness Directives; Airbus Model A320 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to all Airbus Model A320 series airplanes. This action requires revising the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to instruct the flight crew to maintain a flap setting of configuration full (CONF FULL) during landing. This amendment is prompted by a report of severe control difficulties which occurred on approach with the flaps locked in CONF FULL and the landing gear down. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane during approach. DATES: Effective October 7, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of October 7, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before November 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;121&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. The Airplane Flight Manual information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Airbus Industrie, 1 Rond Point Maurice Bellonte, 31707 Blagnac Cedex, France. This information may be examined at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Slotte, Aerospace Engineer, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2797; fax (206) 227&hyph;1320. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Recently, the FAA received a report that a Model A320 series airplane experienced severe control difficulties on approach with the flaps locked in configuration full (CONF FULL) and the landing gear down. In this incident, the Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) system directed the flight crew to select configuration (CONF) 3 for landing. When the flight crew placed the slats/flaps lever in CONF 3, the slats retracted from 27 degrees to 22 degrees, but the flaps remained locked in the full position (40 degrees). Consequently, the flight crew engaged the autopilot, which resulted in the lateral control laws responding to the corresponding CONF 3. In turbulent conditions, this configuration may lead to serious lateral oscillation with the autopilot engaged or to an increase of the lateral sensitivity in manual control. This condition, if not corrected, could result in severely reduced controllability of the airplane during approach. Airbus has issued A320/A321 Flight Manual Temporary Revision 9.99.99/20, dated June 14, 1994, which provides the flight crew with modified procedures for flaps fault/locked condition. These modified procedures instruct the flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during landing approaches. This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.29) and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the Direction Générale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC), which is the airworthiness authority for France, has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, this AD is being issued to prevent severely reduced controllability of the airplane during approach. The FAA has determined that this unsafe condition may be temporarily addressed by revising the Limitations Section of the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to advise the flight crew to maintain CONF FULL during landing approaches. This AFM revision is to be accomplished in accordance with the information specified in the Airbus document described previously. This is considered to be interim action. The manufacturer has advised that it currently is developing a modification that will positively address the unsafe condition addressed by this AD. Once this modification is developed, approved, and available, the FAA may consider further rulemaking. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption `` ADDRESSES. '' All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;121&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption `` ADDRESSES .''
