The political part of the visit is drawing to its end. I would like to say that the entire visit, my talks with politicians, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and the presidents of the two chambers of parliament, and my meetings with the representatives of the employers have been very open and friendly. First, we wanted to convey our message of friendship toward France, on this, my first visit here at this level -- that is, my first state visit to France, as I have been to France on several other occasions in the past, for various international conferences or on private visits, about a year and a half ago, but this is my first state visit here -- and I believe that it marks an important political moment in the development of political relations between our two countries. This visit is also a response to President Mitterrand's visit to Romania. Second, the political discussions that I have conducted here offered an opportunity to draw up a balance sheet of the state of our relations. We came to the joint conclusion that political, scientific, and human relations are developing very favorably. We can ascertain, both in Romania and France, that regardless of the political differences in terms of government, a constant atmosphere of good relations between our countries is being maintained at the bilateral level. We want to emphasize and underscore this. Another very important aspect stressed during the visit is the joint interest in developing our economic relations. In my political discussions as well as in the talks with the representatives from business, I pointed out the need to develop bilateral ties in this sphere and France's role in our economic relations. We noted that there are many positive examples of mutually advantageous relations, but we also noted that the situation in this field is pretty modest, hence we should jointly make further efforts to capitalize on the overall positive climate in the economic sphere, as well. Of course, there are problems in our country, since we are in a time of transition. There is a lot of inertia, inertia of the state apparatus and economic units, as well as disruption caused by the abolition of the old structures and decentralization. All these phenomena are linked to the transition and are causing problems. However, we must overcome these difficulties. We have a joint interest in economic integration into Europe. France must ratify Romania's association accord with the European Community, a procedure which will take place next week; the Senate will ratify the accord at the beginning of May. Thus, Romania will be integrated into this system of relations. We also talked about the political problems of the continent -- the Yugoslav conflict, security problems, and the French initiative regarding a European framework of stability. Generally speaking, I would like to point out that all the talks that I have held here have been positive and that I found a platform for cooperation and for expanding our bilateral ties. We also had a festive moment at the Paris City Hall and I took that opportunity to convey our sentiments to the citizens of Paris as well as the intention to develop our relations at this level, too, that is between our local administrations. The Dialogue With Journalists [Correspondent] Are any agreements going to be signed during your visit here? [Iliescu] It is not the object of our state visit to sign economic agreements. We just reviewed all aspects of political and other relations between our countries and emphasized the joint will and desire to capitalize on the very favorable framework of the relations between our countries, to consolidate it, to facilitate the expansion of bilateral relations, and to take joint steps at various European levels to promote stability and security on the continent as well as the process of all-European integration. [Correspondent] Mr. President, a Paris daily has today published an article by Doina Cornea [leader of Romania's opposition Group for Social Dialogue], who, instead of welcoming you to France, actually criticizes the authorities in Romania for hesitation -- and I would like you to clarify this for the French press -- for hesitation over Romania's policy between East and West and the results of this hesitation. [Iliescu] We are not surprised about Mrs. Cornea's opinions. She constantly says "no" to everything; therefore her statements always have an emotional connotation for electoral purposes. Therefore, I believe one should not attach too much importance to her assessments. Regarding our foreign policy, I do not think one can talk about vacillation, but, on the contrary, there is a constant element in our foreign policy that, I could say, enjoys an unanimous backing, regardless of Romania's internal controversies and problems, which are natural in any political struggle. I believe that there is a very broad understanding, as far as the political language and consensus are concerned, on the major points of our foreign policy. We have been able to ascertain this at various times when Romania had to adopt certain positions and I have noticed that there is a common platform of understanding on these issues. What does "oscillation between East and West" mean? All the West European countries are interested in and are promoting an active policy toward Central and East Europe and toward Russia, in particular. What Mrs. Cornea wants, s what she is aiming at and the ideas that she is advocating, is that Romania should promote a policy designed to create tension in relations with Russia. However, this is not in Romania's national interest. Neither the United States nor the European countries think that it is in their interest to promote such a policy. I emphasized a special aspect of the issue, which I believe I even told our French partners about, namely that France is represented in Chisinau by its embassy in Moscow, not by the French ambassador in Bucharest. Hence, you can see how far sensitivity toward relations with Russia goes. Therefore, what are we supposed to show? Such a thing is totally unwise. I believe that last night's statements by President Mitterrand on the balanced nature of Romanian policy are a commensurate assessment of an experienced politician, who shows greater understanding for Romania's national interests than certain Romanians, who have no political feeling toward the problems of concern for Romania. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have conducted a steady diplomatic activity in the Balkans. What is Romania's mediating role in the region? [Iliescu] Of course Romania, as well as the close neighbors of former Yugoslavia and of Serbia, is very concerned with the events in the former Yugoslavia. Romania is directly affected by the embargo. But the conflict as such, which can pose a great danger for the entire region, directly affects and concerns us. There is no doubt that our means are very modest. Nevertheless, despite all this, we have made and continue to make efforts to contribute to creating a favorable climate for a political solution. We conducted talks on the issue with important French politicians yesterday and today. We found a common platform on the conclusion that military methods cannot help solve the problem. Generally speaking, military means cannot offer solutions. On the contrary, they create complications and exacerbate tensions. That is why I believe that we should promote only political solutions and all efforts should focus in this direction. We appreciate all the efforts made by the European Community, the United States, and Russia to contribute to a rapprochement and a proper climate for helping the parties directly involved to find political solutions. Of course, when conflicts break out -- and it is always easy to trigger a conflict -- it is much more difficult to stop them. When the conflicts have already taken on proportions and people have been killed, then the vendetta exacerbates the situation. This is how the situation has evolved in the former Yugoslavia: First the conflict broke out between the Serbs and the Croats and later on it extended to Bosnia; well, it is much more difficult now to find an acceptable solution for all sides. We have also witnessed certain contradictory developments, since there are times when there is hope for a solution. In the last few days, I have witnessed quite a few contradictory moments. We hope that a solution will finally be found. In this case, as far as Bosnia is concerned, it is clear that we cannot resolve the problem without the Serbs and that solutions must be found to facilitate the dialogue among all sides in Bosnia -- the Croats, the Muslims, and the Serbs -- together. I cannot make any comments on the raids. Anyhow, I consider the resort to force and military means -- we have proof of it before us -- as ineffective in solving problems. One should make further efforts to support political dialogue and solutions. [Correspondent] You have often said that France is one of the most friendly countries toward Romania. I would like to know to what extent this visit to Paris will help overcome the reservations that certain European countries still have toward Romania. [Iliescu] I would say that, from this viewpoint, things have improved and the evolution has been quite positive in recent years within the Council of Europe and the European Union. There has also been a change in the position of various countries in Europe vis-a- vis Romania and Romania's admission to these European institutions. This means that there is a positive evolution in general. France has helped us throughout this period in direct talks and in other negotiations within these European bodies and I hope that this visit will make a new contribution to improving the overall climate for our integration into Europe and for our direct relations with the other states in West Europe. [Correspondent] I would like to ask you, Mr. President, whether the problem of the minorities, and especially the Hungarian minority, was mentioned during the talks? In a broader sense, do you think that Hungary and Romania are very far from signing a friendship agreement? [Iliescu] We have not particularly focussed on these matters, but, of course, in talking about a stability pact in Europe and in Central and East Europe, we tackled the issue of relations between neighboring countries and mentioned our position of openness toward everything concerned with relations with all our neighbors, and particularly Hungary. I believe that others have problems in accepting Romanian tradition and legislation, particularly with regard to the Hungarian minority, since we are talking about it. In talks held with Hungary's representatives -- not here, of course -- we have noted that it is more difficult for Hungary accept Romanian policy regarding legislation and constitutional provisions on the parliamentary representation of all minorities; various studies; teaching and education in the mother tongue; and communication and cultural institutions in the mother tongue. These apply not to the Hungarian minority, which is the largest and has these possibilities, but also for the smaller ones, too. In this respect, we have no difficulty in discussing and adjusting ourselves to European norms. I believe that others have more difficulty in adjusting to these norms than we have. However, I think that on this issue of good understanding with the neighbors, it is not only the problem of the minorities that counts, but also the whole range of issues linked to relations of good understanding among the neighbors. We would also like to create such a climate. We believe that we have good relations with our neighbors, even with Hungary. There is some controversy regarding various aspects, even with regard to the basic political treaty between our countries, but I hope that after the elections [in Hungary], when things quiet down, we will find a common solution to create a legal basis for good neighborliness between our countries. There is no reason for us not to maintain normal relations between our countries. We have a common interest in promoting relations of good neighborliness. We can say that, even now, we have better economic relations with Hungary than with the other neighboring countries and that all the conditions exist for good communications between our countries and the citizens of our countries. Therefore, I hope that the climate will improve after the electoral campaign, which generally affects the people's thinking. [Correspondent] Mr. President, what answer will you give to King Mihai's request to spend the Orthodox Easter in Timisoara? Maybe you will change your attitude, in view of the evolution toward a calmer situation in your country? [Iliescu] I have openly stated my attitude vis-a-vis this visit. Former King Mihai was already in Romania for the Easter holiday in 1992. Last October, he made a similar request. I asked him to regard his visit to Romania as private, not as the sovereign, as he put it. In this respect, we asked him to adopt a clear position regarding his attitude toward the existing constitutional form of the Romanian state. We asked him to respect this choice of the Romanian people and the private character of his visit. However, this problem will be resolved by the Romanian Government, through direct communications with him. This is not necessarily the way for him to give an answer, but he must make a clear commitment if he wants to receive a visa. You know that the members of the Bourbon family were not allowed to visit France for a whole century. The first Bourbon was allowed to set foot in France only during de Gaulle's time. You know that in Italy no representative of the royal family has been allowed in the country since 1947. You also know the Greek Government's position vis-a-vis the former king. We do not want to take similar measures, but we want to have clear-cut relations in this respect. [Correspondent] Romania is member of the Francophonie [group of countries]. The French Parliament is currently holding a debate on the French language. What are your feelings in this respect and what can you say in this connection? [Iliescu] Romania participated in the last meetings in Paris and Mauritius as a full member of the organization. We belong to several Francophonie commissions. Therefore, we are already an active member and are concretely participating in the activities of this organization. We even suggested that a Francophonie meeting should be organized in our country. The matter is still under discussion. The next meeting will held in Benin. As for 1997, there is a proposal from Vietnam in this respect, which will be accepted. Consequently, Romania will offer to host the meeting in 1999. [Correspondent] What are your results regarding the encouragement of foreign investment in Romania? Are there pressures from abroad for further political reforms to be promoted? [Iliescu] I believe that we have very liberal legal and juridical provisions for stimulating foreign investment and there is already an active presence of the foreign capital in our economy. We have some 30,000 joint companies with foreign capital. However, the level of investment is still very modest, since the invested capital amounts to $1 billion. Therefore, we expect proposals for larger investment. We have a new government initiative, which is now being discussed in parliament, for new incentives to be granted to large investment projects in excess of $50 million. Similarly, we are also discussing a law on setting up free trade zones. We are now organizing free-trade zones near Constanta and we hope that these new facilities will encourage the participation of large investors. Investors from all over Europe are operating in our country, from France, Italy -- Italy ranks third in investment, while France is in the second place -- Germany, England, and the Netherlands. These states have already made sizable investment. The Japanese and South Koreans will follow suit. Therefore, we have accumulated some experience and we hope to develop it further in the near future. [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said that France would be the best investor for Romania. If my information is correct, the sum total of the capital invested is $80 million. This is no small amount, but then again, it is no big sum either. On the other hand, you realize that France is going through a rather difficult economic period right now. Under these circumstances, do you think that your visit will mark the start of overcoming reticence? What are your hopes after this visit? [Iliescu] I discussed this subject particularly with Premier Edouard Balladur and the representative of the French employers. On the one hand, we praised the positive French presence and certain interesting and efficient experiments. For instance, there is the ALCATEL company, which has set up a joint company in Timisoara to produce telephone exchanges, as an integral part of a strategic program to modernize the central urban telephone network in Romania. There are two companies participating in this program, which thus ensures a proper competitive framework. There is AlcateL, with a joint company set up in Timisoara, and Siemens, with a joint company in Bucharest called Electromagnetica. Together with the Ministry of Communications, all sides have divided their assignments among themselves and are competing to cover the entire territory with new equipment. We have had three stages in the development of the telephone network in Romania. The first stage -- 60 years ago -- was based on mechanical technology and is still operational today in Bucharest, at the Telephone Palace. The second stage began in the 1960's, with technology assimilated from domestic production. The first step was made by Electromagnetica in this respect. Now we are entering the third stage, based on the computerization of telephone communications. Therefore, this is a good experience, properly appreciated by both the French and Romanian sides. A second experience that I would like to mention is linked to my recent visits and talks with the Bouygues company. This is one of the strongest and internationally known companies in construction. It is building the most important project currently under construction in Bucharest, namely the World Trade Center, as an institution that will be integrated into the global computerized communication network in international trade, with its center at the World Trade Center in New York. The complex will include a Star Jument Hotel, shops, exhibition halls, and office space for commercial companies. This also represents an interesting experiment. Bouygues has cooperated with Romanian designers, experts, and engineers, hence it has been a good experience. Bouygues plans to expand this kind of activity in Romania. Similarly, there are cooperation ventures in electronics, the start of cooperation with companies from Lorraine, and there are interesting projects in agriculture; in this respect, I recently visited a seed-producing joint company. I would also note a three-year-old joint experiment in sugar beet growing and processing. I visited the Urziceni factory, which has joined the project and has shown good and profitable results, including for our French partner. There are quite a few projects that prove the use and mutual benefit of cooperation. Both of our sides assessed the volume of this participation as still rather modest. However, despite certain difficulties, we believe that it is possible to expand it. I have examined this matter with the representatives of the French employers and with Prime Minister Balladur, who promised to examine certain aspects directly linked to credits, so as to ensure the appropriate facilities. Therefore, I believe that my visit and talks have made an important contribution to stimulating common interests along these lines. [Correspondent] Mr. President, since I suspect you of being an emotional man, I would like to suggest the following scenario: Suppose that you had just arrived in Paris now, not in your capacity as president, but as simple Romanian citizen, and had discovered Paris adorned with Romanian and French flags. The question is: What kind of thoughts would spring to your mind? Then, I would like you to tell me whether you can give us some details about the continuation of the French-Romanian dialogue at high or other levels. [Iliescu] Regarding the emotional aspect, I would obviously feel very pleased with such an expression of mutual sentiments of friendship, which are but a continuation of a very rich tradition throughout our history. Regarding the prospects for continued dialogue, this is very clear. We are talking about determination to continue this dialogue. We are expecting the visit of the French foreign minister to Bucharest at the beginning of next autumn. Similarly, we have invited Prime Minister Balladur to visit Romania at the end of the year, and Mr. Balladur has accepted. We have also invited the president of France, Mr. Francois Mitterrand, to pay another visit to Romania. We also expect a number of visits at the ministerial level this year, in order to work out the concrete details of the joint projects in various fields, including the economic one.
