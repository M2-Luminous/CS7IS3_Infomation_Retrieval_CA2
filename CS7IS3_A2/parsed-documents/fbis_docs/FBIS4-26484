The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Premier Kang Song-san said that his government will send a high-level delegation for the pre-summit talks. Kang Song-san today notified his South Korean counterpart Yi Yong-tok that the DPRK has accepted Seoul's proposal for a preparatory meeting on June 28. He said a seven-member DPRK delegation, to be headed by an official of vice-premier level, will travel to the truce village of Panmunjom for the meeting. "The tense political situation on the peninsula has now made the idea of a summit more mandatory than at any other time," Kang said in the message. He said that this high level meeting of the two sides will be an historic event. "It will give the 70 million Korean people the joy of reconciliation and unity and renew hopes for a country of peace and unification," added Kang. "It has been the DPRK's consistent policy to remove distrust and confrontation between the North and the South and open a new phase of national reunification independently and peacefully," said the message. On June 18, former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited the DPRK on June 15-18, relayed to South Korean President Kim Yong-sam an oral message from DPRK President Kim Il-song, saying he was ready to hold a North-South summit with Kim Yong-sam unconditionally and at any time or place. Then on Monday [20 June] Yi Yong-tok suggested to Kang Song-san that a preliminary contact be made to discuss detailed arrangements for the summit, to be held at Panmunjom at 10:00 A.M. local time on June 28 (Tuesday). A South Korean Government official welcomed the DPRK's reply, saying that the message came within the quickest timeframe. "It was in agreement with our proposal and this suggests that they are sincere in approaching the summit," he added.
