Johansson report: "The AK5 -- a Washout for Celsius"] [Text] The automatic carbine AK5 looked set to become a golden egg for Bofors, the Celsius group's weapons division. With orders from the Swedish Armed Forces totalling 670 million kronor [SKr], its subsidiary Carl Gustaf AB in Eskilstuna enjoyed the prospect of at least 10 years' profitable production. Instead, the AK5 seems to have become a flop. The Armed Forces have been sending a steady flow of complaints to Bofors for seven years. Today will see the start of warranty negotiations, which may cost Bofors SKr100 million. This has been a blow to the quality images of Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB, and there will also be consequences for the Swedish defense establishment. With depots full of defective weapons, Sweden's military preparedness is far from what it could have been. Carl Gustaf AB (formerly Gevaersfaktoriet) is a subsidiary of Bofors, which in its turn belongs to the listed Celsius group. Bofors has worked intensely for a couple of years to eliminate its quality problems, but apparently to no avail. According to field reports the rate of faults seems to be getting higher rather than lower. The Materials Administration (FMV) of the Armed Forces has now had enough. Final warranty negotiations concerning the AK5 will start on Thursday [5 May]. By 1 June at the latest, the parties will have sorted out the responsibities for the faults and their payment. Defense professionals have known for a long time that the AK5, the Swedish soldier's standard-issue weapon, is not up to the mark. The fact that the problems have been kept within the family is perhaps an indication of the degree of loyalty shown in this case. If Swedish weapons do not work, it is best that the world outside should not be aware of it. But this has caused an even worse storm behind the military scenes. The complaints and failure reports that keep piling up express a suppressed fury about the low quality of the material. The catalogue of defects in the AK5 will soon be as long as the spare-parts list. And these are no mere trivial faults. Many of them are classified as security risks, e.g., cocks that break and weapons in which the safety catch goes off by itself. There were other faults, particularly embarrasing to the supplier, such as parts manufactured to incorrect dimensions and a paint work so poor that the weapons have to be repainted. Problems have dogged the AK5 ever since 1987, when Carl Gustaf AB in Eskilstuna delivered the first units of this license-manufactured automatic carbine of Belgian origin. Here are some samples of the reports: Several faults were found after only one year. As a result, 40,000 weapons were returned to Bofors to be modified on seven points. In February 1992 broken cocks were reported on 20 percent of the guns. The deliveries were stopped following rejection of the results from wearing-in firing tests. In April 1992 the FMV complained that the AK5's failure rate was abnormally high and involved safety risks. In January 1993 the Naval Forces reported that the oil box was cracked on every fourth weapon. In the spring of 1993, Swedish UN soldiers in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] were issued with weapons that did not function. There were great risks of accidental shots, the cartridge clips had to be changed. In February 1993 the Army Infantry and Cavalry Center in Borensberg reported several cases when the weapons had cocked spontaneously, when carried on the back. FMV ordered Bofors to stop deliveries on several occasions, while the faults were being corrected. Bofors reacted by implementing a thorough investigation on each new report of faults from the field, hoping that this would be the end of the problems. This included the ambulatory control of 764 weapons, reported two weeks ago. But the problems are by no means over and done with. On the contrary, reports of faults continue to flow in. As late as March 1994, Marinkommando Syd reported that "the AK5's failure rate is on the increase in spite of all modifications." Up to 85 percent of the weapons are said to be defective. And now, in the early days of spring, FMV authorities realized that nothing more could be achieved by investigations. It was time to settle the affair with the supplier. Bofors has already poured millions into modifications and repairs and the manufacturing spare parts in parallel with other production. But this is only the beginning. Carl Gustaf AB delivers thousands of AK5 carbines to the units every month. The repairs can hardly keep pace with this tempo, so the number of defective weapons in the depots is increasing. This, of course, is a source of concern to FMV Department Director Gunnar Engvall, who represents the state in this affair. The complaints regarding the AK5 are unlike anything he has ever seen before, either costwise or in terms of the prolonged agony. But Gunnar Engvall is also careful not to give the impression that all the weapons are faulty and under repair in the depots. "If the rate of faults in a batch reaches a certain percentage, then a complaint must be put in for the whole batch," he added. On the eve of the negotiations, Gunnar Engvall is also cautious about specifying the exact negotiating position of the state. It will then be easier to calculate the cost of all the repairs and modifications of the AK5. "How costly this will be depends on the way the work is organized," he added. "If we decide to have the repairs carried out locally, the cost may be closer to SKr100 million." This roughly equals Bofors' 1993 net profit after financing, i.e., SKr112 million. The company's turnover was SKr3.5 billion, of which more than 1 billion in exports. Carl Gustaf AB, which chalked up sales worth SKr263 million in 1992, achieved a profit of SKr76,000 after balance-sheet allocations. The company exports account for 10 to 20 percent of the sales figure, although no AK5 weapons are exported. The Celsius group achieved total sales worth SKr11.6 billion in 1993. The operating result was SKr348 million and the net result after financing was SKr721 million. Bofors must pay, says Gunnar Engvall. "The supplier is responsible for the construction and thus also responsible for the defects of the product." His claim is supported by stipulations in the three contracts regulating the deal that include detailed specifications for dealing with faults and delays. Why the long delay before clearing up the issues of responsibility? "We wanted to make use of the weapon's four-year warranty period to catch as many of the faults as possible. The faults have been reported to Bofors on a continuous basis. But after all investigations, it is now clear that we can not get any further." The whole affair is painful to Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB. That a high-technology industry with a functioning quality control should let so many defective products through is unacceptable. Hitherto the supplier has been represented by Peter Bring, Carl Gustaf's marketing manager. He also represents Bofors in the warranty negotiations. "There have been too many problems," he said. But Peter Bring does not want to make any statements regarding responsibility so as not to forestall negotiations with FMV. Have you learned anything from the problems? "Among other things, that this kind of a mass production requires quality supervision of the subsuppliers." Peter Bring is convinced that Bofors and FMV will reach a solution. They will not have to resort to the arbitration procedures defined in the agreement. The main tasks for Bofors and Carl Gustaf AB will be to restore confidence in their quality control. Otherwise there may be problems, one of which is brewing already, namely a contract for the reconditioning of the older AK4 automatic carbine, which was earlier seen as earmarked for Carl Gustaf AB. It now seems that most of the job will go to the Armed Forces own workshops instead.
