Three criminals were killed and a number of others were injured. Another Islamic resistance group delivered a devastating blow to a security center in the city of al-Bakr, north of al-Nasiriyah. Six regime members were injured and massive material damage was inflicted on the center. Our sources noted panic among the regime agents. The authorities almost completely closed off the entrances to al-Nasiriyah, isolating the governorate from the other southern and central governorates. Searches, raids, and arrests of citizens were launched and the regime forces were put on maximum alert.
