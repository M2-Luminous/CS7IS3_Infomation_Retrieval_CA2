FR940207-0-00005 FR940207-0-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 92&hyph;ANM&hyph;25] Alteration of Class E Airspace AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action changes the names of two VHF Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) aids, and one VHF Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) aid, within the airspace designations of certain Class E airspace areas located in Oregon and Idaho. A navigational aid (NAVAID) with the same name as the airport should be located on the airport. This action reflects the name changes, where necessary, of the NAVAID's that are not located on the airport with which they are associated. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert L. Brown, ANM&hyph;535, Federal Aviation Administration, Docket No. 92&hyph;ANM&hyph;25, 1601 Lind Avenue S.W. Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056, Telephone (206) 227&hyph;2535, Fax (206) 227&hyph;1530. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On December 24, 1992, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to change the names of three NAVAID's within the airspace designations of certain Class E airspace areas located in Oregon and Idaho (57 FR 61343). FAA Handbook 7400.2 states that a NAVAID with the same name as the associated airport should be located on the airport. Therefore, the names of the three NAVAID's associated with the airports, but not located on the airport surfaces, were proposed to be changed. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice, except: The coordinates for the Medford-Jackson County Airport, Oregon, and the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, Idaho, have been changed to reflect the latest data. Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``transition area'' and replaced it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' Other than that change in terminology, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. The coordinates in the proposal were North American Datum 27; however, these coordinates have been updated to North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 6002 and 6004 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be subsequently published in the order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations changes the names of two VORTAC's and one VOR/DME within certain Class E airspace designations in the states of Oregon and Idaho. A NAVAID with the same name as the airport should be located on the airport. This action reflects the name changes, where necessary of the NAVAID's that are not located on the airport with which they are associated.
