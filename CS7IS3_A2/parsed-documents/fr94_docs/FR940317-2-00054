FR940317-2-00054 FR940317-2-00038 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio; Request for an Exemption From Tying Provisions Banc One Corporation, Columbus, Ohio (Banc One), has requested, pursuant to section 106(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 (12 U.S.C. 1971 et seq. ) (Section 106(b)), that the Board grant an exemption to permit Banc One's subsidiary banks to vary the consideration on a loan, deposit, discount, or trust service (``traditional banking products'') for customers that receive first lien mortgage loans on 1-4 family residential real estate (mortgage loans) from Banc One's mortgage subsidiary, Banc One Mortgage Corporation, Indianapolis, Indiana (BOMC). Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit BOMC to vary the consideration on mortgage loans for customers who have obtained or will obtain a traditional banking product from any of Banc One's subsidiary banks. BOMC originates and refinances mortgage loans, primarily for sale into the secondary market. In 1994, Banc One intends to reorganize BOMC as an operating subsidiary of Bank One, Indianapolis, N.A., Indianapolis, Indiana. In this connection, Banc One also has requested an exemption to permit its banks and BOMC to continue to offer customers the price reductions described above after the reorganization. Section 106(b) permits a bank to fix or vary the consideration for extending credit or furnishing services on condition that a customer also obtain a traditional banking product from that bank. However, Section 106(b) prohibits a bank from engaging in these same activities on condition that the customer obtain any additional credit or services from any affiliate. The Board may grant an exception that is not contrary to the purposes of this provision. 1 1 See, e.g. , 12 U.S.C. 1972(1). Banc One contends that its proposal is consistent with the purposes of Section 106(b) because the proposal is not anticompetitive. Banc One argues that the market for mortgage loans and for traditional banking products is highly competitive, and that BOMC does not have sufficient market share on a local, nationwide, or other basis to adversely affect competition. Banc One also argues that the proposal will promote competition and will not limit the availability of products to consumers because the traditional banking products offered by Banc One's subsidiary banks and mortgage loans from BOMC will be separately available to customers. Notice of Banc One's request is published solely in order to seek the views of interested persons on the issues presented by the request and does not represent a determination by the Board that the request meets or is likely to meet the standards of Section 106(b). The request may be inspected at the offices of the Board of Governors. Any comments or requests for hearing should be submitted in writing and received by William W. Wiles, Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551, not later than April 15, 1994. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March 11, 1994.
