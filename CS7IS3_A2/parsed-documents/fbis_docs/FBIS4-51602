"I can assure my fellow countrymen that there won't be another coup," Gen Wimon said yesterday. "Those who always sniff up (rumors of) a coup must have a bad, non-functional nose. These neurotic people deserve all the derision and scorn of the public." Wimon also urged the media to ignore "ignorant and unsupported" predictions of another coup. He was responding to an academic's comments that present political uncertainty could result in the military again stepping in. Chalongphop Suksangkan, the director of the Thailand Development Research Institute, said on Wednesday he believed there could be another coup unless Prime Minister Chuan Likphai dissolves the House of Representatives to defuse the political crisis. His widely-publicized comment was made at a seminar organized by the Board of Trade. Chalongphop said the bombings in the South and the perceived poor performance of the government had hurt the economy and could lead to political tensions resulting in a coup. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters at Government House yesterday that the likelihood of another coup was a non-issue and not worth discussing. "I would like to ask those (who keep talking about the possibility of a coup): Are you doing this because you cannot hold your tongue, or because you want it to happen?" A visibly annoyed Chuan said the public should help find ways to accelerate the country's democratization process rather than paying attention to "unproductive speculation." "The country's democratization has come a long way. But the political development still is not fast enough for some groups of people," Chuan said. "My advice is don't give up hope. We are making steady progress." Politicians and senior military officers said talking about a possible coup was counter-productive to the growth of democracy. Such talk would only damage Thailand's credibility in the eyes of the international community and scare away foreign investors.
