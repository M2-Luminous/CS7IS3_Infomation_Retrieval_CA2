Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that according to Gen. Yatom, these figures are not final but are based on the information available as of last night. The number of people wounded is still being examined. Gen. Yatom added that he has worked out new procedures governing prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs but has not submitted them to the political echelon yet. Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq told the committee that the newspapers published a list of names of 47 people killed in the massacre. An examination of this list, however, showed that several of the persons on it are still alive and that some were only wounded. The list also includes some inaccurate names. The chief of staff believes this is the reason for the gap between the various calculations.
