Alarm Over Nuclear Weapons in Ukraine Growing"] [Text] As a result of persistent efforts by Russian, U.S., and Ukrainian politicians and diplomats, a trilateral agreement was concluded 14 January this year and the Moscow Declaration on Implementing the START I Treaty and the Lisbon Protocol was signed. It appears that the future of nuclear missile weapons in Ukraine, which has caused so much concern in the world, had been settled in such a way as to suit everyone's interests, primarily Kiev's. The Russian side declared its willingness to proceed to practical implementation of the agreements that had been reached. There was every reason to assume that the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense thought likewise, which was evidenced by the Ukrainian military's proposal to hold talks in order to coordinate a plan for shipping nuclear weapons [boyepripasy] to Russian territory. However, literally 10 days later, the Ukrainian defense minister issued an order on transporting the weapons to their "S" installations. And at a Ministry of Defense Collegium session 21 January, the commander of the 43d Missile Army and the commander of the 46th Division were forced to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. This unilateral step constituted a gross violation of all the understandings that had been reached earlier, including the Agreement on the Status of Strategic Nuclear Forces signed by the heads of the CIS in February 1992. If the troops of the 43d Missile Army start taking an oath of allegiance to Ukraine, Ukraine's objective of gaining full control over the nuclear forces located on its territory will be all but realized. In conditions in which Ukraine proclaims the principle of nonuse of nuclear weapons from its territory, the fact that the command of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces retains combat control is a formality. Were these steps by the Ukrainian side unexpected? A chronology of the events of the past two years rules this out. -- Back on 5 April 1992 the Ukrainian president issued an edict subordinating all military formations located on Ukrainian territory, including strategic nuclear forces, to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense. Despite the CIS countries' agreement that they would include them in unified strategic forces under a unified command. This edict gave instructions to organize administrative control of the Ukrainian Strategic Nuclear Forces. -- Three weeks later the defense minister issued his own edict announcing the organization of administrative control of strategic forces. The Administrative Control Center was set up. -- During 1992 troops at Air Force missile supply technical bases and "S" installations were made to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. In practice this led to a decline in their combat readiness, because a large number of officers refused to take the oath. A group was formed of the remaining specialists which was practically incapable of working with nuclear weapons. This was the conclusion drawn by the Ukrainian side itself. -- In summer 1992, under a directive from the Ukrainian Armed Forces General Staff, "S" installations, which were formerly under the exclusive command of the Russian Ministry of Defense Main Directorate, were amalgamated with the 43d Missile Army and subordinated to its commander with instructions to make them ready for combat use. It should be noted that this is not the function of the Army and Strategic Missile Forces, and they do not have the resources to administer "S" installations. Politicians and servicemen alike looked for a way out of the situation that had developed. Everyone realized that nuclear security is no joking matter, and neither are missiles. On 3 September 1993 agreements were concluded in Yalta, including agreements on recycling nuclear weapons and warranty inspection (the latter was to have come into force immediately, from the moment of signing), but a note from the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stated that it refused to implement these important agreements. Their ratification was linked to a resolution of the tactical nuclear weapons issue. As a consequence of the note issued by the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, instructions were given to suspend the freedom of movement of weapons and technology with a view to carrying out maintenance and technical servicing of ICBM groupings as a whole. Troops of the 43d Missile Army were barred from executing directives issued by the Strategic Missile Forces Main Command without the consent of the Ukrainian Administrative Control Center, otherwise criminal proceedings could be instituted. This threatening order, incidentally, contradicted the Ukrainian president's edict on preserving the functions of operational control exercised by the Strategic Missile Forces command. The principal danger of interference in operational control is that personal responsibility for nuclear missile weapons has been destroyed. ...On 19 November 1993 the Ukrainian Supreme Council ratified the START I Treaty with the stipulation that, together with the Lisbon Protocol to the treaty which Ukraine had signed, it is becoming impossible to implement the treaty. Ukraine thus directly proclaimed itself the owner of its nuclear weapons. And now the servicemen of the 43d Army are being asked to swear an oath of allegiance to Ukraine. What does this last step mean? The Strategic Missile Forces High Command believes that, with the adoption of the Ukrainian oath, the Strategic Missile Forces will completely forfeit the potential to operationally administer the 43d Army. Ukraine is left alone with its nuclear weapons. Whereas missile troops in Russia and Ukraine used to be united by a single oath and used to ensure the proper level of combat alert status and maintenance of missile weapons despite all the hardships and difficulties, and whereas they used to resolve nuclear security questions jointly, now all this has been ruled out. Ukraine is in the most danger. Many experienced specialists could quit owing to their unwillingness to take the oath. Quite recently KRASNAYA ZVEZDA reported that one-third of officers have already expressed a desire to serve in Russia. Current forecasts show that this number is growing. Specialists stress that if officer strength level in missile units were to fall to 60 percent, they will become unfit for combat. This raises the fear that the system of combat alert status and maintenance of hardware and weapons will be disrupted. The situation that has developed will not only prevent us from implementing the agreement with Ukraine on further removal of missile regiments from combat alert status, but will also hamper efforts to ensure that missiles are kept in safe state. Today a number of missiles on alert status are irreparable. It is impossible to repair them, the maintenance details do not even have enough fuel to travel to the launch site. But something else is more frightening still: All guarantees of nuclear security are being discarded. Stanislav Voronin, chief designer of nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, who visited the Pervomaysk division recently, noted that owing to political ambitions, an unwillingness to accept assistance, and an inability to cope with problems on their own, "gross violations of the most elementary rules and norms for dealing with nuclear weapons are evident." What amounts to the removal of specialists on the basis of the Ukrainian oath could, not to put too fine a point on it, lead to a disaster even worse than Chernobyl. Approximately 500 nuclear weapons are stockpiled in storage facilities, which is six to eight times above the norm. ...Overnight Ukraine has destroyed everything that was achieved recently in Moscow. The requirement that missile troops have to swear an oath of allegiance is destroying the 43d Army. Once again there is alarm about the future of nuclear missile weapons in Ukraine.
