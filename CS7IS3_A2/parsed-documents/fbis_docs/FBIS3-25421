At Ulundi today IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader and kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said it was incorrect to describe the latest proposals as concessions. Other members of the Freedom Alliance said the ANC was conducting a publicity exercise. Conrad Burke reports: [Begin recording] [Burke] Last night Mr. Mandela said the ANC had agreed to a double ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional constitutions, and greater regional taxation powers. [passage omitted] But, says Dr. Buthelezi and the Afrikaner Volksfront's [Afrikaner National Front] General Constand Viljoen, the wording is vague, they did not like negotiations by press conference, and the whole issue would have to be thrashed out by the Freedom Alliance partners. [Buthelezi] All that they are referring to is a package which Mr. Meyer, the minister of constitutional development, offered to Freedom Alliance negotiators about two weeks ago. It was a package which started with the ballot paper, a double ballot, etc., which came from the National Party, which did not go far enough to address the issue of the powers of regions. I mean, to make certain that there are powers, because even Mr. Mandela in his statement just vaguely spoke about powers of regions, in a vague sort of way. While one welcomes the idea that parliament should be called -- because I think that decision needs to serve as a positive thing -- that they are prepared to call parliament. One hopes that they are going to use the time now, you know, to really, you know, just take that extra mile. [Viljoen] And the question we ask is: Will there really be a volkstaat [homeland], because we want the interim constitution amended to such an extent that we would like to have the volkstaat? My people are claiming the volkstaat to be in position before 27 April. Now there is no indication to us that this is a finality, and the Afrikaner will not be able to be appeased by anything but a very substantial proof that what we have in mind for the Afrikaner will eventually materialize. [passage omitted] Pan-Africanist Congress leader Clarence Makwetu said the organization was still studying the package. He couldn't decide yet whether it amounted to a significant offer. [Makwetu] We are not quite certain whether they are concessions. [end recording]
