Article is a response to the 30 April NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA interview with A. Kuntsevich which appeared in the 11 May FBIS Arms Control Report, p. 6.] [Text] In January 1993 Russia signed a convention banning the development, production, stockpiling or use of chemical weapons and requiring their destruction. The convention was drawn up with participation by 70 states, with negotiations extending over a period of 10 years. In October 1993 all the U.N. member states approved it, the kind of full consensus that one rarely finds in international affairs. Now the world community is closely following the process by which the Convention is considered and ratified by the principal countries, i.e those that produce chemical weapons. These includes the states of the European Economic Community, Japan, China, the United States and Russia. The statutes of the Convention will take effect 180 days after the 65th ratification resolution is handed over for safekeeping, but not earlier than two years after its completion and signing, i.e. not before January 1995. Now it is already May 1994, and the day is not far off when the Russian State Duma will have to make a decision regarding ratification of the Convention. Parliamentary hearings on this issue were held on 24 March. All those attending were of one opinion: the Convention must be ratified, because that is in Russia's national interest and will help establish a more lasting peace on our planet. However, those attending also expressed concern that as we take this responsibility upon ourselves we must also measure our capabilities, and in that context it is above all essential to have a tool for implementing the Convention requirements: a "Concept for the Elimination of Chemical Weapons (CW) in Russia." A draft concept was in fact presented at the parliamentary hearings on behalf of the Russian Federation Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues. The draft in a way builds on the "Comprehensive Program for Gradual Elimination of Chemical Weapons in the Russian Federation," which was drawn up by the same committee in 1992. Were answers to all the questions of interest to those attending the hearings found in the proposed draft? Unfortunately not. Firstly, the draft concept to a certain extent only reflects the issue of destroying toxic agents and leaves completely open the problem of how to destroy CW. Yet it is a well-known fact that the toxic agent "filling" comprises only 10 percent of the total mass of materials slated for destruction. Finding ways to utilize the shell casings, bombs, filling equipment and special missile components is an equally complicated and expensive undertaking. Secondly, the draft makes no provision for options with regard to destruction technology. In fact, both the Comprehensive Program and the draft Concept give exclusive preference to the chemical method. Yet at the same time all references to chemical-based technologies are in the future tense, indicating that they are still being developed. Thirdly, the proposed national Convention is clearly biased in favor of foreign technology. That bias is so strong that Point 6, Section 13 of the draft flatly states that one precondition for Russia's fulfillment of its international commitments with regard to CW destruction is "the attraction of financial and technological aid from foreign countries in connection with destruction of the Russian Federation's chemical weapons, including the construction of 'turnkey' CW destruction facilities in Russia." It can clearly be predicted that implementation of that passage will result in Russia's technical and hence political dependency on its Western partners. And the insignificant $50 million in U.S. aid intended to supply an experimental installation will wind up causing billions more to flow out of our country and into foreign banks. Realizing the importance and timeliness of resolving the issue of large-scale CW destruction, in addition to Khimprom (which manufactures toxic agents) several organizations under other ministries have also begun developing various technological alternatives, often doing so at their own initiative. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA has already reported on one possible alternative technology for complete and comprehensive CW destruction -- use of nuclear explosions (see: NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 29 March 1994). There exist other proposals as well. For example, the Central Scientific Research Institute for Machine Building under the Russian Space Agency has under the direction of A. I. Papush, a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, developed a high-temperature technology and created a working model of a unit designed to neutralize highly toxic substances. On 29 December 1993 destruction of the principal CW components was demonstrated using that experimental unit, along with the scientific and technical principles of this method. In essence the proposed technological process is based on a thermochemical method of transforming a neutralized substance. The experimental unit measures 8.0x1.5x1.5 meters and has a capacity of 1 metric ton per hour. The unit's mobility makes it possible to destroy CW (or toxic agents) at their storage sites. Unfortunately, neither the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense, represented by its Radiation, Chemical and Biological Defense Troops, nor the Russian Federation Presidential Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues, which was headed until recently by A. Kuntsevich, has paid proper attention to this domestically-designed innovation. Its inventors were even refused access to a certain number of appropriate formulas in connection with their demonstration. Yet the "chemical" generals have shown some interest in and consented to the conducting of tests in Russia using experimental units made in the United States and Germany. I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the best intentions with which this draft Concept was developed. But the national Concept should be understandable to every citizen of our country, just as in the end it will not be with "aid" from overseas that the problem of CW elimination will be solved, but with the money of Russia's taxpayers. What would I like to see in the Concept? Firstly, it should reflect the principal ways and means of destroying chemical weapons specifically, not just toxic agents, as envisioned by the international Convention. Secondly, it should make provision for the use of various technologies for CW destruction, depending on the state and conditions of CW and toxic agent storage. For example, munitions in a hazardous state of decay would be destroyed at the site where they are presently located using the aforementioned thermochemical method; toxic agents stored in large containers would be destroyed at refitted Khimprom enterprises; cannister, artillery and airborne chemical weapons would be destroyed with the help of nuclear detonation technology; and so on. The Concept should confirm the most efficient use for each of the proposed technologies, not pit one against the other. What must be done in order to accomplish that? It is clear that there is no point in assigning the aforementioned Committee on Conventional Chemical and Biological Weapons Issues to edit the draft Concept a third time. That should be done by a different team, which should include representatives of all the organizations that are offering various technologies for the destruction of CW (or toxic agents), as well as representatives of CW customers and manufacturers, environmentalists, doctors and economists. Their efforts should be covered by the media in a generally intelligible form at both the Federation-wide level and at the local and regional levels. This team's primary task should be to organize and conduct comprehensive assessments (technical, environmental and economic) of all proposed technologies, including mandatory demonstrations. After this collective assessment has been made, the most environmentally safe and economically appropriate CW destruction technologies should be determined, and this should not be done independently by the customer (the Ministry of Defense), as stipulated in Point 5.6 of the draft. I am convinced that if the issue is formulated in this way Russia is capable not only of destroying its own CW within the established time limits at a minimal cost, but also of providing assistance to other countries around the world.
