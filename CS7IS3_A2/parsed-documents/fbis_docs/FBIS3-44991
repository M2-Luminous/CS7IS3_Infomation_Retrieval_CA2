The traces of Chinese household administrative methods for economic management under the planned economy model are notably retained. To meet the needs of market economic development, it is necessary to deepen reform in the taxation system in accordance with the principle of unified tax law, fair tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power distribution. First, it is possible to better uphold tax management in accordance with the law and exercise authority in tax collection only with a unified taxation law. A unified taxation law is not only conducive to breaking down man-made boundaries separating regions and to establishing fair exchanges of commodities among enterprises in different regions for promoting the establishment of a unified market, but also conducive to implementing state guidance and regulation in market economic development. This is to reflect and bring into play the role of the market mechanism and to strengthen the unanimity of macroeconomic regulation and control. Second, it is possible to ensure fair competition among enterprises only with a fair tax-sharing system. The precise reason for the efficiency of market economy is competition. Enterprises are independent producers and merchandisers of commodities, and a vital condition for their survival and development also lies in competition. However, competition must be fair. Whether or not a fair tax-sharing system can be implemented bears decisive significance to ensuring fair competition. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the principle of fair tax-sharing for all different types of enterprises for promoting fair competition. Third, it is possible to optimize the taxation system only with a simplified taxation system. In the current taxation system, there is an excessive number of interim tax categories; an exclusion of a small number of essential tax categories; a loose taxation system structure; and an irrational distribution of tax categories, thus affecting the overall efficiency of the taxation system. The purpose of simplifying the taxation system is to further rationalize the system structure to make it more efficient. Fourth, it is possible to better handle the distribution between the central authorities and localities only with the rational distribution of powers. Our country is a vast territory and economic development in different regions is rather unbalanced. Therefore, it is essential to suitably change the situation of the past where the powers in taxation matters were overconcentrated in the hands of the central authorities, when it actually could not handle -- or efficiently handle -- tax matters. Under the prerequisite of unifying the taxation law, tax categories that concern the implementation of state policy on macroeconomic control and regulation should come under the control of the central authorities. Tax collection powers that concern the regulation of industrial production structure should be undertaken by the central authorities. The authority for formulating procedures for tax collection and management favorable to local governments' regulation of local economy and income, and even the power to enact a few local tax laws, should all be given to localities. There is an inherent unity in unified taxation law, fair tax-sharing, simplified taxation system, and rational power distribution. The core function is to suit the changes in national income distribution, standardize the distribution methods, and regulate distribution so as to form a rational distribution mechanism for promoting a healthy development for the socialist market economy.
