Under the new measure, Taiwan banks' overseas branches will be allowed to do business directly with Mainland China's overseas branches, and will no longer have to go through foreign banks' overseas branches, the official said. Overseas branches of Taiwan banks can also do business directly with foreign banks' mainland branches. Previously, Taiwan banks wishing to do business with mainland banks had to first go through foreign banks' overseas branches and then through foreign banks' mainland branches. The Finance Ministry is expected to submit the new measure during a meeting on July 4, the official said.
