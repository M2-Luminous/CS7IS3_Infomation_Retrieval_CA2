American media reports have said U.S. senators including Max Baucus sent letters to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa saying that Japan is infringing on a bilateral agreement to move toward a reciprocal total abolishment of tariffs on forestry products. The agreement referred to was one reached in June 1990. The United States at the time requested that Japan cut tariffs by more than 33 percent on 51 selected items. The senators are requesting that the issue be discussed when Hosokawa visits Clinton in February. But agency officials said the case is closed with the conclusion of the Uruguay Round.
