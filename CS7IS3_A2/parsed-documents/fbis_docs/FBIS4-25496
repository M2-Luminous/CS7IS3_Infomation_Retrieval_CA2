In 1992, China, with $25.5 billion worth of exports to the United States, overtook Taiwan for the first time. In 1993, China left Taiwan further behind, with $31.4 billion worth of exports to $23.5 billion from Taiwan. China's exports to the United States amounted to $7.4 billion for the first quarter this year, nearly 40 percent higher than the $5.3 billion worth achieved by Taiwan. It is predicted that the competition in foreign trade between the two shores will be getting more acute since the United States has now renewed the most-favored-nation [MFN] status for China. And the mainland, as a traditional exporter of labor-intensive products, is expected to gain a still greater share of the U.S. market. For years the United States has always been the largest market for Taiwan exports. In recent years, however, Taiwan's competitive power as a traditional exporter of labor-intensive products has been declining because of the increase in production costs as a result of labor shortages and wage increases. Consequently Taiwan export market share in the United States has been decreasing year by year. Taiwan's exports to the United States have been continuously declining since 1987, and Taiwan product market share has decreased from 6.07 percent in that year down to 4.34 percent in 1993. Meanwhile, however, China's share of the U.S. market has been expanding from 1.55 to 5.46 percent during the same period. Of the traditional Chinese and Taiwan exports to the United States, China-made garments, plastic products, furniture, and shoes exported to the United States increased by 22, 59, 44, and 32 percent respectively in 1993; whereas Taiwan-made garments, plastic products, and shoes exported to the United States decreased by 7.1, 6.6, and 30.8 percent respectively, only furniture exports which registered a slight increase of 1.9 percent. What is more, China's toy exports to the United States has now surpassed by far Taiwan's past record in terms of export value. All these changes indicate that Taiwan has lagged behind China in terms of competitive power for quite a few export items in the U.S. market. The United States recently announced the renewal of the MFN status for China Mainland. This will give an impetus to further increasing the competitive power of China's exports to the U.S. market. And China's exports, especially labor-intensive products, will further expand their market share in the United States. To meet the increasingly keen competition between the two shores of the Taiwan Strait in foreign trade, Taiwan will need to step up its efforts to upgrade local industries, further readjust the composition of exports to the United States, and increase exports with high added value, otherwise it can hardly improve its position in the competition with China for share of U.S. market.
