Under the plan, the income tax rate would be 50 percent and the residential tax rate would be 15 percent, the officials said. The plan would also continue the present progressive tax system of levying the income tax in five stages of between 10 and 50 percent and the residential tax in three stages of between 5 and 15 percent. The panel's discussions will now focus on a possible raise in the minimum taxable income to lighten the tax burden for people with low-incomes and an expansion of an income bracket to which a tax rate of 10-20 percent would apply, the officials said. The latter proposal would reduce the tax burden for taxpayers with annual incomes of between 7 million and 12 million yen. The government's tax commission last November proposed that the maximum tax rate on personal income be cut to 50 percent from the present 65 percent. The proposal was widely criticized as benefiting the rich. The 65 percent tax rate currently applies to taxable income of more than 20 million yen, after various deductions.
