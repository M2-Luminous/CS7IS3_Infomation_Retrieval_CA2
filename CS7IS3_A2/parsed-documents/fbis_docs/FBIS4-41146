Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma Committee for International Relations, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday that the deputies received the text of the programme only a few hours before Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed it in Brussels today. He said that President Boris Yeltsin recommended setting up working groups in the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, with the participation of State Duma deputies to discuss the programme. However the Foreign Ministry had failed to arrange such discussions. "That's not the way for democratically minded people to treat the parliament," Lukin said.
