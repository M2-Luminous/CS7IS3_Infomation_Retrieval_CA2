FR940503-0-00025 FR940503-0-00006 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;ACE&hyph;03] Revision of Class D Airspace; Kansas City, MO, Richard-Gebaur Airport AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action amends the Class D airspace at the Kansas City Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri. This change is necessary to exclude the Hillside Airport at Stilwell, Kansas, from this Class D airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Dale L. Carnine, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, ACE&hyph;530b, Federal Aviation Administration, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; telephone number: (816) 426&hyph;3408. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On January 7, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class D airspace at the Kansas City Richards-Gebaur Airport, Missouri (59 FR 4608). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class D airspace areas are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) amends the Class D airspace at the Kansas City Richards-Gebaur Airport. On September 16, 1993, Airspace Reclassification discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area.'' Airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is an operating control tower is now Class D airspace. During the Airspace Reclassification project, the Hillside Airport at Stilwell, Kansas, was to be excluded from the Richards-Gebaur Class D airspace. However, it was inadvertently not addressed in the official description. Hillside is a public use airport which was established in 1956 and serves numerous non-radio aircraft, as well as ultralight vehicles. Under the rules prior to September 16, 1993, an aircraft could land and take off at this airport without contacting the Richards-Gebaur Tower. Under the present rules, an aircraft operating to/from the Hillside Airport must contact this Tower. The intended effect of this rule is to provide access for aircraft utilizing the Hillside Airport without the requirement to establish radio contact with the Richards-Gebaur Tower. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
