FBIS4-64306 "drweu084_n_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-084 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 NORDIC COUNTRIES Norway Poll: Conservatives, Center Parties Gain, FrP Drops Poll: Conservatives, Center Parties Gain, FrP Drops 94P20699A Oslo AFTENPOSTEN in Norwegian 16 Apr 94 p 2 94P20699A Oslo AFTENPOSTEN Norwegian CSO [Article by Harald Stanghelle] [Text] The Progress Party [FrP] drops the most in support while the Center Party, the Christian People's Party, and the Conservatives gain the most according to Opinion's party barometer for April. The April poll is based on 1,005 interviews conducted from Monday [11 April] to Wednesday of this week. Of those interviewed, 71.5 percent declared their party preference. The FrP, which is holding its national congress this weekend, drops the most. The party lost 1.3 percent support. At 4.3 percent it is now 2 percent below the very low election result last September. The FrP has experienced great fluctuations since its start together with the Anders Lange Party in 1973. Chairman Carl I. Hagen's party has now endured a long period of difficulty holding on to its voters. The trend has for a long time been one of low loyalty to the party. By now the level is catastrophically low: 51.3 percent. This means that only one-half of the voters who say they voted for the FrP last year continue to support the party. In comparison, the Center Party enjoys a loyalty of 81.8 percent, the Labor Party 78.9 percent, and even a party with such big problems as the Conservative Party has a loyalty percentage of 69.7. The Conservatives are advancing in the April poll. A likely explanation could be the national congress held last weekend. At that time the party finally got its new leadership installed so that it can now concentrate on its political message. The background data show that the Conservative Party is now mobilizing supporters who chose to stay home during the 1993 national election. This is a positive sign for the party. With a gain of 0.9 percent, the party's current support of 18.3 percent puts it notably above last year's poor election results. The Center Party also gets 18.3 percent support in April, an advance of 1.5 percent since the March poll. The party has an enormously high loyalty level (81.8 percent). The prospects for the party are definitely positive. The Center Party is getting voters both from the Socialist Left and the Christian People's parties. It appears to be perceived as the leading party on the no side [of the EU issue]. With gains of 1.4 percent, the Christian People's Party is definitely advancing, following several months of losing support. The April support of 7.5 percent places the party almost at the level of support in last year's election. The Socialist Left drops slightly, but rising loyalty may mean that the leakage from the Socialist Left to the Labor Party is about to stop. The Labor Party also drops only a little (0.6 percent), but it is interesting to note that in most polls taken in the past months the governing party has been dropping. The background data reveal heightened insecurity and increased voter leakage to other parties. Future polls will tell us more about whether or not this is connected to the EU issue.
