Bucharest--From our correspondent. Four years after the fall of the communist regime, the very clear revival of social disputes has thrown tens of thousands of demonstrators into the streets in Romania and multiplied work stoppages in the public sector during the second half of 1993. And, no doubt, the worst is yet to come. "Romanian trade unions are now reaching maturity. They have passed the simple boundaries of salary claims, to which they had limited themselves until recently, in order to tackle the problem of economic transition." The opinion is that of Octavian Partenie, an adviser to the prime minister in charge of relations with the trade unions, and it appears to be confirmed. The country's main federations of trade unions have, in effect, just issued a call for a general strike to take place during the last two weeks of January to protest the devastating effects of the economic crisis and to demand that the government resign. The issues leading to discontent among the workers are legion. Even though the restructuring of the sprawling public sector has not yet begun, the number of unemployed, according to official counts, has already reached 10.4 percent of the working-age population, but the true figure is doubtlessly much higher. Prices have increased 300 percent this year, flattening the savings and wages of a population that had already lost 40 percent of its purchasing power since 1989. More than one-third of the Romanian people now live below the poverty line with an average monthly wage of less than 300 francs, according to government statistics. And clouds are gathering on the horizon. The International Monetary Fund will certainly extend a new credit of $700 million to Bucharest, but that credit is accompanied by stern recommendations to accelerate reform and to enhance budgetary rigor. "Not a Capitalist Model" There are so many elements which probably will for the first time burden the population and thus provide new battalions of discontented people for the trade unions, which assert that they have already attracted more than two-thirds of all wage-earners. Nevertheless, their claims are not without a conspicuous paradox. Riding the swelling waves of discontent, they have made themselves champions of reform, even though that process could, in the end, risk transforming the unions into a party of union members. In essence, the restructuring processes have resulted inevitably in a multiplication of failures. As for the 500,000 PME [private entrepreneurial family associations] created since 1990 and already responsible for 30 percent of the gross domestic product, they are practically nonunionized. Bogdan Hossu, the leader of Cartel Alfa, one of the main confederations of trade unions, challenges this ambiguity: "We defend the construction of a social economy based on the market and not a South American-style capitalist model." To adapt to the new environment in the country, the trade unions have gradually tightened their ties with their base. A score of confederations participated in the first collective negotiations with the government in 1991. They now number less than ten, and it is thought that in a few months there will not be more than three or four which are truly representative. In other respects, the unions profit today from the result of better means of communication. Mr. Hossu charges: "The political parties are stalling, and the government has proved its incapacity to resolve the crisis." According to him, the trade unions are, therefore, "the only hope for the population," and the unions do not hesitate to venture into the political terrain. A few weeks ago, Miron Mitrea, the executive chairman of the CNSLR-Fratia [National Confederation of Free Trade Unions--Brotherhood], the other large workers' organization along with Cartel Alfa and National Trade Union Bloc, called for the formation of a "coalition cabinet," uniting an opposition party and several groups of the existing majority. Since then, the idea has been taken up again more widely. Courted by the political parties, the Romanian trade unions are raising the bids just when, exhausted by a difficult year, the government's days appear to be numbered. Unless, that is, the trade union quarrels and lack of unity do not allow the souffle to collapse. The negotiations with the government, lacking a common plan of action, as well as the more underhanded question of dividing up the funds of the UGSR [General Union of Trade Unions] (about 5 million francs), which was the only trade union organization under the communists, have made the unions' previous call for a general strike last May fail. Since then, the trade union leaders have dominated the dialogue. They manage the UGSR's war chest cooperatively, and it was with a single voice that they called for mobilization to take place in January, unless the consultations openned on 27 December by President Ilisecu with the leaders of the main political parties, lead to a future reshuffling of the government. The trade unions would then see their first demands satisfied, but, for all that, the deep causes of social tension would not disappear.
