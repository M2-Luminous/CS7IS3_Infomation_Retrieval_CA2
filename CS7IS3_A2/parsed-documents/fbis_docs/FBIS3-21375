In an unusual burst of letter writing, the U.S. president, Mr Bill Clinton, has raised the familiar ghosts that haunted U.S.-Indian relations in the past. In the first instance he replied to a Pakistani propagandist based in Washington, Mr Ghulam Nabi Fai. This allowed Islamabad to go to town releasing the contents of the letter. Mr Clinton then shot off a second letter within the fortnight to an obscure California congressman, Mr Gary Condit, reviving the phantom of "the threatened position of Sikhs in the Indian Union." The timing of the two letters sent by Mr Clinton to persons with known links has raised eyebrows in New Delhi about the real intention behind his move. U.S.-Indian relations in the first year of the Clinton presidency have not made rapid progress. This is partly due to the U.S. president's preoccupation with domestic issues. On the foreign policy front Mr Clinton was concerned with the bigger question arising out of the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the inherent instability in Russia. South Asia was given a separate existence by the state department. But the inability of the administration to either fill the post of assistant secretary of state for the area or send an envoy to New Delhi reflected the interest Washington has shown in the region during the past year. By creating a separate bureau south Asia may have won some individual standing within the system. But in doing so, the region has also been made vulnerable to the whims and fancies of one individual. In the earlier system the region was placed within the near east bureau. Any major policy initiative went all the way up the ladder to the deputy secretary of state. It meant the personal prejudices behind individual decision making were put to scrutiny. The absence of a clear cut policy for south Asia has been evident throughout the first year of the Clinton presidency. Administration officials have made confusing statements. No particular interest in India has been shown, save to look at it through the prism of the administration's global interest of drawing nuclear hold outs into the nuclear nonproliferation net. The Indian Space Research Organisation-Glavkosmos controversy sparked the first major rift between Washington and New Delhi. The United States unveiled its missile and space technology denial policy through Mr Clinton's speech at the United Nations in September 1993. India had no option but to oppose Washington's attempts to unilaterally choke the supply of high technology to countries trying to develop space vehicles. Such development challenged Washington's commercial supremacy in the field. The issue is delicately poised even today. Russia is vertically split on the question of supplying cryogenic rockets. Suggestions have been made that India be admitted to the missile technology control regime as a full participating member. The United States has argued this would require the consent of the member states. The second obstacle to improving bilateral ties is Washington's policy of preaching on Kashmir. The architect of this policy is the newly appointed assistant secretary of state, Ms Robin Raphel, who returned from New Delhi to take up the new job. Ms Raphel, in her new avatar as the prima donna of subcontinental affairs, has been exhibiting an imperiousness wholly out of place with the underlying principles of Washington's envisaged "new world order." The third contention concerns the reprocessing plant at Tarapur. The United States insists that notwithstanding the extension of the safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, India cannot run the plant without earning U.S. displeasure and possible retaliation. Not only does the U.S. diktat go against the terms of the international agreement, it speaks volumes on the confidence the United States has in the IAEA safeguards system which the United States itself insisted on creating in the Fifties. The fourth thorn troubling U.S.-India relations is Washington's attitude towards Pakistan's attempts to destabilise India and its aggressive pursuit of a nuclear weapons programme. During the last year of the Bush administration, Islamabad's responsibility for the abysmal situation in Kashmir was recognised. Pakistan was issued a series of warnings to stop backing Kashmiri militants. If it failed it would be placed on the infamous list of terrorist states. The exit of Mr George Bush got Islamabad off the hook. The Clinton administration was curiously unable to act upon the evidence already at hand. It sent signals to Pakistan that terrorism and covert destabilisation were not high enough on its agenda to merit instant reaction. This resulted in the attempt of Pakistani-sponsored militants storming the Hazratbal mosque. That effort failed. Islamabad, confident Washington would not punish it for its covert support to Kashmiri militants, has now launched a major propaganda offensive to keep Kashmir alive at international fora. Washington's escape hatch of pursuing an "even handed policy" in the subcontinent prevents the United States from publicly "advising" Ms Benazir Bhutto of the dangerous consequences of brinkmanship. Also intriguing is Washington's response to Islamabad's attempts to make its nuclear weapons status public. The Clinton administration is compelled by domestic political considerations to get the better of the legislative branch in the conduct of foreign policy. It therefore generally supports the repeal of the Pressler Amendment. Islamabad has been seeking the amendment's abolition, arguing it gives New Delhi a veto over the future state of relations in the subcontinent. In a bid to entangle both India and Pakistan into a bilateral nuclear nonproliferation deal, the U.S. administration has pursued the flawed concept of the five nation deal. This has been resisted by New Delhi. Mr Clinton's letters come at a time when the U.S. administration is taking an interest in foreign policy issues after a successful tour of Russia and east Europe. In Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the United States has successfully pushed a "money for denuclearisation" strategy. It appears to have made some progress in this direction. Conditions in south Asia are not similar and therein lie possible clues to the motives behind the letters. This is not the first time interested congressmen and political lobbyists have written to a U.S. president. It is arguable whether U.S. presidents have replied to all letters as a matter of "courtesy." It is also doubtful Mr Fai and Mr Condit corresponded with the president for the first time. Mr Fai is a regular participant in Pakistani television programmes beamed via satellite. He has actively sought the support of influential people in Washington for Islamabad's cause. He almost certainly would have written to various administrations in the past, if not received a reply. One wonders if Mr Clinton would reply to every letter Indians wrote him. The case of Mr Condit is even more intriguing. He is an obscure politician roped in by Islamabad to take up issues at its behest. By selectively harping on the human rights of a particular community, Mr Condit has sought to revive the Khalistan movement. Mr Clinton fell for the bait and replied in the same vein, ignoring that human rights excesses are common to all countries. In India or even Punjab it is not Sikhs alone whose human rights have been trampled upon. Punjab has beaten back the challenge of militancy. If human rights excesses have occurred, legal mechanisms exist for people to seek redressal. Punjab is not Bosnia. The press briefing of the U.S. spokeswoman threw up an even more bizarre viewpoint. She is reported to have said Washington could ask the state government directly about its human rights excesses. All this leads to the question why Washington took the calculated risk of issuing the controversial letters. Two factors could perhaps have influenced the course of action. One, the personal predilections of the assistant secretary of state who obviously had some axes to grind following her stay in New Delhi. Two, Washington must have realised some countervailing pressure had to be put on India for refusing a comprehensive south Asia nuclear and missile deal with Pakistan. With a year to go before the nonproliferation treaty review conference, Washington is getting restless. Universal application will continue to elude the treaty in its present form. The upshot of such countervailing pressure is they could derail the train of economic cooperation India and the United States have put together over the years. This is an issue in which the United States has more at stake than ordinary commercial interests.
