Only those personnel with a need to have access to the system are given user names and passwords. The magnetic tape backups have limited access in that users must justify the need and obtain tape numbers and volume identifiers from a central source before they are provided data tapes. Paper record and microfilm records are in limited access areas in locking storage cabinets. Retention and disposal: Leave and Earnings Statements, and pay records are microfilmed and retained on site four years, then archived at the Federal Record Center, and destroyed when 50 years old.

Duplicate magnetic copies of the pay and personnel record are retained at an off site facility for a useful life of seven years. Paper records for waivers and remissions are retained on site six years three months after the determination and then destroyed.
