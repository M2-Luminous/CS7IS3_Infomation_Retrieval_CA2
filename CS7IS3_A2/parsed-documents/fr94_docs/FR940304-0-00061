FR940304-0-00061 FR940304-0-00018 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Part 1312 [Ex Parte No. 218] Filing of Tariff Adoption Publications AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopts a regulation which establishes a 60-day deadline for the filing of adoption publications. The regulation is intended to remove any possible ambiguity with regard to the existing regulation, which requires that such publications be filed ``promptly''. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective April 3, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James W. Greene (202) 927&hyph;5597 or Charles E. Langyher, III (202) 927&hyph;5160. (TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: By decision served December 8, 1993 (58 FR 64717, December 9, 1993), the Commission requested public comments on the desirability of amending §1312.20(h) (49 CFR 1312.20(h)) to require that adoption publications be filed not more than 60 days after consummation of the event giving rise to their filing. The existing regulation specifies that adoption publications should be filed prior to consummation, if possible; and that, if for some reason filing cannot be accomplished prior to consummation, they should be filed as soon as possible thereafter, i.e. ``promptly''. The new regulation will replace ``promptly'' with the more specific requirement that adoption publications be filed no later than 60 days after consummation of the transaction. The regulation is not controversial. The National Bus Traffic Association, Inc. filed the only response to our notice of proposed rulemaking, and it supported the regulation. Timely filing of adoption publications is important. Absent a new carrier's filing of its own tariffs or adoption of the former carrier's tariffs, any operations conducted by the new carrier violate 49 U.S.C. 10761(a), which prohibits service by a carrier unless ``the rate for transportation or service is contained in a tariff that is in effect *␣*␣*''. Thus, the failure to timely file either new tariffs or adoption publications can result in a violation of the statute. Additionally, users and potential users of transportation services have no way of determining from the tariff system the rates for the new carrier's services unless adoption publications or new tariffs have been filed. We will adopt the regulation as proposed. As indicated in the notice of proposed rulemaking, the 60-day deadline is intended only as the maximum allowable time; it should not be viewed as an opportunity to delay filings beyond the consummation date. As stated in both the old and new regulations, adoption publications should be filed prior to the consummation date whenever possible. Environmental and Energy Considerations This rule revision will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. Regulatory Flexibility Analyses Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The action merely clarifies the timing of a one-time filing requirement already required by the Commission's regulations. Thus, no new substantive requirements are being imposed.
