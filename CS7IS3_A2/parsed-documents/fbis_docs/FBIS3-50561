The rebels left their positions in Oxchuc and Las Margaritas, while the Mexican Army expelled them from San Cristobal and Oconsingo, in northern and northeastern Chiapas State. Sources close to the Chiapas government have told EFE that it can be said unofficially that 200 people were killed, including rebels, civilians, and soldiers, and 500 were wounded during the past three days of conflict since the EZLN attacked several towns in Chiapas. They added that 25 rebels were captured during the military operations and that apparently one of them is "Commander Marcos," who appeared in a picture talking to the press at the San Cristobal mayor's office, which was reproduced by Mexican newspapers.
