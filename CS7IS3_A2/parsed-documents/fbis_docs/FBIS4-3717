These attempts will never be realized, said a spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) here today while commenting on a report related to the relations between Britain and China before and after 1997, issued by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons on April 13. The spokesman said the report advocated self-determination of Tibet in an attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs. It is known to all that since ancient times, he noted, Tibet has been an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Before 1959, he said, a system of feudal serfdom was practiced in Tibet, an insidious oppression darker and more cruel than that of the Middle Ages in Europe. The spokesman said old Tibet was one of the regions in the world which suffered most seriously from violations of human rights. After abolishing the serf system, Tibet began to march down the road of national unity, economic development and people living in peace and contentment. This is a reform of epoch-making significance toward safeguarding human rights and promoting social progress, he said. But the authors of the report do not like to see this kind of change. On the contrary, they describe the serf owners who trampled human rights as "guards of human rights," which he said pokes great fun at human rights. The purpose of making such claims is in fact to attempt to sabotage China's reunification and national unity, he said. The spokesman said: "We advise them to take a cautious attitude toward the issue of Tibet in light of what part Britain has played in history." The spokesman said the British House of Commons also suggests strengthening the ties between the British Parliament and Taiwan's "Legislative Yuan", calling on the British Government to ease its restrictions on Taiwan. He pointed out that there is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is part of its territory. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China, which he said has been recognized by the world community. The spokesman said that the points of view on the issue of Taiwan by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons run counter to the principles concerning the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Britain. Its real aim is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", which is firmly opposed by the entire Chinese populace including the people of Taiwan, he said. The report also has the ulterior motive to advocate "China threat" so as to undermine the relations between China and its neighboring countries. It is known to all that China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and is a positive agent for safeguarding world peace and stability. So talk of "China threat" is totally groundless and works in vain. The spokesman said that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the NPC attaches great importance to maintaining and developing its friendly ties and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons. The Chinese side does not do anything harmful to Britain and the British Parliament as well as to Sino-British ties. But, he said, some from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons have recently repeatedly done harm to Sino- British relations while stressing maintaining and developing Sino- British relations. "We should ask what their motives are and where they will lead to in bilateral relations," he said. It is certain that the views and suggestions against China that the report has raised will bring harm not only to Sino-British relations, but also to the long-term interests of Britain, he stressed. "We believe that those who really care for and want to safeguard traditional and friendly bilateral relations are not willing to see such kinds of results," the spokesman added.
