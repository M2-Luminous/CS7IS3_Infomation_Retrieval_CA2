FR940404-0-00078 FR940404-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 216 [Docket No. 940260&hyph;4060; I.D. 021594G] Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of affirmative findings and finding of conformance. SUMMARY: The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries (AA), NMFS, announces that Ecuador, Spain and Vanuatu have submitted acceptable documentation to indicate that they continue to be in compliance with the yellowfin tuna importation regulations for nations that harvest yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). NMFS announces that it has made the affirmative findings and findings of conformance for these nations thus allowing the importation of yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from these nations to continue through December 31, 1994. The AA also announces that Spain has submitted acceptable documentation that it has not imported, during the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products prohibited from direct export to the United States. NMFS announces that it has made such affirmative finding. This finding, in conjunction with renewal of the affirmative finding for Spain as a harvesting nation, allows the importation of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna into the United States from Spain through December 31, 1994. DATES: These findings remain in effect until December 31, 1994, unless revoked by the AA. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding the primary and secondary embargoes should be directed to Ms. Anneka W. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, NOAA, 501 W. Ocean Blvd., suite 4200, Long Beach, CA 90802&hyph;4213. Telephone: 310&hyph;980&hyph;4000, Fax: 310 980&hyph;4018. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Anneka W. Bane, Acting Director, Southwest Region, NMFS, 310&hyph;980&hyph;4001. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 18, 1992, NMFS published a final rule (57 FR 54334) that established a provision for timely consideration and making of an affirmative finding under the yellowfin tuna import regulations for nations that prohibit their vessels from intentionally setting on marine mammals in the course of harvesting yellowfin tuna by purse seine in the ETP. With an affirmative finding, yellowfin tuna and yellowfin tuna products from a harvesting nation can be imported into the United States. The regulations, found at 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x), require that the AA announce and publish the finding in the Federal Register . On December 16, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that the Republic of Ecuador had provided documentary evidence establishing that its regulatory program continues to comply with the yellowfin tuna importation provisions of 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x). As a result of this affirmative finding, yellowfin tuna and products from yellowfin tuna harvested by Ecuadorian-flag purse seine vessels operating in the ETP, may be imported into the United States through December 31, 1994. On December 23, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that Spain had submitted documentary evidence establishing that its regulatory program continues to comply with the tuna importation provisions of 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5) (viii) through (x). However, a secondary embargo on yellowfin tuna from Spain as an intermediary nation had been in effect since January 31, 1991. Yellowfin tuna harvested by Spanish-flag purse seine vessels could not be imported into the United States until the secondary embargo on all yellowfin tuna from Spain as an intermediary nation had been lifted. On December 3, 1993, the AA, after consultation with the Department of State, found that Spain had submitted acceptable documentary evidence that it had not imported in the preceding 6 months, yellowfin tuna or yellowfin tuna products prohibited from direct export to the United States. As a result of this finding, the secondary embargo on Spain as an intermediary nation was lifted, and yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by Spanish-flag vessels can be imported into the United States through December 31, 1994. The yellowfin tuna import regulations at 50 CFR 216.24.(e)(5) also establish provisions for timely consideration and making of an affirmative finding for nations whose vessels harvest yellowfin tuna in the ETP by intentionally setting on marine mammals. These regulations require that the government of the harvesting nation adopt a regulatory program governing the incidental taking of marine mammals in the course of such harvesting that is comparable to the regulatory program of the United States; and that the average rate of incidental mortality by vessels of the harvesting nation is comparable to the average rate of incidental mortality of marine mammals by U.S. vessels in the course of such harvesting. An affirmative finding under these regulations allows importation into the United States of yellowfin tuna and products derived from yellowfin tuna harvested in the ETP by purse seine vessels greater than 400 short tons carrying capacity through December 31, 1994. The AA reviewed the annual report submitted by the Republic of Vanuatu as required by 50 CFR 216.24(e)(5)(iv), describing the activities of the Vanuatu-flag purse seine fleet during the 1993 fishing year (October 1, 1992, through September 30, 1993). The review resulted in a determination that the average rate of incidental taking by Vanuatu-flag vessels was 0.80 times that of the U.S. fleet during the same period (no more than 1.25 times that of U.S. vessels is permitted), and that the percentage of the total mortality for eastern spinner dolphin and coastal spotted dolphin is 6.50 and 6.15 percent, respectively. (Percentages of no greater than 15.0 and 2.0 percent of the total mortality are required.) Based on these data, a negative finding was indicated because the number of incidental coastal spotted dolphin mortalities exceeded 2.0 percent of the total mortality, and NMFS was prepared to make such a finding.
