In diplomatic consultations held at the Foreign Ministry, Japanese officials told a Chinese delegation that China's role is important in solving the problem, the officials said. Beijing supports the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and considers peace and stability on the peninsula important, the Chinese side was quoted as saying. They also told the Japanese side that now is the time for a "calm and constructive" approach by all concerned parties. China wants talks to be held between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and between Washington and Pyongyang, the Chinese diplomats said. Japanese diplomatic officials voiced deep concern over North Korea's unmonitored removal of fuel rods from its nuclear reactor in Yongbyon, and said North Korea's alleged nuclear development concerns the future of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) system, the officials said. The UN Security Council issued a presidential statement Monday "strongly" urging North Korea to cooperate in pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor so IAEA inspectors can determine if any material has been diverted for nuclear weapons. The ministry officials declined to elaborate on the contents of Wednesday's consultations with China, saying they were not "negotiations." Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda led the Japanese delegation at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry, while Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan headed the Chinese side. Japan and China have been holding diplomatic talks since 1980. The previous meeting was held in Beijing in March 1992. Also during the talks, the Japanese side referred to comments by former Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano denying Japan's aggression during World War II and the 1937 Nanjing massacre, and vowed to make continued efforts to develop bilateral relations with China based on remorse for the past, the officials said. The Chinese side said China's basic stance is to develop relations with Japan by not forgetting the past but by learning from it and by looking toward the future. Correctly dealing with the two nations' past is also an important political base for promoting bilateral ties, Chinese officials were quoted as saying. Japan urged China to refrain from conducting underground nuclear tests and expressed hope that Beijing would participate in negotiations on the comprehensive test ban treaty in Geneva, they said. China replied that it is participating in the negotiations, and reiterated that it supports complete abolition of nuclear weapons and conducts fewer tests than other nuclear powers, they said. Tokyo also asked for Chinese support in its bid to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The Chinese side replied that the reorganization of the council should be dealt with according to consensus and the principles of balance, adding that it would consider Japan's bid on this basis, they said.
