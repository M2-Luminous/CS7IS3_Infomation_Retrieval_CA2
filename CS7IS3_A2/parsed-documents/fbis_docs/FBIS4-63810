The naval base in the Balaklava Bay is included in the Sevastopol megapolis. Russia opposed the use of the "Sevastopol city" notion as regards the Ukrainian naval base in Balaklava in the joint document. On mutual agreement Sevastopol will remain the major base of the Russian fleet. The document provides for another base of the Ukrainian Navy in Donuzlava, the Crimea, to house the Ukrainian part of the Black Sea Fleet. In the opinion of the Russian side, the use of the "Sevastopol" name as regards the Balaklava base runs counter to the principle of separate fleet basing envisaged by the agreement on gradual division of the Black Sea Fleet. The latter was signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents on April 15, 1994. Thus, the name of the final document has not been coordinated. The quantity division of the Black Sea Fleet ships is almost not debated. Ukraine will have 164 ships (18 per cent), and the Russian Federation -- 669. At the same time, lists of the ships are still to be made. The Russian side has suggested to begin the first stage of the fleet division after the document signing on condition that Sevastopol is considered the chief base of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
