For the six presidents who participated in the dialogue with Gore, it was most important to know the White House's position on the possibility of the Central American countries forming part of the free trade agreement signed by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. But for the United States, the objective of the minisummit was to prepare for the upcoming hemispheric summit President William Clinton convened in Miami for December. Gore discounted any kind of short- or mid-term link between the Central American countries and NAFTA. Instead, the vice president offered his interlocutors a program that would only give textiles and apparel treatment equivalent to that provided under NAFTA. Gore cautioned, however, that to benefit from this program, the Central American nations would have to open their domestic markets to U.S. textiles and apparel.
