The woods of fire have blazed. And the pillars of the universe have been shaken by the gravity of Palestinian suffering and the deep Palestinian wound, which, whenever about to heal, opens up again to pour out hot blood [words indistinct] amid bloody sacrifices to wash away the shame of the world. [words indistinct] who abandoned God and humanity. May they be cursed. Having them uprooted from the land has become a duty. [words indistinct]. God is great. The Palestinian blood was spilled in the courtyard of the Ibrahimi Mosque while those who kneeled for their God in prayer [words indistinct]. Then, the Zionist hatred poured down on them in the ugliest form, the lowliest way, and [words indistinct]. In front of the Israeli Army and under the sponsorship of the Israeli Government, and in accordance with accurate planning, Zionist soldiers and settlers stormed the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. They volleyed their machine gun fire on the crowds of worshipers, killing dozens and wounding hundreds. Fifty-three were martyred instantly and hundreds were wounded. When people hurried to hospitals to (?rescue) their wounded, the Israeli Army besieged them, especially in the courtyard of the al-Ahli Hospital. Five others fell martyrs and dozens were wounded. Afterward, rage broke out throughout Palestinian territory -- in Gaza and Jerusalem, in Dayr al-Balah and Janin, in Khan Yunus and Ramallah, in Rafah and al-Birah, in Nabulus and Bethlehem, and in all towns, villages, and camps. There, Palestinian wrath broke out. The Zionist Army and the herds of settlers were lying in wait. They wounded dozens of people with their treacherous bullets. God is great. God is great. This is a black Friday in Ramadan. This is an ugly massacre in Ramadan. This is an appalling crime in Ramadan.

They have committed this premeditated crime, knowing that [words indistinct] that their withdrawal from our territory is imminent and their days over our soil are numbered. God is great. God is great. [words indistinct] the wound of the Ibrahim mosque tells the Zionists: You will inevitably leave. You will leave. [words indistinct] Long live Palestine. Glory to the martyrs. Glory to the resisting arms. God's victory is imminent.
