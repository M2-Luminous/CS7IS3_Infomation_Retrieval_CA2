Therefore, Kuncze criticized the government. He said that to provide a complete picture one also had to talk about negative phenomena. Zsuzsa Ladanyi reports on the forum for the inhabitants of Kalocsa [central Hungary]. [Ladanyi] People are filled with fears and this is frightening for me. [passage omitted] Kuncze added that many people did not hand over their recommendation slips [for candidates in the 8 May elections] because they were afraid that their data could be registered somewhere and be misused. I think this fear is unfounded and the institutions of democracy are stable in Hungary, Kuncze said. [passage omitted] We heard at the forum in Kalocsa that Kuncze had found that people were paying attention more and more to what the various parties were saying. Thus, it is important for them to be aware of the election possibilities. Therefore, it is particularly sad that discussion programs, which have counterbalanced government propaganda and in which opinions have been set out against one another, have been taken off the television. What happened at state radio [dismissals] will also lead to this. The next government should guarantee the impartiality of television and radio and supervise impartiality, Kuncze said. He said that a high turnout at the elections was extremely important so that the coalition had sufficient backing and that extremes do not get into parliament, said the SZDSZ's nominee for prime minister at the forum for inhabitants of Kalocsa.
