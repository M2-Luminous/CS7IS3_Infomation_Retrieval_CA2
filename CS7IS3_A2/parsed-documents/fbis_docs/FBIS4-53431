According to the schedule, the session will examine and pass six draft laws, including the draft labor code, the draft law on domestic investment promotion, the draft law on taxes on the transfer of land ownership, the draft of the (revised) law on military service, the draft of the revised law on people's council and people's committee organizations, and the draft of the revised law on people's council elections. The session will also consider a draft civil code. With the draft law on the state budget in particular, the committee initially planned to present this legislation for passage at the Fifth National Assembly Session. Later the committee was requested by the government to ask the National Assembly to postpone consideration until the Sixth National Assembly Session, as this draft law is very important and may affect socioeconomic development. The session will hear a government report and consider implementation of the resolution on practicing thrift, fighting wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling. The session will also include reports on the National Assembly Standing Committee, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Organ of Control, the Nationalities Council, and other National Assembly committees during the first six months of 1994.
