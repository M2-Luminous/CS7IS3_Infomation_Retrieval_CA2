After meeting for over four hours on Bosnia, Juergen Chrobog, the Foreign Ministry political director, said in Bonn this afternoon that the senior officials participating in the meeting had expressed their readiness to give unreserved support to the process of negotiations between Croats and Bosnians. The conference participants want to exploit the dynamism resulting from the success of Sarajevo. They decided to work closely together in order to promote a speedy solution of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The prospects of a peace settlement have improved. The latest developments in Sarajevo are an important step toward ending the war in the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the conference participants said they were very concerned about the serious situation in other regions of Bosnia. As a first step, the conference wants to see to it that the cease-fire in and around Sarajevo is stabilized through an effective disengagement of troops. The reappearance of the heavy weapons withdrawn from there in other arenas of war must be prevented. Free access by road to the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina must be guaranteed, and normal life in Sarajevo must be restored with the help of the United Nations. Free access for humanitarian aid supplies must be achieved for Srebrenica, Zepa. The conference also urges a speedy opening of Tuzla Airport for humanitarian aid. An effective cease-fire should be imposed in Mostar. Military disengagement measures should be taken in central Bosnia to achieve a cease-fire between government troops and Bosnian Croat forces. Free access for humanitarian aid should also be secured in Maglaj. Chrobog stressed the aim of the conference had been to take stock rather than make decisions. The results of the analysis would now be submitted to the foreign ministers of the countries involved. Whether they then meet or whether a conference of heads of state and government takes place hinges not least on the further development of the peace process between the warring parties themselves.
