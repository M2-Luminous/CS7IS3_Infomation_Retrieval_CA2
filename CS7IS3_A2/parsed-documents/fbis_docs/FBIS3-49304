With regard to his canceled trip to Warsaw, Baudys said that his deputy, Jiri Pospisil, is well qualified to fully cover for him. According to Minister Baudys, the envisaged visit by President Bill Clinton is an exceptional event. However, the minister noted that the Army is not preparing any extraordinary measures or alert. The only measure is that the military police will cooperate with the municipal police, the Interior Ministry, and other bodies, in order to protect public order.
