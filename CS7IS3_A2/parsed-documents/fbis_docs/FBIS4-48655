This is being done to enable the UN special envoy, who is in our country, to hold discussions with both sides concerning the UN mission to be deployed here. It is within the framework of facilitating this mission that the RPF has declared a total truce. The RPF is in favor of the truce, but the RPF's observance depends on its observance by the Rwandan Army.
