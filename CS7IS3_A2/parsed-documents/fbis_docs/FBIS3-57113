Two trends emerged at the very start of the session: The first was that the deputies were in no hurry to embark on a fierce political battle for the redistribution of power with the president and the government, but, on the other hand, they were making preparations, by arranging their Duma life in detail; the second was that on day one, without any preliminary maneuvers, the deputies launched into votes enabling them to determine the internal disposition of forces, since the size of everyone's slice of the pie depended on this to a large extent. The first controversy was over two digits in the text of the provisional standing orders indicating the minimum permissible size of a faction. The communists, agrarians, DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], and LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] wanted the number 50, and their reason for that was a desire for organized and efficient work. The opposing flank and "independent" deputies insisted on a threshold of 14 deputies, advocating "freedom of association." In actual fact, there were two things here of great importance to the division of power. First, it was necessary to block the possible multiplication (including by means of division) of factions on the other political flank, which is important because of the natural factional representation norm both in the debates and in the various Duma components. Second, combined with the obligatory order, which is intended to be enshrined later in the Law on the Status of Deputy and which involves strict factional discipline, the high threshold made it possible to form a strategic majority on the left flank. As a result of a two-sitting struggle and a series of votes a compromise figure of 35 deputies was reached as the basis for forming new groups and factions. It is interesting that it was when this matter was being discussed that the "main forces" started to come to the microphones. There followed an equally fierce battle over other standing order norms of vital importance. In this case the left flank of the Duma succeeded in gaining powerful positions by passing norms whereby the quorum for opening a sitting was reduced to one-half of the total number of deputies, and this total number corresponds to the number of elected deputies. In the votes on these questions the deputies were obviously haunted by the specter of the Supreme Soviet. The deputies' love of Aesopian language was most fully manifested in the discussion of two versions of the article in the standing orders determining the mechanism for the election of the Duma chairman. According to the first version, proposed by the standing orders group, the chairman would be elected by two rounds of secret votes; the two candidates who had obtained the most votes would reach the second round -- a natural, generally accepted norm. According to the second version, sponsored by the left wing, a straw poll would be carried out electronically. The reason for this was that it would be a high-speed operation. In fact, this mechanism would enable the very slightly larger left wing to block the passage of candidates from the opposing flank or center to the second round, which was successfully accomplished. As a result, I. Rybkin, who overcame Yu. Vlasov in the second round, won by a majority of half a vote in excess of one-half of the total number of deputies, since one of the ballot papers caused arguments in the tellers' commission amd its fate was decided by the Duma. The initial days of the lower chamber's work revealed the disposition of forces to come, which had been predicted earlier and which is characterized by powerful flanks and a weak center. On the left flank you have the coordinated bloc of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] (45 deputies, which was the figure given in the official registration in the Duma 12 January) and the Agrarian Party of Russia [APR] (55). On a number of questions they are joined by the Liberal Democratic Party (63), the Democratic Party of Russia (15), "Women of Russia" (23), and several independent deputies, some of whom had gotten together in the "Russian Path" association headed by Baburin, Lukyanov, and Vlasov, which has not been registered yet because it does not have enough deputies (approximately 20 deputies). The CPRF, APR, LDPR, amd DPR form the tactical nucleus of this grouping. What distinguishes all their actions is the amount of thought that goes into them and the high degree of preparation. The actions of their speakers and supporting deputies in the chamber are well organized. All this, creating, as it does, an atmosphere of confidence in their own strength, attracts to this grouping the votes of some wavering deputies amd enables them as a result to obtain in the Duma the votes of a small majority of the number of elected deputies. On the opposing flank you have the fragmented "Russia's Choice" (76), the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" bloc (25), the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES] (30 deputies, including the newly joined independents), and the unregistered "Union of 12 December" group of democratically oriented deputies, which has I. Khakamada as one of its leaders (around 20 deputies). These factions are not organized and they are not coordinated, their preparations are poor, and their proposals suffer from poor reasoning. A typical example is the explanation that a quorum of one-half of the deputies is insuitable because it would lead to the adoption of laws by one-fourth of the deputies' votes. This logic was a gift for the communists, who made sure they took advantage of it by immediately reminding their opponents that that was precisely how the Constitution was adopted. It is not inconceivable that this false move might have influenced the outcome of the vote on this question. We can confidently assign the "New Regional Policy" deputies' associaiton (65 deputies), headed by V.S. Medvedev, president of the Oil Workers' Union, to the central part of the spectrum in the Duma. Medvedev was one of the contenders for the post of State Duma chairman and got 145 votes in the straw poll. Further events confirmed the instability of this structure in which neither flank has a sure tactical majority. This was manifested in a series of votes on the agenda, in which the proposals from the extreme left flank "to get to grips with the press," "free political prisoners," and so on did not get through. Which explains the desire of the majority of deputies to resolve the question of the distribution of committee posts as a single "package," on the basis of accords on the proportional allocation of seats, which was successfully implemented. This could mean that the Duma has a certain constructive potential, which will be confirmed or refuted in the very near future. It must be added that, unlike the Supreme Soviet in the final months, where there was an atmosphere of bitter animosity, the atmosphere in the Duma in the initial days was that of a jolly sports festival. The first chairman, G. Lukava, had a lot to do with that. Having sorted out the seats, the deputies will busy themselves with the standing orders and the Law on the Status of Deputy. Then we should see the start of the regular legislative work, primarily, one assumes, on federal constitutional laws. It is not inconceivable that in the interim the Duma will try to creep up on another pie of power, not in the Duma, but outside -- in the state. What form this takes and what the results are will make it possible to answer many questions concerning the fate both of the authorities and of the state.
