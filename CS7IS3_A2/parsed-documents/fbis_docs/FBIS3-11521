The idea, expounded in a document obtained by FOLHA, encourages a political "revenge" in this year's elections: "use your vote to judge those congressmen and politicians who have betrayed their mandate from the people." The document, entitled "Brazil: Alternatives and Protagonists," is the way the National Conference of Brazilian Bishops (CNBB) has chosen to influence the presidential election, in addition to proposing a long-term political and economic plan for the country. Drafted by a commission from the Social Pastoral office of the CNBB, the text says that Brazil is a "society in which only a democracy of the elites is practiced" and in which "consultation with the citizens is avoided and feared." The Church appeals for changes that must occur in a society that is "stupefied" by the events that led to the impeachment of Collor and the proposal to expel and strip political rights from corrupt congressmen. The document is the result of a consolidation of documents contributed by 14 regional units of the CNBB, which held meetings with civic organizations. The CNBB proposal will be discussed during the Second Brazilian Social Week (24 to 29 July in Brasilia) and presented to the presidential candidates during an evening of debate. Father Inacio Neitzling, coordinator of the commission, says it is a "controversial document that is intended to be discussed and will provoke plenty of debate both within and outside the Church." The meeting is likely to be the scene of a clash between progressive and conservative elements in the Church. The bishop of Jales (Sao Paulo State), Dom Luiz Demetrio Valentini, head of the Social Pastoral office, says "it is more than legitimate that the CNBB get involved in the elections and submit alternatives, not just for the immediate future, but for the long term as well." According to Valentini, the document does not support any individual candidate. It does, however, identify similarities between the CNBB proposals and ideas advanced by the PT [Workers Party], the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], and sections of the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. The document, to be released nationwide on 24 March, contains detailed proposals for an economic model, agrarian reform, education, the media, Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the role of the Armed Forces, and military and civilian policies. Final touches are still being put on proposals pertaining to the environment, the judiciary, urban renewal, health, and specific suggestions for each region of the country. The plan will be debated at the meeting in July and may be modified. Educational Change Makes Greatest "Impact" The Church document calls education the priority "of greatest impact" to change the country, something that "will genuinely ensure the distribution of income and social justice." The subject is seen as the basic condition for development and the exercise of citizenship. The chief proposal in this area is the adoption of full-day school sessions. The part of the document that deals with agrarian reform states that in Brazil there is an unlimited right of ownership that has created "a capitalistic monopoly on farmland." Apparently born of free enterprise, the property right--according to the text--has been translated into the practice of "using and abusing the entire extension of land that you buy." The Church believes agrarian reform "is urgently needed" in order to democratize Brazilian society. With respect to the media, the document points to "contradictory" aspects in assessing its "near indispensability" and the need to democratize the media organizations. According to the text, there is a "scandalous" degree of concentration in that sector. "About 90 percent of everything that Brazilians read, hear, and see through the media is controlled by fewer than nine families." The Church criticizes the means by which the Mercosur (the common market formed by Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay) was created, stating that only economic interests were considered and that "human and social aspects" were left out. In the opinion of the Church, the "Rio-Sao Paulo industrial axis" and the "Argentine agroindustrial complex" are the only beneficiaries, because of their competitive clout. The Church suggests a plebiscite. The text states that the "military apparatus has been taken over by arbitrariness and prepotency." And it proposes that "society should control" the military and police forces. The Church finds that there is now "proximity between the police and illegal groups" such as the death squads, the narcotics traffic, and criminal elements. Excerpts In analyzing the performance of the politicians: "Elected officials, in the name of representation but with their backs turned, sneakily act according to their own personal inclinations and protect the interests of the privileged." On the subject of the media: "It is important to accentuate the fact that although the power of the communications media in Brazil today seems almost absolute and totalitarian, it does, like all institutions throughout history, have its contradictions and limitations." On Mercosur: "It is surprising to see how this agreement is being worked out solely on the basis of the interests of businessmen and traders." On the Armed Forces and the police: "This armed wing of the state has on various occasions constituted itself as a truly independent force that has often taken upon itself the responsibility to determine the course of the Brazilian nation, as was the case in the recent period of military dictatorship." Constitutional Revision is "Deplorable" The constitutional revision is described as a "deplorable spectacle staged by the National Congress," according to the CNBB text. The document observes that the way the revision of the Constitution is being handled endangers "the democractic fellowship." The document expresses the belief that the revision is being done hurriedly, with participation by lobbies from the federal government, the military, and other groups--especially the national and international business community. The document asks: "Might this be the last chance to revisit the Constitution with a view to inserting in it the implantation of the neoliberalism imposed by the IMF and by the interests that represent and are accepted by almost all the Brazilian elites?"
