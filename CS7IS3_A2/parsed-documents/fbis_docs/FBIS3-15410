It dealt with questions of the economy and ways of getting out of the current situation -- and the situation is truly excessively grave -- especially in industry. All major factories are working under capacity, almost standing idle. For example, the Lenin machine-tool works, the Frunze machine-tool works, EVM [computer company] and others are operating at only 20-25 percent capacity. People working at these factories are being forced to take indefinite leave. Agricultural production is also falling in the Republic. Now the main reliance is on private farming and joint agricultural enterprises with foreign firms. This is already happening in Moskovskiy Rayon. The prime minister replied to all the questions of those invited.
