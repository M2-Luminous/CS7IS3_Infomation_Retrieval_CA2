Moreover, the membrane does not adversely affect biological activity. This is the first case in which a separation/purification technique mediated by pH sensitivity has been realized. The separation and purification of useful substances produced by microbes and cultured plant and animal cells (bioproducts) is an essential technology in such major industries as pharmaceuticals and foods. Because separation efficiency is greater than with previous methods, and separation and purification are achieved in a single process, this new development will lead to greater efficiency in mass production. Past protein separation and purification processes required such manufacturing steps as concentrating the protein by precipitation, fractionating by molecular size using gel filtration, separating by chromatography or other methods, and desalting by dialysis. This new membrane is a stimulus-response polymer membrane whose separation properties change according to pH. The protein can be concentrated, fractionated, and purified merely by passing it through the membrane. The pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane is formed by dissolving a radical-polymerized copolymer consisting of 4-vinylpyridine and acrylonitrile in a 1:4 molar ratio in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in the presence of lithium nitrate, evaporating the solvent, and performing gelation to remove additional solvent. To use the membrane for protein separation, the sugar-binding protein lectin is added to a cell lysate and ultrafiltration performed at high pH. At high pH, the molecular weight of the fraction passing through the membrane is high, but because the desired proteins bind to the lectin and essentially form a polymer, they are retained. This removes impurities that are lighter than or about the same molecular weight as the desired protein. Next the pH is lowered, which causes the desired protein to dissociate from the lectin. At low pH, the membrane becomes more hydrophilic, and it expands. When this happens, the pores in the membrane become smaller and the molecular weight of the fraction passing through the membrane is reduced. This time only the desired protein passes through the membrane, and it is separated from impurities of higher molecular weight, which are retained. By utilizing the pH-dependent ultrafiltration membrane in this manner, it is possible to separate a desired substance from a mixture containing impurities of both higher and lower molecular weights. The membrane can be used not only to purify useful enzymes such as peroxidase and superoxidase mutase, but can also be used for glycoprotein bioproducts such as oligosaccharides.
