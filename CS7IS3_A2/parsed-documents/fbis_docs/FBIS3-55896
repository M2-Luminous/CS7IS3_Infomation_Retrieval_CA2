"The vanquished do not dictate terms to the victors," he said, "Hence, Tbilisi will have to put up with the fact that our relations must be based on agreements reached between equal subjects of international law. The Georgian side is constantly exploiting the problem of refugees. As for us, we do not prevent them from returning to their home country." Well-informed sources at the Georgian Foreign Ministry believe that such statements made on the eve of the upcoming Georgian-Abkhazian consultations scheduled for 11 January are provocative and may bring about the most undesirable consequences.
