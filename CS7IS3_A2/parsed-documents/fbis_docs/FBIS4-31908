The parties the NDS-NA might unite with are the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), led by Jan Carnogursky, and the Democratic Union (DU), led by Slovak Premier Jozef Moravcik. NDS Deputy Anton Hrnko said the Executive Committee had requested the party leadership to come to a definitive decision by Saturday's meeting of the NDS Central Council. The KDH, which is the second largest party in the coalition government, has stipulated that, while the NDS-NA can field candidates jointly, the NDS-NA could only form a separate deputies' group in parliament if the KDH received 16 percent of the vote. Polls indicate this is not likely. Hrnko said the NDS-NA therefore preferred joining forces with the DU. The DU has been reluctant to offer the NDS-NA joint candidacy but now there are signs of change in the party leadership, Hrnko said. "We want to prevent a re-run of the situation at the elections the year before last when most of the votes were divided between the splintered right, which aided the anti-reform groups," he said. It appears probable the KDH will go it alone in the elections. If so it is expected to reap between eight and ten percent of the vote and can therefore count on seats in parliament. Negotiations should resume with the DU on the possible formation of an electoral coalition. The DU is a breakaway group from ex-premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS). The NDS-NA was formed by the "anti-Meciar faction" within the Slovak National Party (SNS), which was in coalition with the HZDS before the government fell in March. The non-parliamentary coalition of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) has uncertain prospects of getting into parliament.
