They spoke to the national and international media, which has arrived here in San Cristobal de las Casas. Bishop Samuel Ruiz pointed out that yesterday both sides basically worked on the mechanisms for the negotiation. Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis, in an act of friendship and great symbolism, both carried a Mexican flag to the location of their meeting with the national and international media. We must point out that we had access to the cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas at approximately 1730 under tight security measures. All our equipment was inspected. There were numerous reporters from various parts of the country and the world. Bishop Samuel Ruiz said that in this first meeting they basically talked about a dialogue, which has been initiated with goodwill. He said there is a high degree of communication between the sides precisely to achieve good negotiations. He said there is mutual respect. The bishop said both sides introduced themselves and translation was necessary because some representatives of the EZLN....[three-minute break in reception] [Begin EZLN Subcommander Marcos recording in progress] ....so that the dialogue is possible. He especially praised the work done by the national mediation commissioner, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, and his team. He especially congratulated and sent greetings to the men and women of the nongovernment organizations, who are the ones who are guaranteeing the security of our leaders. Subsequently, we talked about how we would discuss the points contained in the list of demands, which the Indian Revolutionary Clandestine Committee will present tomorrow. We talked about the problems at the national and state levels and those specifically having to do with the peasants and Indians. Today we basically talked about the agenda for the dialogue that began today and which we hope will continue tomorrow. Members of the committee are willing to listen to the words of the federal government. We also believe the commissioner is also willing to listen to what the EZLN has to say. That is how we prepared everything to initiate the discussion scheduled to be held tomorrow. That is what we have to say to the national and international media. [end recording] [Unidentified Radio ACIR announcer in Mexico City] That was the voice of Subcommander Marcos, who is the official spokesman of the delegates and representatives of the armed wing of the EZLN. [Sarmenta] Subcommander Marcos said they believe Manuel Camacho Solis is willing to contribute to a fruitful dialogue. [Announcer] Subcommander Marcos talked about the topics of the agenda that will be discussed tomorrow. I remember that in his latest statement, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho said that in this peace dialogue they would not talk about any topic in the national agenda. There is apparently a victory for the EZLN in this dialogue. [Sarmenta] That is true. Manuel Camacho Solis had pointed out that in this topic they would not discuss national issues, however, he pointed out that he would be willing to listen to all the concerns of the EZLN delegates. I can also report that a small kiosk was set up in front of the main altar of the cathedral. Both sides sat down at a table there. A Mexican flag was set up behind the kiosk. We must point out that the person who attracted the most attention from photographers and cameramen was undoubtedly Subcommander Marcos. The peace commissioner spoke later on. He pointed out that they have come a long way from war to politics, from weapons to dialogue. [Begin Camacho Solis recording] I appreciate Samuel Ruiz' hospitality and the respectful behavior shown by the EZLN clandestine committee members. You witnessed a very important event a few minutes ago. You and all the people who are sitting here owe allegiance to only one flag. We all stood up to show our respect to this national flag that unifies us all. This dialogue is being held on Mexican territory. The EZLN is an organization of Chiapas residents who are Mexican -- predominantly Indian -- citizens. The key point of this negotiation is that it allows us to go from force to politics. We are going from weapons to dialogue. Words, not weapons, are talking right now. There are mutual guarantees. That is why we are here. Both parties respect each other. We are attempting to find a solution to the conflict through the political dialogue channel. This new political situation should not be reversed, not only because both parties are willing to talk but because it is the will and the demand of Mexican society. My media friends, this is what I have to report to you at present. Thank you. [end recording] [Sarmenta] After Subcommander Marcos and Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis talked Bishop Samuel Ruiz told reporters that from now on we will probably be told ahead of time if there is to be a news conference or an interview with one of the parties at this dialogue. He said, however, that in this first meeting with the press the commissioners had expressed their points of view but reporters would not be allowed to ask questions. We were also informed that the list of EZLN demands will be revealed tomorrow, as well as Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis's reply to those demands. [Announcer] Jose Luis, I thank you very much for this detailed report on what has just happened at the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral in Chiapas. This is the peace fortress where the first peace and reconciliation meeting is ending right now. It is so good to hear the EZLN members and the peace commissioner state that they will continue to discuss the topics on the agenda tomorrow because this shows that the dialogue is to continue. We, as many Mexicans, believe that while the parties in conflict sit and talk, words and not firearms, will talk. [Sarmenta] Right. At the meeting, the fact that the dialogue started with the opportune mediation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz and that there is mutual respect between the EZLN members and the peace commissioner was underscored. [Announcer] However, we are worried about what is happening in other areas of Chiapas State. We reported to our ACIR Radio Noticias listeners a few minutes ago that the cattlemen and people who have had to move from the area because of the conflict in Altamirano area in the Chiapas highlands....[pauses] We are worried because one of the regents of the Altamirano municipal council said the cattlemen had threatened to return tomorrow to recover their ranches -- with or without permission. There are more than 101 ranches in that area. This prompts apprehension because right now that region can be compared to very dry grasslands during the hot season -- any spark can set things on fire. [Sarmenta] Yes Pepe, we have kept abreast of the events at Altamirano. Up to now, the people in the area have not suffered any type of physical pressure due to the cattlemen's threats. However, we will be attentive to this situation. [Announcer] We will be attentive and I thank you for this report. Thank you, Jose Luis.
