One of the press bulletins is on the meeting in Tijuana, Baja California, on the day Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated; another one on the activities being carried out to choose the new PRI presidential candidate; and the third issued last night by the PRI National Political Council. [passage omitted on details of bulletin on incidents in Tijuana covered by referent item] The second press bulletin states that the PRI continues to maintain unity among its sectors, organizations, and members. It adds that the party is continuing with the various tasks that it must conduct as a political party. The PRI reiterates that it has yet to establish the date and hour for a meeting of the National Executive Committee or the National Political Council to begin the internal procedures to choose a new presidential candidate. The press bulletin adds that as soon as the National Executive Commission decides to begin the internal procedures for the selection of a new candidate, the people will be informed through the media. These bulletins were released yesterday. Members of the National Political Council issued a third press bulletin. In the bulletin, the members state that: In light of the rumors regarding hypothetical changes and reforms to Article 82 of the Constitution and postponing the date for the federal elections, we publicly express our disagreement to said changes. In other words, the PRI National Political Council bulletin states that they are opposed to possible changes to Article 82 of the Constitution or other articles dealing with the possibility of postponing the date of the federal elections scheduled for 21 August. The bulletin adds: We reiterate our determination that the electoral process under way be conducted according to the Constitution and the law in the hopes that the state of law and the democratic principles that encourage us will be respected. The members of the National Political Council add in their bulletin: Once again, we reiterate our firm determination that the party, despite the sorrow it experiences, will maintain its obligation and unity to the commitments made by Luis Donaldo Colosio and supports the Mexican people's demands that justice be done. Those are the three press bulletins released yesterday by the PRI.
