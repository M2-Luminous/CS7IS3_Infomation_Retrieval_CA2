FBIS4-53597 "dreas098_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 North Korea Radio Condemns Japan's `Concealment' of Plutonium Radio Condemns Japan's `Concealment' of Plutonium SK1905142594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 19 May 94 SK1905142594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1200 GMT 19 May 94 Korean BFN [Text] A DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released the following statement [tamhwa] on 19 May concerning the exposure of an extra-large case -- the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making factory in Japan. The statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman: Recently, the true color of Japan as a nuclear criminal was dragged into the light of day, causing quite a stir internationally. As was already reported, an extra-large case of the concealment of 70 kg of plutonium at the nuclear fuel-making factory in Tokaimura, Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, was disclosed. Japan had so far boasted of its uprightness, claiming that it had opened to the public the amount of plutonium it had stockpiled and had accepted strict inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. It was disclosed recently, however, that the Japanese authorities had not declared the amount of plutonium needed for the manufacture of more than nine nuclear warheads in the total inventory of plutonium, keeping it secret. This clearly showed their kind of shamelessness. The concealment of plutonium is a violation of universally recognized international law, which should be taken seriously and denounced. The case also clearly indicates that the so-called three non-nuclear principles advertised so often by Japan are nothing but a screen for concealing a large quantity of plutonium and pushing ahead with nuclear armament in real earnest. Japan's noisy row over our nonexistent nuclear issue, taking the van in the intrigues to stifle the Republic, is nothing but a petty guile to veil its nuclear armament and divert the public attention elsewhere. The Japanese authorities, caught red-handed, are these days making excuses by talking about the so-called probe into the truth and removal of suspicion, but no one will believe that. Judging from the fact that many nuclear facilities of Japan have been in operation for several tens of years, it is too self-evident that the recently discovered plutonium is nothing but an extremely tiny part of the amount concealed in Japan. International circles are now demanding that the IAEA Secretariat treat Japan's production and concealment of plutonium as a grave case and take relevant measures. It says if the IAEA Secretariat never takes issue with the dangerous nuclear activities of Japan and continues to make the matters complicated only over our fledgling peaceful nuclear activities, throwing suspicion on nonexistent nuclear development, it cannot be construed otherwise than an application of a double standard. The IAEA Secretariat must pay due attention to this issue in compliance with the principle of impartiality. The United States, which has used our nuclear issue for a sinister political purpose, calling for a cooperation system to stifle our Republic, joining hands with Japan, the real nuclear criminal, cannot evade the responsibility for this case, either. We do not feel any need to make further argument about the poor lot of the South Korean authorities [tangguk], who have recklessly made a fuss about our nuclear issue, currying favor with the United States and Japan, the two big powers. While the South Korean people in authority [tanggukjadul] ran about like mad, following Japan, the latter did what it wanted. What a ridiculous sight they are. The Japanese authorities must declare to the international society the exact total amount of plutonium now concealed nationwide, and immediately stop nuclear armament. We consider that under the circumstances it has been confirmed as a fact that Japan's nuclear armament is being promoted to the danger line and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula has become practically meaningless. We appeal to [hosohanda] the governments of all countries, international organizations, and antinuclear organizations to make unbiased efforts to remove the danger of nuclear development from our planet and, in particular, to launch a joint action to check the nuclear armament recklessly accelerated by Japan with the ambition of becoming a military and a nuclear power.
