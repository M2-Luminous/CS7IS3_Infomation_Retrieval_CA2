"It is precisely because of the lack of such control that we have been unfoundedly accused so far," he said [word indistinct] a meeting with Andrea Colombo, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) European Office, in the Bosnian Serb political centre of Pale. The two sides discussed humanitarian and political issues. Krajisnik said he had conveyed to the ICRC official the stand of the Bosnian Serb leadership that the latest threat with NATO air strikes was "not an ultimatum to the Serb side because such a category in relations with the Serbian people is out of the question." "We believe that this is pressure aimed at restoring peace in Sarajevo and controlling heavy weapons so that it could be established who initiates conflicts in this area," he said. Krajisnik added that Colombo had informed him about visits of ICRC teams to prisons under Moslem control and promised to do everything in his power to ensure the earliest possible exchange of prisoners. "Mr Colombo assured me that not a single member of the ICRC missions working in this area would leave our territory after NATO's ultimatum," he said. Colombo said his visit was aimed at intensifying humanitarian operations in the entire area of the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which entailed cooperation of all sides. "I must point out the cooperativeness of the Serb side, which today again agreed to participate in the realisation of our programme," said Colombo.
