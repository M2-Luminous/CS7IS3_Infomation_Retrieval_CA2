Dos Santos spoke in a ceremony at the Afro-Asian-Latin American People's Solidarity Organization [AALAPSO] building to mark the 19th anniversary of Mozambique's independence. A special first-day stamp cancellation took place during the ceremony to mark this significant occasion. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], was in attendance. Marcelino dos Santos spoke about the future of Mozambique as well as its role in a convulsive Africa. [Begin Dos Santos recording in Portuguese] We can expect a bright future because, first of all, the war that destroyed our country is in the past; secondly, the great cancers of the region -- apartheid in South Africa and the regime of President Banda in Malawi -- have been eliminated. In other words, the Mozambican people now have all the conditions to reconstruct the economic development projects that we had already established between 1975 and 1980 in health and education.
