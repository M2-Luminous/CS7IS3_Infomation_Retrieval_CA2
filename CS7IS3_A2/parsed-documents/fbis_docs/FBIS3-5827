Maung Aye said that during the time the SLORC holds state powers, it is constructing new railway lines in states and divisions in order to provide smooth transportation. He expressed his satisfaction at seeing local people willingly and competitively participate in the project in order to bring about development in their respective areas. He said the state is providing vast sums of money, both in local and foreign currencies, for the railway construction projects. He urged the departmental authorities and local people to participate actively and cooperate in the project. He also spoke on forest conservation, expansion of agricultural enterprises, and expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations. Next, SLORC Secretary-1 Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt addressed the meeting. He said he had come to Ye along with the deputy commander in chief of the Defense Services and ministers to inspect the progress in the construction of the Ye-Tavoy railway, which is being undertaken for the sake of local development, and to provide the necessary assistance. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt said that during the time it holds state powers, the SLORC is working for national development and to improve the standard of living of the indigenous people. He said the prevalence of law and order and local peace and tranquility are the main prerequisites for carrying out national development tasks. He said all citizens should work hand in hand, in unity, and with zeal and diligence in the name of national progress. The SLORC has invited the armed organizations in the jungle to return to the legal fold in order to work hand in hand. He said that armed organizations in Mon State understood the state government's invitation and held an initial round of talks with us. Preparations are underway for the second round of talks. He expressed his hope that the armed organizations in the Mon State will return to the legal fold following the second round of talks. Continuing, Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt explained that the USDA is the most fundamental organization for the entire Union and that the objectives and aims of the organization are based on the spirit of patriotism in striving for the emergence of a modern nation. Therefore, he said, he urged the entire general public -- including public servants -- to work for the further expansion and strengthening of the USDA. He said while it is necessary for all armed organizations in the jungle to make joint efforts in striving for the emergence of Myanmar as a modern nation, it is necessary for all indigenous people to participate with diligence and zeal.
