(a) General. Except as provided in §536.35(a)(1), when a claim has been determined to be payable, the approval or settlement authority will transmit the following to the appropriate disbursing office: (1) The voucher (SF 1034 or SF 1145 as appropriate) in triplicate, with a request that one copy be returned with voucher number and date of payment noted thereon. (2) Two copies of_ (i) The claim. (Under subpart K this means DD Form 1842 (Claim for Loss of or Damage to Personal Property Incident to Service).) (ii) The settlement agreement, as required. (iii) Actions and other documents as required; for example, DA Form 1668 signed by the approving or settlement authority (as the substitute for action in small claims under subparts C, D, E, F, H or J) attorney general approval and court approval on claims for minors and incompetents. (iv) Original power of attorney, where appropriate. (b) Electronic payment procedures. At installations where electronic payment procedures have been implemented, the approving or settlement authority will electronically transmit payment information to the servicing finance and accounting office. The claim, the settlement agreement, any actions or other required documents, and the original power of attorney will not be transmitted to the finance and accounting office, but will be retained in the claims file. Instead, a ``payment report'' produced by the claims automation program provided such offices by USARCS, which evidences or supports the fact that a claims official has approved a claim payment, will be transmitted to the disbursing activity in accordance with locally established procedures. The method of transmission used should not result in avoidable or significant delay in the issuance of checks for claims payments. The payment report includes_ (1) The name of the payee. (2) The payee's social security number (if available). (3) The payee's address. (4) The date the claim was filed. (5) The claim number. (6) The amount claimed. (7) The amount of the approved payment. (8) The date the payment was recorded in claims records. (9) The claims office identification. (10) The claims office's office code.
