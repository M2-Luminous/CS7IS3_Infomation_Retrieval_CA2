Mosiyenko and R. Khotin, IMA Press, special for LITERATURNAYA GAZETA; place and date not given: "The Dniester Region Could Become a Second Yugoslavia, Thinks Aleksandr Lebed, Commanding General of the 14th Russian Army"] [Text] [Question] On the eve of the parliamentary elections in Moldova, President Mircea Snegur announced that he will insist on the complete withdrawal of your army from the Dniester region in 1994. What do you think about this? [Lebed] As the saying goes, there is desire, and there are possibilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the troops of one state are on the territory of another one, I answer: It is bad. Must they be withdrawn? Yes, they must. When, is a separate question. When will the economic and political conditions be created under which it will be possible to dispatch trains here for the redeployment of subunits, and so that local women do not assault our units, as happened previously... These conditions do not exist now: One and a half years of peace did not produce anything, negotiations between the sides in the conflict are not being conducted, and, unfortunately, no political settlement is being looked into yet. As for the economic conditions--well, troops have already been withdrawn from Georgia and other republics, as a result of which a hundred thousand officers and warrant officers are dangling between heaven and earth without work, without apartments, and without prospects. This is no longer acceptable, and no one will support this in the future. Diplomatic problems also exist. How, for example, will Ukraine see it if I start to transport weapons and ammunition through it? After all, its railroads will be overloaded, and, indeed, the freight, to put it mildly, is not safe. There is also a technical side to the matter. Taking into account the existing rail lines, loading platforms, and the number of weapons, the redeployment will take two years. This is if there is an uninterrupted pullout--night and day, summer and winter, on workdays and holidays... How can there be any talk of 1994? To utilize ammunition here is also unrealistic. But now the game is one-sided--leave, and that is all. [Question] Some politicians, in particular Bundestag Deputy Brigitte Schulte, the leader of the NATO group of observers at the elections in Moldova, believe that the presence of the 14th Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. [Lebed] For me, this German woman is not an authority and, indeed, women have nothing to do here in general. Let her come and try to withdraw this army from here. The former Soviet troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave and, afterwards, following the division of the Union, the second started. The Western Group of Forces left Germany and the Northwestern left the Baltics. This entire mass of officers, warrant officers, military equipment, and preposterous apartmentless servicemen... The economic situation in Russia and Ukraine is now such that it is impossible to solve the present problem quickly. But since this is the case, it has to be resolved in a humane way. When the question of the withdrawal of the British Army of the Rhine from the FRG arose two years ago, the English calculated that it would take nine years. The Germans checked it out--yes, precisely so. This is the civilized approach. [Question] Who in the future could take the place of the 14th Army? Perhaps the UN "blue helmets?" [Lebed] Let us agree that not long ago we were citizens of one country and that we will come to an understanding between ourselves quicker and easier than the Americans, Germans, and English. There are, for example, trilateral peacekeeping posts of Russians, Dniester region people, and Moldovans. There are no interethnic problems among them. And the military commanders know each other, inasmuch as they served in the same army at one time. A certain military-political balance of forces has developed in this region. If it is now crudely violated in a unilateral way... Let us imagine that our army is not here tomorrow--immediately the temptation arises to resolve in one leap and in two hours a problem that set teeth on edge a long time ago. Someone will fill this vacuum. Imagine there is a leap, but victory is not achieved, and a long conflict ensues; but this place is smart, and everyone owes something to everyone else. The map of Europe was redrawn more than once according to the results achieved by the victorious soldiers of one side or the other. In the Dniester-Moldovan conflict it can be proven that white is white and black at the same time, only in one case it is necessary to get documents from the 18th century, and in the other, the 19th century. Therefore, this may be a second Yugoslavia. A lot of sound thought has to be put in before disrupting this balance. I personally cannot yet conceive of how to withdraw the subunits entrusted to me from here. Even if tomorrow someone else is its commander, he also will be unable to do this. The people are not chasing the army from the Dniester region--on the contrary, they are holding on to it. Because troops were pulled out of the far abroad in a disgraceful record-breaking timeframe, complicated tasks came up frequently: For example, disband a division in two months. And then the question arose: Where is your place of birth? If you are from Tiraspol, let us send you, lad, to the commanding general of the 14th Army, and he will find you a place. As a result, 51 percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant officers I now have were born in this region. Everything got mixed up in the home of the Oblonskiy: The Army is Russian, the last name of the commander is Lebed, his combat deputy is Melnichuk, armaments deputy--Dymar, rear services-- Perepadya, and the relatives of all of them are more often than not in Ukraine. But on the whole all this is gibberish that must be stopped as quickly as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians-- all are Slavs, people of one destiny and blood, and one faith. We have to think about not what disunites us but about what unites us. But we are divided like Siamese twins that have two heads and one body. If they are separated, you get a hybrid from either one of them. Well, we are now working on hybrids. [Question] What are relations like between the command authorities of the Army and the Dniester region leadership? [Lebed] They were never simple. The Tiraspol leaders introduced idiotic money (rubles before 1992 with a stamp depicting Suvorov and a face value), they are poking their nose into other people's affairs, having sent hundreds of assault rifles in October to the White House. They are making decisions on some kind of citizenship, they are introducing outlandish legislation, they have privatized 30 kilometers of the Russian pipeline that goes through the territory of the Dniester region, and they have taken jurisdiction of the air space over the Dniester-Moldovan Republic, while possessing no airport or aircraft. I resigned my commission as a Dniester region deputy, inasmuch as I am categorically against the rude interference in the internal affairs of the state and in the army that I serve. The kind of president and the kind of parliament to have is Russia's affair. The Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents are irrelevant here.
