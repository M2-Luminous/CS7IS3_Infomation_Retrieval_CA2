Israeli society, which was implanted inside the live Palestinian flesh, has shown the unique ability to spawn, foster, and protect terrorism. We do not exaggerate when we say that Israeli extremism was fostered in the lap of the military establishment and in the settlement institution itself, which views the entire Palestinian territory as the natural right of every Israeli. [passage omitted] Slaughterer Baruch Goldstein, the killer of Muslims at prayer in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, who bears dual Israeli-U.S. citizenship; and before him Former Israeli Prime Minister Menahem Begin, the champion of the Dayr Yasin massacre; former Israeli Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon, champion of the Sabra and Shatila massacres; Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who advocated breaking the bones of the intifadah heroes, whose hands are dripping with the blood of innocent Palestinians; and dozens of generals and leaders, who committed massacres against defenseless Palestinians, are calling on the Arabs to turn over a new leaf and salvage the peace process, as if peace can only be achieved with the corpses of Arabs and Palestinians. We will never be content with a Security Council meeting and passing resolutions condemning the massacre, because this would be mere ink on paper. The situation now requires an overall Arab assessment of all developments from the Oslo agreement to the Cairo agreement in order to define our path. In other words, we do not want to leave the Palestinians alone to face this ordeal. Whether we like it or not, the Palestinian issue will remain primarily an Egyptian issue and an Arab issue that affects pan-Arab security. We do not want to leave the Palestinian negotiator alone in the open to face killers, executioners, and the schemes of the Israelis who claim to seek peace. Since all Arab countries have condemned and denounced the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and since all Arab governments have defined their position on the planned Israeli terrorism, and since all Arab regimes have agreed that the crux of the problem is due to the existence of the armed Israeli settlements and the lack of protection for the Palestinian people, we do not want to leave Yasir 'Arafat to stand alone to face the plotting and to declare the continued suspension of the negotiations. There will be no solution. A real solution lies in a call by the Arab League for an emergency meeting of the Arab foreign ministers to be held urgently at the Arab League or in any Arab capital, to agree on a unified Arab stance on negotiations and the peace process. Israel continues to build settlements and to arm settlers and to distribute arms on a large scale inside the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in preparation for a civil war after implementing the self-rule agreement. It is a time bomb that Israel has planted to go off at a certain moment. We are not exaggerating when we say that Israel itself is a real threat to Arab security. It poses a threat to the entire Arab region. The Israeli society poses a constant threat to the Palestinian people. Despite this, Israel negotiates and says in a loud voice that its security is threatened and that it wants the Oslo agreement and the Cairo agreement to guarantee its security. Such an opportunistic stance will prevent genuine peace with Israel. We are in dire need of a new Arab will, new approach, and new peace that fulfills all Arab rights. The peace that we seek means withdrawal, dismantling of the settlements, departure of the settlers, and granting the Palestinian people the right to determine their future and establish their state. There is a dire need for a new Arab decision that will put things right and not leave the Palestinian negotiator alone in the open while we continue to repeat statements of condemnation and denunciation.
