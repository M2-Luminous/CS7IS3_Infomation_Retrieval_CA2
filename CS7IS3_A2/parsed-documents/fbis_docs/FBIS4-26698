The annual growth rates of the three major indices measuring the domestic money supply M1A, M1B and M2 reached 11.45 percent, 16.5 percent and 15.73 percent respectively in May, all higher than the April levels, according to statistics released by the Central Bank of China (CBC) Saturday [25 June]. The M1A and M1B growth rates reached three-month highs, while the broadly-defined M2 growth rate was at its highest level since April 1993, when the rate hit 16.5 percent. May's M2 and M1B growth rates also exceeded the CBC-set 15 percent ceiling. CBC Governor Liang Kuo-shu said the central bank has begun open-market operations to control the growth of domestic money supply. "We believe that through our open-market operations, the M2 annual growth rate will fall below the 15-percent ceiling in June," he said. CBC Deputy Governor Chiu Cheng-hsiung attributed the high money supply growth rate for May in part to increased bank loans to manufacturers during the month. As local banks still have huge excess reserves, Chiu said, the central bank will intensify open-market operations to retrieve idle funds from the banking system to staunch money-supply growth. "We'll continue monitoring the domestic financial situation closely and will take necessary steps to keep the M2, M1A, and M1B growth rates within 10 to 15 percent," he added. M2 is the broadest measure of a country's total money stock, comprising currency in circulation, checking and demand deposits as well as quasi-money (including time deposits and Treasury bills). The narrowly-defined M1A comprises cash in circulation and deposits in demand and checking accounts, while M1B comprises M1A plus passbook savings deposits.
