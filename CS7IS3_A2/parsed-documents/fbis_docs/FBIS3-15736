Speaking at a news conference in Vienna on Tuesday, Eliasson said that during his trip to the war zone he had met with Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev and Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. Both leaders called for the soonest possible end to the bloodshed. However, they have different approaches towards ways of solving the conflict, Eliasson said. The Swedish diplomat believes the conflict cannot be solved by military means and called for looking for a political stage-by-stage settlement which should involve exchange of prisoners and creating conditions for the return of refugees. The problem of the disputed enclave's political status remains the biggest stumbling block. Solving this problem will require coordination of peace initiatives. Eliasson said he had had talks with Russian officials to this end. The Azerbaijani president said earlier today in Beijing where he is currently on a visit that the reconsideration of the status of Nagorno-Karabakh was conditioned on certain terms. Among them he named "unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed units from the occupied territory of Azerbaijan, territorial integrity and inviolability of borders." Eliasson said that the CSCE Minsk group sees its role in sending representatives to the region to monitor ceasefire and to help find a political solution to the conflict. The proposal about CSCE observers is welcomed by all sides, including Russia, the ambassador pointed out. At the same time he said the CSCE did not yet look deep into the question of bringing a disengagement force to the region. "We could also assist in the withdrawal of troops, normalisation of communications and trade, the return of refugees, and humanitarian aid matters", he said. Eliasson said the success of peace settlement will depend on whether the sides involved in the conflict will manage to overcome mutual suspiciousness between the conflicting sides, build confidence in the military, political and humanitarian areas, including in cooperation with the International Red Cross Committee, and display "reasonable political will." The ambassador pointed out that all who can influence the situation must work together and concertedly. This is why, he said, "We closely cooperate with Russia as a big mediator in the region".
