"This ceremony left me a very strong impression," said Elio Germano, ambassador of the European Union in Tirana. With the signing of this agreement, he said, we confirmed that the European Union will stand side by side Albania to help it with the developing processes and the economic and institutional reform. The signing of this document implies that Albania should be increasingly close to a decentralised economy and programs projected for the Albanian people, Mr. Germano said. "During our stay in Albania, we have worked to conclude this program as soon as possible and completely, something which also serves the strengthening of our relations," he concluded.
