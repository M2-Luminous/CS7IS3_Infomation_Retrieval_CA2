Actions must be taken to encourage healthy and necessary competition because orderly competition will prevail without paternalism nor undeserved support, he said during the official welcome speech at the 15th Annual Cuban Tourism Convention. This convention will run through Friday [20 May] at this beach resort, approximately 140 km east of Havana. After recalling that this traditional encounter coincides with important organizational changes in the local tourism sector, Cienfuegos stressed that the rules (to obtain sustained development) will be efficiency in the economy, excellence in the quality of the services, and the professionalism of all workers and executives. Cinefuegos noted that the Tourism Ministry will be streamlined and that it will not issue mandates nor dictate. Instead, it will concentrate on development policies and oversee their implementation. He stressed that the ministry will manage Cuban tourist services which, at times, have been the victim of bad administration. This, he noted, has created a distorted image of the industry, and he called on tour operators to comply with what has been agreed upon contractually to avoid misunderstandings. "In addition to sun and beaches, in general our outdoors, our history, our culture, and our traditions are fundamental elements of the Cuban tourist product," he stressed. He affirmed that the conservation of cities and the environment will shape the design of tourist facilities. The extended use of the land will not take precedence over its rational use and it will not take precedence over nature. He noted that a culture of cement will not be created. When referring to job opportunities in the industry, he said all the forms of specialized tourism will be explored. The development of aquatic sports and golf will quickly open new opportunities to fill the void in current inducements to vacationers. He also commented on the fact that tourism is not only the obligation of the so-called tourist organizations, but it also should be the obligation of society as a whole and its institutions. In this regard, and without giving any more details, he announced the utilization of a tourism council that will include participation from various organizations, and he also mentioned the enactment of a government law that will regulate this sector. In addition, Cienfuegos concluded, a law on the already charted coastlines and a code of ethics will be promulgated.
