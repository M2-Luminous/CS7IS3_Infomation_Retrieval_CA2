The observer, who was named as Dutch Major Van Baal, was freed along with his Serb interpreter, the United Nations Protection Force spokesman said. Van Baal informed his Sarajevo headquarters of the men's release, the circumstances of which were not detailed. The two men went missing April 11, the day after the first North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air strike on Serb forces besieging the eastern Bosnian Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Fifty-eight unarmed UN military observers were placed under house arrest by Serb forces in areas under their control in reprisal for that air strike and a second strike a day later.
