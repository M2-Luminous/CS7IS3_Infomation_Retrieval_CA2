[Shushkevich] The reasons were quite aptly formulated by numerous commentators: The restoration of nomenklatura power. The formal pretexts simply do not stand up to criticism: Anyone who has seen my ordinary dacha, which I began to build with my own hands, knows that not by the remotest stretch of the imagination can it be termed "personal vanity." It is something else that surprises me: I managed to work on for 18 months after the disposition of forces in the Belarusian parliament had become obvious, where the majority did not need a democrat or centrist as a speaker. [Yuferova] Politics are a tough team game. You did not have your own party, your own faction in parliament, or even, they say, your own team. Are you a lone politician? [Shushkevich] I could not make the majority think differently but some newcomers started to think like me -- and that is good for our power inclined toward old convictions. I have always had complete mutual understanding with politicians from stable democratic countries. I was a political romantic; I had no political support among the social strata; some of the intelligentsia understood me. The trouble is that the mass media in our country are entirely in the hands of those who actually rule and have now finally taken all power. The first organizational meeting of the present government was held by the first secretary of the Communist Party of Belarus Central Committee; this government has in fact brought the republic's economy to its knees. The legislative base for the transition to the market, although it is not the best base, has nonetheless been created. [Yuferova] But does it not seem to you that the rapid deterioration of the people's life, galloping inflation, also voted against the head of state? [Shushkevich] Not a single parliament can neglect production. Through the will of the government not a single market mechanism is operating in our country. The state cannot pay two-thirds of their wages to 50 percent of the plants for the umpteenth month when people are doing nothing. We are consuming our fixed capital, everything which our predecessors accumulated. No one from outside will rectify our own stupidity. They can help, but they cannot cure us from the outside. [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, in that case should the Russian ruble fulfill its "international duty" on Belarusian territory? Many economists in Moscow are less than delighted, to put it mildly, in connection with the union of the two states' monetary systems. For some people the ruble zone will simply be a zone.... [Shushkevich] Nothing threatens the Russian ruble for a reason which has already been cited: The majority of enterprises are out of it -- that means we should not expect an eruption of inflation. Our neighbors' empty coffers present no danger. The complication will lie in the mutual settling of accounts. The Russian ruble will help but will not lead us out of the impasse. What difference will it make: There used to be no Belarusian rubles, now there will be no Russian rubles. In my view the unification of the two monetary systems is becoming more problematical with every passing day. [Yuferova] What was the reaction in the republic to your resignation? [Shushkevich] I remember a well-known anecdote: Khrushchev was at home shortly after being sent into retirement when his telephone rang. He lifted the receiver: "Hello, at your service." And he heard in reply: "In the past you had to be of service, but now you can come downstairs with us to play dominoes." So what can I say now.... There is a pile of reassuring telegrams, there are people who support me, there are my friends and my family. [Yuferova] Was there any official or unofficial reaction from Moscow or Kiev? After all the three Belovezhskaya Forest "bison" -- Yeltsin, Kravchuk, and Shushkevich -- crossed the Viskuli [reference unknown] together into history. [Shushkevich] No. A resignation is a state's internal affair. And the conservation of friendly relations is our personal business. [Yuferova] How did the rumor appear that Shumeyko had offered you the post of chairman of the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly? [Shushkevich] I have nothing to do with it. The rumor was obviously generated by ignorant people. According to the established rules, only an acting head can head the assembly. [Yuferova] Who is your successor, elected recently as head of the Belarusian parliament? [Shushkevich] Myechyslaw Ivanovich Hryb, a retired lieutenant general, headed the national security commission in the parliament, and I once even asked him to be my deputy. And even now I do not cast doubt on his fitting human qualities. Let us see how he does in this position although it is an open secret that a disposition of forces convenient to the government is taking shape in parliament. I should like to wish him success in establishing Belarusian statehood. [Yuferova] There is a feeling that the present speaker is temporary. No analyst predicted this figure's appearance on the political Olympus. [Shushkevich] That is a problem for the analysts, not for the speaker now chosen. At the sessions there was frequent talk on the subject but early parliamentary elections were not in fact scheduled (the deputies are utterly reluctant to part with their mandates acquired in the USSR). According to the existing Constitution this parliament has one year and two months to work -- until new elections in March 1995. [Yuferova] If Belarus decides on presidential elections, will you run? [Shushkevich] For the time being I shall say just one thing: I do not intend to leave political life. [Yuferova] But considering past mistakes you cannot seriously count on anything as a lone politician. On whom do you intend to rely in the future? [Shushkevich] Give me two weeks to think. At present it is the fashion to play numerous parts, I want to retain my convictions. [Yuferova] How have you spent these difficult days since your resignation, who has been by your side? [Shushkevich] To be honest, I wanted to be quite alone, in the sticks, at my dacha. But it did not work out that way. Close friends have arrived and now I have my daughter, my son-in-law, and my dog Kuzka with me. I regret not having gone to the writers' center today to bid farewell to Ales Mikhaylovich Adamovich. I did not have time. It is 3 km to the local station and another 50 km to Minsk. And my 1983 Zhiguli would not start. [Yuferova] Stanislav Stanislavovich, it seems to me there is actually another reason here. It is not that simple to mingle with people in a different capacity even at a time of grief. [Shushkevich] Perhaps there is some truth there.... Ales Adamovich was a man of great principle and honesty. The people and rulers should have been proud of such a son, but he was obliged to spend the past six years in his favorite foreign land -- Russia. Sometimes a man has to die to be understood in his own Fatherland. How painful it was to learn that when Bulat Okudzhava last came to Minsk there was a crowd which abused him. That is our shame, that is the same crew which drove Adamovich from the republic. [Yuferova] Your immediate plans? [Shushkevich] Over the past few years I have taken virtually no leave; I will finally enjoy this right and then continue work in parliament as a deputy. [Yuferova] Have you not thought of the destiny of the professors who went straight from meetings into big-league politics: Akayev, Ter-Petrosyan, Khasbulatov, Landsbergis, Popov, Shushkevich. Can a scholar change profession in his maturity without personal drama? What is your personal experience? [Shushkevich] The need to understand the thrust of a phenomenon, the need to focus efforts on a specific avenue leads some people to victory, others to resignation. Most likely here it is a case not of their profession but of the size of their personality. [Shushkevich ends] Shushkevich gave this interview over the telephone on Sunday evening while he was at his dacha near Minsk, of which even PRAVDA, always biased against the former speaker, wrote that the parliamentary commission's claims looked ridiculously inadequate. They settled accounts with him over a different subject.
