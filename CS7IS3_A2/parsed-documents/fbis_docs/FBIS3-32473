Cuban Ambassador Jose Perez Novoa said Washington's occupation of part of the Guantanamo territory in the eastern part of his country, against the island's will is an example of the denial of this right. The head of the Caribbean island's delegation to the 50th Human Rights Commission meeting spoke for the second time in one day to explain his position on point nine of the agenda: self-determination and its application to peoples subjected to colonial rule or foreign occupation. Moreover, Cuba views the promotion of intervention disguised as humanitarian efforts and concern for human rights as an attempt to downplay the importance of the people's right to self-determination. There are sufficient arguments to prove that certain northern countries become concerned about the problems of others only when they are moved by political considerations that are entirely foreign to the essence of these rights, the Cuban diplomat stated. Perez Novoa said a small group of states is trying to force the rest of the world to accept certain ideological patterns of conduct whether they like it or not. Perez Novoa said that countries that have been colonized and exploited for centuries are now being forced to adopt imported economic and political models that pose serious limitations to their national sovereignty and therefore to the full exercise of their self-determination. It is being done under the pretext that such models must necessarily be applied throughout the entire world. According to the diplomat, he would like to see a humanitarian intervention in one of the northern countries at the request of a group of underdeveloped nations. The disregard for self-determination has reached such a point that those who are calling for the so-called humanitarian interventions and theories about limited sovereignty would rather have this principle disappear from the Human Rights Commission agenda altogether, Perez Novoa said. He added that neither preventive diplomacy, limited sovereignty, nor humanitarian interference would resolve the serious problems of mankind, among which he mentioned the inhumane conditions that lead to millions of deaths each year as well as poverty, hunger, and illiteracy. Imagine a world where the law of the jungle prevails, in which manipulation and political interests prevail over the majority of countries, denying them the right to freely decide their future.
