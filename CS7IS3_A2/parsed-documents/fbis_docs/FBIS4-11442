[Begin Fernandez de Cevallos recording] I believe Dr. Zedillo suggested the three main parties hold the first debate. I, however, am willing to attend debates with the other candidates. We all have the right to participate. It would be practically impossible to have all the candidates in the same place at the same time, but I am open to the idea, and the other candidates will find that I am very willing to participate with them in many debates. Perhaps we can soon set dates to debate national issues and our political proposals with other candidates. [end recording] [Further on in the same newscast, there is a recording of Institutional Revolutionary Candidate Ernesto Zedillo responding to Fernandez de Cevallos' acceptance of the debate invitation: "I am very pleased to know that a least one of the candidates I invited to this debate has responded in the most constructive manner possible. He has even suggested a date, 3 May, and a debate format. This encourages me, and I would like to tell the candidate who answered my invitation that I accept the date he suggested."]
