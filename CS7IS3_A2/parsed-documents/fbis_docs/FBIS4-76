SADF Communications Chief Director Maj-Gen Gert Opperman said on Wednesday [30 March] predictions of a turn-out of as low as five per cent were hopelessly exaggerated. Last year 49 per cent of part-time SADF members reported for service when called up, and only 10.6 percent failed to report for duty. Others obtained exemption, served in crucial posts or could not be traced, said Gen Opperman. The election call-up period is from April 15 to May 15. Gen Opperman said he wanted to stop predictions of a low response rate because this could lead to its realisation. "I can't see how such predictions can be made. If people stop creating a negative perception, and concentrate on the positive, we can expect a good number of men." The call-up had the approval of most parties, including the End Conscription Campaign and the African National Congress, he said. "They are all saying that the chaps should report. The call-up is truly in the national interest and for ensuring free and fair elections. I think people will react responsibly despite their personal fears because this will be in South Africa's macro-security interests." Part-time force members would get salaries equalling those of their permanent force colleagues during the call-up period. Subject to approval, the SADF would also pay an allowance to them and permanent force members deployed to assist the police. Asked about concerns about the party-political loyalties of part-time SADF members and units, Gen Opperman said: "We have total confidence in the members of our part-time forces and think they will react very responsibly without allowing party politics to influence their judgment."
