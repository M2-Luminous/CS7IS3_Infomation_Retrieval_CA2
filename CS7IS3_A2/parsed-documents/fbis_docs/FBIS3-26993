Beijing yesterday gave its first indications of dissatisfaction with the latest financing proposal submitted by the British side more than a week ago. Britain's fourth funding proposal in a year was believed to have met China's demand for a bigger equity injection to cushion debts incurred by the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) and the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC). But Chinese sources yesterday said the obstacles to agreement remained two-fold. The proposed equity injection of $60 billion is contingent on China's approval of an additional land grant. Britain wants 62 hectares of land along the airport rail link sold under a gradual sell-off. The grant would be in addition to the annual 50-hectare ceiling for land sales stipulated in annexe three of the Sino-British Joint Declaration. But the Chinese side remains concerned about the effect of this on the coffers of the post-1997 Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. Sources said the Chinese side was reluctant to change the arrangement under which this land could be disposed of only by the SAR government. The other obstacle was the Chinese side's dissatisfaction with what it regarded as Britain's failure to establish an independent committee to monitor the cost of the airport project. It maintained that the British side had persistently circumvented the Airport Consultative Committee, a body set up to oversee financing arrangements. Despite China's concerns over the latest funding proposal, it is expected to propose a meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) Airport Committee next week. Chinese JLG team leader Guo Fengmin yesterday confirmed that Beijing had studied the fourth financing proposal, but that there were problems which needed to be discussed. Mr Guo would not elaborate. Three rounds of JLG expert meetings are expected to be held in the next two weeks. Next week, the two sides will try to resolve the impasse on the future of military sites in Hong Kong after 1997.
