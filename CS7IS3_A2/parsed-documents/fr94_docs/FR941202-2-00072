FR941202-2-00072 FR941202-2-00051 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,206] Vought Aircraft Company A/K/A LTV Aerospace & Defense Company Dallas, TX; Notice of Revised Determination on Reopening On November 9, 1994, the Department, at the request of the company reopened its investigation for the workers and former workers of the subject firm in Dallas, Texas. The initial investigation resulted in a negative determination on February 24, 1994 and was published in the Federal Register on March 10, 1994 (59 FR 11326). Findings on reopening show that a sufficient amount of aircraft subassembly work has been offloaded overseas and imported back to the subject firm. Sales at the subject firm decreased in 1993 compared to 1992. Substantial worker separations occurred at the subject firm in 1993 and 1994. Further, several appropriate subdivisions (job families at Vought Aircraft, a/k/a LTV Aerospace & Defense Company in Dallas) have already been certified to TAA under petitions TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,166, TA&hyph;W&hyph;30&hyph;167, TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,202, TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,249 and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,856. These certifications will be terminated and the workers will be covered under TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,206. Vought Aircraft workers certified under TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,470 are not affected by this notice. Conclusion After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reopening, its is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the aircraft subassemblies contributed importantly to the decline in sales or production and to the total or partial separation of workers at the subject facility. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination: All workers and former workers of Vought Aircraft Company, Dallas, Texas, except workers certified under TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,470, who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after October 6, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. The following certifications are terminated TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,166; TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,167; TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,202; TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,249 and TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,856 effective November 16, 1994. Certification TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,470 is not affected by this notice. Signed in Washington, D.C., this 16th day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29717 Filed 12&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
