Stoforopoulos: "Justified Fears"] [Text] The Greek prime minister's visit to the United States causes concern, because it has become obvious that the U.S. policy in our region not only does not take Greek interests into account but is opposed to them and is trying to "organize" the Balkans and the Near East against Hellenism, with Turkey as its axis. No one can believe that the only superpower cannot influence Ankara, Tirana, or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to support legality and peace. With our behavior, which has turned us into a mere object to be maneuvered by the United States and the other Western powers, we have contributed to the formulation of the U.S. policy. We have not really utilized any of our advantages and have let our defense and economy reach a state where our dependency has become complete. Our fears are being reinforced, because in all of the years that he has been responsible for our foreign policy, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has yielded to U.S. suggestions on substantive issues and tried to hide this behind a rhetorical screen. Before it assumed the leadership, we remember that PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] was opposed to the intercommunal talks in Cyprus but afterward willingly conveying to Nicosia the transatlantic requests for the intercommunal talks to continue and the pro-Turkish "solution" to be accepted. We remember how we stayed in the NATO consortium, the bases that were supposed to leave but remained, the exploit of the courageous Greek Armed Forces during the 1987 crisis in order to "put over" the postponing (at NATO inspiration) of our exerting our sovereign rights in the Aegean. We have not forgotten the first Davos conference (Papandreou-Papoulias) with the Americans behind the scenes (as they of course were during the second Davos conference of Mitsotakis-Samaras). What stance will the prime minister take in Washington? Will he stress the Turkish regime's natural fascist, expansionist character, which is being supported by the United States and presented as a model? Will he remind them of the Armenian and Pontian genocides, the September Revolution, the deportations, and other measures against Greeks and the Ecumenical Patriarchate? Measures that are still in effect. Will he condemn Ankara's behavior in Cyprus and northern Kurdistan, the Aegean, and Thrace? Will he refer to the murder of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis [in Cyprus]? Will he say that due to its nature, the Turkish regime is violating human rights each day? That it is continuously widening economic inequalities that arouse the public's discontent (as also expressed at the expansion of Islamism)? Will he underline the dangers of encouraging the Albanian authorities' antiminority policy and the Skopjean ideology? Will the prime minister tell the U.S. President that after 20 years of fruitless negotiations on Cyprus--during which the Turkish side has gradually hardened its demands while at the same time carrying out more illegal actions--Greece believes that no more talks should be held until all the Turkish troops and settlers withdraw from the island unconditionally, until the pseudostate renounces its claimed status, and until the basic freedoms of all Cypriots are restored? Will Greece stress that it will not give up any of its sovereign rights in the Aegean and that it will guard its sovereignty in Thrace? Will the prime minister strongly defend the just Greek positions in Macedonia and North Ipiros? This stance, which is the only beneficial one for the nation, would bring Greeks everywhere closer. It would make the activity of Greek-Americans particularly effective. Let us hope that the prime minister will not give in to pressure from Washington to make concessions on our national issues. For example, that it will not agree to support further discussion on the confidence-building measures on Cyprus because they favor the Turkish schemes. That it will not legalize Turkey's expansion and its machinations against Greece by accepting a third Davos conference. That it will not agree to "freeze Greek-Turkish disputes," even with NATO "guarantees," because its political vision is well known. If we followed such recommendations, the repercussions would be very negative and the "trade" for Greek-American business access to the Balkans unacceptable (even financially unprofitable).
