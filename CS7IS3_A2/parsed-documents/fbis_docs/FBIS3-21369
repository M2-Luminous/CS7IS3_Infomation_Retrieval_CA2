He talks about pan-Arabism, the SAP [Structural Adjustment Program], and the upcoming elections in this interview. [Ferchouche] What distinguishes the UDU from other parties and the RCD [Constitutional and Democratic Rally]? [Tlili] We are the only Tunisian party to have incorporated the Arab dimension into its political program. All the others, on the other hand, and I am not being polemical here at all, have added that element to their--demagogic--rhetoric purely as a matter of opportunism since the crisis in the Gulf. [Ferchouche] Isn't that paradoxical--didn't the Gulf crisis reveal the failure of pan-Arabism or at least of a certain form of pan-Arabism? [Tlili] For our part, we feel that nationalism is a basic fact among peoples. This is true even in the most authoritarian regimes like the former USSR, where, despite the support of Marxist ideology, the transfers of populations, and the "integration" policies, it was impossible to wipe out nationalism. What has happened in the Arab world is the failure of Arab nationalists, not of Arab nationalism. It is the same failure as that experienced by all those who have not incorporated the democratic dimension into their platforms and actions--all those who have used the just aspirations of the people as the basis of their dictatorships. The problem of the Arab world has been and remains democracy. For that matter, the simple reason why all attempts at union have always failed is, basically, the absence of democracy, on which the fate of any political plan depends nowadays. [Ferchouche] What is your economic program? [Tlili] It is premature to talk about an economic program when the election campaign has not yet officially begun. We will have plenty of time to explain our entire election platform to you. But here are the main outlines: we will place special emphasis on three problems: employment and vocational training, regional development, and exports. It is true that those problems are current topics and that they are being dealt with by the authorities, but the UDU is trying to find better solutions to them. Employment, which is currently the scourge of the West, could become a real problem in coming years if care is not taken. However, and this is not among its least advantages, the Tunisian economy still has several pools of jobs, although some sectors may be called upon sooner or later to undergo severe restructuring. Besides the need to carry out public works projects that are essential for modernizing our infrastructures, it would be sufficient, for example, to implement a new urban policy, if only by applying the legal arsenal available to the municipal governments, to create thousands of jobs. Vocational training is such an overworked subject that it is tending to become a pet theme. Without going into detail, I will say that we will propose an upgrading of training in the basic and service occupations, a coordination of training with the needs of the economy, and, above all, the supplying of training that will meet the requirements of relocation, particularly as regards certain jobs with a future such as data processing, telematics, and so on. Just consider that Swissair subcontracts its accounting to Bombay, India, whereas we are continuing to be subcontractors in areas where we will soon be supplanted by the Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam! As far as regional development is concerned, we will propose the establishment of economic zones and development centers that will have their own funds, which will be determined in proportion to their rates of growth. [Ferchouche] Are you talking about decentralization? [Tlili] It is no longer a question of decentralization, but rather of regionalization. Those regions will also have certain prerogatives clearly defined by law to enable them to take full or partial responsibility for certain sectors of economic, social, and cultural life that have traditionally been managed by the central government (schools, hospitals, and so on). This should result in genuine interregional competition. As regards exports--another subject that everybody talks about but very few understand--we feel that our export products will not be able to survive international competition, especially after 1995, which is when the GATT agreements will take effect, unless they are competitive in terms of quality, enter the distribution channels, and carry guarantees of quality and origin. All of this will require a great deal of financial investment. Are domestic savings sufficient to carry out all those programs? We do not think so. Hence the need for foreign investment, and we estimate that at least $1.5 billion per year will be needed for 10 years or so. And it seems obvious to us that Tunisia is not benefiting sufficiently from the opportunities for financial investment from abroad or from the relocation of industry from North to South: China attracted more than $130 billion in foreign investment in 1993. [Ferchouche] The great majority of the parties have criticized the SAP. What is your position on that subject? [Tlili] The SAP is a necessity, and regardless of our judgment and opinion of that program, it has obviously made steady progress over the past several years. Its first phase is drawing to a close. It has yielded favorable results from the standpoint of overall balances and growth. Those successes are due basically to the fact that Tunisia, through the personal impetus given by President Ben Ali, has managed to safeguard its social gains, something that is not the case in other countries, where we have seen the rise of discontent and even popular revolts following implementation of the SAP. For our part, we ourselves were saying from the start that those social gains--the quality of social services and public service--should not be victims of the SAP, because we feel that growth in the GNP [gross national product] is worth the trouble only if it does not make the rich richer and the poor poorer--that is, if it guarantees a maximum of general satisfaction. [Ferchouche] How do you intend to approach the elections? [Tlili] Under our internal rules, it is the National Council that decides election policy and appoints candidates. To begin with, work has been done at the regional federation level to draw up consensual slates of candidates. Now it will be up the National Council to ratify those rank-and-file decisions or arbitrate disagreements. [Ferchouche] Are alliances planned in connection with the elections? [Tlili] Alliances are no longer the order of the day. Putting together a coalition based on a common platform is out of date, and the timetable does not allow for it. That being said, we have been consistently calling for the formation of a democratic front since 6 April 1989, but we have also been insisting that such a front should be based on a common platform, not on a temporary coalition, because right from the start, we were afraid of combinations with a subjectively ephemeral character. On the other hand, I think there is still time for technical agreements among the parties aimed at ensuring that the elections go smoothly. At any rate, all we can say at this stage is that policies of one-upmanship must be avoided, because any one-upmanship leads to the appearance, if only temporarily, of extremes, meaning, in our case, a victory by all those who do not want Tunisia to get in step with the multiparty system and democracy. [Ferchouche] In your opinion, what are the necessary conditions for the success of the election campaign? [Tlili] Political action cannot be regulated solely by laws. The law is often ahead of reality, and mentalities must also change. That change is slowly but surely taking place in our country. Because of that, and speaking generally, we want the campaign on radio and television in particular to take place in conditions that will allow the various parties to express themselves and clearly set forth their platforms, thereby enabling the citizens to vote for the party they choose on the basis of its platform rather than on the basis of clever slogans. Because when all is said and done, the big challenge in the elections lies not so much in their competitive nature and the results they lead to as it does in the awareness that the voter gains through his action as a citizen capable of influencing, not to say directing, his country's policy on the basis of his basic choices. [Ferchouche] How do you see the postelection period? [Tlili] It is difficult to foresee the postelection period, but what one can say today is that on 21 March, all the parties in the race will have to assess the operation. Will we witness a movement to found new parties or realign some old ones? Perhaps. For our part, we have already scheduled a National Council meeting for the period after the election. There we will have to genuinely assess our election results and, on that basis, decide what steps to take. One such step might even be the calling of a special congress this fall.
