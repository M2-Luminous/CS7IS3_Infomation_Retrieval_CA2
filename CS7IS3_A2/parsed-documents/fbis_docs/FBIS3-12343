He called for escalating resistance to the Israeli occupation forces. He stressed that Israel does not seek peace in the region and that its attempts to circumvent the Geneva summit are continuing, sometimes by threatening to repeat last summer's aggression and at other times by imposing obstructionist conditions to withdrawal from south Lebanon and implementation of Resolution 425. For his part, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has called for collective action to end the occupation. He affirmed that a comprehensive and just peace is the means to achieve a genuine peace and noted that any partial agreement in the name of peace will only lead to further conflict and the shedding of innocent people's blood. The Amal Movement urged international legitimacy to prove its credibility and enforce the implementation of its resolutions, which Israel violates daily. The Progressive Socialist Party viewed the massacre as a message to the Arabs and Muslims and another disgrace for Zionism, which world public opinion acquitted of charges of racism at the United Nations. The National Liberal Party denounced the massacre and expressed fear of its negative impact on the peace process.
