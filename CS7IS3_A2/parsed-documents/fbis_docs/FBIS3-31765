[Reporter] Aleksander Kwasniewski, the Constitutional Commission chairman, said that yesterday's decision by the president to withdraw both his representative and his constitutional draft from the Constitutional Commission was in breach of law. According to the law [of 1991 on the procedure of preparing and adopting the constitution] it is the representatives of the president, the government, and the Constitutional Tribunal who should take part in the meetings of the commission. They all have the right to file motions. This is more of a duty than a right. Aleksander Kwasniewski said that using the Constitution as means to achieve an aim, irrespective of whether the objective is to compete for the presidential post, or to improve the image of the first man in the country, is wrong. On the other hand, Tadeusz Mazowiecki from the Democratic Union [UD] parliamentary floor group, said that he had noticed that also the government coalition, the coalition parliamentary majority, used the Constitution as a means to an end. Tadeusz Mazowiecki said that the Constitutional Commission Chairman, Aleksander Kwasniewski himself, had brought about the escalation of the conflict by saying, for example on the radio yesterday, that President Walesa could be facing a trial by the State Tribunal. Tadeusz Mazowiecki pointed out that the rejection by the Sejm on Friday [18 February] of the president's constitutional draft had been done in a manner openly arrogant, ostentatious, and contemptuous to President Walesa. Deputy Jerzy Gwizdz from the Non-Party Bloc for Supporting Reforms [BBWR] put forward a motion that the commission's proceedings be discontinued. He was supported by Leszek Moczulski from the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN].
