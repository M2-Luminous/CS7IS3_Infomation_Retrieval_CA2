This happened after the deputies approved Shota Kviraya as the Internal Minister. A part of attackers penetrated the conference hall. Fists were put in action, as well as insults heard, addressed to deputies who did not follow the opinion of police head appearing against Kviraya. After the incident was calmed down, the parliament unanimously qualified this action as an attempted coup and created a special commission to investigate the incident. As told SNARK the deputy head of Tbilisi police, Mikhail Saladze, who took part in the "assault" of parliament, the attackers "were governed in their actions by interests of struggle with criminals and strengthening of legal order in Tbilisi". "This was the only way to make us be heard", told Saladze. The 38-year-old major general Shota Kviraya was nominated by the head of Georgia as Internal Minister nearly eight months ago. However, due to the emergency state in the republic, the parliament only today could approve this nomination of the former state-security officer.
