Japan and Russia have been working out the schedule for the trip after Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Panov earlier this week agreed on Hata's visit in March. Fukuda and Panov agreed during two days of meetings in Moscow to promote political dialogue between the two nations and continue talks on a long-standing territorial dispute involving four Russian-held islands off Hokkaido. Conditions for Hata's visit were set after Yeltsin vowed Thursday in an address to Parliament to continue efforts to settle the territorial row with Japan and conclude a peace treaty, the officials said. Japan claims sovereignty over Etorofu, Kunashiri and Shikotan islands and the Habomai group of islets, which the former Soviet Union seized at the end of World War II. The dispute has prevented the two sides from concluding a peace treaty. But analysts say Tokyo and Moscow are unlikely to achieve any major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's visit because ultrarightists and conservatives, opposed to returning the islands to Japan, dominate the new Russian Parliament. During his visit, Hata may also meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of Parliament, the officials said. Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for Russia's reform efforts and shift toward a market-oriented economy in his talks with Russian leaders, they said. He is also likely to discuss promoting personnel exchanges between the two nations, they said.
