FR940216-0-00131 FR940216-0-00010 One commenter stated that the requirement of a quality assurance program in addition to all other testing and audit requirements, is redundant. EPA believes that quality assurance sampling and testing is essential so that there is an incentive for parties to adequately monitor the quality of gasoline received and shipped/delivered. The principal purpose of quality assurance sampling and testing, in EPA's view, is to alert a party to gasoline quality problems so that the party may correct the problem and the conditions that caused the problem before EPA documents any violations. Other enforcement mechanisms that are included in the reformulated gasoline program are important for their own reasons, but EPA does not believe they eliminate the need for sampling and testing. In addition, the existence of an adequate quality assurance program is a separate element of the defense to a presumption of liability because EPA does not feel confident that a party did not cause a violation absent such evidence. For example, even if one party can show that another party was the apparent or primary cause of a downstream violation, that does not on its own show that the first party did not also cause the violation. The fungible nature of the gasoline distribution system could well lead to situations where more than one and perhaps several parties contributed to a violation detected downstream. Absent a sufficient quality assurance program, production of proper transfer records, and any other evidence needed to show that the first party did not cause the violation, EPA does not believe that the first party has properly rebutted the presumption of liability. A quality assurance program, which involves sampling and testing the gasoline while it is in the hands of a party, is reasonably considered a necessary, minimum element of properly showing that a party did not cause a violation and thereby rebutting a presumption of liability. Refiners, importers and oxygenate blenders are required to conduct sampling and testing under the regulations, as well as have independent audits performed. For those parties, the required sampling and testing may well satisfy the quality assurance element of a defense to presumptive liability and is therefore not redundant. For those parties it only calls for additional sampling and testing where the required sampling and testing would not be adequate to satisfy that element of the defense. For all other parties, the quality assurance element of a defense is not redundant as there is no required sampling and testing for other parties. Nevertheless, sampling and testing by parties other than refiners, importers, and oxygenate blenders is not required by the final rule, but rather is a voluntary defense element only. If a party believes that no violations will occur as a result of other program requirements, the party could choose to avoid a quality assurance sampling and testing program. Such a decision would, however, increase the risk of violation attributable to the party. Without a quality assurance sampling and testing program a party would have scant basis for knowing if the gasoline it receives and ships or delivers meets standards. In addition, in the event the party's confidence is misplaced and EPA documents a violation for which the party is presumed liable, the party would be unable to establish a defense against that liability. A commenter requested that EPA define the frequency of sampling and testing that EPA would consider sufficient to satisfy the quality assurance defense element. Another commenter recommended that EPA should base enforcement actions exclusively on EPA testing using regulatory test methods and not on oversight sampling and testing by regulated parties. EPA is reluctant to specify the details of a ``sufficient'' quality assurance sampling and testing program, because the type of program that is sufficient in any situation depends on the particular facts of that situation. In addition, EPA believes regulated parties are closest to their own operations and are therefore in the best position to judge the program that is adequate. Typically, such a program should include sampling and testing of a representative sampling of the gasoline the party receives and ships or delivers; identification of any sample that is in violation of relevant standards, and for such a sample, correction of the violation and the conditions that caused the violation; and an increased rate of sampling and testing when conditions indicate an increased likelihood of violations (e.g., violating samples found). In the case where a violation is detected through a party's quality assurance program, and the party corrects both the violation and the conditions that caused the violation without any involvement by EPA, EPA generally forgoes any enforcement on the basis of the party's test results. If the party does not follow-up on violations in this manner, however, EPA may initiate an enforcement action on the basis of the party's test results. Carrier-commenters objected to the quality assurance sampling and testing defense element as applied to carriers. Commenters stated that a carrier is in a uniquely weak position in the gasoline distribution system to verify the characteristics of product received in order to rebut an assertion that the carrier caused a violation.
