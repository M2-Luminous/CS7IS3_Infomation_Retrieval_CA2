Conomuissa said this week fighter bombers from Lubango attacked the villages of Ucua, Canopa, Vila Branca, and Cucesse, killing 50 civilians. Most of the victims were elderly people and children. Conomuissa said the enemy abducted 57 civilians from (Sicocosse), Cambiri, and Capeua. The civilians were killed and their corpses abandoned on the road. Those who escaped from the attacks were killed in explosions caused by land mines that Joao de Matos' men planted in roads leading to farms. The situation is worrying the residents of those areas.
