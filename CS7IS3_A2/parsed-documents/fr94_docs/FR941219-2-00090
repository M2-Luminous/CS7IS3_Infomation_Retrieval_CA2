ACTION: Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and Notice of Scoping Meetings. SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the Bureau of Land Management, Coos Bay District, will be directing the preparation of an EIS to be prepared by a third party contractor on the impacts of the proposed construction of the Bal'diyaka Interpretive Center. DATES: Written comments will be accepted until January 10, 1995. Public scoping meetings will be held from 3 to 5 and 7 to 9 p.m. on Monday, January 9, 1995, at BLM's Coos Bay Office, 1300 Airport Lane, North Bend, OR and from 3 to 5 and 7 to 9 p.m. on Tuesday, January 10, 1995, at BLM's Eugene Office, 2890 Chad Drive, Eugene, OR. Additional briefing meetings will be considered as appropriate. ADDRESSES: Comments concerning issues to be addressed in the EIS should be addressed to: District Manager, Coos Bay District, 1300 Airport Lane, North Bend, OR 97459&hyph;2000, Attn: Bal'diyaka Project. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Daryl Albiston, Tioga Area Manager, Coos Bay District, 1300 Airport Lane, North Bend, OR 97459&hyph;2000, (503) 756&hyph;0100. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: BLM, in cooperation with the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua & Siuslaw, et al. is considering the construction of an interpretive center to be located near the Cape Arago Lighthouse on Gregory Point in Coos County, OR (T. 26 S., R. 14 W., Sec. 4, Willamette Meridian). The center will be known as the Bal'diyaka Interpretive Center and could feature the Native American history of the local tribes, as well as the historic use of this site by the U.S. Lifesaving Service and the U.S. Coast Guard. The proposed action may consist of one or more new buildings to house the interpretive displays, meeting rooms, offices, a new lighthouse, and related infrastructure needs. Potential issues include, but may not be limited to, vehicular access and parking; social and economic values; recreation; impacts on cultural resources, traditional Native American resources, geology and mineral resources, visual resources, soil, watershed, and vegetation resources. The project area will encompass approximately 40 acres, while the area of consideration of impacts will be much larger and include the communities of Coos Bay, Charleston, North Bend, as well as associated rural areas. Consideration will be given to adjacent Federal and State administered lands as well as County and private lands and the affect on local land use planning. The specific location, design and arrangement is yet to be determined. Alternatives to be considered, other than the No Action Alternative, are unknown at this time. The Bureau of Land Management's scoping process for the EIS will include: (1) Identification of issues to be addressed; (2) Identification of viable alternatives; and (3) Notifying interested groups, individuals, and agencies so that additional information concerning these can be obtained. The scoping process will consist of this Federal Register Notice; a legal notice in local newspapers announcing the scoping meetings; letters of invitation to participate in the scoping process; and a scoping meeting agenda which further clarifies the proposed action, range of alternatives and previously identified significant issues being considered, to be distributed to selected parties and available upon request. Dated: November 29, 1994 Melvin Chase, District Manager. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;31159 Filed 12&hyph;16&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;33&hyph;P&hyph;M
