Its performance created a lot of excitement among the delegates and among those present were the IAF top brass who seemed truly impressed. The aircraft which displayed its prowess at the Bangalore air show was the British Aerospace advanced jet trainer (AJT), Hawk and exactly a month later the government of India has decided to acquire this aircraft for the IAF. The Hawk's immediate rival, the Franco-German Alpha which was also to have been displayed at this air show, pulled out and French aviation officials were unable to explain this sudden move. This further lent credence to the theory that the Alpha advanced jet trainer (AJT) had lost the race to get into the IAF inventory. The government of India has been dithering over the choice of the AJT for more than a decade and efforts by various IAF chiefs to convince the government to take a quick decision had proved futile. The IAF was in dire need of a trainer because of the difficulties pilots faced while graduating from the subsonic Kiran trainer to the supersonic aircraft. This transition was being done on the Hunters but they had now become old. According to the former deputy chief of air staff, C.V. Gole, "the government's perennial excuse for delaying the decision on the AJT was lack of funds." While the government remained undecided on such an important matter, IAF pilots were all the while facing a mismatch between man and machine, as a pilot took combat training in an aircraft with old technology, but had to fly a modern fighter like the Mirage 2000 and Mig-29. This eventually began to take its toll. Initially, there were four types of AJTs trying for the attention of the Indian government. These were the British Aerospace Hawk, the Dassault Breguet-Dornier Alpha, Aeromachhi's MB-339 and Czechoslovakia's Aero L-39. After evaluation, the choice narrowed down between the Alpha and the Hawk. Eventually, the Hawk has emerged victorious. Explaining why the Alpha was not found suitable, Mr P. Upendra, MP [,ember of Parliament], said in the Rajya Sabha on August 27, 1993, that the last model of this aircraft was produced in 1986. He said: "All Dassault proposes is to transfer to India its jigs and tooling equipment, which have been lying idle in France for years since there is no further market for Alpha jets anywhere in the world..." Thus the Alpha lost out. Media reports today speak of the Union cabinet giving the green signal for the acquisition of 66 British Aerospace Hawks, expected to cost over Rs 6,000 crores. The first major Hawk variant was the "50 series" which was sold to Finland, Kenya and Indonesia. The "50 series" was succeeded in 1981 by the "60 series" which incorporated changes in the avionic system. This was the aircraft being considered by the IAF. The Hawk-60 with various changes resulted in a 33 percent payload increase and a 30 percent increase in range. Its customers include Zimbabwe, Dubai, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and Switzerland. In 1984 came Hawk-200 which was followed three years later by the Hawk 100 which was displayed at Bangalore. The question is whether the government will now opt for this variant of the Hawk?
