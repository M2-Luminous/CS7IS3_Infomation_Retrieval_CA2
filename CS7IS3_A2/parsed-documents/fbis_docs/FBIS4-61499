The seminar's theme was expressed rather dryly: "Questions of Citizenship and the Position of Fellow-Countrymen in Nearby Foreign Countries." However, the report by Abdulakh Mikitayev, chairman of the president's Citizenship Commission, the speech by Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov, and -- most of all -- the reports from Russian diplomats were imbued with genuine alarm at the plight of the Russian-speaking population in nearby foreign countries, first and foremost Estonia and Latvia. The situation in the Republic of Latvia provides the most glaring example of the overt "expulsion" of Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Poles. Here are a few facts. According to the 1989 census 64.5 percent of the population of Riga were non-Latvians (mainly Russian), in Liepaja the figure was 61.2 percent, and in Daugavpils 87 percent. The figures have changed now, but at any rate 45-60 percent of the population in those cities is Russian. The vast mass of them were already deprived of citizenship (apart from those who were citizens of Latvia before 1940 and those of special service to the republic) and in 1993 they were deprived even of the possibility of participating in the formation of local self-government. The majority of them have the status of "permanent resident" and have only the hope of obtaining citizenship -- as a rule an impossible hope. A lot has been said about the language barrier. Let us add just a small comment here: Enterprise directors who hire Russians with no knowledge of the local language are liable to be fined. "Occupation forces -- get out of the good apartments!" is a slogan you can often see in Latvia. At the moment, however, it is no more than a slogan. In conversation with your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent, Georgiy Isakovskiy, head of the Russian Federation Embassy Consular Department in the Republic of Latvia, talked about the activity of the Latvian Ministry of Internal Affairs Department of Citizenship and Migration. Despite the fact that this structure's work is regulated by secret documents, which therefore have no force, it ventures to do things which violate the constitution and laws of Latvia. A circular stamp placed in a passport by the department denotes a Russian serviceman, a square stamp denotes a reservist. These marks are grounds for overt discrimination when it comes to hiring people and the registration of ownership rights. The Latvian press publishes lists of the Russian military complete addresses and telephone numbers -- so everyone can display "civic activeness." Recently a highly sophisticated process began in which residents who travel to neighboring countries (Russia, Estonia, and Belorussia) [Belarus] to visit relatives are exiled [vysylayutsya]. They are forced to obtain Russian general civil foreign passports, and when they return to Latvia (people travel without a visa, of course) the Latvian residence permits in the former USSR passports are canceled and the Russian general civil foreign passports are stamped to prohibit them from entering the country for five years and order them to leave Latvia within seven days. Tyranny? Yes, without doubt. And this is acknowledged by the Latvian courts when they restore the rights of permanent residents of the country. But by no means everyone goes to court -- a large proportion of them sell their property within seven days and leave for Russia. If these people do not leave or appeal to the court action is taken against them...no, not by the law enforcement agencies but by detachments of the "zemessargi" [home defense guard]. It is staggering but true that a state structure -- the Department for Citizenship and Migration -- bases its activity on the "zemessargi." Organized on the pattern of the Volksdeutsche and Hitler Youth, these youth structures have the job of intimidating the Russian-speaking population. But why are the permanent residents of the Republic of Latvia not expressing dissatisfaction, why are they not uniting? They have been banned from doing that. The charters of organizations whose purpose is to defend human rights in Latvia are not registered. If their charter contains no line to that effect but the organizations engage in this activity anyway, they are banned on the grounds that they are not abiding by their charter. All associations of Russians in Latvia except cultural societies are essentially underground. How can human rights violations in the nearby foreign countries be combated? Boris Pastukhov described as urgent the signing of a "package" of agreements with Latvia (that is, together with the settlement of the situation concerning military pensioners). The Russian Federation deputy foreign minister noted that the Latvian side is dragging out the talks and in this situation a Russian action program is being prepared to protect the rights of specific inhabitants. Abdulakh Mikitayev declared that Russia must grant dual citizenship to residents after the conclusion of the corresponding accords with nearby foreign states, and cited the experience of France and Canada, where there are more than 2 million people with dual citizenship.
