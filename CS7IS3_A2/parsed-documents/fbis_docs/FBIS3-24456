Ms. Kurkova accused the missing man of organizing the mass provocation against her personally and against the democratic management of the television and radio company as a whole by setting up a sponsorship agreement between "Kommercheskiy tsentr TV i radio Peterburga" [Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. Petersburg] and the limited partnership "Nevskiy Glashatay" [Neva Herald], which her husband, Vadim Tareyev, heads. That agreement was the cause of the scandal. According to information which is as yet unconfirmed, Mr. Syroyezhin is now in Austria, protecting himself from the focused interest of law enforcement organs. People in the company are also saying that the missing man called Ms. Kurkova and informed her that he is in one of the hospitals on Russian Federation territory where he is hiding from the "raids" of racketeers. It is possible, however, that both versions are far from reality, since contradictory rumors are flying through the halls of the RGTRK [Russian State Television and Radio Company] that Mr. Syroyezhin was seen in the United States, while others allege that he has "holed up" in Moscow. However, it has become known that there exist directives signed by Mr. Syroyezhin transferring large amounts of the television and radio company's capital abroad--to the account of the company TV and Radio St. Petersburg, whose founder is once again Mr. Syroyezhin himself. Taking into account the fact that it was the "American" company TV and Radio St. Petersburg which, with the approval of the vice premier of the Russian government, Vladimir Shumeyko, was supposed to receive 49 percent of the charter capital in conjunction with the joint stock company RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 (the RGTRK with Mr. Shumeyko's approval was supposed to invest all its buildings, structures, and equipment in the joint stock company's charter capital); it is likely that the scandal will prove to be larger than was initially supposed. It is interesting that Mr. Syroyezhin at one time was appointed deputy chairman of the RGTRK by that same Ms. Kurkova. Now even she and her husband are trying to have nothing to do with the energetic Mr. Syroyezhin. In a statement on one of the broadcasts of St. Petersburg radio, Mr. Tareyev explained that he took R12 million as sponsorship aid from the joint stock company Commercial TV and Radio Center of St. Petersburg (although he suspected its indirect budget origin) and surrendered to the persuasion of Mr. Syroyezhin whom he trusted because he knew his father, a scientist well known in Petersburg. Ms. Kurkova in turn explained that she knew nothing at all about her husband's firm receiving major financial aid from the partners of the state television and radio company which she manages. Now the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 is trying to impart a purely political look to the scandal surrounding the RGTRK's financial activity. In a broadcast on St. Petersburg radio, which is subordinate to Ms. Kurkova, she was called a "fearless journalist whom her enemies, most of whom she acquired during the years of perestroyka, want to settle accounts with." Taking into account that the political opposition had a hand in the appearance of the packet of documents on the activity of the management of the RGTRK Petersburg-Channel 5 at the procurator's office, Bella Kurkova announced that the ultimate goal of the organizers of the scandal is to "remove first Kurkova, and then Sobchak, and then even Yeltsin from office." A special presidential commission which came to St. Petersburg to verify the accusations against Ms. Kurkova is more and more inclined to the conclusion that if the RGTRK management did in fact do some strange things, it was not out of malice; the head of the commission, Andrey Semikolennyy, announced in an interview on St. Petersburg radio: "Kurkova has become a victim of major political provocation." It is altogether possible that even the city procurator's office will be satisfied with the explanations of the "difficult circumstances" in which the management of the television and radio company found itself and will terminate the investigation.
