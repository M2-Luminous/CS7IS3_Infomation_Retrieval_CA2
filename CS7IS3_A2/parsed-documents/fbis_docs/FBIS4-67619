According to Belarmino, Embrapa [Brazilian Agriculture and Livestock Research Enterprise] is ready to launch a product based on a combination of bacteria that attacks caterpillars feeding on leguminous and citrus plants. There are 10,000 species of insects that eat, destroy, or attack in other ways plants and animals that are important for the survival of mankind. Some species, such as locusts, may completely destroy some crops. Belarmino said that the new microorganism was obtained by crossing two bacteria in the laboratory: the Bacilus Turingenses- Kurstaki and the Bacilus Turingenses-Aizawa. He noted that this is among 200 research papers to be submitted to the Fourth Biological Symposium to be held in Gramado (Rio Grande do Sul State) from 15 to 20 May, with the attendance of 350 scientists from 50 countries. The First Symposium on Biological Control in the Southern Cone and the Fifth Brazilian Meeting on Biological Control of Plant Diseases will also be held at the same time. Another new method that is already being applied in Mato Grosso is the use of a bug feeding on manure to fight horn flies, one of the main livestock health problems. These bugs plow in manure and bury part of the horn fly larva underground, thus gradually rendering them useless. In so doing, these bugs are preventing the reproduction of horn flies already at the larva stage. Belarmino concedes that there are no laws in Brazil regulating the creation of new living organisms, Embrapa's research on microorganisms, the crossing of bacteria, and the separation of genes. He guarantees, however, that every precautionary measure and biological control procedures established by the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, by Ibama [Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources], and by Embrapa itself are followed. The use of biological agents will make it possible to reduce by half the use of pesticides in plague control. The main success remains the use of Bacolovirus Anticarsi in fighting the soybean plague already in 1.2 hectares [figure as published] in Brazil -- the largest area in the world under biological control. This area accounts for 10 percent of the country's overall soybean plantation and for 40 percent of soybean plantations in Rio Grande do Sul.
