The news conference was attended by reporters of newspapers, news agencies, and broadcasting networks in Pyongyang and foreign reporters. Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, made remarks at the news conference. Cho Il-min informed the reporters of the white paper published by the SKNDF Central Committee to expose the nuclear arms development maneuvers of the South Korean puppet clique and mentioned the purpose of publishing this white paper. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and their stooges are waging the anti-North and antisocialist smear campaign on the pretext of the nonexistent nuclear issue of the North and are expanding it in a step-by-step manner. Thus, they are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to a touch and go war crisis. He said that because the South Korean people cannot be the victims of such a slanderous nuclear smear campaign, the SKNDF Central Committee decided to publish a white paper to expose the truth of the situation before fair public opinion of the world. He said that the heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok are used for the development of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula and the basis for this is that enough plutonium capable of producing 34 nuclear warheads a year is being generated from the heavy water reactor in Wolsong, and that plutonium is being generated from the multipurpose research reactor in a more rapid manner than heavy water. He also pointed out that the South Korean figures involved in the nuclear development themselves confessed that these reactors were introduced for the purpose of developing nuclear weapons, and that since nuclear materials can be extracted even during operation, supervision is difficult [kamdokto kollanhada]. Cho Il-min, chief of the mission, expressed the hope that the reporters will pay attention to nuclear weapons development maneuvers in south Korea, and will report and create public opinion in a fair and impartial manner. He answered questions raised by reporters. The white paper of the SKNDF Central Committee was distributed to reporters at the news conference.
