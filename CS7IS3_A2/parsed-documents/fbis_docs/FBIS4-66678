In an historic verdict, the supreme court today unanimously upheld the dismissal of the erstwhile BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] governments in M.P. [Madhya Pradesh], Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh in the wake of the demolition of the Babri masjid at Ayodhya on December 6, 1992, and at the same time struck down as unconstitutional the sacking of the three other ministries, including that of the S.R. Bommai (Janata Dal) in Karnataka, reports PTI [Press Trust of India]. It is for the first time the dismissal of state governments and imposition of President's rule has been held as unconstitutional. Delivering judgment on petitions challenging the validity of Article 356 of the constitution under which these governments were dismissed and President's rule imposed, the nine-judge bench, headed by Mr. Justice S.R. Pandian, declared in unequivocal terms that secularism being the bedrock of the constitution, any act of a state to subvert this could "lawfully be deemed to give rise to a situation where the government cannot be carried on in accordance with law". The judges on the bench comprised Mr. Justice A.M. Ahmedi, Mr. Justice Kuldip Singh, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma, Mr. Justice P.B. Sawant, Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy, Mr. Justice S.C. Aggarwal, Mr. Justice Yogeshwar Dayal and Mr. Justice B.P. Jeevan Reddy. The bench, however, held as unconstitutional the 1989 dismissal of the Janata Dal government headed by Mr. S.R. Bommai in Karnataka and the Meghalaya and Nagaland governments in January 1991 and August 1988 respectively. The judges made it clear that they could, however, not direct the revival of these governments as fresh elections held during the intervening periods had led to the installation of new ministries. The sharpest indictment of the policies and programmes of the Bharatiya Janata Party came from Mr. Justice K. Ramaswamy who dwelt at length in separate but concurring judgment on the party's efforts to use religion in politics which was expressly prohibited by the constitution. "Any act by a political party or government of a state in furtherance of its policies and programmes to mix religion with politics is violative of not only the law but the constitution," Mr. Justice Ramaswamy declared. The judge observed that if religion was overplayed by political parties it was bound to result in eruption of social tensions. Religion he said cannot be mixed with politics. Justifying the imposition of President's rule and the dissolution of the assemblies of the three states, Mr. Justice Ramaswamy said when the President feels that religion had been mixed with politics by the party in power he was free to reach a satisfaction under Article 356 in accordance with law. Earlier, Mr. Justice Pandian in his judgment said he was however, of the firm opinion that the power of the President to impose President's rule and dissolve assemblies, should be used sparingly only when he was fully satisfied as to the situation. The party in power at the Centre should not be allowed to use the provision to disrupt constitutional balance by frequent exercise of the power through the President who acts on the advice of the Centre. Mr. Justice Pandian pointed out that as per official records, in the last 41 years Article 356 had been invoked by various ruling parties in power at the Centre 95 times. On 23 occasions assemblies were dissolved and in 18 cases the assemblies kept in suspended animation had been revived. "Pathetically, the provisions had been used frequently to disrupt constitutional balance and as a result the chief ministers of the states were held in perpetual fear of the act of Presidential proclamation. The chief ministers were in many cases not sure that they would remain in power and stand up in their seats to fulfil constitutional obligations," Mr. Justice Pandian said. In his judgment, Mr. Justice Ahmedi said article 74(2) under which the Prime Minister and his council of ministers advice the President in the exercise of his power to impose President's rule was not a bar for judicial review of the decision. Merely because a political party had come to power at the Centre with a majority was not sufficient reason for imposition of President's rule to dislodge state governments led by other political parties. In his concurring judgment, Mr. Justice J.S. Verma said only objective factors like subversion of the principles of secularism and failure of constitutional machinery of the state could be used to invoke Article 356. The judge said imponderable materials which do not strictly constitute legal evidence and thus are incapable of being tested in a court of law, cannot be judicially reviewable. Mr. Justice P.B. Sawant in his judgment ruled that the validity of the proclamation under Article 356 was judicially reviewable to the extent that the materials relied on by the President were not relevant or extraneous and the exercise of power was malafide. In such a case if the concerned state government effected by the decision could make out a prima facie case then it would be the burden of the Central government to prove that the materials did in fact exist. Mr. Justice Sawant was also of the view that article 74(2) was not a bar against scrutiny of the material on which the President had based his satisfaction. The judge made it clear that since Article 356 was also intended to check the power of the President in imposing Presidents rule, it was not permissible for the President to take irreversible action of dissolving the state assembly till Parliament approved his action in imposing President's rule. Mr. Justice Sawant said if the presidential proclamation was held invalid notwithstanding Parliament's approval the court had the power to restore status quo ante of the legislative assembly.
