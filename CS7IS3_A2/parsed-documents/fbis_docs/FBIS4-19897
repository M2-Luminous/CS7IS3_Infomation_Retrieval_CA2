Answering questions of the press in the airport, before departing for Azerbaijan, Cetin said that the prime minister had called him this morning. `The P.M. called me this morning and said that she and U.S. President Bill Clinton had not talked about Cyprus during their tete-a-tete meeting in Washington,' he said. During their telephone conversation, Premier Ciller also wanted the foreign minister to tell her the details of a daily's report on Saturday who quoted U.S. President Bill Clinton saying that he and Ciller had discussed the Cyprus issue and that Ciller promised him to resolve the matter soon. `We have already reviewed the issue and found out that Clinton has not said these words,' Cetin said. He added that the Cyprus coordinator of the U.S. state department, Robert Lamb, had called the Turkish Embassy in Washington and briefed the embassy on the talks made between Clinton and Greek Premier Papandreou in his presence. `I reviewed these minutes and could not find anything which would yield such a meaning,' Cetin said. Cetin pointed out that all these rumors were a result of the distortions of the Greek press. `I know it from my own experience that the Greek press distorts my own statements from time to time,' he said. Cetin recalled that Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus President Rauf Denktas and Turkey had initially accepted in principle, the confidence-building measures formulated by the UN secretary general. `However,' he said, `additions made to the package, which can be categorized under four broad groups, are all giving certain advantages to the Greek Cypriots and TRNC President Denktas, rightfully has said that this was not the original package. `Turkey has supported the stand of Denktas.' The second package, proposed by the UN on March 21 as a `non-document document' gives the control of roads leading to Maras [Varosha] to the UN, gives the control of customs to a UN official in Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport and Maras, limits Turkish planes using the Lefkose Airport and gives other priorities to Greek Cypriots. The original package of July 1993, had foreseen to open the Lefkose Airport to international traffic and to place the uninhabited Maras section of the TRNC to the UN monitoring.
