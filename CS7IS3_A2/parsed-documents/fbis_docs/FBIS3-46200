Qiao, who is the first NPC chairman to visit Austria, was greeted at the airport by Fischer. In a written speech released at the airport, Qiao spoke of the all-round development of the friendly relations and cooperation between the two countries in various fields since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 20 years ago. Contacts between China's NPC and the Austrian National Council are on the increase, he said.
