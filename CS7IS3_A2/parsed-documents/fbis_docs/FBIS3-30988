These properties are -- let me remind your viewers and all those people who are following the work and visit of the Yugoslav delegation -- that it has been representing and I think that it will continue to represent a bridge between the two civilizations, a region without which modern world could not even be imagined. However, if somebody claims -- I am therefore in a way already inviting critics of such a visit and its consequences -- that progress is very small, insignificant, or that it is (?benign), I would not agree with this, because such steps which pervade concrete lives show that life itself can often influence the creation of politics or can change politics in a certain way. It is not true that only politics can influence life and change it in this or the other way. I think that the Croatian public, just as the public in Yugoslavia, is aware of the fact that the politics that is on the scene in Yugoslavia today is of such a kind that its only aim is to establish peace and to carry out policy devoid of any arrogance, arrogance which is, so to speak, alien to Yugoslav politics. [Avramovic] Were the Serbian Krajinas, or, as the Croatian side puts it, the regions under UN protection, touched upon [in the talks]? [Simic] It goes without saying that when I said that the most sensitive issues and the most difficult questions which in a way represent disturbing factors in the relations between the two countries were touched upon, that the problem of the krajinas could not be avoided in any way. However, I must say that both sides -- it is immodest to say so on behalf of my own delegation, but I think that the Croatian side will also confirm that -- have shown the good intention that any kind of extremism should be avoided in taking any stands. The Yugoslav side had a clear stand that the legitimate will of the Serbian people in the krajinas cannot be avoided and that it is the factor which we must take into account and will always take into account. [Avramovic] Which of these conclusions, these agreements you consider to be the most significant? [Granic] Well, I would say that the most important thing is that we have agreed that settling Croat-Serbian relations and the relations between the Republic of Croatia and the FRY is the foundation of the stability of the region and that all problems should be solved in [word indistinct]. In the concrete case, as regards the commission for the disappeared persons, refugees, and humanitarian issues, this is a great step forward. There are problems on both sides equally, and they can be solved only in such an atmosphere.
