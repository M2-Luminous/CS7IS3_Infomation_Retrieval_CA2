ITAR-TASS learned this from a well-informed source. The source said there is a conflict between deputy ministers and Nechayev, so Moskvichev and Starodubov deemed it impossible to work under his direction. Nechayev has signed the resignations which are now considered by the government. New candidatures to fill the posts have already been found, ITAR-TASS was told.
