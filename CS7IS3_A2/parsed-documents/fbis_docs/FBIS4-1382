Since the death of President Habyarimana on 6 April and the ethnic atrocities in Kigali, the RPF has been closing in on the capital. Abe Saleh asked our Kigali correspondent, Nestor Serushago, about the state of fighting today: [Begin recording] [Serushago] In the northern part of this town, about five kilometers from the heart of the city, there is a heavy fighting between Rwandese forces and the RPF. Battling, each one wanting to get a hold of the top of those hills to the north so that he can control the town. It is going on right now. [Saleh] Is the fighting only in the north of Kigali? [Serushago] It is where I can see it is concentrated but also the eastern (?hills) and the south, there are sporadic shootings but not as heavy as that in the north. [end recording] Not much has been heard recently of the transitional government who fled Kigali to Giterama, south of the city. But now, the commerce minister, (Justin Mugenzi), has turned up in our office in Nairobi. Robin White asked him if now that the cease-fire had broken down, it meant they would be fighting to the bitter end. [Begin recording] [(Mugenzi)] I understand that RPF does not want anything else than fighting, fighting, fighting. We are trying our best to get whoever can have influence on Ugandan Government because all lies with the Ugandan Government, so that Museveni can bring this RPF to reasoning and asked them to stop it. [White] Are you claiming that he controls the RPF in some way? [(Mugenzi)] Well, not only controls but he orders the men, we are convinced that without him, RPF will not behave this way. [White] Are you losing the war at the moment? [(Mugenzi)] No, we are not. We are not losing the war, we are only losing people, because people are dying in big numbers, and this is a pity. It is a pity so many people are dying because of this war. And we want to bring an end to the war so that people can stop dying. [White] But doesn't it look as you might shortly lose total control of Kigali? [(Mugenzi)] No, I don't think so. According to the information I have, we are in a good position to stand the invasion. [White] But how can you claim to be in any kind of control when the government itself has abandoned the capital and gone to Gitarama [(Mugenzi)] No, we did not abandon it, we only did not want to work under those shells and those bombs because you can imagine the kind of noise you have there and you know that in any war, a government is always the first target. So if you want to keep some kind of administration and control and power over the country, you must make sure that the government is safe. [end recording]
