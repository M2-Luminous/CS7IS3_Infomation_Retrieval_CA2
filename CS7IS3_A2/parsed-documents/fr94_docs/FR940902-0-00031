FR940902-0-00031 FR940902-0-00010 Relocation Section 141(c) of the Act was revised substantially to prohibit the use, or proposal for use, of JTPA funds to induce or to encourage the relocation of a company when such relocation results in the loss of employment of any employee of the company at the original site. That section also prohibits certain assistance to any relocating company for the first 120 days after the company commences operations at the new or expanded location, if the relocation results in an employee's job loss at the original site. If the Secretary finds that the State, SDA, or substate grantee (SSG) has violated either provision, fines are levied equal to twice the amount of funds expended. If the State, SDA, or SSG demonstrates that it neither knew nor reasonably could have known (after an inquiry undertaken with due diligence) that the funds it provided were expended in violation of these provisions, then only the amount expended is repaid. Some commenters questioned whether these provisions prevent SDA's/SSG's from placing participants in certain job openings for a set period of time. The Department believes that they do under circumstances in which there are job losses in other geographic areas or in which workers are laid off or experience periods of unemployment. By clarifying and standardizing terms, as well as setting the prohibition on assistance at 120 days, the Act systematizes the administration of this prohibition on relocation. Most of the comments on the interim final rule pertaining to these provisions focused on the need for clarification of terms such as ``labor market area'', ``loss of employment'', ``commercial operations'', ``pre-award review'', ``induce'' or ``encourage'', and on the extent of an SDA's due diligence and local liability. Section 627.215(c) defines a ``relocating establishment'' as a business entity moving operations ``from a facility in one labor market area within the United States and its territories to a new or expanding facility in another labor market area.'' Commenters pointed out that some rural labor market areas may encompass vast areas and several counties. Section 4(13) of the Act provides a definition of ``labor market area'' as ``an economically integrated geographic area within which individuals can reside and find employment within a reasonable distance or can readily change employment without changing their place of residence. Such areas shall be identified in accordance with criteria used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor in defining such areas or similar criteria established by a Governor.'' The key to the Act's definition is that the labor market area be ``an economically integrated geographic area'' where an individual can change his or her employment without changing his or her place of residence. Thus, for purposes of this relocation provision, a large rural SDA could contain more than one labor market area. Several commenters asked for a clarification of ``loss of employment''. One stated that when employees at the original location do not accept relocation job offers and then are laid off, ``loss of employment'' has not occurred. The Department believes that, in such a situation, loss of employment is presumed when a person no longer has a job with the company at the original location or with any other entity because of the relocation and the loss of employment at that location would not otherwise have occurred. This does not include those who would have retired or quit regardless of the relocation, or those who were fired for cause. Several commenters requested further guidance on commencement (or expansion) of commercial operations. The Department added the term ``commercial'' to the regulations to be consistent with the statutory intent that a viable prohibition on JTPA assistance in the day-to-day production of goods and services be observed. The term ``commercial'' operations is intended to further distinguish between the construction and operation stage of a business, as well as to demarcate the stage when products are being produced for commercial distribution.
