Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl still intends to talk with President Yeltsin on the telephone this Friday [21 January] to ask him about the new cabinet list and the future course of the government. Meanwhile, it has been expected in Bonn, even before the conversation, that Yeltsin will tell the chancellor that he was in control of the situation and that the reforms would continue. Kohl is expected to tell Yeltsin that he will continue to support him and the reforms. Before that, Kohl had a long telephone conversation with U.S. President Clinton that ended with the two men agreeing that Kohl would ask Yeltsin about developments triggered by the meeting the two presidents held in Moscow; in a week, Kohl and Clinton will further coordinate their position during the chancellor's visit to Washington. In the Foreign Ministry and in the Chancellor's Office, the question whether Finance Minister Fedorov would remain in the government was interpreted as an indicator for the future of the reform policy and the West's position toward Russia. Diplomats in Bonn have, therefore, been following alternating reports about Fedorov with great attention. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE: "For the World Bank and the IMF, the most important financial institutes for Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar, who has since resigned, and Fedorov used to be the two confidence-building personalities; they maintained the contact. If both were to go, this would result in a considerable loss of confidence for Moscow." If the changing reports on Fedorov were to end with his resignation from the government, which was unclear on Thursday, "then this would constitute a major setback." Nevertheless, Kinkel said that as far as Germany is concerned, "there is no alternative to the reform policy; it has to be supported." Kinkel advised against "dramatizing warnings." Yeltsin-Chernomyrdin-Fedorov Kinkel assumed that Prime Minister Chernomyrdin would try to "strike a compromise." If Fedorov ultimately were to resign, only Deputy Prime Minister Chubays, who is in charge of privatization, would remain of the original hard core of reformers in the government. Kinkel said the conclusion for German foreign policy was that "the West must continue to help Yeltsin, under the condition that the objectives of reform must not be seriously threatened." As criteria for assessing Moscow's reform policy, Kinkel mentioned "the fight against inflation, the inclusion of the central bank into the policy of monetary stability, the continued efforts for privatization, the reduction of subsidies for state enterprises that are unable to survive, and further steps toward the market economy accompanied by the establishment of a social insurance system independent of enterprises." These criteria are similar to the conditions under which Fedorov would stay in office. In Kinkel's view, the revolutionary process is not yet concluded in Russia: "The lava is still flowing." The developments have not yet become steady. The balance between Yeltsin and now stronger Chernomyrdin, between the president and parliament, and between the government and the state duma still has to be achieved. Gaydar's resignation has already weakened the government's reform punch. Chernomyrdin was obviously also trying to force Fedorov into the background; yet Yeltsin knows he needs the finance minister. Meanwhile, the positions of Gaydar and Fedorov have been strengthened through their parliamentary seats. Sources in Bonn expect that the government will be able to achieve "majorities on specific issues" in parliament, when Gaydar's bloc cooperates with independent and "federative" deputies in individual cases. However, visitors from Bonn in Moscow, such as Hornhues, the deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag group, have noticed an even increasing fragmentation in Parliament. Gaydar's group does not "primarily" see itself as the government party. In general, it has been noted in Bonn that various politicians are even now guided in their behavior by their prospects for the 1996 presidential and parliamentary election. Chernomyrdin and Gaydar are probably rivals for the succession to Yeltsin. Some observers from Bonn have interpreted a movement of disassociation from Yeltsin as an indication that changes may be possible even before 1996. If Yeltsin were to resign for health or other reasons, numerous politicians, public servants, and military members from very differing directions would get ready to take over. In this respect, Deputy Defense Minister Kronov seems to be playing a significant role. He was the last Russian officer to leave Afghan territory and he is said not to be too distant from the views of nationalist Zhirinovskiy. Some observers in Bonn seem to regard it as possible that the forces that are standing behind Zhirinovskiy in military circles, and certain services are planning to use their popular figurehead only until they are able to implement their own ambitions and no longer need the charlatan. Kinkel does not indulge in such speculation, but obviously does not rule out a development that follows the experience that "the revolution devours its children." Stabilizing help by the West was, therefore, all the more important, he said. More difficult than the conditions in Russia is the situation in Ukraine, Kinkel stressed, mentioning catchwords such as Sevastopol, the domestic harbor of the Black Sea fleet, dependency on Russian energy supplies, and nuclear arms. After the Russian-Ukrainian agreement on the scrapping of nuclear arms, which was signed in the presence of Bill Clinton, the last of those issues seems to have been defused. However, the economic situation was disastrous. In the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE interview, Kinkel suggested that the European Union [EU] follow Germany's proposal and devise a "program for the economical use of energy." Since many relief programs remained ineffective, the EU should make sure its aid is coordinated. Kinkel said: "Russia and Ukraine should conclude a treaty on neighborly relations, comparable to the one Germany signed with Poland and the other Eastern countries." Kinkel drew up a "program for the Baltics." The Baltics are "highly sensitive for Russia." The Balts' nervousness is not without reason. Yet, Kinkel stressed that he was also convinced Russia would withdraw its forces. Nevertheless, for Russia, the independence of the Baltic countries is a symbol for its decline as an international power. Kinkel announced that in an early March meeting in Bonn with the foreign ministers of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, he intends to discuss how the three countries can be included in European cooperation "as partners with equal rights." Kinkel described his initiative in the EU: "At the European Council in December, the Brussels Commission was given the mandate to conduct negotiations on a free trade agreement; I am trying to extend this mandate to facilitate the conclusion of a Europe agreement with each of the three Baltic states that at least includes the prospects for EU accession." The next EU Council of Foreign Ministers should discuss this issue in February. Nervousness in Poland Regarding the countries in East-Central Europe, Kinkel noticed that nervousness is most marked in Poland, because of Warsaw's unfulfilled wishes toward NATO and the EU. In her talks in Bonn on Tuesday, former Polish Prime Minister Suchocka expressed her disappointment about the West. The Partnership for Peace did not offer any protection. Since NATO failed to agree on an "agenda" for Polish membership in, say, 10 years, Poland's acceptance into the alliance, including a necessary security guarantee for this country, which is a neighbor to Russia. Mrs. Suchocka predicted that the stronger and more dangerous Russia would become the less NATO would be willing to accept Central- East European countries as members out of fear of Moscow's reactions. Russia would never become a democracy. The Poles were also getting upset with the EU and its protectionism. The mood was becoming anti-Western, Suchocka said. In the interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, Kinkel described Poland's fears as not justified. The Europe agreement with Poland will come into force on 1 February: "Poland is being involved in many ways." Poland must understand, however, that "the involvement of Russia in cooperation is in the interest of the Central-East European countries." Kinkel said: "There are two levels. We understand what is moving the peoples and governments of the Central-East European countries; however, together we must try to come to a rational assessment of the situation." The accusation of selfish Western European protectionism to the disadvantage of democracy in the East cannot be substantiated. Kinkel warned the East Europeans against turning their back to the West: "Remain sensible and do not overreact!" Kinkel pointed out that the Europe agreement with Hungary on free trade and political dialogue, including "prospects for membership" would also become effective at the beginning of next month. Similar agreements with Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic were signed in Brussels last year. The ratification procedures have started; interim agreements will be in force until they are concluded. Negotiations between the European Union and Russia on a partnership agreement have been interrupted as a result of the government reshuffle in Moscow. A result should be achieved in the course of the year. Negotiations with Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan have started or are being prepared. Kinkel concluded: "We are doing everything possible to strengthen the network."
