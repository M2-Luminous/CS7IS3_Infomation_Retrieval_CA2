FR940513-0-00154 FR940513-0-00034 3. Vibration Service and Rough Service Reflector Lamps Angelo raised a concern at the Workshop about a type of incandescent reflectorized lamp that is produced for use under conditions involving rough service or service in which they will be subjected to vibration, such as industrial or construction site use. These lamps are manufactured with more durable filaments to withstand such service, which also results in their having a significantly longer life. Angelo pointed out that these lamps appear to be excluded from the definition of ``incandescent reflector lamp'' in the EPA 92 amendments to EPCA. 195 As such, they would not be required to meet the minimum efficiency standards or bear the disclosures required for other incandescent reflector lamps by the Rule. 195 Angelo (Tr.), 310. See 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(C) (West Supp. 1993). Angelo contended that these products, many of which are imported, are significantly less efficient than incandescent reflector lamps that will have to meet the new minimum standards, but that they may be marketed to compete directly with these more efficient lamps at a reduced retail price. 196 According to Angelo, the price differential will lead residential consumers into purchasing them without realizing that they are receiving a much less efficient product for their money, and ``cheap lamps will drive out good lamps at the consumer level.'' 197 Angelo's recommended solution is to require that manufacturers of rough and vibration service incandescent reflectorized lamps be required to disclose, on their packages, the fact that the lamps are for rough service and do not meet the federal minimum efficiency standards for other similar lamps designed for ordinary household use. 198 Angelo's concerns and proposed solution were shared by three other participants, including a company that produces rough and vibration service incandescent reflector lamps. 199 196 Angelo (Tr.), 310&hyph;11, 314&hyph;15, 315&hyph;16, (Supp.), G&hyph;8, 4. 197 Id. 198 Angelo (Tr.), 315&hyph;16, (Supp.), G&hyph;8, 4. 199 Supreme (Tr.), 313, (Supp.), G&hyph;13, 1; Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 4 (``This labeling should include that the product is designed for Rough Service (or Vibration Service) applications only, has a low light output and costs more to operate than similar products available in the marketplace.''); ACEEE (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2 (``These products have an efficacy of 12 lumens per watt or less. Requiring disclosure of lumens per watt is the only way to inform consumers of the overwhelming energy penalty associated with purchasing these lamps and in essence to thwart these manufacturers' attempts to get around the [EPA 92] requirements.''). EPCA defines ``incandescent lamp,'' in part, as ``a lamp in which light is produced by a filament heated to incandescence by an electric current, including only the following: * * * * * (i) Any lamp (commonly referred to as lower wattage nonreflector general service lamps, including any tungsten-halogen lamp) that has a rated wattage between 30 and 199 watts, has an E26 medium screw base, has a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, and is not a reflector lamp. (ii) Any lamp (commonly referred to as a reflector lamp) which is not colored or designed for rough or vibration service applications (emphasis supplied), that contains an inner reflective coating on the outer bulb to direct the light, an R, PAR, or similar bulb shapes (excluding ER or BR) with E26 medium screw bases, a rated voltage or voltage range that lies at least partially within 115 and 130 volts, a diameter which exceeds 2.75 inches, and is either_ (I) A low(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage between 40 and 205 watts; or (II) A high(er) wattage reflector lamp which has a rated wattage above 205 volts.'' 200 200 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(C) (West Supp. 1993). * * * * * EPCA defines ``incandescent reflector lamp'' as ``a lamp described in subparagraph (C)(ii).'' 201 201 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(30)(F) (West Supp. 1993). Based on the language of the statute, the Commission concludes that it does not have the authority to treat incandescent reflectorized lamps designed for rough or vibration service applications as ``incandescent reflector lamps'' under the labeling rules. As part of the process of developing test protocols for incandescent reflector lamps, DOE will define what is meant by ``rough or vibration service applications'' because such lamps will be excluded from the test protocols. Angelo speculated, however, that the definition DOE adopts for such lamps may allow manufacturers to make lamps that meet the DOE exclusionary definition, but then market them, not as rough or vibration service lamps, but simply as spot or flood lamps to compete with the incandescent reflector lamps that are subject to the minimum efficiency standards. The gist of Angelo's concern appears to be twofold. First, manufacturers of incandescent reflector lamps who must meet the DOE standards (and whose products, as a result, will likely cost more to manufacture) will be at a competitive disadvantage because rough or vibration service reflectorized lamps will have a significantly lower retail price. Second, consumers will not be aware that these less expensive lamps are significantly less efficient and will cost more to operate over time. EPCA authorizes DOE to add products to the list of products for which EPCA mandates minimum efficiency standards. 202 Therefore, if the exclusion of these lamps from coverage under the labeling rules as ``incandescent reflector lamps'' results in unfair competition, consumer confusion, or other problems, DOE can reconsider its definition of general service incandescent reflectorized lamps ``for rough or vibration service.'' In the alternative, DOE can consider whether to add general service incandescent reflectorized lamps ``for rough or vibration service'' as a specific type of consumer product covered under EPCA to remedy the situation. 202 42 U.S.C. 6292(a)(19) (1988).
