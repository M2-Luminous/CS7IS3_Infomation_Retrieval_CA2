Poplavskaya, Novosibirsk; UDC 532.526] [Abstract] The problem of calculating a three-dimensional compressible laminar boundary layer on a contoured delta wing with supersonic leading edges has been formulated and presented along with an algorithm for solving it. The algorithm has been used to perform calculations for the windward and leeward sides of a wing with a sweep angle (_ch_) of 45� given a Mach number (M[.sub]�[/]) of 3 and for the windward side of a wing with the same sweep angle and Mach numbers of 3 and 6 for any number of angles of attack (_a_). The effect of Mach number, angle of attack, and relative profile thickness on friction coefficient and its contribution to the wing's total drag have been investigated. Selected results of the calculations are as follows. The adjusted values found for a contoured wing exceed their values for a plane wafer by 30 percent. The difference between the values found for the friction coefficient on the nose and those on a plane wafer is much greater when M[.sub]�[/] = 6 than when M[.sub]�[/] = 3. Calculations of the effect of the angle of attack on the distribution of the friction coefficient on the leeward side of a contoured wing indicate that the friction coefficient decreases by about 15 percent when _a_ is increased by 5� and that, given identical profile thicknesses and Mach numbers, the curves plotted for the friction coefficient (and also for the Stanton number) for different angles of attack are qualitatively similar to one another. A calculation of the contribution of the total intensity of friction (CF[.sub]x[/]) to the total drag (CX[.sub]0[/]) for each wing surface given Re[.sub]L[/] = 10[.sup]5[/] indicates that as M[.sub]�[/] increases, the value of CF[.sub]x[/] decreases somewhat when _a_ = 0 and increases when _a_ = 5�; however, wave drag decreases significantly, which results in an increase in the contribution of friction forces from 67 to 79 percent when _a_ = 0 and from 21.5 to 43 percent when _a_ = 5�. The value of CF[.sub]x[/] is on average 15 percent greater for a contoured wing than for a delta wafer; however, wave drag is significantly greater in the case of a contoured wing, which reduces the contribution of friction forces to total drag when compared with that in the case of a plane delta wafer. An analogous phenomenon is observed when the angle of attack is increased. Although the value of CF[.sub]x[/] increases when _a_ is increased from 0 to 5�, wave drag increases more, and as a result, the contribution of friction forces decreases from 67 to 21.5 percent when M[.sub]�[/] = 3 and from 79 to 43 percent when M[.sub]�[/].
