While the public operator does not envisage any significant increase in its investment budget for this task (each year it plows in 20-25 billion French francs [Fr] out of a total budget of Fr30 billion), the technological choices that have just been announced, however, do threaten to change the list of the company's registered suppliers. This is a game of musical chairs whose stakes run into billions of French francs, since, for example, each year France Telecom spends around Fr4 billion on transmission equipment and Fr6 billion on public network switching. The French public network, with the highest proportion of digitization in the world (85 percent in switching and 90 percent in transmission) will therefore undergo massive change. The changes announced, however, only concern the core of the network (the transmission network) which runs from the five main transit switchers to the 13,800 local centers. On the other hand, there should be no changes in the short-term for the distribution network, i.e., the links between the local centers and the 30 million subscribers, which represent between 40 and 50 million connection lines. Thus, the changeover to an "all-optical" configuration does not directly affect the subscriber and does not therefore herald a possible "information highway." National Network Cabled in Optical Fiber by 1996 However, far-reaching changes have been announced for the transmission network. Firstly, these changes could enable it to handle the massive increase in traffic generated by the decision to cable the distribution network with optical fiber to the door of the subscriber. Secondly, these changes affect all the network functions: switching (all switches will work by time-division switching by 1998), transmission, and signaling (where the network is controlled by the transmission of commands between switches), without forgetting network supervision (administration and technical management). The greatest challenge concerns transmission, with the generalization of SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) technology and optical fiber: by 1998, the structure of the France Telecom transmission network will be almost exclusively cabled with monomode optical fiber, and as a result, coaxial cable and Hertzien links will be dropped completely for this purpose. At the end of 1993, the national network included some 12,000 kilometers of optical fiber cable, with 22,000 km on the associated regional networks. This represented a total of 820,000 km of monomode fiber (since each cable can now carry an enormous number of fibers). This figure will reach 1.3 million in 1996 when, with 21,000 km, the national network will have been completed, while the total length of the regional networks will be 43,000 km. By the year 2000, two million kilometers of optical fiber should be in service, with 80,000 km of cable for the regional networks. These are mouthwatering prospects for Alcatel and the SAT [Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications], which have been selected to supply optical fiber. However, where SDH equipment is concerned, it is harder to spot the eventual winners. The adoption of this technology, which today makes it possible to transmit at a speed of 2.5 Gbits/s down a single fiber (the equivalent of 30,000 telephone lines) and 10 Gbits/s in three or four years' time, will lead to a complete reconfiguration of the network architecture from an arborescent structure to a structure of regional loops (about 100) connected up to five major national branches, or, to use the France Telecom term, petals. This loop structure will thus ensure dual network access at all levels so that, if an incident is generated on the loop it will be possible to automatically reroute the traffic along the second branch of the loop. Suppliers to be Chosen Before the Summer The first 2.5 Gbits/s-per-fiber petal will be looped up in the autumn of 1994 (in eastern France, followed by the north). By then, the suppliers will have to be chosen. The first choice concerns the I/O multiplexors which make it possible to catch data "in flight" at different transmission speeds without demultiplexing, and then inject them into the 155 Mbits/s loop. Each loop should have three to four multiplexors (or around 400 systems in total). A number of groups are competing on this market: Alcatel, the SAT in partnership with Siemens, Secre in association with the Israeli company ECI, Nokia, and TRT-PKI (Philips). Suppliers could be selected within a few weeks, although Jean-Pierre Poitevin, director of the public network, warns: "No one is today capable of meeting the specifications promised on paper." Then the suppliers of the SDH patch bays (which do the actual switching) will be chosen. Alcatel and the SAT have already been selected to supply the 2.5 Gbits/s point-to-point transmission line systems on the petals. A "Programmable" Network for Dedicated Links The other major innovation on the public network concerns dedicated links. Until now, these links have been permanent and built at the request of companies for the transmission of their data. However, to reduce service costs by eliminating some of the civil engineering costs involved in link connection, France Telecom has recently decided to build a separate network for dedicated links. Christened MDTN (multiservice digital transport network), this network will be fully precabled in optical fiber. A connection is then made by programming it in, the physical link being already in place. This technique of optical fiber precabling is also starting to be used to build FOC's (flexible optical connections) for major professional customers and densely-populated business districts. Already, some 200 buildings have been cabled in the Defense business district of Paris, offering high-thruput services (up to 34 Mbits/s). In 1998, 1,500 buildings will be cabled, and France Telecom has also examined the possibility of cabling 5,000 additional buildings. Lastly, network control, or signaling, will also be considerably modified. Initially, the data required to control the network (the status and availability of equipment, billing, etc.) were exchanged over voice links. From now on, the Semaphore signaling network will be kept separate from the voice network to increase the data exchange capacity required by the proliferation of new services such as the upcoming capacity to transmit messages in the course of a communication, or to identify the incoming call number -- services which could thus open up new markets for terminals. In fact, the general network will consist of four networks one on top of the other: the voice and Semaphore networks, but also an "intelligent" network and the technical supervision network. Thanks to the "intelligent" network, new services could rapidly be developed simply by altering the software in the centralized database -- service modifications could even be done in real time! As a result, certain instructions will no longer be programmed into all network switches, but will instead be placed in the central database which the switches would then consult. This will greatly simplify the technical management of the telecoms system.
