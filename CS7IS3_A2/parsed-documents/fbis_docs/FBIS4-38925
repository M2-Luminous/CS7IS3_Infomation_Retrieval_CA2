"We do not want to be accused of disrupting the adoption of economic laws and decisions important for the republic and for the people." The demand upon which these deputies just recently left the parliament, depriving it of a quorum for an indefinite period of time, remains unchanged: The issue of the Bishkek Protocol must be included in the agenda of parliamentary sessions. T. Gasymov noted that the group continues to insist on an examination of this question at a separate session of the National Assembly. He categorically denied the assertion that the return of the deputies constituted a compromise with the authorities. "This step was dictated by a desire not to inflame political passions in the republic to their ultimate limit. The authorities intended to provoke the people, in their eyes heaping upon us all the clumsiness and incompetence of the leadership," the chairman of the parliamentary commission stated.
