According to the spokesman of the Hezb-e Eslami led by Golboddin Hekmatyar, the prime minister of Afghanistan, the conditions for ending the conflict are the resignation of Borhanoddin Rabbani from the post of president, the setting up of an interim government, the establishment of a national camp, and the calling of elections in six months. The spokesman of the Jami'at-e Eslami, led by Borhanoddin Rabbani, also stressed that Rabbani should remain in his position as president and he set forth as the Government's condition that the opposition should remove their heavy weapons from around Kabul. Only then will the government agree to a cease-fire. It appears from looking at these conditions that it is not going to be easy to find common ground for negotiations between the two sides. In fact, what has further exacerbated the situation is that the involved sides refuse to compromise on their conditions because of their sensitivity and the importance they attach to their own political status. It seems that unless there is some sort of flexibility and tolerance among the Afghan factions, there is a very slight chance of reaching any agreements on the basis of goodwill. In any case, in the opinion of the observers of Afghan affairs, the change in the political situation in Kabul cannot help in restoring peace or promote any progress toward peaceful objectives, including elections. This is because as long as political goals are pursued through military force and weapons, an end to the war in the circumstances currently prevailing in Afghanistan is unimaginable. In any case, experience proves that under such difficult conditions, Afghanistan's friendly neighbors have been able to motivate the warring sides to negotiate regardless of their irreconcilable conditions. It seems clear that the present clash in Kabul is bound to have the same outcome. Meanwhile, according to the emissary of the Iranian Foreign Minister to Kabul, all the sides involved in the conflict have welcomed the mediatory actions of the friendly neighboring countries. Taherian, who met the leaders of the sides involved during visits to Kabul and Islamabad on Wednesday [12 January] said in an interview that it is difficult to convince the two sides to begin negotiations and stressed that the Iranian Foreign Ministry is seeking to establish common ground for mediation among all the Afghan warring factions by means of negotiations with Pakistani Foreign Ministry officials and those of all other Islamic countries.
