About ten of them denounce, in a statement to Radio Metropole, the disastrous effects of the international sanctions imposed on Haiti. Enough is enough said the residents of Cite Soleil who are calling on the concerned authorities to assume their responsibilities. The residents assert that they are willing to accept any solution to the crisis as long as it allows the lifting of the embargo and the end of the nightmare for the Haitian people. [Begin unidentified speaker recording in Creole] Even if the Army takes power we do not mind. We want the embargo to be lifted, the population to find food to eat, gasoline prices to drop, and the security problems to be solved so that everyone can normally go about his activities. Whether it is the parliament or the Army which takes over, as long as we can eat and drink, we do not mind. We heard on the radio that [Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress Leader] Mr. Constant asserted that he would find a solution to the crisis. We are calling on those people to find a solution. It is time that they save the country because Aristide is out of the question. We are not concerned with Aristide since he did not return on 30 September. It is a scenario being played. It is a movie, a play but they [not further identified] want to use the population as a cover. [end recording]
