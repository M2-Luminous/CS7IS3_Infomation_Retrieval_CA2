The cause of the excessive concentrations of ozone are nitric oxide and volatile organic compounds (in practice hydrocarbon vapors) emissions. During a meeting held in Chamonix, the environment ministers of the three countries signed a joint statement in order to reduce these emissions by 70-80 percent (over 1980 levels) and to achieve a "substantial" reduction by the year 2000. Furthermore, other governments have been invited to sign the agreement. In transport the committment is to: reduce in the volume of truck traffic by using trains (even high-speed trains at night) and rivers to transport goods over long distances; put a stop to the increasing horsepower of vehicles and limiting average fuel consumption to 5 liters per 100 km.; step up controls on automobiles and speed limits; improve the effectiveness of catalytic converters; promote public transport; perform studies to determine the possible harmful consequences of building new roads. Measures concerning plants include establishing limits for nitric oxide and hydrocarbon vapor emissions, both now and for the future. For products instead, the use of organic solvents in paints, detergents, glues will be suppressed or at least limited; in addition products containing organic solvents will be required to bear a label indicating the percentage content. The economic measures to be adopted include increased taxes (exise rate) on fuels and measures designed to progressively cover the total cost of heavy traffic. Finally, studies to assess the measures to be adopted after the year 2000 and better exchange of information on research being performed in the sector.
