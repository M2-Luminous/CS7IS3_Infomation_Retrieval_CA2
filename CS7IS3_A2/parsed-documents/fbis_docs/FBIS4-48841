"It is vital to declare Kigali and an area up to 20 kilometres around the town neutral," the Zairian president said. Mobutu said this would allow "the intervention of United Nations forces, emergency services of humanitarian organisations, as well as the setting up of a government of national union following talks between the two parties to the conflict." Zaire, along with Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania, borders the tiny east African nation where up to half a million people have been killed in fighting between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis since early April.
