According to the article, the number of requests to leave the FAS has been so great that some pilots have been incarcerated in order to prevent desertions. The Sandinist People's Army (EPS) has requested the assistance of the National Police in arresting deserting pilots, the article reports. Because so many pilots are leaving, the FAS is unable to provide enough crews for all of its aircraft. Captain Eduardo Medina of the EPS Office of Public Relations confirmed that the police had arrested FAS pilots but denied any knowledge of why they were detained.
