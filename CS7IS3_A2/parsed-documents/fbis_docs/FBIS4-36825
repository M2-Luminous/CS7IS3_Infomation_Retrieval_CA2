The "war of the brothers", indeed the "war against ourselves" was noticeably delayed until oil was discovered in commercial quantities in the "two parts of that country." This delay shows the design: For the United States to get its hands on Arab oil wherever it is, always in the name of international legality, and to implement this international legality's resolutions to prevent the Arabs from burning themselves with their own oil, just like children playing with matches. What is important is that, as of today, a "Security Council" is the arbiter between one Yemen and another, deciding for each miserable "part" what is good for it, what is bad, and what is forbidden. The primary taboo is for Yemen to unite as a sound, capable entity able to compensate for its historical misery by exploiting its natural resources. In the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf where "sovereignty" belongs to the kingdom of black gold and white silence, everyone is under the direct protection of several junior officers of the U.S. Armed Forces. No ruler tenders an offer without their permission or buys a motorcycle without their approval. Indeed, those officers decide "what is needed", who to buy from, the price, and the commission. These officers alone have the right to "instruct" the sultans when and how much "democracy" to grant to their citizens. Democracy there cannot be attained except with the use of U.S. crutches, one of which would preferably be a "Wahhabite" [form of Islam prevalent in Saudi Arabia] crutch and the other a "revanchist" crutch with a mentality harking back to such a distant past that it sees in Wahhabism an atheistic, destructive ideology. Although everyone in that region was committed to the logic of "market economy", even prior to the official declaration of U.S. protection, they were not required to adhere to the other side of that baleful coin, namely human rights and political pluralism. While Kuwait, in U.S. eyes, is "more than a protectorate but less than a negro [Zinji] quarter," this does not spare it the necessity of surrounding itself with a legendary barricade extending through the desert along the entire length of its "border" with Iraq, filled with such luxuries as refrigeration, cool water, and rugby and baseball fields. This will guarantee that it will be a golden burial ground for the remaining oil revenues, the so-called "fund for future generations," which the "shaykhs" used to save for a rainy day. Meanwhile, an irrevocable international sentence has been passed against Iraq, with no room for appeal. The sentence is to keep the tyrant safe and sound, but to execute the people, with their various Arab, Kurdish, Turkoman, Assyrian, Chaldean, Babylonian, Muslim, Christian, Sabian, and Yazidi sects and the remnants of the fire-worshipping Magi. A more serious matter is the starving of the Iraqis while their huge oil reserves go to waste. Their tall refineries stand still and their thousand-kilometer pipelines stretch to the gulfs and seas, empty like their treasury, their wallets, and home refrigerators. If we assume that the fate of the eastern triangle--Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon--hinges on what Israel, the "local" strategic ally, decides is best for U.S. interests in this region, then the option offered to the countries forming this triangle is as follows: Either an Egypt-like Camp David arrangement with a U.S.- dominated multinational observer force or a Gaza/Jericho-like agreement with local police serving under Israeli command. The non-oil-producing countries--Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania--can suffer a slow death and crawl on their bellies, asking, today or tomorrow, for bits of the U.S. food surplus. Or they can die in mass extermination orgies, as in Somalia. Libya, however, and later on Algeria, must pay a retroactive price for their revolutionary pretensions. Thus, sanctions are imposed on the Libyan people, who know hardly anything about the world, politics, or the taste of living. A ring of fire surrounds Libya, impenetrable to even a single plane, even medical or fire-fighting emergency flights to the oil fields. How dare someone to whom fate has given fabulous wealth, more than they can personally use, speak of revolution, unity, the liberation of Palestine, and jihad against Israel? Therefore, it is necessary to condemn the entire Libyan nation and fight it as if it were a scourge or contagious disease. It must repent publicly, give up its wealth, and kill with its own hand everything that remotely refers to revolution, today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow. They might even require the Libyan nation to dig up the grave of its heroic martyr 'Umar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the Italian colonialists, put his remains on trial, and hang him (again) on the charge of prior incitement against the new world order and the U.S. monopoly of Arab oil. As for Algeria, let it sink gradually into an open-ended civil war that will sap the state's and the people's energies so that the oil and natural gas can remain in the hands of the U.S. master, who will "hasten" alone to save the one-million-martyr country from drowning in a multibillion-dollar debt, the interest on which would eat up the world. All Arabs are minors, wards of international guardianship. In accordance with international legality's resolutions, every "Arab" has a compulsory guardian (generally American and only occasionally European) who makes decisions for him. The oil belongs to those who discovered and extracted it, laid its pipelines, built its refineries, and shipped it to the "developed society," which deserves to enjoy its revenues since it is qualified to utilize it as a source of energy that has a decisive influence on the world's destiny and humanity's fate. After Israel's and the oil's future is guaranteed, no worries will remain except this exceptional population increase in the backward Arab societies. There can be no solution to this except for the Arabs to exterminate each other. Hence, the map of the Arab homeland resembles a lake of futilely shed blood, all of it true Arab blood. Only when it comes to killing is there no guardianship of the Arabs. In this they are free, to the point of total chaos. The more the Arabs shed their own cheap blood, the greater the share for the U.S. West (including Israel) of their precious oil. Thank God that Lebanon is not an oil country. Otherwise its civil war would have continued until the last drop of its stalwart sons' blood was shed.
