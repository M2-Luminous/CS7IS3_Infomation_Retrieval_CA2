Iliescu, Romania's first popularly elected president, meets with his South Korean counterpart Kim Yong-sam later in the afternoon and will be the main guest at a state dinner. He will meet leaders from both the ruling and opposition camps on Thursday. But the highlight of his visit is an industrial tour and meetings with business leaders that will take him to the southern part of the country for a first-hand look at factories, with 22 businessmen accompanying him. Romania had been a staunch ally of North Korea until Iliescu's election as president, and Seoul officials see his visit as another sign of the cold war's collapse. Kim and Iliescu will issue a joint statement after their summit pledging to pursue dialogue on political and economic cooperation. The two countries' foreign ministers will sign an aviation agreement on Thursday.
