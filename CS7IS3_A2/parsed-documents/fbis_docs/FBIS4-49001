Mr Patten played down the apparent snubs by Mr Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and the Bank of China yesterday, saying he did not feel "particularly neglected". Mr Lu, who arrives in the territory tomorrow, has rejected an invitation to meet Mr Patten to discuss transitional issues. The Governor has also been left off the guest list of a Bank of China ceremony on Monday to celebrate the issuing of Hong Kong banknotes. In an interview with the Sing Tao Group, Mr Patten said he regretted Mr Lu's refusal to meet him. "If it was deliberate, which I can't believe, I think it would seem to people to be rather small-minded, so I can't believe that it is meant in that way," Mr Patten said. "If he phoned up this afternoon we could clear the diary." Mr Patten said he wanted to discuss the government's measures for tackling property speculation with Mr Lu because the issue straddled 1997. "It's partly because there are longer term implications that I was very keen to discuss the issue very candidly with Mr Lu," he said. "I think the people of Hong Kong want to see us cooperating." Mr Patten earlier responded to the Bank of China's snub, saying he hoped everyone who had been invited to the ceremony had a "smashing time". It was the second time the Governor was snubbed by Chinese officials in 24 hours. Nevertheless, Mr Patten continued to garner political points in suggesting that Mr Lu was too busy to discuss the livelihood issues affecting Hong Kong people in the transitional period. Banking officials said earlier that Mr Patten was not on the guest list for the ceremony because it was a financial matter and therefore not appropriate to invite him. The Governor stressed that financial officials from the Hong Kong government, including the Director of the Monetary Authority, Joseph Yam, would be free to attend if they wished. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod embarks on a trip to Britain today and will not attend. A number of Hong Kong officials had extremely good working relationships with the financial -- authorities in China and it "would be a shame if they weren't able to go to what is an important ceremony," Mr Patten said.
