FBIS4-9370 "dreeu080_k_94008" FBIS-EEU-94-080 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 CROATIA Finance Ministry Implicated in Tax Scandal Finance Ministry Implicated in Tax Scandal 94BA0245C Zagreb DANAS in Serbo-Croatian 5 Apr 94 pp 28-29 94BA0245C Zagreb DANAS Serbo-Croatian CSO [Article by Marko Franjic: "How Much Do the Herzegovinians Smoke?"] [Text] The key question is not the individuals involved in smuggling; more important is the state budget's revenue from taxes on tobacco and the control over their payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and control over the payment of taxes, there will always be smugglers. There are 450 metric tons of cigarettes smoked in the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna, but three Croatian factories officially export a total of 2,500 tons of cigarettes there. Where the 2,000 tons of cigarettes went, and whether taxes were paid on them, because it is assumed that 60 million German marks [DM] in taxes have not been collected, was a deputy's question from Vice Vukojevic on the first day of last week's Assembly session. Prime Minister Nikola Valentic himself gave him an interesting answer. The answer was approximately that some of the cigarettes were exported to Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it was most likely that a large amount of that tobacco ended up on the Croatian market and thus evaded taxes. After that, just a few days after the Assembly session, everything continued to proceed in the established order and rhythm, as if it had not upset anyone too much. Since the question involved fairly specific statements, it seemed that Vice Vukojevic had more facts, and so we asked him to expand on his question and explain what was going on, and whether he perhaps knew anything more about the whole case. During the Assembly's recess, however, Vukojevic only responded briefly to our query by saying that we should ask the Finance Ministry who was given permits to export tobacco and tobacco products, since the key and the answer lay in that, while he himself, until he received that information, did not want to comment on anything else. So far no one has spoken up, although all three Croatian tobacco factories were clearly identified in the deputy's question: the Zagreb, Rovinj, and Zadar factories. They were called upon to answer where they had marketed the 2,000 tons of tobacco, and whether no more or less than about DM60 million in taxes had been paid for those cigarettes. Also named was the Finance Ministry, which has jurisdiction over issuing export permits. It is also concerned with supplying the state budget, and it ought to know how much cigarette tax has been collected. It is interesting that at the last session of the Assembly, one of the agenda items was the state budget, and the Ministry's strongest staff, with the prime minister's assistance, had a great deal of work to do in defending the proposed figures before the deputies. Germany One Hundred, Croatia Three Furthermore, the IMF announced that Croatia would have to prepared a state budget for the next three years if it wanted to conclude arrangements with that institution. Naturally, in that situation the key question is where to get the money, not only as a fictitious amount on the paper of the state budget, but rather as real collected revenue, which means that the ministry absolutely has to take into account the collection of taxes. The tax administration, which operates as part of the Finance Ministry, has just prepared a proposal for excise duties, a new system for taxing products that are of interest for taxation in every country, which also include cigarettes, because most of the tax revenue is collected precisely by taxing tobacco, alcohol, and oil. Every year Germany collected DM100 billion from those three products, while Croatia, according to some assumptions, should earn at least DM3 billion. When we add to this the claims expressed several times--also unofficially admitted by the tax administration--that the state lost DM200 million on imported and licensed cigarettes and the smuggling of those cigarettes last year because of the inappropriate tax system, it is clear that this is not a problem that just appeared yesterday, nor does it concern negligible revenues. Furthermore, the state introduced stamps for cigarettes a long time ago, and precisely thereby declared war on smugglers, and by a special decree it tried to regulate exports of certain products, including cigarettes, precisely because of smuggling, which threatened the state budget's revenues. That decree prescribed that deposits would be paid on exported goods, and when it was proven that the exports had taken place, the Finance Ministry would return the deposited money to the exporter. Consequently, even before the introduction of the stamps (on 19 November 1992), it was known that cigarettes were a commodity of interest for smuggling and that the state treasury was being left empty because of that "interest." Recently in the Varazdin area, the police there seized large amounts of smuggled cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. As the policemen explained, the goods, although intended for Bosnia-Herzegovina according to the documentation, came from Slovenia. Specifically, a large amount of cigarettes was first purchased at the Rovinj Tobacco Factory, and then, according to the documentation, it was supposed to be exported to Bosnia-Herzegovina. It was taken to Slovenia, however, and after that it was smuggled to the Varazdin area, where it was offered at lower prices. So far there have been a lot of interested customers there, who probably knew where the cheaper cigarettes came from and how. Tobacco Smuggling Lobby After that seizure of the smuggled goods, the Varazdin police administration says that one can now speak of organized groups and a well-developed network for the purchase and smuggling of cigarettes, but also other goods. The system is already known, and, one might say, the usual one until recently. First of all a factory in Bosnia-Herzegovina is found that will fictitiously buy the cigarettes, which afterwards, of course, end up on the Croatian market at lower prices, because the high taxes, which are 60 percent for domestic cigarettes, are not paid. Judging by the suspensions of policemen and customs officers, one can assume who else is in the smuggling network in addition to Croatian factories and the ones in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Specific names are not being mentioned yet, however, and it is not known whether the network is controlled by one center of power or whether there are several organized groups. One could hear stories in the corridors--and one of them was publicized precisely in DANAS--that one Zagreb private businessman tried to go into the business as an independent, but after having paid $420,000 for a truckload of Marlboros, he was left without the cigarettes or the money, since the deal was not "agreed upon" with the smuggling lobby that allegedly controls that profitable business. After a year and a half the result of all this, aside from the individual successful and ostentatiously presented police operations to prevent smuggling known as "Stibra" [Tax] and the firm promises that the economy will be put in order, is Vukojevic's deputy's question, bringing up the same problems again, which may imply that they have not been solved. Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Seks, who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the "Stibra" operations, says that both the regular police and the financial police have already been monitoring and checking what is happening in the profitable cigarette business for some time now. The confiscations of smuggled cigarettes, and even the suspensions of policemen and customs officers, resulted from that. Vladimir Seks, however, did not want to prejudge anyone's guilt, and thought that it would not be proper to talk about the involvement of people from the tobacco factories in cigarette smuggling and even about the names obtained during the investigation, since the investigation has not yet been completed. A Time of Big Scandals So far it is known for certain that the goods were not exported, that they did not end up where they were supposed to according to the customs declaration, and instead were sold on the black market, probably in Croatia. It is also suspected that customs declarations were falsified. Since this is all still the subject of investigation, however, not even Assistant Finance Minister Bozo Prka could comment much more on it, as he politely explained. Nevertheless, it appears that this time, what has been uncovered and what is being investigated will not be hushed up. Our impression is that the state authorities are now working seriously on this, but the question is whether it will be brought to a finish or whether the public will be offered some "little fish" as scapegoats. After all, the key question is not the individuals who are engaged in this; what is more important is the state budget revenues from tobacco taxes and control over their payment, because if there are holes in the regulations and control over the payment of taxes, there will always be people interested in smuggling. According to the proposed model for tobacco taxes, or excise taxes, they will be 6,000 and 8,000 dinars, depending on the location of the sale, for foreign cigarettes, and 2,400 and 3,000 dinars for domestic cigarettes, with customs duties also paid for imports of foreign cigarettes. The difference in taxes for foreign and domestic cigarettes was the big reason for the smuggling of those cigarettes, but Croatia's joining GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade], which is in preparation, will be based precisely on the requirements to make taxes on domestic and foreign goods equivalent, with tariffs being the instrument to protect domestic production. The question is whether the proposed model for taxing cigarettes will pass, while experience with smuggling seems to have taught the Croatian government nothing. When the present events are summed up after an interval of time, this will certainly be remembered as a time of big scandals for which no one has been held accountable, because not one official has resigned or left because of mistakes and omissions. In some cases there has not even been an attempt to determine who could have been responsible for a certain mistake, but without that, things will not be put in order.
