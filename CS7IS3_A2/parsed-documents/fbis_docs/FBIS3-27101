A listed company is a company which is approved to issue and list its stocks for trading on a stock exchange. A listed company must be a limited liability stock company. However, not all limited liability stock companies are listed companies. This is because a limited liability stock company must meet certain requirements, and go through screening and approving formalities according to prescribed procedures before it can become a listed company. Specific listing requirements for a company differ from country to country. For example, the listing requirements for a company stipulated by the New York Stock Exchange are: The company's pretax profits shall not be less than $2.5 million for the most recent year and shall not be less than $2 million a year for the most recent two years; its tangible assets shall not be less than $16 million; the market value of its publicly held stocks shall not be less than $16 million; and at least 1 million shares of its stocks are publicly held and 2,000 stockholders hold more than 100 shares of its stock. China has also conducted experiments to list limited liability stock companies on the stock market. With approval, a stock exchange was set up in Shanghai and Shenzhen in December 1990 and July 1991, respectively. At the same time, eight limited liability stock companies were listed in Shanghai and six were listed in Shenzhen. With the deepening of reform, more companies have been listed on the stock exchanges, and the experimental work has become more standardized. By November 1993, 157 companies had been listed, 97 on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and 60 on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange are: The company must be one registered with the department of administration for industry and commerce; its paid-up capital shall not be less than 5 million yuan in Renminbi; the amount of the company's stocks issued to the general public shall not be less than 25 percent of its paid-up capital; the number of registered stocks shall not be fewer than 500; the company has earned profits for the two latest consecutive years; it has the recommendation of at least one Shanghai Stock Exchange member; it has set up an office in Shanghai municipal district for transactions [guo hu 6665 2073]; and it has published its financial situation regularly in at least one publicly circulated newspaper or periodical. The listing requirements for a company stipulated by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange are: The company must be an approved limited liability stock company newly established or established through reorganization; its production line and business conform with Shenzhen City's industrial policy (for companies registered in Shenzhen; companies registered in other places must conform with the state's industrial policy); the company is in good standing in terms of production and business performance, with net assets not less than 10 million yuan; the net value of its tangible assets shall not be less than 25 percent of the total value of its tangible assets in the year preceding listing application; the founder's subscribed stocks shall not be less than 5 million yuan and not less than 35 percent of the total amount of the company's stocks; the amount of stocks issued to nonspecific individuals through public offering shall not be less than 25 percent of the total amount of the capital stocks and the number of stockholders shall not be fewer than 800; and there are no records showing that the company has violated the law or harmed the public interests in the most recent three years. Since 1992, with the approval of authorized state departments, nine large state-owned enterprises -- Shanghai Petrochemical General Plant, Qingdao Beer Plant, Beijing People's Machinery Plant, Guangzhou Shipyard, Maanshan Steel Company, Kunming Machine-Building Plant, Dongfang Electric-Machinery Plant, Tianjin Bohai Petrochemical (Group) Company, Yizheng Chemical Fiber (Group) Company -- have undergone reorganization to become limited liability stock companies and made other preparations for listing according to the agreement reached between departments concerned and the Hong Kong Joint Stock Exchange. The first five companies completed listing formalities and became listed companies in the Hong Kong Joint Stock Exchange in 1993.
