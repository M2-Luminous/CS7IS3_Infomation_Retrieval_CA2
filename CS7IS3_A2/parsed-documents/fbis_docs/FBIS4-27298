Quoting the work, the paper said: In the work President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea said since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has emanated from the United States' hostile policy towards the DPRK, it must be resolved through dialogues between the DPRK and the United States. Noting that pressure can never be a solution to the problem, he said it is a miscalculation to think that they can bring the Korean people to their knees by means of pressure and force, the people who regard independence as their lifeblood. If the United States continues to clamour for putting pressure on the DPRK, the DPRK will be compelled to take due measures of self-defence to safeguard the dignity of the Korean nation and the sovereignty of the country, he stressed. This work was also reported by the Yugoslav Tanjug News Agency and Belgrade radio and television, the Mozambican paper NOTICIAS, the Tanzanian paper DAILY NEWS, the Malaysian paper SIN CHEW JIT POH, the Thai paper SIN CHONG YUAN PAO, the Tunisian papers LA PRESSE and LE RENOUVEAU, the Pakistani papers MUSLIM, PAKISTAN OBSERVER, HABARE and MARGAJ, the Kazakh paper EXPRESS, the Indonesian Antara News Agency, a Malian radio and Madagascan radio and television.
