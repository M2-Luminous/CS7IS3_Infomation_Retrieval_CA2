(f) Long-term wet lease means a lease by which the lessor provides both an aircraft and crew, which either (a) lasts more than 60 days, or (b) is part of a series of such leases that amounts to a continuing arrangement lasting more than 60 days. §257.4 Unfair and deceptive practice. The holding out and sale of scheduled passenger air transportation involving a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is prohibited as unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C. §41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part. §257.5 Notice requirement. (a) Notice in schedules. In written or electronic schedule information provided by carriers to the public, the Official Airline Guide and comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservations systems, carriers involved in code-sharing arrangements or long-term wet leases shall ensure that an asterisk or other easily recognizable mark identifies each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. (b) Oral notice to prospective consumers. In any direct oral communication with a prospective consumer concerning a flight that is part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket agent doing business in the United States or a carrier shall tell the consumer, before booking transportation, that the transporting carrier is not the carrier whose designator code will appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier. (c) Written notice. At the time of sale, each selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide each consumer of scheduled passenger air transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease with the following notice: (1) If an itinerary is issued, there shall appear in conjunction with the listing of any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier a legend that states ``Operated by'' followed by the name of the transporting carrier. In the case of single-flight number service involving a segment or segments on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier, the notice shall clearly identify the segment or segments and the transporting carrier. The following form of statement will satisfy the requirement of the preceding sentence: IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines; or (2) If no itinerary is issued, the selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide a separate written notice that identifies clearly the transporting carrier for any flight segment on which the designator code is not that of the transporting carrier. The following form of notice will satisfy the requirement of this subparagraph: IMPORTANT NOTICE: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines. (d) Advertising. In any advertisement for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or by long-term wet lease, the advertising carrier or ticket agent shall clearly indicate the nature of the service and shall identify the transporting carrier[s]. 2.
