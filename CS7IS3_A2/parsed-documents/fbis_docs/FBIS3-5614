Mitsubishi is the third major Japanese automaker to announce import targets for U.S.-made auto parts following Toyota Motor Corp., leader of the industry, and Mazda Motor Corp., affiliate of Ford Motor Co. of the United States. Mitsubishi has announced a purchase plan for fiscal 1994, which begins April 1, incorporating imports of 400 million dollars worth of parts from U.S. suppliers and an additional 1.2 billion dollars for local procurement for its U.S. car venture. The company also said it will increase U.S. production of cars mounted with engines and transmissions supplied by Chrysler Corp. to 200,000 vehicles in 1995. The company said it can boost local procurement in fiscal 1994 by about 400 million dollars if its vehicle production in the U.S. expands steadily. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said it will announce next week an appeal for cooperation between Japanese and U.S. auto industries. The appeal calls for the establishment of a forum for consultations between Japanese automakers and the U.S. "Big Three" -- General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler, association officials said.
