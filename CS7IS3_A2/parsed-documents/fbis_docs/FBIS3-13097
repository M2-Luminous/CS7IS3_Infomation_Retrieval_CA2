The issue of Jerusalem -- namely, the clause which applies the Geneva Convention to the territories, including Jerusalem -- is the most crucial article of that resolution. Israel objects to the clause, but it is expected to be endorsed nevertheless, since the United States will probably abstain on this clause, rather than veto it. The resolution denouncing the Hebron massacre, which the Security Council will debate tonight, will pave the way for renewing the negotiations. Political sources in Jerusalem have said that the clause incorporating Jerusalem in the territories is an achievement for the Palestinians, and within a few days, it will pave the way to direct contacts toward the resumption of negotiations. The contacts will address the steps Israel is to take in the wake of the Hebron massacre to secure the PLO return to the negotiations. For Israel, the Jerusalem clause is disagreeable, but it is neither new nor very significant. It is disagreeable, but not tragic, Foreign Ministry sources said. Last night, Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin held his second telephone conversation with Yasir 'Arafat in two days. Rabin told 'Arafat that Israel will not accept all the demands 'Arafat had conveyed to political adviser Jacques Neriya as a condition for resuming the negotiations. Rabin urged 'Arafat to return to the negotiating table. 'Arafat replied: Not yet. It is believed that after the UN Security Council passes a denouncing resolution, a senior-level meeting -- probably between Peres and Mahmud 'Abbas, possibly between Rabin and 'Arafat -- will be held within a few days, heralding the delegations' return to intensive talks on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement.
