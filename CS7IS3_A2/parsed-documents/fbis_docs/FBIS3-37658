Churkin told journalists of this today in Moscow. At the same time, he does not rule out the possibility of new problems with regard to a political settlement around Sarajevo. Among these, he identified the likelihood of terrorist acts. Vitaliy Churkin believes that the situation whereby responsibility for the explosion in the Sarajevo market was immediately laid at the Serbs' door is unacceptable. In his opinion, in this sort of case it is necessary to hold an investigation. The Russian president's special representative denied rumors about the possible introduction of Russian troops into Macedonia. He said that this possibility is not being discussed and is not on the agenda.
