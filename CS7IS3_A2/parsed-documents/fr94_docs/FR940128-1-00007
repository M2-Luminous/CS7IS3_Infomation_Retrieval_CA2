The meeting is intended to be a forum in which EPA can report on the status of regulatory development and in which interested parties can provide information and ideas to the Agency on key technical, scientific, and other issues. DATES: The meeting will be held on February 23, 1994 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Center Auditorium, 12201 Sunrise Valley Drive, Reston, Virginia.
