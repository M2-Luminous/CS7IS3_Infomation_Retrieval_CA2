[Isaias] We are now at the stage of rebuilding what was destroyed by war and establishing a future political system to run the country. I can say that the setting up of a commission for the Eritrean Constitution is an important political achievement. It certainly needs to exert tremendous efforts, with participation by the people, to draft a constitution. By cooperating with states with resources and with UN agencies, we are now working on creating government agencies. I can say we overcame real difficulties. On the other hand, there are certain problems inherited from the liberation war. These are economic and social problems. We are trying our best to overcome them by introducing practical programs. Because the challenges were great, we can say that certain successes have been achieved in certain fields. ['Abdallah] In your speech last year, you set a transitional period for your government and said that free, multi-party elections will be held. Will you keep to your promise to allow free elections? [Isaias] Free elections will be held on the basis of the Constitution. The Constitution will determine the political system and the form of government in Eritrea. The setting up of a commission for the Constitution, is, in my opinion, a first step in that direction. Within two years, and with the participation of the Eritrean people, this commission will draft the Constitution. Within three years after the Constitution is ratified, elections will be held according to the approved Constitution. This is not only a promise or a commitment, but is an imperative thing to do to support the stability that prevails in Eritrea right now. I think this is also a historic need, not just an act of charity or the decision of a political party or government that is in power now, during this transitional phase. ['Abdallah] The transitional National Council has an overwhelming majority from the Popular Front for Democracy and Justice; you are its secretary general. Does this mean you plan to tailor an Eritrean constitution to the front's standards? [Isaias] The new structure of the council is considered a progressive step. Half the members are not from the Popular Front. This means other members are represented in it, unlike the first council which indeed had the majority of members from the Popular Front. The composition of the current National Council is comprehensive at this stage. I think the front's role in, and contribution to the government agencies is reducing now. On the other hand, government work is now completely separated in principle and we are seriously seeking to apply this in practice. The front and the government are two separate things, and they have different issues to address. The Popular Front understands its role in this society and is playing this role wisely and carefully. It also gives the opportunity for more participation by the people in this country. ['Abdallah] When you talk about participation, do you mean the other Eritrean factions? If so, which ones do you mean? If that is not the case, then what is the future of the other Eritrean military and political organizations? [Isaias] In the march of this country, we are not interested in talking about other Eritrean political trends that are linked to Arab or foreign regimes. We do not think other countries have the right to participate with us in drafting the constitution or the political system in Eritrea in any way. Nor do we like to interfere in the political affairs of others. There is no justification for any state or certain political forces to impose on us groups and factions and to appoint themselves custodians over our future and bring us a political system that suits their own whims. We do not think there are Eritrean political forces outside the Eritrean arena. The entire Eritrean people are participating in the national action during the transitional period, in an atmosphere marked by tranquillity and in which there is no suppression or attempts to impose a certain view. The process to draft the Constitution is continuing. Through it we will confirm broad-based popular participation. But if certain states wish to impose a specific group on us and talk about cultural and political differences and a host of past disputes, then we are trying to avoid that and not accept what they are trying to impose on us from abroad. We are also trying not to enter into bargains with certain states or political forces so that they give us aid in return for allowing them to impose on us certain political forces that will in the end turn into a fifth column working inside this country. We say this is unacceptable. What is going on the Eritrean arena in terms of participation and the steps to establish a democratic system is a firm course. It will not be affected by false conjecture: Is there participation or not; is there democracy or not. This must be made clear to certain people abroad who think that by talking about democracy and participation, they can impose a group of people or individuals on Eritrean politics. [passage omitted] ['Abdallah] Mr. President, many questions have been raised about Eritrea's identity. The fact that Eritrea has not yet joined the Arab League raises fears among the Arabs that Eritrea is distancing itself from its Arab surrounding. What do you think, your excellency? [Isaias] We are Africans above anything else. We exist in this continent and our geographic position is part of our identity. We cannot deny this identity. There is no dualism in identity. And, before that, there is one identity; that is, we are all Eritreans. [passage omitted] ['Abdallah] There are reports of Sudanese military reinforcements on the borders with Eritrea following the Abu Jabal [placename as published] incident in which the Eritrean forces arrested a Sudanese officer and then the Qarmakiya [placename as published] incident in which a camp of the Eritrean forces was destroyed. Does this mean there will be a potential for tension in the entire region? [Isaias] First, I do not have specific information. However, what I would like to say is that we had differences with the regime in Sudan over certain issues. I think these are pushing in the direction of tension and disagreement with Sudan, but a conflict would be too far from the reality. What happened was very simple. The border police conducted an operation to fight smuggling. There was a shootout, by accident. The incident did not have any political nature. This I can say. I can also confirm that it was not a political clash, but an incident that can happen anywhere. Regardless of how many differences we may have with Sudan, I do not think that such differences can reach the point of an armed conflict. What are the reasons and the motives? If some people tried to interpret this incident as a sign of a potential war between Eritrea and Sudan, I can say that this is very far from our thinking and strategy. The entire subject has been resolved. Such issues are resolved through a joint effort by both countries. ['Abdallah] Stories have arisen recently over Eritrean-Israeli relations. This issue has been a subject of concern. A report by one of the regional organizations that monitor Israeli activity in Africa says Israeli promised to set up three Israeli military bases in Asmara, Dankalia, and Sakhit [last two placenames as published]. What is the true Eritrean position on this? [Isaias] All this is a propaganda and media clamor. We should not be asked to be in a certain track more than others. If some people are trying to find an excuse for their psychological complexes by directing the finger of accusation toward Eritrea over its cooperation and relations with Israel, then I can say that this will not serve that purpose. Even the psychological problems and the domestic political problems cannot be justified by directing false accusations against Eritrea or fabricating scenarios to frighten people in order to justifiy certain trends. What will follow such an announcement? Who wants to promote the idea that Eritrea is going to give Israel bases here and there? What is the purpose? Sensationalism? But what will follow? I believe that there are certain people who are living in an illusion and excel at hypocrisy, instead of dealing with reality in a rational way. What they claim may have been possible 15 or 20 years ago. But things are different now. The Palestinians have reached an agreement with Israel, and those who used to accuse the Americans of conspiracies in the past are now extending their hands asking for help from the United States to resolve this problem. Several events have proved that the rational and practical thing to do is to act in a constructive way. I think that, regardless of its source, this sensationalism has been outdated and there is no need for such a clamor.
