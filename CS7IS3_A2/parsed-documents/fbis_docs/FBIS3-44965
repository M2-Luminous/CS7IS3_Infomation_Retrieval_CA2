This move wins the hearts of the people, and the struggle is develping steadily and in an orderly manner. One prominent feature of the corrupt phenomenon at this time is that unlawful elements in the society vigorously engage in trading money for power with the mutated elements within party and government departments, and they vehemently embezzle state assets to an alarming extent. The emergence of this feature cannot but make us recall Comrade Mao Zedong's warning on resisting "sugar-coated bullets," a warning he gave on the eve of the nation's founding. Those teachings are still very practical and applicable today. At this time when the 100th birthday of Mao Zedong is approaching, with this article I want to cherish my profound memory of our revered old man. Comrade Mao Zedong spent all his life on the undertakings of the party and the people; he hoped our people's government and socialist undertaking would not be forfeited because of our own corruption. As early as the period of rectification campaign in Yenan, Comrade Mao Zedong reminded the whole party not to once again make the mistake of being arrogant in time of victory in his report entitled "Study and the Times." He praised Comrade Guo Moruo's article entitled "Memorial Ceremony for 300 Years of Jia Shen," which described the lesson one can learn from Li Zicheng who walked from victory to failure; he asked the senior cadres in the whole party to learn from the article. At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, which was convened on the eve of the overall victory across the country, Comrade Mao Zedong gave some earnest advice: "The might of the enemies cannot conquer us, and this point has already been proved. But flattery from the bourgeoisie could conquer the weak-minded persons within our contingent. There could be some party members who have never been conquered by the enemies who held guns, and they lived up to the title of hero in front of those enemies, but they cannot sustain the attack by the bullets which are coated with sugar, and they will lose the battle when such bullets are used. We must take precautionary measures against such a situation." Comrade Mao Zedong's prophecy unfortunately came true, during the "1951-1952 movement against the three evils," the corrupt, degraded, and mutated elements such as Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, who were the typical examples, were discovered. In order to more effectively prevent the cadre contingent from decaying, and to better save the majority of the cadres who had made mistakes, the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, after very careful consideration, resolutely sentenced these two seriously degenerated elements to death. Today, under the conditions of reform, opening up, and development of market economy, the situation is very different from the one shortly after the nation's founding. But Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on resisting the "sugar-coated bullets" still have great practical significance. Because, even under the conditions of development of a market economy and the practice of separation of the government and enterprises, the government still has the duty of exercising macro-regulation, control, and management over the economy, and judicial departments, administrative and law enforcement organs, and economic management departments still have relatively great powers. Unlawful elements in society and those who are obsessed with the desire for gain, will use various means to shoot sugar-coated bullets, leap over and erode the supervisory powers of party and government officials and even senior cadres, and pull the weak-minded into the water, to serve as the protective umbrellas from unlawful and criminal elements. Compared with the period shortly after the nation's founding, the main body shooting sugar-coated bullets is different now; at that time they were the old bourgeois elements, and now they are probably new figures who hold various titles such as "managers." Shortly after the nation's founding, when party and government officials received sugar-coated bullets, most of the time it happened passively, but now some of them are actively attracting sugar-coated bullets and seeking to be hit. No matter how the contents and measures vary, the essence is the same, that is, the trading of power for money, abusing public interests for private ones, and jeopardizing the state's interests. What is more serious is that this phenomenon has already begun to erode the tools of people's democratic dictatorship--political and judicial organs, and even some of our army units have also been affected. This cannot but arouse a high degree of alertness among us. Our party's second-generation leadership collective inherited and developed Comrade Mao Zedong's ideas on resisting corruption and advocating clean government, in particular, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has shown a great deal of concern in this area. In the course of reform and opening up, he has always stressed the need to do two kinds of work simultaneously, and equally firmly. He said: "We must fight corruption in the whole process of reform and opening up. To cadres and party members, clean government building must be grasped as a big thing." He also demanded that senior party cadres play an exemplary role in being uncorrupt and exercising self- discipline, including properly disciplining their children. He stressed that clean government building must rely on the legal system, and that it is still a legal system which is more reliable. Based on these expositions by Comrade Xiaoping, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided to explicitly list strengthening of clean government building and the anticorruption drive as the necessary conditions and important guarantees for building socialist market economy system, holding that this is a big matter which has a bearing on the success or failure of the reform undertaking, and on the fate of the party and the country; the decision reiterated: "The principle of commodity exchange is never allowed to be introduced into the party's political life or the administrative affairs of state organs for the purpose of trading power for money." At present, the whole party and the people in the whole country are profoundly implementing the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and expediting development and reform. At the same time, we must never become slack in spiritual civilization construction and efforts to fight corruption and advocate clean government. We should seriously learn from Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on anticorruption and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's relevant expositions, and resolutely uphold the principle of doing two kinds of work simultaneously and equally firmly, to ensure that our undertakings continuously advance along a healthy track!
