SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of February 9, 1994 (59 FR 5972), EPA issued a proposed rule that pursuant to petitions by Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, EPA proposed to establish under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 346a and 348) a tolerance for residues of the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris( O -ethylphosphonate), in or on dried hops at 45 ppm. One comment from the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany was received in response to the proposed rule to establish a tolerance of 45 ppm for fosetyl-Al in dried hops. The German Embassy strongly supports the reclassification of dried hops as a raw agricultural commodity. They also support establishing a tolerance for fosetyl-Al in dried hops at 45 ppm. However, the Embassy states that a maximum tolerance of 100 ppm in dried hops is appropriate based on residue data available from the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, and Germany. The commenter also stated, however, that support for a higher tolerance should not delay issuance of the 45-ppm tolerance as proposed. No Codex, Canadian, or Mexican tolerances have been established for fosetyl-Al in dried hops. The 45-ppm level is based on residue studies submitted by Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co. that were conducted in the United States and represent U.S. hop-growing practices and U.S. techniques for control of plant diseases. EPA will establish the maximum tolerance for fosetyl-Al residues at 45 ppm based on this U.S. data. However, any interested party, including the German Embassy, may petition the Agency to increase this tolerance. After review of supporting data, if the tolerance protects the public health, EPA would establish the higher tolerance, if appropriate. There were no requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule. The data submitted relevant to the proposal and other related material have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance is established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register, file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32). Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations or recipients thereof; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
