Will the left win? [Bertinotti] I really do not know. I do not want to give the impression of being reticent, because I am not like this. I think that when you make a commitment, when you fight, when you battle, you must not be distracted by forecasts. Also because forecasts are always either an exorcism or a desire. You must be committed to win. That is all. [Fusi] You have just returned from Bari.... [Bertinotti] Yes, from an election meeting where I saw a great deal of the enthusiasm for the old PCI [Italian Communist Party]. And a lot of young people are among our followers. [Fusi] Let me finish. Why not go to London? [Achille] Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS] went, as did Roberto Maroni [Northern League lower house floor leader]. What is holding you back? [Bertinotti] I am not going because I do not speak English well. [Fusi] Or because you fear that when the city bankers see you they will run away terrorized? [Bertinotti] I do not intend criticizing the others, but since the Italians will be the ones to vote, the right thing to do is to dedicate ourselves to them and to their sovereignty. Once we used to go to the United States, then to London.... When talking about the elections, I prefer Italy. [Fusi] Let us talk about elections then. I will draw a picture. The left gains the absolute majority. What will Communist Renewal do, ask for its own ministries? [Bertinotti] The technical discussion over the composition of the government is entirely premature. If the progressives really win, the government structure would have to be reexamined in light of the objective of renewal and transformation. [Fusi] Translated this means: less ministries? [Bertinotti] Yes, and composed differently. The ministries are currently divided according to the administrative concept of politics. I will give you an example: If the central issue is the battle against unemployment, how can it be handled without considering labor, the environment, and the territory at the same time? [Fusi] Okay, but the communist ministers? [Bertinotti] If the progressives win the absolute majority they would have a moral obligation to govern alongside the same aggregation with which they won. [Fusi] And who should go to Palazzo Chigi [government seat]? [Bertinotti] First I must say that we are against giving the name of a premier because it distorts the sense of this political battle which must be centered around programs, not men. The characteristic of the left is that it is the antagonist of the right and an alternative to the center. [Fusi] Yes, but the programs are marching with the legs of the men who embody them.... [Bertinotti] I am against speeding up the times for what I consider to be a counterreform, the direct election of the head of government. These elections are already suggesting to many that those like us, who supported the validity of the proportional system, were right. I do not want us to fall into a worse situation now with even more summit meetings. Once the polls close, we must see which of the various elements that gave rise to the progressive alliance, which I rightly support, has taken hold best. I am referring not only to votes, but also to the topics and leaders during the election campaign. [Fusi] Do not slink away, Bertinotti... [PDS Deputy Secretary] d'Alema has reproposed the current prime minister. What will you do? Ciampi yes, or Ciampi no? [Bertinotti] We have already clearly expressed our firm opposition to the nomination of Ciampi and will not change our opinion. This is by no means a sign of disregard toward a worthy person in the Italian political scene as far as his moral profile is concerned. However, we will not fail to show our dissent over the general lines that characterized his government, and that the progressives must discontinue. In particular, in a central issue: This government has not carried out any political innovation in the fight against unemployment, rather it has continued along the lines of the Amato government, which was one of the causes of unemployment. [Fusi] What about the institutional government? [Bertinotti] Never, never. It would be a paradox. The elections are being carried out in a context of bitter opposition between the right and the progressives. Would we have to follow with a new transformism, saying that we were joking? No way. [Fusi] Another topic, taxing treasury bills. Are you surprised that even Berlusconi's economic expert Antonio Martino is now demonstrating the possibilities? [Bertinotti] First, this proposal comes precisely from the economists of the left, starting with August Graziani. Then, it is shared by people like Mario Monti, rector at the Bocconi University, who stands at the center of Italian economic life. What do I mean? That there is a certain amount of reason behind this proposal. Since I think that there is still a great deal of confusion over this, I would like to emphasize that I have always talked about taxing anybody who has more than 200 million lire in treasury bills. There is a great difference. The proposal made by Forza Italia in fiscal matters is entirely incompatible with mine. Berlusconi has the opposite idea: less taxes for the rich and more taxes for the poor. [Fusi] Let us draw another picture. The left wins but without getting the absolute majority. At that point would you accept the idea of an accord between the progressives and the center? [Bertinotti] No. We do not want to force anybody. However, we interpret the mobilization of the progressives, their entry into the field, including the declaration of intent that represented their calling card, as being a political proposal that is antagonistic to the right and an alternative to the moderates. We are aiming at the victory of the progressives but without any subordinate clauses. Rather, we think that any subordinate clause, starting with an alliance with the moderates, would seriously damage the left in this election campaign, and would be an error after the elections. [Fusi] What if the balance of power depends on the center? [Bertinotti] We have no ideological prejudices but we want to change the country. The proposals made by the center are the continuation of Amato and Ciampi. They are either undecipherable or of a moderate nature. We want a break with the past, they do not. There must be preventive consultations and discussions among the progressives. Then each will make his own choice. [Fusi] Bertinotti, once and for all: Is it better to lose alone or to win together with the others? [Bertinotti] This question embodies the damnation of the more radical forces that we identify ourselves with. Both routes are catastrophic because they lead to a subordinate position in one case and a ghetto in the other. We defeated both routes at our congress by adhering to the progressive pole, and bringing inside the pole the contents of the radical petitions for change. [passage omitted] [Fusi] Let us return to politics. You say that the left must win. To do this, however, it must get at least part of the moderates' votes. What do you offer them to convince them to line up with the progressives? [Bertinotti] One basic consideration. These elections will decide between two different social models, between two different types of civilization, as happened in Italy in 1948 and 1953 with the fraudulent law. I hope that the moderate alignment understands that there is room for them and for their requests in the model of civilization that the progressives are proposing, because it is a highly pluralistic model that respects everything and everybody. On the right instead there is an authoritative model, which is strongly oppressive, with the absolute prevalence of business and market interests over those of society. This model can only generate polarization and acute conflicts. For this reason I think that the moderates must vote for the progressives: to avoid finding themselves in front of a country divided in two. I add, and this time I refer to the progressives, that politics is not geometry: preestablished spaces and property to be occupied. Politics is the movement of forces. The moderate side has moved to the left, it was involved in the change when the forces of the left were able to create a movement and were able to put a pervasive culture on the field. And not when they simply followed the moderates, thinking that they were occupying a space. [passage omitted]
