He told ITAR-TASS that NATO leaders held a meeting today and expressed satisfaction with the results of air raids on Sunday [10 April] and Monday which were carried out in accordance with U.N. Security Council Resolution 836. He said NATO leaders did not discuss Moscow's reaction to air raids or prospects for Russia's accession to the Partnership for Peace programme. They reiterated NATO's readiness to provide aviation support if U.N. forces come under attack in Bosnia again. The official did not rule out the possibility that the date of signing the Partnership for Peace agreement by Russia set for April 21 may be changed because there has been no official confirmation from Russia yet. He expressed that hope that it will happen as soon as possible. The official noted that NATO acted as an executor of the U.N. will and all complaints and protests should be directed to the United Nations which bears all responsibility for the action. He confirmed NATO's intention to act in close contact with Russia in order to restore peace in the former Yugoslavia, adding that the Partnership for Peace programme could provide a good foundation for such cooperation.
