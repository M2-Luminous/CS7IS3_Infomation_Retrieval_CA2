A letter of intent was signed a month ago by the company and the Beijing municipality, involving 200 million U.S. dollars. Chinese senior leader Li Ruihuan had a brief meeting with Holzmann's chairman Lothar Mayer here this afternoon, praising the company for involving itself in this and other important projects in China and hoping that construction of such projects will be completed in time and with high quality. These projects also include the Yansha Center in Beijing, a section of the express highway in Shanghai, a key water conservancy project in Sichuan Province and another one in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, told the visitor that during the past 15 years the Chinese Government and local authorities have given top priority to the fast-growing construction industry, resulting in a drastic face-lifing in the major cities. Li expressed the conviction that Holzmann will get full support in China.
