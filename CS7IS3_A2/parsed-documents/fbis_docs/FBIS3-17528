He arrived a day earlier than expected, but his talks with Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin will begin tomorrow, as previously agreed. The Kazakh chief of state intends to prepare himself better for the official part of his visit, and he will begin the appropriate consultations as soon as he arrives in the Kremlin residence set aside for him. On his way to Moscow, Nursultan Nazarbayev gave an exclusive interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. He noted that Kazakhstan and Russia are tied by stable links of friendship and fraternity going back centuries. The president of Kazakhstan said the key factors cementing these links are a common economy, historical and cultural traditions, and a common mentality, therefore nobody will ever manage to sow discord between our peoples, "although such attempts have already been made and are still being made by some irresponsible politicians." As to the essence of the forthcoming talks, the Kazakh chief of state said the main purpose of the meeting with Boris Yeltsin is to remove the problems which have accumulated in relations between the two countries. Experts have worked throughout the year on ways of resolving many of them, and there is no doubt that a mutual understanding will be found. Nursultan Nazarbayev stressed in particular that he would like matters to be conducted in such a way that there are never any problems at all in the dialogue between Russia and Kazakhstan. The two sides are fated, in the best sense of that word, to be together always, therefore, the Kazakh president said, how far that succeeds depends to a large extent upon the situation in each of them individually and in the CIS as a whole. The leader of Kazakhstan also said that the exchange of opinions on the situation in the CIS and on ways to give the Commonwealth a more concrete and effective content will occupy an important place in his conversation with Boris Yeltsin.
