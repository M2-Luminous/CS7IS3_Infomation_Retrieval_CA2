Section 6302(h) of the Internal Revenue Code requires the Secretary to prescribe regulations as may be necessary for the development and implementation of an electronic funds transfer system to be used for the collection of depository taxes as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section. Section 6302(h)(2) of the Code provides a phase-in schedule which sets forth escalating minimum percentages of those depository taxes to be deposited by electronic funds transfer, starting with the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1993, and ending September 30, 1994. This section prescribes the rules necessary for implementing an electronic funds transfer system for collection of depository taxes and for effecting an orderly and expeditious phase-in of that system. (i) Period prior to January 1, 1995 . The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has entered into binding agreements with third party bulk data processors. These agreements require that the third party bulk processors deposit certain depository taxes of certain of their customers by electronic funds transfer in a manner designed to ensure that those amounts are credited to the general account of the Treasury by the deposit due date. A taxpayer who is a customer of a third party bulk data processor that is a party to such an agreement may have its deposits that are subject to such agreement made by the processor until the expiration or termination of the agreement. However, the taxpayer continues to be responsible for the deposit of those depository taxes that are not subject to such agreement. (ii) Periods after December 31, 1994 . (A) Taxpayers whose aggregate deposits of the taxes imposed by Chapters 21 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act), 22 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act), and 24 (Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages) of the Internal Revenue Code during a 12-month determination period exceed the applicable threshold amount are required to deposit all depository taxes (as described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section) due on and after the applicable effective date by electronic funds transfer (as defined in paragraph (h)(3) of this section) unless exempted under paragraph (h)(4) of this section. In general, each applicable effective date has one 12-month determination period. However, for the applicable effective date January 1, 1996, there are two determination periods. If the applicable threshold amount is exceeded in either of those determination periods, the taxpayer becomes subject to the requirement to deposit by electronic funds transfer, effective January 1, 1996. The threshold amounts, determination periods, and applicable effective dates are as follows:
