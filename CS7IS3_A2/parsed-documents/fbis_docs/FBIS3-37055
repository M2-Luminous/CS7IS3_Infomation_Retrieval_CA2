Ero Pavilainen, a resident of the northern Russian city of Petrozavodsk, served in early 60's in a military unit near the town of Pechenga, close to the Norwegian border. He told the Petrozavodsk-based newspaper "NORTHERN COURIER" on Friday that he and other soldiers had unloaded numerous railway cars with bombs with mustard gas. "These were the Soviet chemical weapons accumulated since the (World) War (Two). They were delivered by trains from various military units of the Soviet Union and dumped in the Arctic Ocean", Pavilainen was quoted as saying. The newspaper added that measurements taken by experts in certain parts of the White Sea showed that the water and soil there are contaminated and unsuitable for living organisms. It added that the secret burial places of chemical weapons may be the reason for a high mortality rate, especially among newborns, registered in several settlement along the coast.
