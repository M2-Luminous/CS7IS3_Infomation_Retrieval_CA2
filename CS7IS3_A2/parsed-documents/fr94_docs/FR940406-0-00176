FR940406-0-00176 FR940406-0-00012 GM faces certain technological risks during MYs 1996&hyph;97 that could lower its CAFE in those model years. Based on its evaluation of information submitted by GM, NHTSA estimates that these risks could decrease GM's MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE by more than 0.1 mpg in each year. By adjusting GM's MYs 1996 and 1997 product plans to reflect all of the factors stated above, NHTSA has concluded that GM is capable of achieving a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both model years. 2. Ford As indicated above, Ford currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 21.1 mpg, and its MY 1997 light truck CAFE level at 21.6 mpg. It has also identified certain volume sales and technological risks which it says could reduce its CAFE level by as much as 0.3 mpg in MY 1996 and 0.6 mpg in MY 1997. Ford has also identified several opportunities which could slightly increase its CAFE. As discussed in the Regulatory Evaluation, NHTSA has evaluated the risks and opportunities identified by Ford, as well as other means that may be available to Ford to improve its CAFE. The agency believes that Ford overstates the risks that can reasonably be expected to occur in both years. NHTSA expects the risks that negatively affect Ford's CAFE to be offset by sufficient opportunities to result in a capability of 21.2 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.6 mpg in MY 1997. 3. Chrysler As indicated above, Chrysler currently projects its MY 1996 light truck CAFE level at 20.8 mpg, and its MY 1997 light truck CAFE level at 20.9 mpg. After evaluating Chrysler's product plan, NHTSA has concluded that Chrysler can achieve CAFE levels of at least 20.8 mpg in MY 1996 and 21.0 mpg in MY 1997. The agency believes that the additional leadtime available before MY 1997 vehicles begin production may allow Chrysler to make technological refinements or improvements, or to move certain planned improvements forward to MY 1997. This could increase Chrysler's MY 1997 CAFE by up to 0.1 mpg, thus allowing the company to attain a CAFE level of 21.0 mpg. While NHTSA has focused its analysis on GM, the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales, the agency does not believe that company's capability is significantly below that of Chrysler, although it is well below that of Ford. As indicated above, the agency believes that Ford has the capability to achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 21.2 mpg and a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.6 mpg, and that Chrysler can achieve a MY 1996 CAFE of 20.8 mpg and a MY 1997 CAFE of 21.0 mpg. The agency believes that the ability of Ford and Chrysler to improve their CAFE levels above their projections is small. The agency must, therefore, disagree, with the comment received from ECC that argued that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY 1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within the capability of manufacturers. The ECC cited a study of fuel economy by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The study, which was jointly commissioned by NHTSA and the Federal Highway Administration in 1991, stated that a 22 mpg CAFE standard would be within manufacturers' capabilities. ECC also cited ``best-in-class'' analysis performed by the EPA, purportedly showing that light trucks could achieve a 24.3 mpg CAFE level. ECC failed to address the agency's discussion of the limitations of the NAS study in the NPRM (see 57 FR 61384), which noted that the methodology used by the NAS in its study ``has little relevance as a reference value for this rulemaking.'' The figure used by the NAS in reaching its conclusion that a 22 mpg level was possible in MY 1996 was intended to represent the entire light truck fleet, and not the capability of one or two manufacturers with a significant share of the market. As NHTSA has noted, individual large manufacturers may have light truck fleets with a mix toward larger, less fuel efficient trucks that have the effect of lowering their overall CAFE. In addition, the model mix used in the study was derived from EPA preliminary data for MY 1990, and did not bear a close relationship to the actual mix produced in MY 1991, much less the projected mix for MY 1996. Nor did the study include large vans and utility vehicles, which are a significant segment of the light truck market, and have lower fuel economy levels. The agency stated in the NPRM that it could not use the NAS study as a blueprint for setting CAFE standards, and ECC did not rebut the agency's statement. The best-in-class analysis does not take into account sales or popularity in the market. Most vehicles that get best-in-class fuel economy ratings have the poorest sales in their class as well. NHTSA cannot force consumers to buy best-in-class light trucks, which often suffer from the disadvantage that they do not possess the power, room, or other attributes that light truck purchasers find desirable. Nor, given the very short leadtime between now and MYs 1996&hyph;97, would manufacturers have the chance to redesign their light trucks to more closely be capable of achieving best-in-class fuel economy levels. Based on its own analysis and in light of the lack of evidence presented by ECC, the agency rejects that commenter's argument that CAFE levels of 23 mpg in MY 1996 and 24 mpg in MY 1997 would be within manufacturers' capabilities. IV. Other Federal Standards In determining the maximum feasible fuel economy level, the agency must take into consideration the potential effects of other Federal standards. The following section discusses other government regulations, both in process and recently completed, that may have an impact on fuel economy capability.
