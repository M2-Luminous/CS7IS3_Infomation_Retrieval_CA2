In the course of our negotiations with the Indian leaders we were able to work out a mechanism for achieving mutual understanding between our young Russia and the renovated India, and for achieving mutually acceptable decisions," Vice- Chairman of the Russian Government Yuriy Yarov told a press conference here today. He is currently visiting the Indian capital at the head of a high-ranking Russian delegation. "As a result of the scrupulous work done by the two sides," Yarov said, "we were able to draw up a package of documents that are expected to be concluded at the end of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's official visit to Russia at the end of June and the beginning of July. The agreements are practically ready to be signed and they cover many areas of cooperation, including the protection of investments, development of tourism, business partnership in science and technology, implementation of joint ecological projects and measures to protect the environment, etc. Yarov did not dodge some sharp questions put to him by journalists about the Russo-Indian relations. He stated, for instance, that the results of bilateral contacts over the past two years were unsatisfactory. "At the present time, the trade turnover between our two countries amounts to 25 billion rupees (about 782 million U.S. dollars), which is absolutely insufficient. This sum has to be at least doubled by the end of the year," Yarov stated. Asked about the irregularity of Russian deliveries of spare parts to the Indian armed forces, the head of the Russian delegation said that this was a "feeble link" in Russo-Indian cooperation. However, on the whole, Yarov sounded quite optimistic. Asked by ITAR-TASS to sum up the results of the Russian delegation's work in India, he said: "We were able to do a lot during this brief period, but there is still much work ahead. On the whole, we are satisfied with our results. Our relations with India were made more dynamic. We want to be friends with India and we shall do our best to promote this friendship." Yarov said that agreement was reached on Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to India, which will take place in the near future. Yarov will be received by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao today, after which the Russian delegation will leave for home.
