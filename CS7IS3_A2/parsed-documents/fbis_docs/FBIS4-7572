The Romanian high official also said that during the talks stress was laid on the importance Romania was giving to the building of a security system at European level, which would ensure also Romania's security, which depends on other elements too such as the democratic process in Russia and the ties between the two countries. In the context, both sides referred also to other security structures, pointing on the role held by the CSCE, the role of bilateral ties, as well as on the contribution of regional collaboration to bring stability in the area.
