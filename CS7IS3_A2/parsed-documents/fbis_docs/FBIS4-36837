(New York), June 13, IRNA -- Iran's Permanent Envoy to the United Nations Kamal Kharazi today protested the U.S. warships and helicopters' interruption and chase of Iranian naval boats and helicopters engaged in routine duty in the waters of the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman. Kharazi in a letter to the UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali pointed out 10-cases of interruption by the intruding American naval fleet in Iran's regional waters between October 20 to February 5, 1994. The Iranian non-military boats and helicopters were on their routine inspection tour of off-shore oil platforms when the U.S. warships, helicopters and fighters interrupted their course and started taking video films and photographs of the Iranian installations in the Persian Gulf. The letter was circulated here as a U.N. document today. Last month Iran had protested to America through its interest section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington.
