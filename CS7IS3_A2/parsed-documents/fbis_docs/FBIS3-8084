The two commanders also talked about further controlling the weapons in and around Sarajevo, particularly the Muslim weapons, as the Muslim side has still not fully complied with the agreement on putting its weapons under UNPROFOR's control. By the way, as Rasim Delic, commander of the so-called Muslim army, did not show up, the meeting of military commanders of the Serbian and Muslim armies that should have been held in Sarajevo today did not take place. Michael Rose tried to excuse Delic's failure to come to the meeting with his being busy establishing peace, as he put it, for his people in central Bosnia.
