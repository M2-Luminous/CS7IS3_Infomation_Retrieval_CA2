Indeed, the hatchet of an absurd, penny-pinching policy has been taken to the Italian military capability over recent years, reducing defense spending to little more than 1 percent of gross domestic product. The result of these unfounded decisions by the last few governments of the First Republic has been that our country has found itself without the essential foreign policy support provided by a military capability when developments on the international political scene made it crucial to have one. The situation is compounded by the restrictions imposed on a sector that has traditionally been at the forefront of technology, the arms industry -- such tight restrictions that they give grounds for suspecting lucrative collusion with the competition in the best "bribe city" style -- and the dominant cultures' continuing demonization of anything remotely connected with the "military" sphere. Now that the new cabinet is giving clear signs that it intends to assume a much more definite role and acquire a higher profile at international level, the necessity of imparting new vigor to the Armed Forces, in other words to the means most traditionally used to back foreign policy, has become manifest, and Defense Minister Previti has been more than explicit on the subject. The renovation of the Italian military apparatus requires a rise in quality standards, to be achieved not just by increasing defense spending but, first and foremost, by deploying this spending more wisely, so as to create a tool relying more on the quality of its operational units and the means and equipment at their disposal than on the quantity of bureaucratic structures and bodies of greater or lesser utility. One of the crucial aspects of such decisions in favor of quality is undoubtedly the growing professionalization of the Armed Forces in view of the fact that the increasing complexity of modern warfare means that it cannot be waged by poorly trained draftees but requires arms professionals capable of acquitting themselves with the maximum skill in a range of different operational situations, peacekeeping and peace-enforcing missions currently being the main ones envisaged. However, we must define the real nature of military careerism with extreme clarity. To cite the well-known distinction drawn by U.S. sociologist Charles C. Moskos, when the Armed Forces decide to recruit a substantial number of volunteers, they must maintain a fundamentally institutional organizational structure, resisting the temptation to adopt an occupational structure. The institutional model responds to a set of values and standards that transcend individual interests and serve the collective interest, and it is marked by a high level of idealism. The occupational model, on the other hand, tends to turn the military career into a job like any other, lacking ideals and concerned solely with obtaining pay rises and union guarantees. Ever since its initial proposals on voluntary recruitment, the MSI [Italian Social Movement] has been fighting for an Army made up of professionals motivated by high ideals, and not for a crowd of odd-jobbers. Today, National Alliance cannot but confirm this stance, bearing in mind, however, that, particularly in times of economic recession, the temptation for many young men to opt for a military career as a remedy for widespread unemployment may be very strong. Nevertheless, the fact that this need exists must not be seen as a limiting factor, but rather as a welcome opportunity to improve relations between youth and the Armed Forces. In a recent interview granted to the specialized journal, PANORAMA DIFESA, General Incisa di Camerana, Army chief of general staff, pointed out that the country's current economic problems had definitely enhanced voluntary recruitment, but he also added that a large number of the volunteers seemed to be driven by high ideals that transcended short-term economic necessity. This is the human foundation on which we must aim to build a new, high quality military capability; a force whose major concerns are not so much job stability, pay rises, and pension rights (which must nevertheless not be neglected, provided they are kept in the right perspective), but rather the ability to do one's job at all times and in any circumstances, and to do it according to the ethical principles and values that the military institution has traditionally made its own. This will also create the conditions for improving relations between the governing forces and the officer corps. The latter, indeed, has for decades had its high ideal motives unfairly undermined by governments who made no secret of their basic contempt for anything with "military" associations. The creation of a new, modern, military capability requires a decision to go for quality in this sphere as well.
