FBIS4-36126 "drnes109dd_94003" FBIS-NES-94-109 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 Palestinian Affairs Abu-Zayyad Calls For End to Talk on Jerusalem Abu-Zayyad Calls For End to Talk on Jerusalem TA0706101894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 0705 GMT 7 Jun 94 TA0706101894 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, "spokesman for the Palestinian leadership," by Rafi Rosenfeld; place not given; from the "It Is All Talk" program -- live] [Text] [Rosenfeld] In connection with the Peres letter, the Israelis feel that 'Arafat made a mountain out of a molehill. The government is claiming that the letter merely guarantees the status quo of the Jerusalem institutions and nothing more. What do you say? [Abu-Zayyad] I say that you have nothing better to do than make mountains out of molehills. The truth is that I am surprised at both the Israeli media and the Israeli politicians' preoccupation with this matter. I think Jerusalem is a very sensitive issue, and the constant discussion of it merely serves to complicate it and incite the sides against each other. Therefore, I think we -- both sides -- should drop the issue. In my opinion, the Palestinians should stop making political statements about Jerusalem, and the Israelis should do the same. At the same time, the closure should be lifted gradually, because what is inciting the Palestinians is the continued closure and the suffering to which the Arabs have been subjected in the context of Jerusalem. [Rosenfeld] Your remarks imply a great affinity between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership on the issue of Jerusalem. Could this affinity be the result of some other secret addenda? [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, as far as I know, there are no secret addenda. I have noticed that the Israeli opposition has been trying to attack the government and turn the Israeli people against the government and the peace process. All those who support the peace process and desire peace should be sufficiently alert to distinguish between malicious pronouncements intended to agitate and those made sincerely. [Rosenfeld] Ziyad Abu-Zayyad, there is one point I would like to clarify with you. We heard this morning that the Palestinian leaders have a copy of the letter to the Norwegian foreign minister, but with one difference: Your copy is dated one month earlier than the one that was sent to Foreign Minister Holst. [Abu-Zayyad] First of all, although I know a lot and am involved in many facets of Palestinian politics, I have neither seen nor heard about such a letter. I do not know where you obtained your information about the letter in 'Arafat's possession. [Rosenfeld] It was reported on the radio this morning. [Abu-Zayyad] Listen, Israeli radio and press publish lots of unsubstantiated and unfounded reports. [Rosenfeld] Are you saying that although you have not seen it, it may exist? [Abu-Zayyad] My not having seen it does not mean that it does not exist, but what I am telling you is that we must treat press and radio reports cautiously, because there are many unfounded reports. [Rosenfeld] Now to two ostensibly technical questions. Peres said this morning that if the Palestinians conduct Palestinian affairs from Orient House in East Jerusalem, the place will be closed. Are you conducting autonomy affairs from there? [Abu-Zayyad] Orient House was launched as part of the overall peace process, and it will continue to operate in that capacity. [Rosenfeld] I do not understand. Are you saying that Palestinian autonomy matters will be run from there? [Abu-Zayyad] No, definitely not. I do not see how you could have understood that. As I told you, Orient House started operating right after the Madrid Conference within the broad framework of the peace process. It does not belong in the autonomy, it is not part of the autonomy, and its offices are not autonomy offices. Orient House will continue to operate as it did before the Gaza-Jericho agreement, and it will continue to operate even after the Gaza- Jericho agreement is implemented. Now, the Gaza-Jericho agreement stipulates that the central Gaza-Jericho authority will be in Jericho, and there is no argument about that. Thus, the Palestinian self-rule institutions that will be established in Gaza and Jericho will naturally be situated in Gaza and Jericho. [Rosenfeld] I have another technical question, Ziyad Abu-Zayyad. Minister Shahal said this morning that if any security officers operate in East Jerusalem, they will be detained. Are there any such officers? [Abu-Zayyad] There are none. To put it briefly and unequivocally: There are no Palestinian security officers in East Jerusalem. There are security guards situated inside Orient House, and their work is connected solely to Orient House. They are under clear, unequivocal orders precluding their operation outside Orient House. You may see one of them still wearing his clothes with an Orient House emblem on his way home, but it does not mean that he is on duty or that he is patrolling the area or on duty. We are fully aware of the legal aspects of the activity of these people, and they will not attempt to exceed the limits of their authority. [Rosenfeld] Thank you very much, Ziyad Abu-Zayyad.
