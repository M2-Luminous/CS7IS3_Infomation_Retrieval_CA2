Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius are now in Lukishskaya [as transliterated] Jail. The Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office is not carrying out any investigations, it is giving the "members of the professional underground," as they describe themselves, time to get accustomed to their new position. The first cross-examination showed that they do not really realize what happened. M. Burokevicius is still in the jail sick bay with cardiac insufficiency. Meanwhile the Lithuanian General Prosecutor's Office has asked the corresponding bodies in Russia for the extradition of a few other people involved in the Vilnius coup case: Major General A. Naudjunas, Colonel J. Kasperavicius, and the leaders of the former USSR's power ministries, V. Kryuchkov and D. Yazov. "We would never have gotten M. Burokevicius and J. Jermalavicius had Moscow not wanted this," K. Gashka, member of the Sejmas National Security Committee, told the newspaper RESPUBLIKA. He has no doubt that leaders of the Communist Party of Lithuania have been deliberately handed over to Lithuania so that a third country's tasks can be carried out by means of their trial in Vilnius. What has happened has caused vehement discontent in Belarus among the Communist faction in the Supreme Soviet and set-tos in parliament. Belarusian General Prosecutor V. Sholodonov has given orders for an inquiry to be started into his subordinates' involvement in the "abduction" of Burokevicius and Jermalavicius. The parliamentary commission for national security, defense, and the fight against organized crime in Belarus has asked for the republic's internal affairs minister, V. Yegorov, and KGB Chairman Ye. Shirkovskiy to be removed from their posts (the former's resignation has already been announced).
