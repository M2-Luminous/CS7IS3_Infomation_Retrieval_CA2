CONTENTS: 1. Israeli Academic Center Spies on Islamic Group 2. Student Demonstrations Force Israeli Ambassador to Work at Home 3. Police-Islamic Group Vendetta in Asyut 4. Human Rights Violations in Prisons 5. Islamist Cleric Defended ISRAELI ACADEMIC CENTER SPIES ON ISLAMIC GROUP A 5,000-word "analytical study" by Rif'at Sayyid Ahmad on page 3 discusses the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo and its "spying activity and attempts to penetrate the Islamic Group in Egypt, in coordination with the Israeli Embassy and the Mosad apparatus, as well as its recruitment of Egyptian youth to spy for Israel under the cover of scholarships in the Mosad-affiliated Ulpan 'Aqiva Institute in Jerusalem." The study says that AL-SHA'B has obtained a number of "secret messages" sent by the center to "researchers and spies of both sexes." The messages, of which samples in Hebrew and Arabic are published, begin by thanking the persons involved for earlier services, enclose large sums of money--varying between 2,000 and 5,000 Egyptian pounds--and close with a specific request for the person to continue to send reports and studies about extremist Islamic groups in his governorate. The messages are usually signed by Dr. Emanu'el Marx, director of the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo, and bear the center's stamp and the Israeli Embassy's secret stamp. A copy of each message is forwarded to the "official concerned" at the embassy. Maintaining that the center violates the protocol under which it was established, which describes the center as "a private organization established under and subject to Egyptian laws," the study asks if the center really operates in accordance with Egyptian laws and if "collecting information, recruiting spies, and penetrating the Islamic group with the goal of destroying it and the homeland from within can be described as activities subject to Egyptian laws." Noting that the protocol was careful to emphasize the dissociation of the center's scientific undertakings from any political activity, the study wonders why copies of these secret messages are sent to the Israeli Embassy. It deduces that "the center practices clear political spying in coordination with the Israeli Embassy." The study cites an "official letter" the Israeli Foreign Ministry sent to the center's previous director about four Egyptians who were supposed to take a course at the Ulpan 'Aqiva Institute, "which belongs to Mosad, according to the Jews themselves." It asks: Since when does the Israeli Foreign Ministry concern itself with teaching Hebrew to Egyptian students and researchers? The study also cites the center's "secret report" to the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which the Egyptian Foreign Ministry knows nothing about. The report talks about the deteriorating security situation in Egypt, several attempts to assassinate senior officials, and the persons who have been recruited. Of these, the report mentions a "counselor who had a financial problem with the Jewish Congress in Switzerland in 1988." The counselor claimed to have lost $30,000, and the report adds that "this sum should be provided so that we will not lose him as an important source and a weighty friend." The report also talks about the center's spying activity and methods applied in penetrating national research groups and requests increased financial and moral support for the persons cooperating with it, the study says. The study finally notes that an Egyptian working in the center has been caught selling the center's documents to Arab and foreign reporters. STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS FORCE ISRAELI AMBASSADOR TO WORK AT HOME A 300-word report by Mu'tazz al-Hadidi and Nasir Faruq on page 1 says that Cairo University students organized demonstrations at the campus during the past few days, in which "they shouted anti-Zionist slogans and denounced the continued massacres against the Palestinian people." The students burned the Israeli flag, raised the Palestinian flag, and denounced the government's feeble stance. The report adds that the Muslim Brotherhood students at 'Ayn Shams University organized demonstrations last Tuesday to denounce Clinton's remarks about Jerusalem. In a statement they issued, the students said that their demonstrations "forced the Israeli ambassador in Cairo to perform his job from his home in al-Ma'adi, file a request with the government to permit him to use 40 guards, and send a memorandum to the Zionist Ministry of Tourism, warning it against the organization of excursions to Egypt." POLICE-ISLAMIC GROUP VENDETTA IN ASYUT A 350-word report by Qutb al-'Arabi on page 1 maintains that clashes between police and the Islamic Group in Asyut have turned into "a fierce vendetta." The report adds that the Central and Public Security forces have placed a siege around the al-Walidiyah neighborhood in Asyut over a week ago and prevented the people from entering or leaving. HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS IN PRISONS A 200-word report on pages 1 and 7 says prison inmates have been subjected to a one-month "discipline campaign," in which dozens were injured and deprived of food and water, their personal effects confiscated, and their heads and beards shaved inhumanely. ISLAMIST CLERIC DEFENDED Mustafa Bakri's 1,500-word article on page 4 criticizes the government for preventing Islamic cleric 'Umar 'Abd-al-Kafi from preaching. He affirms that 'Abd-al-Kafi does not preach violence and has always warned against it. Bakri maintains that only groups that pursue "political violence" stand to gain from this measure. He emphasizes the need for an exhaustive, rudimentary solution for society's problems and demands political and intellectual freedom for all nationals, without discrimination. A related 150-word report by 'Amir 'Abd-al-Mun'im on page 7 contends that 'Abd-al-Kafi was banned from preaching because of security reports submitted to the political leadership on the type of audience that frequents his mosque. Security reports indicated that the majority of his audience were rich businessmen who reside in high-class neighborhoods, state officials, and famous artists, 'Abd-al-Mun'im says. These reports also noted 'Abd-al-Kafi's ability to persuade his listeners. The report adds that the ban was preceded by repeated warnings that 'Abd-al-Kafi might be arrested.
