Surveys on the spring cultivation conducted by six investigative teams sent by the State Council to 13 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities showed that the situation was generally good with a return to normal of the area for the growing of early paddy rice and a rise in area of land under the cultivation of cotton. The summer crops and summer oil-bearing seeds have taken a turn for the better. So long as there are no abnormal weather conditions and proper management is in place, a big harvest of summer crops is expected while production of summer oil crops is tending to increase. Problems of the spring cultivation lie mainly in first, too great a rise in prices for production means for agriculture, especially quality chemical fertilizer. Second, some agricultural production means, particularly quality chemical fertilizer is in rather great demand and its supply is relatively in a tense state. Third, difficulties are being found in keeping steady a certain area under grain cultivation while it is proving difficult to achieve the expected area for production of cotton. The total area under cultivation of grain and cotton therefore continues to decline this year. Fourth, implementation of the loans policy set by the central authorities for economic development in some major counties where commodity grain and cotton are produced is proceeding at a slow pace.
