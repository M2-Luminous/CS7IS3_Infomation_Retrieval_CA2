He participated in a conference of leaders of North-Caucasean regions, which took place in Krasnodar. "As for me, I have never concealed the fact that (the federal government) has no regional policy as yet. I have always criticized the ministry led by Sergey Shakhray," he added. Describing his attitude toward the newly appointed minister, who previously led the Krasnodar territorial administration, President Aushev said: "He is a practician, a man, who -- to use a military term -- commanded the territory inhabited by people of all nationalities represented in Russia. All of them are living in peace. I believe Nikolay Yegorov merits reward for this." President Aushev expressed hope that Yegorov would make use of the experience he had gained in his economic and political activities. "We, leaders of North-Caucasian regions, will help him shape regional policies," said the Ingushetian president.
