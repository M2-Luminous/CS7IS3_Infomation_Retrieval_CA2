Based on this pretext, the Serbian police have intensified their punitive actions in many Kosova dwelling places. Mehmet Haziri has more details: [Haziri] Albanian youths have particularly become targets of the Serbian police in Kosova. They are being pursued on two pretexts -- to be recruited into the service of the so-called Yugoslav Army and for allegedly having trained in various military centers in Albania. The Kosova Information Center reports that after protesting the alleged arrest of members of the Defense Ministry of the republic of Kosova, Belgrade has recently been attempting to invent the soldiers of this ministry. Thus, the Serbian Prosecutor's Office and Peje District Court decided to pre-imprison [paraburgim] youths Bedrush Halilaj and Florin Golaj from Lipovec in Gjakove on the pretext that upon instructions from representatives of the Kosova government in Tirana, they have become militarily efficient in Labinot in Elbasan, with the aim of starting an armed action in Kosova at the proper moment. Another month of imprisonment has been defined for those youths, whom the Serbian police arrested in early April. During April, the Serbs in the Kosova prosecutor's offices and courts called for pre-imprisonment for many Albanian youths on the pretext that they allegedly carried out military training in Albania. In the wake of pursuing Albanian youths, Serbian recruiters issued draft notices to 125 youths in the Malisheve commune this week. On the other hand, repressive actions by the police has spread to other strata of the Albanian population. On the pretext of searching for weapons or other invented schemes, police expeditions during the last two days have raided dozens of families in the communes of Mitrovice, Viti, Kamenice, Kline, Peje, and Lipjan. In Okllap in Lipjan, the Serbian police confiscated all of the pedagogical inspection documents of the education counsels in Ferizaj.
