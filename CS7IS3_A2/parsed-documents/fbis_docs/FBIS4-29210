The TOLD9151mb operates at a wavelength of 685 nanometers, compared with the 780 nanometers currently used in optical disk systems, Toshiba said. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. The smaller spot size allows almost double the volume of information to be stored on the same size disk, it said. Mass production of the device, at some 60,000 units per month, will begin at the end of the year. Toshiba has begun shipping samples of the laser diode at a price of 15,000 yen per unit.
