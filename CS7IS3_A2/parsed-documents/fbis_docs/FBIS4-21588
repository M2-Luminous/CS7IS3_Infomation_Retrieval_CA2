Taking advantage of a defective ground lighting system which had left half the base in darkness, the two men scaled a chain-link fence surrounding the Araxos military base around 4am, entering undetected. After breaking into a munitions warehouse, they grabbed a box of what they believed to contain anti-aircraft missile shells and made for the camp perimeter. But their escape was foiled by a guard, who shouted for them to stop. Opening fire on the guard, the two men raced across the compound and escaped over the fence. With army guards still in pursuit, they dropped the box in a nearby ditch. It was later found to be full of empty 20mm Rheinmetall RH202 shells. Military police launched a manhunt in the surrounding area while anti-terrorism experts and a forensics team were ordered to Araxos to aid in the manhunt. The Defence Ministry has also ordered an internal inquiry amid questions about possible security breaches at the base, which includes an airfield for fighter craft, a communications center and munitions stores. Ministry sources said preliminary evidence suggested the botched operation was a sophisticated operation planned by professionals. News reports highlighted similarities to a December 1989 rocket snatch from a Larissa base by the November 17 urban guerrilla group but officials did not rule out the possibility of a simple arms heist.
