He said that "we would like to place our hope on China's persuasive power with North Korea." Referring to his U.S. visit, he said that he intends to meet U.S. Government leaders to discuss the two nations' future stands toward North Korea. He added, in particular, that the U.S.- ROK consultations will focus on the possibility of UN Security Council resolutions against North Korea in line with the results of the Japanese-ROK and Chinese-ROK summit talks. As for China's desirable role in the nuclear issue involving North Korea, Foreign Minister Han stated: "Just like Japan, China has an important role in this issue. We would like to place our hopes on China's persuasive power with North Korea, while we still do not know how effective this actually will be." Foreign Minister Han had been visiting China as the deputy leader of the ROK delegation led by President Kim Yong-sam, and he is heading for the United States straightaway. After his U.S. visit, he is scheduled to again visit Japan on 3 April and to meet with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and other Japanese leaders.
