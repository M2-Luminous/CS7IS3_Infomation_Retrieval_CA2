A person may object to or comment on the proposal relating to any of the above mentioned substances without filing comments or objections regarding the others. If a person believes that one or more of these issues warrant a hearing, the individual should so state and summarize the reasons for this belief. In the event that comments or objections to this proposal raise one or more issues which the Administrator finds warrant a hearing, the Administrator shall order a public hearing by notice in the Federal Register , summarizing the issues to be heard and setting the time for the hearing. The Office of Management and Budget has determined that notice of aggregate production quotas are not subject to centralized review under Executive Order 12866. Rules establishing aggregate production quotas for controlled substances in Schedules I and II are required by statute, fulfill United States obligations under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961, and other international treaties, and are essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States. Without the periodic establishment and adjustment of aggregate production quotas, pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United States could not lawfully produce a wide variety of medically necessary pharmaceutical drugs. These actions have been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and it has been determined that this matter raises no Federalism implications which would warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The Administrator hereby certifies that this action will have no significant impact upon small entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. The establishment and revision of annual production quotas for Schedules I and II controlled substances is mandated by law and by the international obligations of the United States. Such quotas impact predominantly upon major manufacturers of the affected controlled substances. Dated: April 5, 1994. Thomas A. Constantine, Administrator.
