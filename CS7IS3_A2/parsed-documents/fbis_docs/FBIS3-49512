These countries can become members of European institutions more or less simultaneously," Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky told Poland's authoritative weekly POLITYKA. In Jeszenszky's view, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia are linked by historical, cultural and economic ties. He asserts that the four countries, problems and the mentality of their residents are very similar. He added that the United States, the European Union and other European institutions are also for maintaining the Visegrad Group, and treating the four countries as a group of states. The Prague meeting, Jeszenszky said, is a good opportunity for the U.S. President to see the importance of this part of Europe. "It would be good for the President to realize how many dangers our new democracies have to face. America has to accept a certain responsibility for their fate," he said. He stressed that the membership of the region's countries in European structures may be the first stage in the eastward expansion of democracy, welfare and stability. "A stable Central Europe can be an example and hope for other states in the region that it is worth taking the same path of economic and political reform... Towards a full membership in the European Union and in NATO."
