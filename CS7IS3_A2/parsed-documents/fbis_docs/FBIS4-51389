Since its founding, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association has focused on publicizing and popularizing the Copyright Law. In March 1993, the association organized training on the "Universal Copyright Convention and copyright management" for people in charge of copyright-related work from more than 60 publishing houses and press offices in Beijing, thus enabling them to gain a preliminary knowledge and understanding of the Universal Copyright Convention, and thus laying a fairly sound foundation for copyright management organs to exercise their duties in accordance with the law. The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has organized many forums regarding the Copyright Law for artists and renowned writers in Beijing, and it has launched publicity and consultation services regarding the Copyright Law in Beijing's main streets and public places. This has facilitated Beijing's enforcement of the Copyright Law. The Beijing Copyright Protection Association has provided services for copyright protection and has carried out explorations and experiments in copyright agency services. Last September, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association and the Beijing Copyright Bureau held the first trade fair on book manuscripts, thus serving as a bridge between writers and publishers. Nine publishing agreements and 30 letters of intent on publishing were concluded, and approximately 300,000 yuan worth of business was conducted. The fair won universal acclaim from writers and publishers. The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has actively investigated piracy and other infringements on behalf of copyright holders. In 1993, the association sent its members to Heilongjiang Province, Hebei Province, Tianjin municipality, and Shanxi Province to investigate the piracy of "The Gourd Brothers," a book published by the China Film Press. It helped the publishers recoup part of their economic losses. The Beijing Copyright Protection Association also has made active efforts to mediate copyright disputes. A publishing house in Beijing had a dispute with the heir of an author, and the dispute remained unresolved for several years. Last year, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association mediated the dispute at the request of both parties and quickly solved it. According to the feedback of many publishers and writers in Beijing municipality, the civilian mediation process employed by the Beijing Copyright Protection Association regarding copyright disputes is simple, is unlikely to provoke hard feelings, and is economically acceptable. After more than a year of exploration and practice, the Beijing Copyright Protection Association has inducted most of the publishers and a number of writers in the Beijing area, thereby initially installing a collective management mechanism for copyright management in the Beijing area.
