Dr. 'Ali Day, chairman of the City Council and an ophthalmologist, has been arrested after investigations revealed that he had recruited young men from Ramadan sports courses in order to give them training in acts of violence at unpopulated areas in Ra's al-Barr and (al-Dibah) this winter. [see previous Terrorism Report] A security source told AL-MUSAWWAR that the chairman of the City Council, an ophthalmologist who had returned from Peshawar and who was refused a job in the health department in Damietta, took advantage of disputes among the National Democratic Party members in recent elections and got elected. He was chosen from among the Labor Party members to be chairman of the Damietta City Council. The source said that by observing these courses, it was evident that the ages of the young men who underwent these courses ranged from 16 to 20. He added: By following up on this matter last week we found 12 minibuses carrying over 140 young men roaming Ra's al- Barr at 0730 in search of a place for an obstacle course. The source assured that the youths were not practicing soccer but conducting training on karate, violent games, and target practice.
