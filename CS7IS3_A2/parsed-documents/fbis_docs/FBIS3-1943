Anti-riot police and the para-military People's Armed Police (PAP) have been deployed to help restore order to cities and towns badly hit by industrial incidents. A news blackout has been imposed on the number and severity of strikes in the past year, but sources said the authorities were concerned enough to release emergency funds in spite of the worsening budget deficit. The sources said the hardest hit sector was the depressed coal industry, with many mines and factories owing labourers months of salaries. Just before Lunar New Year, the State Council set aside 1.6 billion yuan to help miners and other staff in the coal industry. One of the worst industrial incidents took place in the mining town of Jixi near the Russian border in northeast Heilongjiang province, when nearly 10,000 miners took part in a strike in January. The action was called off when the authorities paid workers enough money to take home for the Lunar New Year. It is understood state coal-producing companies had been crippled by competition from private mines which offered coal for a third of the state company price. Transport shortages caused stockpiling. Sources familiar with Chinese industry said a depressed market and restructuring of state units had forced at least half of government-run enterprises to lay off workers or delay paying wages and bonuses in the past year. They said the managers of 88 large-scale state enterprises recently petitioned the State Council for special relief funds so that they could pay their workers up to 75 percent of regular wages. The sources said that instead of paying salaries, many state factories had from last year issued workers goods from storehouses, which employees sold on the streets. Such practices sparked many demonstrations, even in relatively prosperous Tianjin and Shanghai. Human resources experts have admitted that the labour problem has been compounded by inflation, which is approaching 25 per cent in urban areas. An internal report last month said the livelihood of more than 20 percent of employees in urban state firms had been "significantly affected" by hyperinflation. Analysts said the spectre of strikes, demonstrations and urban unrest had already forced the leadership to scale down plans to modernise state businesses by transforming them into Western-style shareholding or stock companies. Internal estimates said at least 30 percent of the state sector's 100 million-strong workforce was superfluous. Laying the workers off was the only way to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, security sources said Beijing's police, paramilitary police, and state-security agents had been instructed to keep a close watch on "trouble-makers" in factories. Those to be watched included underground trade-unionists and labour organisers who in several instances had established contact with dissident intellectuals and those involved in the 1989 pro- democracy movement. The sources said for the first time since the Tiananmen Square crackdown, security agents were closely watching workers during the politically sensitive period that runs from the beginning of the National People's Congress to the anniversary of the June 4 crackdown. Sources said the frequency with which various police and paramilitary units had been mobilised to handle industrial unrest had increased in 1993. Tianjin sources said two PAP platoons were deployed last month to help defuse a strike that involved 4,000 workers. Last December, the Ministry of Public Security set up China's first patrol police force. A dispatch by the semiofficial China News Service said last night that 88 cities had set up patrol police squadrons. Patrol police numbers had reached more than 15,000 officers. While the aim of the new police unit was to fight crime, analysts said it would also be used to handle urban crises including industrial action. An official report last month said there were 250,000 labour disputes, including strikes, from 1988 to the end of last year.
