Such a move would seriously damage normal Sino-U.S. trade and naturally has prompted vigorous protests from Chinese officials. It has also infuriated Chinese industrial and commercial sectors, apart from causing dissatisfaction among American importers and consumers. The U.S. government cited the so-called "illegal transit" of China-made textile products, through third-world countries, into the United States, as reason for its move, which is untenable. The textile product quota system is a means of regulation for normal textile trade. It was arrived at through negotiations on equal footing between the Chinese and U.S. governments and, as such, is totally unrelated to illegal textile transit. The Chinese government always opposes the illegal transit of textile products and deals with such practices sternly, when there is solid evidence. In fact, last year, China's MOFTEC publicly punished nine enterprises for such illegal practices, and called two special national conferences in connection with cracking down on illegal textile transit. The United States was well aware of the efforts China has made and their effects in this regard. But the U.S. government ignored these facts and arbitrarily extended the accusation to normal textile trade. This is completely wrong. Trade disputes can only be solved through talks based on the principle of equality and mutual benefits. The U.S. government's latest move runs directly against this principle and has violated the GATT free trade rule and regulations of the International Multi- Fibre Agreement. The United States should not imagine that its action can force China to yield. It will not achieve this. The Chinese people have never bowed to any external pressure. The U.S. unilateral cut in China's textile quota assuredly will hurt Chinese textile production and exporting firms. But ultimately it is its American textile importers and consumers who are going to be hurt. American firms engaged in joint-venture textile production and technological cooperation in China will also be hit hard. The serious consequences of such a move will also affect other American industries. China's MOFTEC has solemnly declared that China will continue talks as originally planned in order to solve the problems through consultations. If the United States clings obstinately to its course, it will force China into a position where it has to adopt corresponding retaliatory actions. We hope the U.S. government will change its course, immediately correct the wrong action, and return to the path of consultation on equal footing in order to safeguard the normal development of Sino-U.S. trade and overall Sino-U.S. relations.
