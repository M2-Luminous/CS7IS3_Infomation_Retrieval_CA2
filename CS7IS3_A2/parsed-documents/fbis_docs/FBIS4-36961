FBIS4-36961 "drnes115cc_94001" FBIS-NES-94-115 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Islamic Affairs Muslim Brotherhood's Plans To Seize Power Detailed Muslim Brotherhood's Plans To Seize Power Detailed NC1306053094 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic 10 Jun 94 pp 14-19, 78 NC1306053094 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR Arabic BFN ["Part Two" in a series of unattributed articles: "Getting Control -- The Muslim Brotherhood's Plans to Seize Power"] [Text] The document entitled "Getting Control" [al-tamkin] is probably one of the gravest Muslim Brotherhood [MB] documents seized in the "al-Salsabil" case. As its title points out, it deals with the MB's plans to seize power; the title means, as the document literally says, "to prepare for shouldering the duties of the future and acquiring the ability to manage state affairs, and this cannot be achieved without a comprehensive plan that takes into its calculations the need for the MB to penetrate the vital classes in society and its influential establishments while remaining committed to a specific strategy against the other forces of society and in dealing with the outside world's forces." The document, which consists of 13 sheets of foolscap paper, makes the task of penetrating the student, worker, professional, and business sectors and the less capable popular groups the cornerstone of the plan to take control because, as the document says, the MB's spread in these sectors will make the confronting the MB more difficult, will impose on the state more complicated considerations, and will also increase the MB's opportunities and ability to alter the situation and work to "get control." But the document refers very clearly to the importance of the MB's penetration of the influential establishments in society. Herein lies the danger, because in the MB's view, the influential establishments are not just the professional associations, the media and judiciary establishments, and the People's Assembly, but also "other establishments" which are influential, have the ability to bring about change, and which the state might use in confronting and curtailing the MB. The "Getting Control" document does not openly name the other establishments, and this is intentional. But the description very clearly refers to the army and police. Those who know the history of the MB are not surprised by this because the MB is the only political movement whose first option for reaching power always included penetration of the army and the police with the aim of seizing power. This was exactly what happened in Sudan recently. The document also expounds a complete concept of how to deal with the unions, the pressure groups in society, and the political parties through a long-term policy, starting with "coordination," moving to "neutralization," then "containment," and then to taking the situation in hand and seizing control through controlling the decision-making centers. It also expounds on how to deal with Egypt's Copts, advocating a two-pronged policy: first, neutralize them by letting them feel that the MB does not pose a danger to them, and then second, limit the effectiveness of the Copts' role in public life and reduce their economic power in society. Yet the most dangerous point in the document is the MB's concept of dealing with the outside world, especially the West and the United States. This reveals the MB's real face, because the document asserts the importance of making the West, especially the United States, feel that the MB does not pose a danger to their interests and that it is in the West's interest to deal with the MB after they succeed in "getting control" because the MB represents stability and discipline. This is the content of the document, which we now publish in full together with an example of its application to all the governorates. We have not changed anything. As we said in the first part, these are the MB's own documents and papers, testifying to their plots to overthrow the regime and seize power. It is composed of thirteen large foolscap pages with the title "Getting Control," written in the form of a report that stresses that the new stage in the MB's existence requires confrontation and will not tolerate the generality of the former objectives of penetration and spreading. The document warns against making conflicting decisions on the situations facing the MB, the foreign challenges and threats, and the overt confrontation between the existing regimes and the political Islam movements operating in the political arena. The document begins with two questions that constitute the core of the plan for "getting control." The first question: What do they seek to achieve? And second: What should be the short-term situation in regard to the accomplishment of the mission, continuity, preparedness for future tasks, and promoting competence? The mission as the MB understands it and according to the text of the document is aimed at preparing its members to shoulder the tasks of the future and be capable of running the state, and at preparing the internal structure for the tasks of the stage of "competence." By competence, the document means drawing up a policy to confront external dangers, namely attempts to frustrate the MB's schemes to take power and penetrate the society through: - spreading to the vital class of society and knowing how to incite them. - spreading to the effective establishments, namely the army and police. - dealing with other forces and; lastly - making use of the external dimension. The document underlines that spreading throughout the vital classes of the people and having the ability to incite them would yield several benefits for the Muslim Brotherhood. Most importantly, this permeation would lessen threats and make confrontation with the MB more difficult. The ability to incite these classes would enhance the opportunities for effecting a change and enhance the chances of achieving the mission, that is, the ability to run state affairs and take power. According to the text of the document, the sectors of the people marked for penetration and permeation in order to control them were chosen on the following bases: - ease of penetration - ability to influence and incite them - the ease with which they could be manipulated - continuity of influence over them. According to these four conditions, the MB chose students, workers, artisans, businessmen, and popular classes as the segments to accomplish the two parts of the plan for getting power. Regarding the students, it is easy for the MB to penetrate them, spread among them, incite them, and continue to influence them. Regarding the workers, it is easy to spread among them and incite them. As for the artisans, it is easy to penetrate and influence them and somewhat easy to incite them. The businessmen are an easy sector to influence and to sustain the influence. The popular classes are easy to penetrate and incite. The Army And The Police Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of this document is the part dealing with implementing the plan for "getting control" in vital establishments. The document describes these establishments as those representing: 1. A tool to undermine and confront the Islamic movement. 2. A real addition to the movement's power and effectiveness in making changes. Although these two conditions fit only the army and the police, as we pointed out in the preamble, the document's description of these establishments confirms our theory that they do mean the army and the police. The document says that choosing the vital establishments depends on the following criteria: 1. Their effectiveness in confronting and undermining the Islamic movement. 2. Their ability to make changes. 3. The comprehensiveness and broadness of their influence. 4. Long-term confrontation. The document indicates the army and the police are two of its most important targets, along with the influential establishments, foremost among which is the media establishment. The latter, according to the document, has comprehensive, wide-ranging, and long-term influence, has the ability to make changes, and can prove effective in the confrontation. Regarding the religious establishment, al-Azhar, the document says that it has the same characteristics as the media establishment, but in its own way. As for the judiciary, the document notes that it is known for its effectiveness in causing change, particularly in the legislature-- that is, the People's Assembly. Dealing With Others The document discusses in detail what is known as dealing carefully with others as part of the plan for "getting control" and the "know your enemy" method. It says: We are not operating alone, for there are other forces in the arena that negatively or positively affect our ability to perform our mission. Therefore, the continuity of the efforts for "getting control" requires careful action with a view to containing the others, coexisting, neutralizing, and minimizing the effectiveness of the opposing quarters, while coordinating with neutral quarters that have not defined their positions or that support our mission--the brothers in full or in part. The document adds: We have to take into consideration that we must be able to deal with different types of cases simultaneously. There are options before the MB with regard to the authorities: 1. Containment by exploiting the authorities' establishments to fulfill the MB's mission through the decision-making process or by changing their systems. 2. Coexistence--in other words, working to create a form of coexistence with the regime by influencing situations and thus making the regime eager to keep our effective presence. 3. Neutralization by letting them -- that is the authorities -- feel that we do not pose a danger to them. 4. Reducing the authorities' effectiveness in the confrontation so as to continue the efforts to get control. On the issue of dealing with the Copts, the document says: One of three ways of dealing with the Coptic community must be chosen: 1. Coexistence by convincing them that they have an interest in realizing Islamic rule and the justice it brings, which the present regime cannot provide. 2. Neutralization by making the Copts feel that we -- the MB -- are not hostile to them and do not pose any danger to them. The document calls this "securing" [al-ta'min], that is, winning over the Copts. 3. Reducing the scope of their threat and their economic influence and material force. The document defines this as "fragmentation"--that is, fragmenting the Coptic ranks facing the MB. The document does not fail to define the stand vis-a-vis the Jews; it is limited to one line, namely: "The effectiveness of their threat in all fields must be minimized." And the Groups For the MB, the other groups include the pressure groups and the parties in addition to the authority, Copts, and Jews. It is not strange for the document to add the clubs, the suspicious societies "according to the document," the Islamic groups, and Islamist thinkers to the above groups. Regarding the clubs and suspicious societies, the document says -- without naming these clubs or their types -- that their danger lies in their influence on the decision-making centers through executive figures and in their influence on public opinion through the leaders in the media and the arts. This leads to the adoption of decisions and laws that serve their interests to a great degree. Penetrating them is difficult due to the information that they receive from certain levels. The inability to prove their dangerousness in a practical way is clearly a weak point and we -- the MB -- must realize this in order to rectify it. We must cope with this sector by minimizing the effectiveness of their threat. In the section dealing with parties and pressure groups, the document says: This section includes professional associations, family and tribal groupings, international "human rights" organizations, economic forums like "the businessmen's society..." [ellipsis as published], and the existing parties. The document explains that dealings will take place at several levels: 1. Steering. Joining and controlling the decision-making centers so that we have a majority. 2. Coordination. If we do not have a majority, we must coordinate with them in areas where we have common grounds and even find joint interests with them. 3. At this level, the document combines the methods of containment, neutralization, and minimizing of the effectiveness of others should the steering or the coordination efforts fail. The document notes that dealing with parties and associations may take various forms because of their nature and the divergence of their views. The gravest part of this document is the one dealing with the Islamic groups and Islamic thinkers. In this section, the MB openly reveals its position regarding these groups for the first time. According to the text of the document, this section includes: - Independent Islamic groups and thinkers who are in agreement with us, even partly, regarding the mission but who differ over the details. This requires coordination, cooperation, integration, and alliances. If the alliance and coordination efforts fail, containment, neutralization, and coexistence tactics should be pursued. - Nonindependent Islamic groups and thinkers affiliated with specific quarters that are used to strike at and obstruct our efforts at "getting control." Attempts should be made to steer, contain, or neutralize them so as to minimize their effectiveness. America and the West In another paragraph headed "Hostile External Forces--America and the West," the document says verbatim that dealing with them begins with the stage of coexistence. This can be achieved by persuading them that it is in their interest to deal with the existing forces in the region, and that as a force the MB is characterized by stability and discipline. However, dealing with the West will pass through a stage of neutralization. This can be done by letting the West feel that it is in its interest not to harm us, because we pose no threat to them so long as they do not obstruct the efforts for "getting control." In the meantime, we, the MB, could affect their interests should they stand against these efforts. The last stage of dealing with the West and the United States is the one of minimizing their effectiveness, which can be achieved by means of minimizing their threat. This can be done by directly affecting their interests and weakening the ability of their institutions to influence the decision-making process for their interests. Whenever possible, however, we must benefit from the external domain. Managing the State The most dangerous point in this document is probably the plan for the coup that the MB is preparing in order to seize power and reach the stage of managing the state's affairs or what is termed in this document as the preparation for future tasks. The document says: Creating a social situation that would allow us to "get control" requires that we be able to manage the state's affairs and that we realize it is possible that we might be compelled to manage the state's affairs by ourselves. At the same time, "getting control" will lead to the rallying of hostile foreign forces. Hence, preparations must be made to confront the internal and external challenges; this means that we -- the MB -- must have a plan for confronting these challenges by getting the necessary resources to do so and the ability to use them. This requires the preparation of the internal structure in line with the changing requirements and making the optimum use of the resources, which the document labels "competence" [al-kafa'ah]. The document adds that this is the practical challenge in achieving the various objectives of the plan. This requires the development of the particulars of the internal structure so as to be in line with the nature of the coming stage -- both from the conceptual angle and the preparation of individuals and the internal structure -- in the following way: Regarding the concept--which is one of the most important sides in the triangle of competence--this requires the concentration of the membership's efforts on construction and change. Therefore it is important for the ranks, "the MB elements," to understand fully the issue of change and to have a very clear idea of its directions so that the plan will not meet with passive resistance from within. It is necessary to start submitting the issue of change to dialogues at all levels in order to let everyone interact and participate, thus initiating ideas and initiatives and giving substance to the issue. Regarding indoctrinating individuals, the document says that the existing indoctrination program should include the effects of the plan on various particulars. Permeating the classes of society, which is the core of the "getting control" plan, requires raising the individuals' ability to influence a large sector of society and thus improve the level of dialogue, the ability to convince and train through the following: - Creating a balance between the propagation carried out by individuals so as to unite the ranks and make the propagation widespread. - Developing the leadership circles and the ability to activate the groups. As for permeating influential establishments, this requires the following: - Raising the individuals' ability to penetrate the establishments without losing their identities. - Raising the individuals' ability to handle information. As for dealings with the other forces, individuals must be groomed to establish intellectual or practical bridges with them. As for the mission of running the state and future missions, this requires the following: 1. Attention must be given to a select group, which will develop the ability to run public establishments. 2. The ability to absorb and benefit from distinguished figures in various sectors. Regarding structural building, the practical method of management requires: - The availability of the necessary information to perform various missions. - The establishment of the principle of authorization and decentralization in action whenever possible. - The establishment of the principle of nonengagement of individuals, so they will be free to occupy important positions. - The flexibility of the structure to allow for adding new entities in accordance with the plan "information apparatus- political relations." - Completing the structure on the basis of the importance and priority of the action in the plan. The Importance After finishing with indoctrination and the structural formation of individuals and the structures of groups, the document moves to the most dangerous part. It outlines the priorities of actions in all sectors and the relative importance of each sector, and defines the degree of penetration achieved and those who will be targeted, using figures and percentages--which proves the scientific and methodological nature of the plan. In this regard, the document says: 1. As far as ensuring the success of the efforts for "getting control," the social classes that must be penetrated are: Students, laborers, professionals, businessmen, and low-income people, in that order. As far as the vital establishments are concerned, the following influential establishments could be named: The media, the religious establishment, the judiciary, the parliament. The document adds that the goal of dealing with others concerns the need to deal with the authorities first, then with the Copts, the Jews, the West, the suspicious clubs, pressure groups, parties, and Islamic groups. 2. Preparedness for future missions in "running of the state." The document names first the universities, professionals, public institutions, institutions that have a specific mission, and finally the economic institutions for "financing." 3. Betterment of society. The document here selects for penetration and infiltration the educational institutions, the media, the religious and cultural establishment, economic institutions, and technological institutions. 4. As far as internal preparations are concerned, the goal is to deepen the vision and complete the structural formation and reforms. As far as the four goals are concerned, the document allocates 40 percent of efforts to continuing the "getting control" plan, 30 percent to internal structuring, 20 percent to the betterment of society, and the remaining 10 percent to preparations for the future missions when "running the state." Having precisely determined the importance of each of the four objectives of the plan, the document assigns weight to every track of action according to its importance and its contribution to the achievement of the set objective. To the tracks within the first objective--"getting control"--the following weights are given: 50 percent to the penetration of society's vital sectors, 40 percent to the penetration of influential institutions, and 10 percent to dealings with others. Within these, there are subtracks, and each has its weight: In the penetration of the vital sectors, students are given 30 percent, workers 30 percent, professionals and businessmen 10 percent, and low-class people 20 percent. In the track of influential institutions, the plan gives powerful establishments, "the Army and the police," 40 percent, and this goes up to 50 percent for the judiciary, 50 percent for the parliament, 30 percent for media, and 20 percent as a comparative weight for the religious establishment [figures as published]. In accordance with these weights, the plan sets the priorities of action in 1994 and determines rates to be achieved during the remaining seven months of this year. Although the investigations have not yet determined the significance of these rates and standards, the MB says in this serious document that it made good progress in the stage of formation (2,100 points) compared to 1,425 points in the field of education, 900 points in economics, 780 points in the media, only 120 points in the area of parties and pressure groups, and 400 points in the shantytowns. This shows that the internal organization made fine strides and that there were various degrees and stages of penetration of society, as the document shows on its last page. The Plan's Guide In its final shape, the plan in itself constitutes the MB's manifesto of its future attempt to take over power and stage an internal coup against the existing regime. The plan contains a guide specifying in detail and in accordance with a fixed and precise timetable the steps for staging the coup. The guide consists of five foolscap pages and six annexes, each representing a questionnaire for studying the real situation in every governorate, from the street committees, to families, to the guidance offices in the governorates. According to the document, the following steps must be implemented in chronological order. The first step: The Administrative Bureau would choose a three-member committee called "the committee of planning and follow-up" or some such name expressing this type of function. One of its members, the moderator at least, would be a member of the Administrative Bureau. The bureau would choose at least one person to act as planning and follow-up delegate in the governorate. The committee's primary function would be to direct and follow up planning operations, including proper implementation of any future steps, examining the performance of all involved functionaries, and developing plans and major ideas prior to submitting them to the Administrative Bureau. According to the document, it is advisable for the above committee to include a representative of the chief administrative or geographical division--that is, the main town or district center-- and a representative for the various specialized divisions of the groups in the area. The committee would meet and draw up a plan and a timetable to implement further steps. The second step: This consists of examining the Brotherhood's policies and deciding which policies must be maintained. The Administrative Bureau in each governorate would carry out a detailed discussion of the Brotherhood's policies and arrive at two results. First, the policies would be translated into major guidelines governing the Brotherhood's activities in the governorate for the duration of the plan. Secondly, members' comments and suggestions that the Bureau sees fit to submit to senior administrators and to the central planning unit would be recorded. These comments and suggestions are designed to improve policies and close any existing gaps. The third step: The local bureau in the governorate would examine the Brotherhood's course of action in the governorate during the previous plan. It would assess the following: 1. The details, clarity, and comprehensibility of the working plans. 2. The extent to which the objectives have been attained. 3. The lessons to be drawn from previous activities regarding the quality of planning and the competence of the planners, the practicality of the previous plan, and the problems that surfaced during the implementation of the plan. The fourth step: Gathering information on internal and external conditions. This was perhaps the most dangerous step of the "Salsabil" office's tasks. The office's activities were confined to gathering, classifying, and analyzing the information on the internal and external conditions as follows: 1. The information on internal conditions will also include details about the Brotherhood's members. The field leader will ask every member to fill out an information paper about himself. The information on internal conditions also includes details about the organizational and administrative status in the governorate. These details will be collected by the field leader and will be finally reviewed and classified by the governorate's planning and follow-up committee. 2. The information on external conditions will also include: A. Details about the status of the state and society in general. The central planning unit will supply this information. B. Details about the governorate's society and departments. The representative of the planning and follow-up committee in the governorate will provide this information. C. Details about the institutions, companies, and departments with which our personnel have a connection. The field official or the officials in charge of branches and divisions will gather such details. D. Details about the most influential figures in the governorate with whom we cooperate and who have direct influence on us. The fifth step: After gathering the information, the representative of the planning and follow-up committee will prepare a three-part report as follows: First part: It contains a list showing the points of internal weakness and strength. This list is prepared from the information gathered by the internal unit. The representative is anxious to classify these points according to their importance and effect. Second part: It contains a list detailing the job opportunities on the one hand and the challenges and problems facing our members on the other. The representative will classify this information and its effects on our activities and the dangers and threats this information represents in the future. Third part: The representative will compare the opportunities and challenges with the points of weakness and strength. He will define the opportunities which include points of strength that will enable us to exploit them. The representative will also define the points that we could not exploit easily due to the presence of specific weak points. He will define the threats that could increase due to the presence of weak points and that could be confronted by points of strength. The sixth step: Analyzing the previous objectives so that they can be used in the next stage. Also, assessing the success in implementing the objectives and comparing this with previous successes as mentioned in the first document. The seventh step: Here, methods of implementation are selected. The planning and follow-up committee would choose a set of appropriate methods to realize every objective. The committee would hold intensive consultations with the main formations in the governorates (geographical and technical). The eighth step: Drafting programs to put those methods chronologically, financially, and organizationally into practice. The planning and follow-up committee would translate the methods into plans of action with specified timetables. It would also specify approximate budgets for those methods and determine the organizational responsibilities for implementing every major activity. The ninth step: Sending the proposed plan to the formations in the governorates for evaluation and presentation to the base. The Administrative Bureau would supervise the forwarding of the proposed plan to the geographic formations and the technical divisions and its presentation to the executive bases in the governorates. The various units would present their proposals to develop the plan to the Administrative Bureau. The bureau would refer them to the planning and follow-up committee, which, in turn, would examine them and try to use them to modify the proposed plan and send it back to the Administrative Bureau. In this last stage, the Administrative Bureau would discuss the plan, decide on its final shape, adopt it as a basis for action, and send it to all formations so that they will be committed to it. The bureau would watch the progress of its various units in achieving the tasks assigned to them by the plan. Here, the document known as the guide to the plan ends. It is the first practical model for implementing the "getting control" plan at the level of the governorate, beginning with the street committee and ending with the governorate's shura [consultative] council. The seriousness of the document lies in the fact that it uses scientific and technological methods in gathering information and data from the field or the locality, and this is one of the known security methods. The information and the date are then analyzed to determine the points of strength and weakness to help implement the "getting control" plan--seizing power and staging a well-devised coup program which the Brotherhood adopts in its secret organization. Again, these are their own papers and documents, signed by their leaders. There is no way to deny that the Brotherhood is a coupist organization that believes only in secret activity, no matter what public facade it uses.
