It listened to a report by the minister of state for foreign affairs on Jordan's participation in the meetings of the multilateral working group on water, which held its fifth meeting in Muscat in the Sultanate of Oman. It is noteworthy that Jordan decided to reduce the number of its delegates participating in the meeting to only one, until an appropriate solution is found for the way ships heading for al-'Aqabah are searched. At the end of the meetings, Jordan's delegate delivered a speech. He said he could not reject or support the decisions reached in the committee's meetings until he consulted with the Jordanian Government. This position postponed the meetings for a few hours because the committee's decisions are made unanimously. In honor of the host state, the fraternal Sultanate of Oman, the Jordanian delegate decided to regard his speech as canceled, so acceptable decisions could be made unanimously. In a concluding speech, the meeting's head said he understood Jordan's position and stressed the desire of the committee's members to remove the reasons for the reduction in the Jordanian delegation, so it can resume its previous activity and efforts.
