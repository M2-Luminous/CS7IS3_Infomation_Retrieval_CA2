"We are on a trajectory of better and better employment figures, but they are still not as good as we hope," Labor Secretary Robert Reich said today, saying that the new legislation will change the entire employment system. Observers said the Workforce Security Act, which features the establishment of one-stop job searching centers across the nation, was the third piece of legislation of the White House in improving the nation's job picture. Last year, Congress passed the administration's voluntary national standards for elementary and secondary school and its school-to-work training and apprenticeship program. In the U.S., around 25 percent of the unemployed workers do not have the skills for another jobs. The traditional job training system is called obsolete and wrongly targeted. "What the Americans are discovering now, even though there are more jobs, they're not getting the old jobs back again," Secretary Reich said in a TV interview. "It's not enough simply to get some unemployment insurance check. You've got to get help in getting the new jobs."
