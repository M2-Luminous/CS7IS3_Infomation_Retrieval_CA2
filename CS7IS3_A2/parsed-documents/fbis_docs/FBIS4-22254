In the course of carrying out monitoring work, the tax inspectorates established violations of the tax legislation in every other enterprise and organization that was audited. They revealed instances of understated profit, concealed taxes and payments with a consideration of penalty sanctions with a total amount of 16.6 billion rubles, which constitutes 14.9 million rubles per average scheduled worker in the tax agencies. The largest additional computations were made during the audits of the Dvigatel plant in Yartsevo, 1,445,500,000 rubles; the Minudobreniya Dorogobuzh AO [joint-stock company], 527,900,000 rubles; the Almazinstrument Plant in Roslavl, 256,700,000 rubles; Gnezdovo AO, 165,500,000 rubles; Kompleksnyye Dorozhnyye Mashiny AO, 130,600,000 rubles; Stroykonstruktsiya AO, 120,500,000 rubles; Smolensk Oblast Commercial-Trade Enterprise, 117,400,000 rubles; and Smolensknefteprodukty State Enterprise, 87,500,000 rubles. The basic reasons for the revealed violations were the poor knowledge of the tax legislation by officials at enterprises and organizations by physical individuals; their failure to observe the proper bookkeeping procedure and the statute dealing with the makeup of the expenditures to be considered as production costs of output (operations, services) and other normative documents and instructional documents; as well as the deliberate understatement of the taxable base for purposes of avoiding taxation. During 1993, administrative fines amounting to a total of 66.2 million rubles were levied against 3459 officials at enterprises and organizations and 3366 citizens for violations of the tax legislation. A total of 15,233 foreign citizens were required to file declarations. They were taxed a total of 58.6 million rubles of income tax.
