The ceremony, full of pomp and circumstance, was attended by many guests. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco represented the Angolan Government. [passage omitted] South African Ambassador Roger Trammer said a new South Africa should encourage stronger bilateral relations. [Begin Trammer recording] The struggle for freedom has been won but the struggle continues so we can obtain what freedom offers us. We must now forget the past because the future beckons. [end recording] Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco said that the victory of the African National Congress, ANC, and Nelson Mandela was also a victory for Africa, the world, and Angola in particular. [Begin Moco recording] It is in fact a victory for the whole of mankind. It is not a victory of blacks over whites, as is often said and as has often been said. This has not been a victory only for those who were oppressed but also for the oppressors. As someone has pointed out, the oppressor also suffers. In South Africa for many decades we saw that suffering, human degradation, misery, and immorality affected everyone to some extent, irrespective of their race, creed, or regional background. All Africans of all regions, colors, and races felt that suffering. [end recording]
