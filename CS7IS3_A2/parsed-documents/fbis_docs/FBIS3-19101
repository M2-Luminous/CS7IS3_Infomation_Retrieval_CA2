Scientists say the contraction of the coal industry will cut the area affected by nearly nine-tenths early next century. The estimates, prepared for the Department of the Environment, show that western and northern parts of the UK, including much of Wales and Scotland, are particularly affected. Mr. Robert Wilson, chairman of the report's research group, said the soils and rocks of these areas contained little alkaline material to counteract the acid. Last week in Geneva the UK agreed the terms of a UN protocol to curb the sulphur dioxide emissions which help cause acid rain and come largely from coal-burning power stations. Under the agreement, likely to be signed later this year, the UK must cut emissions to 50 percent of 1980 levels by the year 2000, and to 30 percent by 2005 and 20 percent by 2010. Ministers have been assured that the power generation industry's switch from coal to gas means that the UK can meet the new obligations. Environmentalists such as the pressure group Friends of the Earth have criticised the UK for refusing to sign an earlier sulphur protocol which expired last year. The report employs the "critical loads approach" that the UK has urged international conventions to follow. This takes account of the environment's sensitivity as well as the extent of pollution when assessing the impact of acid rain. The report says that some damage to Scottish heather and to salmon and trout stocks in Wales can be attributed directly to acid rain. However, it adds: "It is harder to link damage to tree health directly to air pollution -- the causes are complex." About 10 percent of pollution recorded by the study was found to come from other countries. Even if sulphur emissions were curbed sharply some areas, such as the southern Pennines, "would never recover from layers of deposits since the Industrial Revolution," the report says. Negotiations on a protocol to curb nitrogen oxides, which are emitted from vehicles and other sources, are expected to take several years.
