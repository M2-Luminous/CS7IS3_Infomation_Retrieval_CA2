FR940328-0-00049 FR940328-0-00013 The Agricultural Outlook publication (which was available in the FSIS Hearing Clerk's office) states that ``CDC researchers estimate that between 7,668 and 20,448 persons became ill from exposure to E. coli 0157:H7 annually in the U.S.'' The range in estimated deaths is directly related to the range in the CDC estimate for number of cases. CDC researchers have estimated that 1.9 percent of the 7,668 to 20,448 cases result in death. Several comments point out that costs are affected by the effective date, especially in view of the upcoming implementation date for nutrition labeling. The Department agrees that costs are affected by the implementation schedule. However, it is beyond the scope of the cost analysis to be able to differentiate or estimate the cost savings that would be attributable to processors and retailers having an additional 30 or 60 days to comply. The issue of effective date is discussed elsewhere under comments related to the implementation schedule. One comment alleged that the Department did not make sufficient supporting material available to the public, particularly in the area of the cost and benefit analysis. The data from Table 1 represents the latest and best estimates of the cost of foodborne illness prepared by the Department's Economic Research Service (ERS). ERS has been publishing articles on their cost of foodborne illness research for more than a decade. The methodology has been refined and updated over time. From the perspective of Executive Order 12866, the relevant information is the available data on costs and benefits that is based on the latest methodology. The Department is not obligated to identify all the materials that have been published during the development and refinement of these methods. Another comment stated that USDA failed to place on the record any studies or other information relied upon by USDA regarding foodborne illnesses other than E. coli 0157:H7. The Agricultural Outlook article summarizes CDC findings for all foodborne diseases caused by bacterial and parasitic agents. While recognizing that in the majority of cases, the cause is unknown, CDC has found that when a source or likely source is identified, approximately 50 percent of cases of all foodborne diseases are associated with meat or poultry products. The CDC analysis supports the ERS estimates that meat and poultry are associated with approximately 50 percent of foodborne bacterial diseases. A supermarket chain commented that scale upgrades would cost almost $500,000, or approximately $9,700 per store. While this cost is slightly outside the estimate of $6,000 to $9,000 used in the analysis, changing the range from $6,000 to $10,000 would not have an effect on the net benefit conclusions. The same commenter pointed out that upgrading equipment does not eliminate labor costs, since there would always be some items that were not compatible with automated equipment and would have to be done by hand. The Department agrees, but accounting for this in the analytical model would have minimal effect on net benefits.
