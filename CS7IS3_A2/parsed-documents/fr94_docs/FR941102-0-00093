FR941102-0-00093 FR941102-0-00026 Rule 10b&hyph;10(e)(9) defines payment for order flow to include any monetary payment, service, property, or any other benefit that results in remuneration, compensation or consideration to a broker or dealer in return for the routing of customer orders. Broker-dealers should examine order routing arrangements carefully, with a view toward determining whether the firm has received some form of remuneration as a result of routing orders to that market. As noted, payment for order flow includes non-monetary compensation, such as clearing services or reciprocal order swapping arrangements. It is the Commission's view that monetary and non-monetary inducements are alternative methods of payment to attract order flow and are economically equivalent. 22 As such, non-cash remuneration is as likely to influence the broker's order routing decision as cash. In addition, as is the case with monetary payments, the customer is unlikely to be aware of many of these practices. Thus, the net effect of non-monetary arrangements is not appreciably different than that of monetary payment for order flow. Therefore, the Commission concludes that non-monetary payment for order flow should be included in the definition and should be subject to the regulatory treatment set forth in the proposal. 22 See, e.g. , ``Inducements for Order Flow,'' A Report to the Board of Governors, NASD, July 1991; see also National Market System Hearings, supra note 11. Payment for order flow also includes any credit, rebate, or discount against execution fees that exceeds the fee charged for executing the order. 23 It is the Commission's view that although SRO fee schedules are reviewed by the Commission under section 19(b) of the Act and appear in the Federal Register , the connection between these fee arrangements and a member firm's order routing practices may not be known or apparent to that firm's customers. Moreover, it is possible for an exchange to adjust its fee schedule for members routing orders to provide the economic equivalent of payment for order flow. The existence of such remuneration to the firm, whether in the form of monetary payments or other benefits, should be disclosed directly to customers. 24 23 Thus, payment for order flow would include a fee arrangement in which an exchange charges 50 cents per order but offers a $2.00 per order credit for agency orders, which can be used to offset other fees incurred on that exchange. See e.g. , Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32377 (May 27, 1993), 58 FR 31568 (Approving NYSE practice of offering a rebate on every small order (100&hyph;2099 shares) delivered via SuperDot and executed by the NYSE specialist). However, payment for order flow would not include fee arrangements in which the market's net charge for executing the order, after any discount, rebate, or credit, is greater than zero. 24 As initially proposed, ``payment for order flow'' was defined as ``any compensation received from any broker-dealer (including market makers), exchange members, or exchanges to which a broker-dealer routes customers orders for execution, including: Monetary payments, research, products or services *␣*␣* discounts and rebates, or any other reduction of or credit against any fee, expense or other financial obligation of the broker or dealer routing a customer order.'' In response to comments, the Commission has clarified that the definition of payment for order flow includes discounts, rebates, credits, or other fee arrangements only to the extent that such discounts exceed the fee charged. In addition, the Commission has clarified that payment for order flow received from a registered securities association is also subject to the disclosure rules. The Companion Release solicits comment on whether the definition of payment for order flow should be expanded. B. New Account and Annual Disclosures The Commission is adopting Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 to require broker-dealers to provide to customers information regarding their payment for order flow practices when a new account is opened and to all customers annually. The Commission is modifying the Rule to require a description of the broker-dealer's policies for determining where to route customer orders that are subject to payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the NBBO.
