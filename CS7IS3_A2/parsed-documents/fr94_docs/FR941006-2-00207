FR941006-2-00207 FR941006-2-00113 J. Human Research Protection All research involving human subjects shall be conducted with the informed consent of those subjects and in a manner that will ensure their privacy and freedom from risk or harm and the protection of persons who are not subjects of the research but would be affected by it, unless such procedures and safeguards would make the research impractical. In such instances, the Institute must approve procedures designed by the grantee to provide human subjects with relevant information about the research after their involvement and to minimize or eliminate risk or harm to those subjects due to their participation. K. Nondiscrimination No person may, on the basis of race, sex, national origin, disability, color, or creed be excluded from participation in, denied the benefits of, or otherwise subjected to discrimination under any program or activity supported by Institute funds. Recipients of Institute funds must immediately take any measures necessary to effectuate this provision. L. Reporting Requirements Recipients of Institute funds, other than scholarships awarded under section II.B.2.b.v., shall submit Quarterly Progress and Financial Reports within 30 days of the close of each calendar quarter (that is, no later than January 30, April 30, July 30, and October 30). Two copies of each report must be sent. The Quarterly Progress Reports shall include a narrative description of project activities during the calendar quarter, the relationship between those activities and the task schedule and objectives set forth in the approved application or an approved adjustment thereto, any significant problem areas that have developed and how they will be resolved, and the activities scheduled during the next reporting period. The quarterly financial status report shall be submitted in accordance with section XI.G.2. of this guideline. A final project progress report and financial status report shall be submitted within 90 days after the end of the grant period in accordance with section XI.K.2. of this Guideline. M. Audit Each recipient must provide for an annual fiscal audit which shall include an opinion on whether the financial statements of the grantee present fairly its financial position and financial operations are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (See section XI.J. of the Guideline for the requirements of such audits.) N. Suspension of Funding After providing a recipient reasonable notice and opportunity to submit written documentation demonstrating why fund termination or suspension should not occur, the Institute may terminate or suspend funding of a project that fails to comply substantially with the Act, Institute guide-lines, or the terms and conditions of the award. 42 U.S.C. 10708(a). O. Title to Property At the conclusion of the project, title to all expendable and nonexpendable personal property purchased with Institute funds shall vest in the recipient court, organization, or individual that purchased the property if certification is made to the Institute that the property will continue to be used for the authorized purposes of the Institute-funded project or other purposes consistent with the State Justice Institute Act, as approved by the Insti-tute. If such certification is not made or the Institute disapproves such certification, title to all such property with an aggregate or individual value of $1,000 or more shall vest in the Institute, which will direct the disposi-tion of the property. P. Original Material All products prepared as the result of Institute-supported projects must be originally-developed material unless otherwise specified in the award documents. Material not originally developed that is included in such products must be properly identified, whether the material is in a verbatim or extensive paraphrase format. Q. Acknowledgment and Disclaimer Recipients of Institute funds shall acknowledge prominently on all products developed with grant funds that support was received from the Institute. The ``SJI'' logo must appear on the front cover of a written product, or in the opening frames of a video product, unless another placement is approved in writing by the Institute. A camera-ready logo sheet is available from the Institute upon request. Recipients also shall display the following disclaimer on all grant products: This [document, film, videotape, etc.] was developed under [grant/cooperative agreement, number SJI-(insert number)] from the State Justice Institute. The points of view expressed are those of the [author(s), filmmaker(s), etc.] and do not necessarily represent the official position or policies of the State Justice Institute. R. Institute Approval of Grant Products No grant funds may be obligated for publication or reproduction of a final product developed with grant funds without the written approval of the Institute. Grantees shall submit a final draft of each such product to the Institute for review and approval. These drafts shall be submitted sufficiently before the product is scheduled to be sent for publication or reproduction to permit Institute review and incorporation of any appropriate changes agreed upon by the grantee and the Institute.
