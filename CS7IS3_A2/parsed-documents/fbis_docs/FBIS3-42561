A Political Portrait"] [Text] The fashion of writing books that has swept over Russian politicians in recent years has not bypassed Vladimir Volfovich. But as distinct from others, he has written his, but he dictated it without worrying about editing and without being at all concerned about style or even grammar. This kind of work is commonly called "stream of consciousness." But this is also what makes it interesting. The Essence of His Brain "This is an analytical narrative intermingled with the biographical canon, the quintessence of my philosophical and geopolitical views on modern reality. This is the essence of my brain, the limit I have reached in my 46 years"--this is how Zhirinovskiy begins his book, which he called "the last rush to the south" and published precisely on the eve of the December elections in an edition of 75,000 copies. Introducing himself to the reader, Zhirinovskiy immediately touches upon a spot that is sensitive for him--the question of his paternity: "My first name is Russian--Vladimir, but my father was named Volf, and that is what was written on my father's birth certificate and passport. But mama called him simply Volodya and it would have been simpler for me to be named Vladimir Vladimirovich, but because of bureaucratism or red tape--I do not know, one or the other--I am Vladimir Volfovich. I am proud to bear any name since it is my father's name, although it sounds a little strange to the Russian ear." Sensitivity to the "Russian ear," for which passive anti-Semitism is no rarity, has distinguished Zhirinovskiy since the very beginning of his political career. Extreme nationalism has also distinguished certain of his "party comrades" with whom he went through the early stages of the establishment of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]. Those who know Zhirinovskiy assert that in reality he has a very vulnerable soul and he was offended when journalists grabbed on to his slip of the tongue, when he said that his "mama is Russian but father is a lawyer." The problem is that Zhirinovskiy is trying to please everyone at the same time. In a recent interview in the Israeli newspaper MAARIV he stated that his late father was a Jew. The leader of the LDPR added: "Jews are in a special position in Russia. Ninety percent of the Leninist party were Jews and 90 percent of the members of my party are Jews as well." In general Zhirinovskiy's book could serve as an ideal aid for people studying psychoanalysis. Here is a little example of his recollections of day nurseries in Almaty: "I recall how we were awakened at 2300 in the evening. They put us to bed at 2100 and awakened us at 2300 to make sure that we urinated in the bucket. The boys went to urinate in one bucket and the girls in another. And that was perhaps the first time, at three or four years of age, that something sexual stirred in me, when I saw girls completely naked." And here is how political thinking awakened in the young Zhirinovskiy: "I ran through the corridor of the kindergarten and saw the attendants standing by the loudspeaker...they were standing there and weeping. It seemed that they had just received information that somewhere in Moscow a certain Stalin had died. And to me, a child, of course, who still knew absolutely nothing about politics, it was quite incomprehensible why so far from Moscow, in the corridor of the kindergarten, adult people, attendants, nurses, teachers--were standing there and weeping...perhaps this was my first flash of political awareness, my first protest against the personality cult." The Institute Since childhood the young Volodya was pursued by the dream of getting away from the backwater Almaty, from his family, where he was the sixth child, to run away from his stepfather whom he did not like (his father died when the boy was less than a year old). Zhirinovskiy wanted to become a diplomat or at least an officer. "Ultimately...I decided to go to Moscow and enter if not the MGIMO [Moscow State Institute of International Relations] then its Eastern version--the Institute of Eastern Languages under Moscow State University." In 1964 when the 18-year-old Zhirinovskiy crossed the threshold of the Sovetskiy Rayon Committee of the VLKSM [All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League] of Almaty in order to obtain a character reference for admission to Moscow State University, he assured the Komsomol leaders that he would still "become the pride of Kazakhstan." True, he received average marks on his entrance examinations to the Institute of Eastern Languages at Moscow State University, where he was assigned the Turkish language, which is not difficult to study and not very promising on the level of further work. Dark Spots in the Biography Zhirinovskiy was a good student, even excellent, and therefore it is not surprising that he was sent for temporary duty in Turkey for the construction of the metallurgical combine in Iskenderun. We do not know precisely what happened there. Zhirinovskiy himself in a conversation with one of the authors said the following in this regard: "The Turks wanted to accuse me of disseminating communist propaganda because I gave a Turk a badge on which, they thought, was a picture of Karl Marx. And when they understood that they were mistaken and that the badge depicted Pushkin, they apologized to me." But that is his version. And although Zhirinovskiy asserts that he never spent time in a Turkish jail, it was with considerable difficulty that he was rescued from the clutches of the Turkish authorities. To be sent out of a country at midnight for any reason meant, at the beginning of the seventies, the end of one's career, even if it had not begun. According to recollections of Zhirinovskiy's teachers and fellow students, before this trip he was a cheerful person and a joker, but he returned anxious and morally broken. Zhirinovskiy had no hope of any more trips abroad, even as a translator, but nonetheless he found the strength within himself to graduate from the Institute (with honors), after which he was drafted into the army for two years and sent to Tbilisi, where he served as a staff officer. Was Zhirinovskiy a Member? With his reverent attitude toward communist ideals even today, God himself willed Zhirinovskiy to be in the party, but still he remained a "nonparty communist." Why? People who know him say that he tried to enter several times, but...his grim, quarrelsome disposition and his squabbles with those around him made it impossible for him to do this even in the army where it was not difficult to enter the party, especially for an officer working in specialized propaganda. And after that, when he became a "private citizen," working in institutions where there were long waiting lists to enter the CPSU, he could not even dream about it. The fact that he was not in the party served as an excuse for him to leave the Committee for Defense of Peace, where he worked for two years as a translator after leaving the army. Zhirinovskiy and the KGB The fact that the future leader of the LDPR was not in the CPSU predetermines the answer to the question of whether or not he was a "combatant on the invisible front." At least he was not a staff worker. This required going through training in a secret KGB school, which Zhirinovskiy did not manage to do in spite of all his attraction to training. Here is what one of his former deputies and close advisers in the LDPR, Leonid Alimov, has to say about this: "I do not think he could be a KGB worker. For some reasons which only he knows, he is extremely afraid of the committee. But Zhirinovskiy has met with its workers repeatedly. When he went to Vologda and Chita during his election campaign, the first place he went was to the local KGB division." Zhirinovskiy, however, considers all discussion of his work in the KGB to be intrigues of bearded journalists and members of Democratic Russia: "They are all bedeviled by the fact that I was in neither the party nor the KGB nor the nomenklatura! This bedevils them because they themselves all came from insane asylums, jails, or out of immigration. I am a rare bird among them." Diagnosis: Political Figure Zhirinovskiy has apparently always been a "rare bird." Even as a second-year student he went to the rector of the institute with a plan for reorganizing all Eastern studies education in the USSR. They slapped him on the shoulder and sent him back to study some more. But he was not satisfied with this. "On 15 April 1967," he writes in his book, "I sent a letter to the CPSU Central Committee and in an address to the country's leaders I suggested conducting reforms in the areas of agriculture, education, and industry." In the view of psychiatric specialists who have observed Zhirinovskiy's career from the very beginning, this person needs "light psychiatric treatment or consultations with a psychoanalyst. One can state with a great deal of confidence that his difficult childhood and lack of a father were subsequently manifested in the development in the personality of delusions of grandeur and a fervor for reform. "In principle the desire to be known and the wish to reform society are not in and of themselves a manifestation of a psychological illness. But their sharply expressed form and an inclination to exaggerate indicate psychological deviations inherent in a given individual." His hysterical behavior, which is especially marked in his speeches in the Duma, and the physical violence that has begun to attract him recently are causing alarm even among his supporters. Zhirinovskiy himself when speaking with one of the authors of this article answered a question about this as follows: "I am prepared at any time to undergo an official examination of my health. I suggested having this done even before the presidential elections. Let the best doctors of Russia give a complete diagnosis from head to toe. I am ready. All these insulting tricks do not affect me." The problem, however, is that Zhirinovskiy is constantly changing his image. First he is a communist by conviction, then a democrat, first he is in favor of the State Committee for the State of Emergency, then he is against it, first he is for peace, and then he is for war.
