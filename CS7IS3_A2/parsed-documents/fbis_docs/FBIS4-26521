According to an official from the city, the central government and Jiangxi Province are spending over three billion yuan on 20 key construction projects in Jiujiang during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995). Opened to foreign ships in 1992, Jiujiang harbor has regular cargo shipping services to various parts of the world. Its airport links the city with Beijing, Nanjing and Huiyang in Guangdong Province. New air routes are being planned with regular flights to Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Haikou. A major bridge across the Chang Jiang river is being built in the city. Railway lines from Beijing to Kowloon, from Shanghai to Chongqing, and from Jiujiang to Hefei, which are all under construction, will make the city an important transportation center. With a favorable investment environment and promising potential, the city approved 144 foreign investment projects during last year alone, with an investment of 140 million U.S. dollars. To further improve its investment conditions, the city plans to invest a total of 10 billion yuan by the end of the century in such sectors as communications, telecommunications and energy.
