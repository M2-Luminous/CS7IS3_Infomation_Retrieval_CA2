To build European unity with the help of all the continent's countries, from those of EFTA [European Free Trade Association] -- which include Norway -- to those of East Europe. These latter must be free to decide independently on NATO membership -- without any vetoes from Russia -- which is partly supported by the United States, though Clinton has now softened his stances, by moving on from "if" to "when" the countries of the East can join the Atlantic alliance. I have argued the need to take account of the problems being experienced by Russia, whose intervention in the conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union are to some extent understandable. Then there is the problem of the Russian minorities, not to mention the still unresolved issue of the dismantling of nuclear weapons. These statements were appreciated by all the delegations and may have helped the Norwegians to understand that perhaps some people went too far. [Mensurati] The atmosphere was already different by the time you left. [Tremaglia] Yes, indeed. The chairman of the Norwegian parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Blankenborg, a Laborite, said: "I have no intention of taking part in a witch hunt and of persecuting someone because of his past. Mr. Tremaglia must be judged on the basis of his ideas now." He was supported in this by the daily, AFTENPOSTEN, in an editorial which stated among other things: "Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal recently said that he does not want any meetings with neofascist members of the Italian Government. Immediately afterward he went to China to shake hands with the very same people who trampled the democratic forces only a few years ago. It seems that `the name is worse than the action,' that the name `neofascist' is a greater problem than the real conditions created by `a totalitarian, barbaric, and regressively Marxist China.' This shows that we can legitimately expect to be judged on the basis of our deeds." [Mensurati] This responsible stance was also adopted by American President Clinton. [Tremaglia] The final echoes of the dispute will end with the major electoral blow that will fall on the left-wing forces in a week's time. I would say that Clinton's remarks are perfect. He said that he felt like an Italian citizen and, in view of the need for change, he said, with regard to the prime minister: "Let us allow him to work and support him." With specific reference to the AN ministers, he put an end to all speculation: "In a democracy different parties have their roots in the past, and people must be judged on what they do, not on their labels." Clinton's remarks have put an end to a passing phase, so no more interference, especially from the French president, who would do better to concern himself right now with France's serious responsibility for what is happening in Rwanda, the arms trafficking which preceded the massacre, and for which previous Italian governments also bear their share of responsibility. [Mensurati] With regard to Rwanda, two days ago the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously approved a document submitted by its chairman. [Tremaglia] There is a certain style and tradition in the Foreign Affairs Committee that I want to encourage: The nation's problems come before partisan considerations. The issue under discussion was this disastrous situation in Rwanda, and I called for the foreign minister to speak, and he promptly addressed the committee. So the first meeting was attended by Martino and his under secretaries. The proceedings were of a very high standard. Everyone approved the resolution, with no exceptions. This was a satisfying conclusion for me, from a personal viewpoint too, after some disappointments. [Mensurati] Which we will pass over... [Tremaglia] ...no, we will return to them, to express my absolute determination to fight with Italians around the world for the defense of their rights, and more besides. I very much wanted, I would say I built, this ministry for expatriate Italians, in order to set in motion a comprehensive policy involving our fellow countrymen at all levels in the media and in the field of promulgating our culture, in the field of economic cooperation, and in the field of organizations. [Mensurati] Clinton's visit to Italy was scheduled a long time ago, but nevertheless it is taking place at a time of major political developments. What is your opinion of it? [Tremaglia] The visit signifies several different things, and I will not try to evade them. It recalls the time of war, but it is an important political act, with respect to Italy too. Clinton said he is anxious to have contacts with our government. I must say that this visit also prompts a serious reflection. That is, the civil war between the nations of Europe and the civil war in Italy ended 50 years ago. So this is a great act -- in both ethical and political terms -- of reconciliation among all the European states and among the Italian people. We have always felt this need for reconciliation by paying tribute to the fallen, without partisan distinctions, and by demanding respect for the living who fought on both sides. As happened at Montecassino, where on 19 May there were not only Italians present, but representatives of all the foreign armies that fought there 50 years ago. This is the attitude with which, with great enthusiasm, I regard Clinton's arrival in Italy. He is a president that has displayed great sensitivity, the ability to understand that only within mutual respect and a solid alliance without any first- and second-class distinctions can we confront, with determination and the necessary compactness, the challenges that face us at the international level.
