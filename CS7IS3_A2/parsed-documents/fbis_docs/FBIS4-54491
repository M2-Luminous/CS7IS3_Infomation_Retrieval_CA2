Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan expressed his views on this and other Slovak foreign policy tasks in an interview for PRAVDA. [Rusko] Shortly after entering office, you expressed the view that assisting Slovakia's economy is also a task for our foreign policy. How can your department fulfill this task? [Kukan] I am convinced that highlighting the economic dimension of foreign service work is one of our most pressing tasks. Our representative offices must become more actively involved in looking for ways to help the Slovak economy. This means adopting a pragmatic and new course of action, perhaps even to the detriment of traditional diplomacy, toward these issues. Apart from emphasis on the comprehensive functioning of our diplomatic service, we are also orienting our ambassadors and other diplomats toward forging intensive contacts with business circles and the financial sphere in host countries and toward increasing the information available to potential partners. Presenting Slovakia and its domestic political situation correctly and objectively is essential because foreign investors, in considering activity in our country, want to know what they are getting themselves into and that they are making a purposeful investment. Therefore, the country's political stability is also important. [Rusko] What do you think of the stage the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) has reached? Has it not already passed its zenith? [Kukan] This question, for example, came up in discussion during my recent visit to Canada. In my opinion, the CSCE is still an important institution; it has not yet exhausted its potential. It is necessary to vitalize its activity, especially in maintaining peace on the continent and in preparing and dispatching groups of observers or delegations to areas of conflict. The CSCE can play a positive role there, even given the existence of other mechanisms. It is necessary to institutionalize its mechanisms more thoroughly. There was often a lack of consensus in decisionmaking in the past. Perhaps for this reason the impression was given that it is declining in importance. I think it could still do a great deal. [Rusko] Do you think that, in time, it could also have its own military-security structures alongside NATO and the Western European Union? [Kukan] This is highly unlikely. [Rusko] Various points of view are also being expressed about the justification for the Visegrad Four (the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia). What is your view? [Kukan] In our opinion, the Visegrad Four should continue to function as a free alliance, without establishing institutions. This alliance could be used for consultations and for coordinating certain foreign policy steps. Representatives from the individual member countries have differing views on the justification for the Visegrad Four, but, as long as the grouping exists, Slovakia will advocate that it continues to function. [Rusko] At the recent meeting involving seven presidents in Litomysl, it became apparent that there is no unanimous interpretation of the political term "Central Europe." Lech Walesa at least twice publicly expressed his opposition to using this term. Some others admitted that it is, to say the least, difficult to precisely define this term in view of the political, but especially economic, differences among the individual countries in it. What is your interpretation? [Kukan] The term "Central Europe" has not really been defined precisely. In the wake of the political changes on the continent and the eradication of political bipolarity, this term began to be employed instead of the former ideological term "East Europe." At first, international organizations began to speak about "Central and East Europe," and now they only speak about "Central Europe," but no one can say what belongs there. It is possible to speak about Central Europe as a free and, in specific instances of economic, political, and security contacts, purposefully perceived subregion of the Continent of Europe in which more intensive relations could be developed. We are interested in them, and we consider them to be a form of rapprochement with the whole of Europe. After all, our relations--for example, with the countries that belong to the European Union and with the other countries preparing for entry--have been defined. Similarly, in the security sphere, we have acknowledged the Partnership for Peace--our presentation document should be ready in the very near future--as our road toward NATO. It is unequivocal. [Rusko] However, because of these very objectives of certain countries, Russia has recently modified its stance. It has modified it with regard to the Partnership for Peace and also, it seems, with regard to NATO. What is the attitude adopted by our foreign policy toward the topical perceptions of Russian diplomacy? [Kukan] We have emphasized many times in our talks with our partners in Europe and overseas--and we concurred in this--that our interest lies in ensuring that the situation in Russia is stable and that the proreform and prodemocratic forces prevail and govern society. From this point of view, it is essential to keep on emphasizing that our interest in integration with NATO and other European structures does not mean we have any hostile intentions toward Russia. On the contrary, there is room for cooperation with Russia, especially in the economic sphere. Naturally, we see a focal point in this, but we also want to have normal mutual political relations at the level of sovereign states and corresponding to the appropriate norms of international law and diplomacy. [Rusko] We have good relations with all neighboring states; only in our relations with Hungary are certain elements of tension palpable. In your opinion, how could we get rid of this tension? [Kukan] By means of a calm, matter-of-fact, and continuous dialogue that would create a favorable atmosphere for gradually resolving the issues on which we have different views. We want to emphasize that the Slovak side is ready for such a dialogue. [Rusko] During your recent visit to the United States, you, according to the U.S. press, also discussed the sale of products from the Slovak arms industry. Could you tell our readers about the outcome of these talks? [Kukan] In this case, the reports were distorted. Within the framework of my program, I had lunch in Washington with eight representatives of the U.S. press, actually from influential dailies such as THE WASHINGTON POST, THE NEW YORK TIMES, and so on, and we spoke about all sorts of things. We also discussed arms sales; they asked me about this, and I explained to them the kind of problems we have with conversion and what the more than 90-percent reduction in production compared with 1989 has meant for Slovakia. And, within the framework of the general conversation, I told them that the government is considering a partial renewal of production and possible arms exports, but we will not export them to high-risk regions of conflict. I said this to U.S. journalists, but I did not negotiate with the U.S. side about any arms sales. [Rusko] A contingent of Pakistani troops is to come to Slovakia and will undergo training here for service in UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] units. [Kukan] I discussed these issues with UN officials during my recent visit to the United States. They assessed positively our willingness to provide this opportunity. They noted it, and Slovakia has thus scored a few points. I view this as assistance and cooperation within the framework of the United Nations. [Rusko] Since we are talking about the United Nations, has a decision been made yet on Slovakia's permanent representative, who will take over from you? [Kukan] No decision has been made yet. Someone has just been nominated; therefore, I will not mention any names. However, we envisage that he would take up his post sometime in July so that he can become familiar with the working environment and conditions in the United Nations before the start of the next UN General Assembly session in September. [Rusko] Even before you entered office, there was talk about reducing the number of Slovak representative offices. What are the prospects? [Kukan] We would not like to reduce their number. We proceed from the premise that the number of representative offices--63, these include embassies, permanent missions, consulates general, and consulates--is not many. After all, countries comparable with us perhaps have more representative offices than the Slovak Republic. We are under a great deal of pressure; it is possible that we will have to adopt some budget measures, but we want, to say the least, to maintain this number of representative offices. [Rusko] Preparing for the conference to be held at the end of May in Paris on issues concerning stability in Europe is one of the topical tasks facing our diplomatic service. What would the Slovak side like to come up with there? [Kukan] In preparing for this important event, we are proceeding from the premise that the Pact on Stability should respect the interests of all of the participants on an equal basis. There should be neither "victors" nor "vanquished" in it.
