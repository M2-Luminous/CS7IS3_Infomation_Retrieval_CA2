This way of building up border troops in Russia's federal border service is regarded as promising and makes it possible to resolve the personnel shortage to a considerable extent. By the end of this year, one in four, and in another year, one in two Russian border guards will be on contract service, an ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the press service of the Russian border troops. It is justifiable to stake on building up border troops on a contract basis, it is believed here. Those on contract service are distinguished by endurance, good discipline, and professionalism. If before they used to be sent to logistics subunits, nowadays they are entrusted with the main posts of junior commanders and service in leading specialities. According to the press service, contract servicemen are eager to go to "hot spots." They regard service at the outer borders of CIS states as prestigious and in line with Russia's national interests. According to the same source, women, too, have been enlisted in border guard service of late. There are 2,500 women in Russian border troops now.
