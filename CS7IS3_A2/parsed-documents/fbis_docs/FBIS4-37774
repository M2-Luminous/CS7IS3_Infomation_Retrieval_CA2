This remark was made today by Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, a close adviser to King Husayn in the West Bank. The senior Jordanian journalist, Sultan al-Hattab, who was in Israel last week and met Rabin and Peres, was sent here by Jordan's prime minister and stayed in al-Nashashibi's East Jerusalem home. Speaking with our Arab affairs correspondent Aharon Barne'a today, al-Nashashibi explained what lies behind the recent moves by the king: [Begin recording] [Al-Nashashibi] When Jordan found that Syria has not moved enough towards peace -- and under certain pressure from the United States and from the world opinion on Jordan to act for peace, and under certain pressure, financial and economic pressure, also pressure from the army side for more new arms -- so, these things made Jordan fasten [as heard] its steps towards peace. [Barne'a] Nasir-al-Din al-Nashashibi, today a close adviser to King Husayn, served as an adviser to the king's grandfather, King 'Abdallah, just as he was an adviser to Jamal 'Abd-al-Nasir, King Fahd, and other Arab leaders. Today, he believes, Husayn is past the stage of being angry over being left out of the picture, and decided to take the initiative and lead, as did his grandfather. [Al-Nashashibi] He has been always a man who leads. And, as I said, since 1948, his grandfather was a man of peace. He paid his life as a price for that peace, and the king is aware of this. [Barne'a, in English] Are we to witness very soon a meeting between the king, or high Jordanian officials, and high Israeli officials? [Al-Nashashibi] I think the king has no complexes. He will... [pauses] I heard yesterday that a future planned public meeting would take place in October. I doubt it. It will take place before -- if the king feels that the bell is ringing across the river and there are certain good, just, comprehensive offers that he can transfer into concrete peace agreement.
