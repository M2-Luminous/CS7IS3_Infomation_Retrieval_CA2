Lien, accompanied by his wife and several government officials, arrived at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport at 5:47 A.M., 20 minutes ahead of schedule. The Liens soon left the airport for home. The advance arrival allowed Lien to avoid an encounter with a group of opposition legislators who arrived at the airport around 6 A.M. to protest Lien's alleged illegal instructions to state-run companies to offer ruling Kuomintang [KMT] lawmakers easier access to bidding for their construction projects. Failing to meet Lien, the Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers, headed by Yen Chin-fu, said they will launch a series of demonstrations around the island to push the government to stop the practice of taking "kickbacks" among the ruling party, state-run firms and KMT lawmakers. Many ranking officials, including Foreign Affairs Minister Chien Fu, greeted Lien at the airport. During an in-flight news conference on his way from New York to Taipei, Lien said his three-country Central American tour will help strengthen the Republic of China's relations with that region. "I'm happy as I have accomplished my mission as expected," Lien told reporters who had covered his official visits to El Salvador and Guatemala. Lien said his three-day unofficial visit to Mexico was very fruitful. While there, Lien met with many Mexican political and business heavyweights for wide-ranging talks. Lien would not reveal with which Mexican officials he had talked. He instead said he had managed to meet with whomever he planned to see. Lien was the highest-ranking ROC official to visit Mexico since the two countries severed diplomatic ties 23 years ago. Lien said he is optimistic about future Taiwan-Mexico ties, particularly in the economic and cultural fields. "Mexican authorities have shown keen interest in promoting commercial, tourist and cultural exchanges with Taiwan," he said. Taiwan will benefit from boosting cooperation with Mexico as Mexico has signed the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada and has maintained close relations with Caribbean and Central American nations, Lien said.
