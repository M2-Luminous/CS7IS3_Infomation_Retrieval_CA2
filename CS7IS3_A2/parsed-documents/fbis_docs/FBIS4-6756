"We are seriously concerned about nuclear (reactor) proliferation in South Korea," said Tom Clements, Greenpeace International's plutonium campaign manager based in Washington, D.C., and chief of the Greenpeace team touring Korea since April 12. "We feel that coming from Western countries, we can share our experience and knowledge about nuclear development and wastes with the Korean people," he told a press conference at the Korea Federation of Environment Movement (KFEM) headquarters in Seoul together with five other Greenpeace representatives and Korean environmental activists. Prof. Yi Pil-ryol, representing 222 petitioners from various walks of life, questioned Seoul's support for the atomic energy industry, which he said is being abandoned worldwide due to its hazardous nature. Shaun Burnie, a nuclear campaign coordinator based in Amsterdam, said he has learned of defects in the steam generators made by Westinghouse of the United States that have been causing troubles throughout the world. Clements said in the United States, Westinghouse was being sued by 15 utilities for making faulty generators. The campaigners, who have been touring proposed reactor sites and power stations in the Southern part of the country, arrived in Inchon aboard their flagship MV Greenpeace Thursday and moved on to the capital for three days of debate, protests and other activities. They hope to meet government officials, including the prime minister, for Earth Day falling on Friday.
