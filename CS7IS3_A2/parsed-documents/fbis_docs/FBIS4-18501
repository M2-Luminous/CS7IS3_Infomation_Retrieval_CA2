If Bossi is in earnest, and I fear that he is, we will be back in the changing rooms drawing up a new team sheet." So says Clemente Mastella, resurrected on Easter Monday [4 April] ("I gave myself a period of sabbatical, but now I too am speaking out") to settle some scores, with the allies but also with his friends in the CCD [Christian Democratic Center] -- those Christian Democrats who preferred [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi to Mino Martinazzoli, [secretary of the Italian Popular Party, PPI]. It is better to settle things once and for all, firstly with Pierferdinando Casini who is so active on TV and in the press but who, without the parachute of a proportional voting system under the banner of Forza Italia, would have failed. "Look at it this way: I am the only one who was elected using the first-past-the-post voting system. The only one who got through alone, against the progressive front and against the Italian Social Movement [MSI] which both put up candidates in my constituency." So it is clear: If Bossi, the leader of the League, is the man of the north who defends the interests of the north, then Mastella, leader of the CCD, is the man of the south. Below the Garigliano river, you talk (and negotiate) with him. [Mastella] From the point of view of freedoms, there are four allies, not three. Without us, and let us be clear about this, there is no majority. [Caporale] So, Deputy Mastella, tell us what you think. [Mastella] If the regions of the south are not brought to the fore, we will not agree to enter the government. [Caporale] I do not believe it. Even you would play hard to get? [Mastella] I see and I read names that are supposed to be part of the new executive. They are all people who speak the same dialect, and that is not a good thing. I then read about plans that would appear to reduce southern Italy to a beggar's role, a parasite tugging at Italy's sleeve. I do not go along with that. [Caporale] Is it a question of seats in government? [Mastella] The makeup of the government is not decided in Milan. [Caporale] Bossi says it is. [Mastella] Bossi is wrong, very wrong. [Caporale] Why is he wrong? [Mastella] Because without the votes of my group, there is no government. There is no majority in the Senate. [Caporale] Bossi wants federalism. [Mastella] Federalism is fine, but solidarity with the weakest areas of population must not be questioned. [Caporale] So...? [Mastella] So turning off the money supply to invalid pensions is great, but at the same time we must offer other sources of income. Those pensions, in their way, are social shock absorbers. If they are eliminated once and for all, there will be an explosion of anger in the south. [Caporale] Bossi does not want Berlusconi as prime minister. [Mastella] Nor can the League ask for the position for itself, or there will be a big fuss. It is a force tied to a territory which, unluckily for it, does not correspond to the territory of Italy which remains one indivisible whole. [Caporale] Berlusconi, on the other hand... [Mastella] People voted for Berlusconi in the south because he is a popular man, and it was the leader of the alliance who won. It is our duty to respect the will of the electorate. [Caporale] Bossi says that he will have nothing to do with the MSI. [Mastella] He is irresponsible. The people have clearly stated which government they want. He is forced to respect the agreement that was made before the vote. However, I am not sure that Bossi, if he carries on like that, will be able to retain control of the group. [Caporale] But your split could endanger [President] Scalfaro. To whom should he give the job? [Mastella] To the leader of the majority. [Caporale] But is not the League the largest party in parliament? [Mastella] These considerations also depend on our decision on whether to constitute a separate group or whether to join up with Forza Italia. [Caporale] The task falls to Berlusconi, but he does not take it up because Bossi is opposed to it. Will Scalfaro have to yield? [Mastella] If the leader of the majority does not take the job, it is only right for the leader of the opposition to try. Bossi could then try and go into government with the communists. If he tries, after three months we will be voting again, but this time with a different lineup. We in the center will be finally united and associated with the Right. We will no longer need him...
