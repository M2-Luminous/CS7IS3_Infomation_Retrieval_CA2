Remember: We are the only ones who can keep the promise of federalism, regionalism, and fiscal decentralization. The others, especially the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and the Pact members, are just creating confusion. The head of the next government has one name alone: [League lower house floor leader] Roberto Maroni, and we will win almost everything in the North. In the center and south, on the other hand, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is the one who will save the day." In his first interview since the beginning of the election campaign, [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi outlined his strategy for combating the front led by the PDS. [Sorti] Bossi, tomorrow is the day of reckoning for the League. We shall at last know officially who your candidates are. Any advance news? [Bossi] There will be no big surprises. As far as I know, almost all our current deputies will be running again. [Sorti] You have been unexpectedly "betrayed" by Germontani, who has gone over to Fini. [Bossi] It came as no surprise to us. Let us not forget that the Federal Italy League was a "federalist provocation" in an environment that, in reality, was not yet ripe for federalism. [Sorti] How many constituencies do you expect to win in the North? [Bossi] More or less all of them. The League is the only road open in the North. [Sorti] Nevertheless, the election campaign in the other regions will be extremely hard-fought. What do you expect to achieve in the major cities in central Italy, where the PDS has an extremely strong network of influence? [Bossi] That is a question you should ask Berlusconi. He knows better than I do how the attack on Rome and the rest of central Italy will have to be launched. [Sorti] In other words, it is up to him. [Bossi] It is up to him because in some areas we have seen that we cannot get beyond 1-2 percent. That is where the votes that used to go to the former DC [Christian Democratic Party], which in reality no longer exists, must be drained off. [Sorti] After the election a government will have to be formed, and the League could be part of it as well. But with whom? National Alliance, for example, does not seem to be on the shortlist of potential alliesnsulates [Bossi] I confirm that. I do not believe at all that we could govern with [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fini, who suddenly pronounced himself a federalist a month ago: a quick-change act in which Fini ran the risk of losing his grass-roots support overnight. [Sorti] In its manifesto, the PDS stresses fiscal decentralization and regionalism. [Bossi] I know. That bunch think that all they need is a pinch of federalism, a pinch of privatization, and hey presto! The PDS manifesto! The truth of the matter is that nearly all of them are trying to recycle themselves as best they can, whereas people must not forget that we are the ones who provided the decisive thrust to topple the old parties like the DC and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party]. We are the real federalists and antistatists. [Sorti] But who will be prime mininster? Give us at least three names. [Bossi] Three names? I will cite only one, that of Roberto Maroni. I b. ve he would be an excellent prime minister, although he would probably suggest someone else... [Sorti] What about Berlusconi? Objections are voiced on several sides that if Berlusconi were to become prime minister, the opposition would attack him on account of his alleged "interests" as a businessman. [Bossi] We have never proposed Berlusconi as head of government. As a Milanese proverb has it, everyone should stick to his own trade. However, the qualifications required by Some of government are obvious: He must know his own mind, he must be consistent, and he must have the requisite openness. I would also add that he must not be liable to blackmail, or at least he must have no intention of being blackmailed. [Sorti] Italy has always been the country of blackmail and veto and counterveto ... [Bossi] Yes, but I solved the biggest case of veto and counterveto for Italy when I kept the DC and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni out of the two opposing poles: That was the biggest case of blackmail, the biggest ambiguity, and we were the ones who "dealt with it."
