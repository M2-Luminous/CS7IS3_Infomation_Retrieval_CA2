In an interview with Interfax Thursday, he said that the so- called "Tajik government in exile" does not present any threat to the republic's legitimate authorities. However, it will trouble the country and destabilize the social and political situation. Zukhurov said that the Dushanbe authorities are prepared for talks with both the armed and political opposition. "It is up to them to have their say," he said.
