This was stated at a briefing today by Mikhail Demurin, deputy head of administration of the Information and Press Department of the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry . "Our fundamental position is well known and remains immutable. Russia favors strengthening the regime of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons and favors transparency of nuclear programs so that no doubts or fears will arise concerning the possibility of attempts to create nuclear weaponry. It is especially important that a state which is a member of the treaty and which has an agreement with the IAEA on guarantees should honestly and consistently fulfill its obligations. If this has not been done or is not being done, then the international community has the right to react appropriately," the Russian diplomat said.
