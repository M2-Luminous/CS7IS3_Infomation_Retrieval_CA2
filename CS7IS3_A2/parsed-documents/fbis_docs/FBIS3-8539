According to Bryczkowski, we cannot have an enemy in the future president of Russia. For Zhirinovskiy's visit, he will assign 300,000,000 zloty "for Poland." "Zhirinovskiy is coming at a private invitation as a citizen of our great neighbor. He is a friend of Poland and declares this friendship at every opportunity. He will have a chance to confront what the newspapers write about him with reality," he said. One of the main aims of the visits is to be the setting up of a nongovernment commission for political and economic cooperation, which will enhance the trade exchange between Poland and Russia. Several Russian banks and several "serious" Polish banks are to be incorporated in the cooperation. "A real goods exchange would begin then," the "Self-Defense" National Front leader said. Zhirinovskiy's security will be guarded by the Misztal's private bodyguard firm as well as by a detachment of the "Self-Defense" National Front, all wearing specially purchased "nice, black uniforms." If there should be an attempt to expel Zhirinovskiy from Poland, they will be fighting against the police, the "Self-Defense" National Front leader announced. Foreign journalists who would like to have an exclusive conversation with Zhirinovskiy will have to pay $1,000 a minute.
