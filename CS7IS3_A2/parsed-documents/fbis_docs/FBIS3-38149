In his second letter, Denktas announced that the Turkish Cypriots accept in principle articles 37, 38, 42, and 43, which stipulate the transfer of Maras [Varosha] to UN administration and the opening of Lefkosa [NIcosia] Airport to traffic. In the letter, Denktas also declared that he is ready to discuss the implementation of the said articles with Greek Cypriot Administration leader Glavkos Kliridhis. In a statement to TRT, Denktas charged that Kliridhis found himself in a difficult situation after the Turkish Cypriot side announced its readiness to discuss the confidence-building measures and sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali in an attempt to alter the agenda. Denktas pointed out that Kliridhis tried to eliminate the guarantee agreements by raising the proposal to demilitarize the island. Denktas remarked that following this confusion, he asked Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy for Cyprus, to clarify the matter and therefore wrote the second letter. Denktas added: There is no sense in solving the issue through statements without sitting at the negotiating table. As we have always stated, if a picture emerges from the negotiating table to the benefit of the Turkish Cypriot people, one that guarantees the interests and security of the Turkish Cypriots in line with the stipulations of the UN secretary general and the experts' reports, then our Assembly can say yes to this. If, however, such a picture does not emerge, then we can make a reassessment. Therefore, we stated and underlined our position once more. If the negotiations are to begin, then let them.
