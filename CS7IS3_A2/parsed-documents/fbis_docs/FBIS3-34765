However, he emphasized that Riyadh is wavering in joining this order because it excludes Syria from any regional arrangements in the region. President 'Arafat proposed that a Jordanian-Palestinian-Syrian bloc be formed to impose itself on this order whose foundations were established during recent visits to Turkey by Israeli President 'Ezer Weizman and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak. 'Arafat made this disclosure at his meeting with King Husayn during his short visit to Amman on 10 February after signing the Cairo agreement with Israel. President 'Arafat asked King Husayn to exert his efforts in mediating between the PLO and Syria with the aim of rebuilding the bridges of confidence between Damascus and the PLO. A senior Palestinian official who participated in the Jordanian-Palestinian summit talks has stressed that steps have been taken toward Palestinian-Syrian reconciliation. [passage omitted]
