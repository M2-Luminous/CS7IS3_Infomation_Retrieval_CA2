During a press conference, Molina was more explicit, stating that the drug traffic has infiltrated not only the police ranks in Chihuahua, but also the banks, through money laundering, as well as the real estate business, concealing wealth produced by drug sales through the purchase of residences. He also remarked that the Attorney General's Office Internal Affairs Department will expand its action, including in its investigations socioeconomic studies of State Judicial Police agents, as well as of agents and experts from the Public Prosecutor's Office. He stressed that, after the audits to assess the integrity of the personnel and their performance in the administration of justice, an attempt will be made to prevent suspicious procedures or the drawing up of records that do not coincide with the facts. He noted that, in the investigation to be conducted of all members of the PJE, there must be consistency between what they earn and the circumstances under which they live. Their socioeconomic level will be observed, including the cost of their homes, cars, and assets in general. Returning to the topic of the drug traffic's infiltration, he commented: "It has affected various structures, and we cannot claim that this evil has been eliminated here, because it still persists." Finally, he admitted that, although Chihuahua is not a trafficking site, it is, unfortunately, one used for drug growing and production.
