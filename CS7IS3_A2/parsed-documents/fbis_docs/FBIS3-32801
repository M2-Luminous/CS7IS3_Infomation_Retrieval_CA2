The speech by the Salvadoran foreign minister centered mainly on demonstrating that the country's regime has basically changed with regard to respect for and encouragement of human rights, as proven by the testimonies of various agents designated by the United Nations, such as Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador], and the main UN and international community organs. Salaverria said that El Salvador "is the only sovereign state that has encouraged and granted facilities for international on `site' observance of the development of political events." He added that the 150 Onusal members move about freely and have all the means to fulfill their designated tasks. After admitting that during the conflict "serious violations to human rights took place," Salaverria added that today "the topic should be viewed from a realistic perspective and according to the new existing circumstances." He admitted that there is a problem of common crime due to the postwar situation. Despite all this, he said that "it should not be linked to human rights violations by the state." Salaverria gave assurances that Onusal's presence in El Salvador is the best national and international guarantee in the observance and verification of the country's human rights situation, because this is done directly and with the active presence and backing of the UN Security Council. Minister Salaverria said that El Salvador has decidedly begun consolidating peace, implementing national reconciliation, placing emphasis on a legal state, and strengthening the democratic system. On several occasions he insisted on the favorable evolution of human rights and pointed out how the administration of President Alfredo Cristiani is complying with the pledge made to the Salvadoran people and the international community. In fact, we have even gone "beyond it by giving new ideas to consolidate world peace." In this area Salaverria mentioned the National Forum for Reflection on Education and Peace Culture organized by the Salvadoran Government in April 1993, which proved to be a valuable initiative. He then added that because peace consolidation requires conceptualizing and putting it into practice, the government has made invitations to the First International Forum on Peace Culture, which will take place on 16 February in San Salvador with UNESCO [UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization] support. Numerous delegates are expected to attend. When thanking the international community for the support given to the peace negotiation and consolidation process, he warned that this support could, however, run the risk of becoming "an obstacle" if the recommendations are followed by those who intend to maintain unnecessary observation in El Salvador "when undisputable evidence has been given that peace in El Salvador is irreversible and can only become stronger." In this part of his speech, Foreign Minister Salaverria made his call for members of the UN Human Rights Commission to grant "the deserved credibility to the Salvadoran process and decide, by consensus, to remove El Salvador from its list." He pointed out that El Salvador is on its way to an election on 20 March with the participation of all political forces, without any of them being hindered, that will be witnessed by international representatives from several states and by more than 1,500 observers.
