[Docket No. CP94&hyph;284&hyph;000] Take notice that on March 14, 1994, East Tennessee Natural Gas Company (East Tennessee), Building E, Suite 424, Cross Park II, 9111 Cross Park Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37923, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;284&hyph;000 a request pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205, 157.212) for authorization to modify certain existing metering facilities under East Tennessee's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;412&hyph;000 pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.
