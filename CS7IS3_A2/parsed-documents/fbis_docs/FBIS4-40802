This was disclosed today by a spokesmen for the two sides. Vladimir (Nikonorov), a spokesman for the Russian Defense Ministry, said that the cancellation was not his ministry's fault but was due to the resolution adopted by the Russian parliament's lower house, the State Duma. In his words, the Russian Government yielded to the pressure, although the idea itself had not been rejected. Spokesman for the United States embassy in Moscow, Michael McClellan, said the joint exercises are postponed and work is currently underway to determine a fresh date. He expressed hope that these would still take place in Russia elsewhere, possibly in autumn.
