To prepare for the session, some 120 deputies from Beijing and Tianjin began a 10-day inspection tour of Beijing Municipality on 19 January. During their inspection tour, the deputies gave their views and made many suggestions on various aspects of Beijing's urban construction, economic development, and social life. The Beijing municipal government held a forum on 28 January, where principal municipal leaders heard the deputies' views and suggestions. Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Environmental Protection Committee, spoke about Beijing's urban plans and environmental protection. He said: Beijing is China's capital; it is also suffering from a water shortage. In drawing up urban industrial development plans, anything that affects water resources and the air should be restricted, not only in the city proper but also in surburban districts and counties. After more than a decade of readjustment, enterprises with serious pollution problems have been moved out of the city. The municipal government has also adopted measures to reduce pollution, such as developing centralized heating and natural gas supply systems. However, there are still a few factories producing pollution in the city proper. Qu Geping pointed out that the NPC is considering revising relevant laws and regulations to ban the use of raw coal, which produces heavy pollutants. He urged the municipality to take the lead in this regard. Many deputies also spoke about commodity prices, an issue of great concern to ordinary Chinese citizens. Qin Zhongda, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said: Municipal leaders have been personally attending to work related to the supply of grain, edible oil, and other foodstuff. Departments responsible for commodity prices have also done a tremendous amount of work. With the approaching of the Spring Festival, a traditional Chinese holiday, the government has indicated that prices will be controlled during the holiday season. What will happen after the holiday season? He expressed confidence in the government to do a good job in this regard, but he also urged it to keep the size of price increases under control for a protracted period. Other deputies also gave their views on issues of science and technology, education, and reduction of the peasants' burden. At the forum, Chen Xitong, responsible person of the municipal government, thanked the deputies for giving their views and making suggestions. In response to the questions raised and criticism made by the deputies, he said: The municipal government will seriously study solutions and will see to it that everyone of the questions is answered. Taking the questions raised by the deputies seriously in order to resolve them is an important expression of socialist democracy.
