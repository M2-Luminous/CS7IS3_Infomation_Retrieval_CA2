FR940812-1-00027 FR940812-1-00007 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Parts 1312 and 1314 [Ex Parte No. 444] Electronic Filing of Tariffs AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). ACTION: Notice of Postponement of Action in the Establishment of a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. SUMMARY: The ICC announces that it will postpone, until after October 1, 1994, any further action to establish an Electronic Tariff Filing (ETF) Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (Reg-Neg Committee). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James W. Greene, (202) 927&hyph;5597, or Charles E. Langyher, III, (202) 927&hyph;5160. TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In a notice published May 24, 1994 (59 FR 26777), we requested public comments by June 23, 1994, on the initial selections for membership on the ETF Reg-Neg Committee. Several comments were received suggesting changes in the composition of the Committee. Subsequent to the notice and comments, however, legislation was introduced in the Senate 1 that would materially affect the work of the ETF Reg-Neg Committee by largely eliminating the motor carrier tariff filing requirement. Additionally, the House of Representatives voted not to fund the Commission for Fiscal Year 1995, while the Senate approved a 31% reduction in the Commission's Fiscal Year 1995 appropriation. 1 S. 2275, The Trucking Industry Regulatory Reform Act of 1994. In light of the potential impact of these actions on motor carrier tariff filing requirements, we believe we should await the outcome of Congressional deliberations on these matters before proceeding further with ETF. Depending upon the action Congress takes with respect to the Commission's appropriation and S. 2275, the Commission will determine whether the Reg-Neg Committee approach continues to be appropriate for addressing ETF issues, whether the composition of the Reg-Neg Committee should be modified to reflect changed tariff filing requirements, or whether the Commission should proceed with ETF at all. Environmental Statement This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources. Decided: August 1, 1994. By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, Commissioners Simmons and Morgan. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
