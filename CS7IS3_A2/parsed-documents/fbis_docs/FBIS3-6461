He said the embassy always takes precautionary measures but Thai police have not assigned extra reinforcements to guard the embassy. "Reinforcements are at the discretion of the police," he said. The embassy is located in Soi Langsuan. Police suggested earlier in the day that the explosives could have been designed to avenge the massacre last month at Hebron on the West Bank. "But it could be the embassy was selected at random. The incident may be connected with the problems in the South. Whatever it is, the result could have been a major disaster," he added. The embassy has reported the finding of the explosives to Jerusalem. "This is standard practice in these circumstances," he said.
