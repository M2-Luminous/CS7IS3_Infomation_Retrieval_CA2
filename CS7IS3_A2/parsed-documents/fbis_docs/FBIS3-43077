Published information on the following topics was examined: the role of the hypothalamus and extrahypothalamic structures (the hippocampus, tonsils, septum, and reticular formation); the role of the adrenergic, seritoninergic, and cholinergic systems of the hypothalamus-reticulum-limbic complex; the role of neuropeptides; and delta-sleep inducing peptide [DSIP] and its biological role. In addition, the regulation of the pituitary-adrenal system and the functional activity and intercenter interrelationship of the structures of the brains in a stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior and the effects of corticosteroids and DSIP were examined in a study of 982 adult male rats. The rat studies established that the development of aggressive-defensive behavior results in a marked restructuring of the functional activity of the hypothalamic-reticular-limbic structures and cerebral cortex, as well as in a change in the nature of intercenter interrelationships that correlate with a change in the content of corticosterone and DSIP in blood plasma. Specifically, the stressed state of aggressive-defensive behavior was accompanied by an elevation of corticosterone level from 12.29 +/- 0.5 to 126.1 +/- 1.5 mmol/l and a decrease in DSIP from 388.1 +/- 41.06 to 242.3 +/- 31.88 fmol/l. Also during aggressive-defensive behavior, the bioelectric activity of the rats' brains manifested a change in theta-rhythm spectrum, the integral strength of which (in ï¿½V/s) in the hippocampus rose from 18.8 +/- 3.6 (background) to 6.1 +/- 5.9. Theta-activity in the hippocampus thus increased from 31 to 54 percent. In the ventromedial hypothalamus theta-activity increased from 17 to 43 percent, and in the reticular formation of the midbrain it increased from 31 to 37 percent (this change was coupled with increases in respiration and heart rates). The correlation between DSIP level and corticosterone level during aggressive-defensive behavior was seen as especially noteworthy. Exogenous injection of DSIP against the background of advanced stress resulted in myorelaxation and elimination of aggression. Injection of DSIP before the development of aggressive-defensive behavior led to a decrease in corticosterone level from 12.29 +/- 0.5 to 9.64 +/- 0.7 mmol/l and to a less pronounced increase in the level of corticosterone in the rats' blood plasma after the onset of aggressive-defensive behavior than occurred without the injection of DSIP. New data regarding the structurofunctional organization of the inhibitory process under the effect of DSIP during aggressive-defensive behavior and the significant integration of nervous and hormonal factors in the mechanisms of its development were also obtained. DSIP was determined to function as a natural tranquilizer that increases resistance to stress. References 80: 19 Russian, 61 Western.
