A Yankee president must make everyone happy. He must benefit the strong, and obtain the votes of the weak; make concessions to senators and representatives who defend opposing interests; always smile and give a good image of a democratic man, which in many cases has nothing to do with his political ideas. He must also adapt himself to the workings of Washington, which has more than 200 years of experience and tradition. That situation explains why almost all U.S. presidents have more success with foreign affairs than with domestic policies. When they do not achieve even that, they are practically banished, as in the case of Jimmy Carter, who is not even invited to speak at Democratic Party conventions. Another thing that could happen is what happened to George Bush. Bush harvested victories in foreign policies, many of which were not directly his own. We could mention the collapse of the socialist bloc, the Panama invasion, the Gulf War, et cetera, but despite all that, he was not reelected in the 1992 elections. The domestic economy played a dirty trick on him: The country entered a recession and he lost. An almost unknown Democratic governor from Arkansas named William Clinton took the White House, which he has now occupied for approximately a year. Clinton has not been the exception, and during his first year in office, achieved more success with foreign affairs than with domestic policies. This is logical: The challenges that any U.S. president today faces are greater inside the country than abroad. On the foreign plane, Clinton has achieved the Israeli-Palestinian peace treaty; ratification of the Free Trade agreement; a favorable solution for the United States in the Uruguay Round's General Accord on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]; and, just recently, was able to get NATO to accept and control the former members of the Warsaw Pact; the Ukraine to commit itself to eliminating its nuclear weapons; Belarus to continue in that process; and Syria agree to negotiate an effective peace agreement with Israel. All these achievements indicate a strong foreign policy that benefits U.S. interests and Clinton's image. Nevertheless, his popularity rating is very low. Could it be that the U.S. people today realize that very few dare to contradict the wishes of the empire and that the victories are really not so numerous as they would like them to believe. Clinton has acquired a budget from Congress that could probably allow him to reduce the deficit with time, but he did not obtain the $16 billion for the creation of new jobs at a moment when there were more than 10 million people unemployed and the economy barely showing symptoms of recovery. To obtain approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, Clinton had to make concessions to several senators and representatives. It is yet to be seen if he will obtain the approval needed for his health care plan. What is even more important is for Clinton to take the first steps toward revitalizing the U.S. economy, which is in need of structural change. Personally, I wish no evil to President Clinton. He does not seem to be a bad person, but as with every U.S. president, he must play the game that the imperial "establishment" imposes, whether he likes it or not. Clinton has not been the exception. It appears from its attempts to discredit him, creating problems by accusing him of being unfaithful to his wife and of shady business deals in Arkansas, that the extreme right fears him. His first year in office has therefore concluded with some glories and some sorrows. So far, he has proven to be a capable man within the system. What he does from this point on will influence his chances for reelection in 1996. Only time will tell.
