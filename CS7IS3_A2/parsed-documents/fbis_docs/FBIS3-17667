In an interview with INTERFAX in Minsk, Lukashenko said his commission had evidence that the prime minister was trying to "syphon off part of government resources to commercial banks." The official also maintains that Kebich started his unofficial election campaign six weeks ago by suspending local subsidies and agreeing after private meetings to provide them with regional administrators in exchange for a promise to back his candidacy. Lukashenko also said that the Prime Minister had already set up his own election office on the basis of existing government structures.
