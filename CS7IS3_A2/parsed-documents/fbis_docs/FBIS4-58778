Following the meeting, al-Dali stated that the urgent meeting of the Arab League Council is a positive step toward solving the Yemeni crisis. He said he hopes the meeting will stop the bloody war between northern and southern Yemeni troops in good time. He added that the YSP supports any step the brothers at the Arab League take and the Egyptian initiative on Yemen. Al-Dali said the current infighting in Yemen is not a domestic but rather a pan-Arab affair, adding that the YSP will demand Arab assistance if the Yemeni parties fail to stop the fighting. Touching on the Egyptian proposal to send Arab peace-keeping forces to Yemen, al-Dali remarked that the YSP will welcome this if it becomes necessary, even if Yemeni leaders refuse to stop fighting. He appealed to all Yemeni leaders and brothers in Egypt and other Arab states to take action to end the ongoing fighting in Yemen.
