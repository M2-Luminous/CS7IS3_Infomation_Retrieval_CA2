Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-26JAN94-CHINA-PAKISTAN Bhutto Visit Highlights Expanding Sino-Pakistani Ties SUMMARY Recent high-level exchanges between China and Pakistan, including a late December visit to Beijing by Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, indicate that, despite its ongoing efforts to improve relations with India, Beijing is continuing to expand its bilateral relations with Pakistan, strengthening both economic and military ties. END SUMMARY The 27-29 December "official goodwill" visit to China by Prime Minister Bhutto served to underscore Beijing's commitment to Pakistan. Meeting with Bhutto on 28 December, Premier Li Peng, for example, reaffirmed the "importance" China attaches to its "friendly and cooperative ties" with Pakistan (Xinhua, 28 December). He went on to assure Bhutto of China's continued friendship, stating that "whatever changes take place in the world, China will remain Pakistan's trusted friend and continue to develop good-neighborly ties" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993). Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin also underscored Beijing's commitment to Islamabad at his meeting with Bhutto on the 28th, hailing the Sino-Pakistani relationship as having "stood the test of time" as "an example" for "relations between countries with different social systems" (Xinhua, 28 December 1993). Focus on Economic Cooperation Reflecting the continuing expansion of economic ties, the visit was capped by the signing of five bilateral agreements, including an agreement for economic and technological cooperation, an accord extending the border trade agreement between the two countries, road transport and water resource cooperative accords, and an agreement to establish sister relations between Pakistan's Punjab and China's Jiangsu provinces (Xinhua, 28 December 1993). Calling for the further expansion of bilateral economic relations Li, at his meeting with Bhutto, said that two countries should "seek more ways," including more exchanges between enterprises and setting up of more joint ventures, to "boost" their ties and indicated that the Chinese Government was "encouraging" PRC companies to "invest" in Pakistan (Xinhua, 28 December 1993). During a five-day official visit to Pakistan earlier in December, Politburo Standing Committee member Li Ruihuan had suggested that Beijing may be planning to give more aid to Pakistan, noting in an interview with the Pakistani press--carried by Xinhua on the 6th--that China "may provide more assistance" if China's economy "develops at a faster pace" (Xinhua, 6 December 1993). Military Cooperation There are also signs that the two countries are continuing to expand their military ties. Reflecting this trend, Xinhua on 1 December reported that Gen. Zhang Wannian, Chief of the General Staff of the PLA, and his host Pakistani Defense Minister Af tab Shaban Mirani discussed the "mutual cooperation between the armed forces" of the two countries during Zhang's visit. In another indication of their deepening military ties, the two sides also signed an agreement during Zhang's visit granting Chinese "credits" to Pakistan for the "procurement of defense equipment" (Xinhua, 4 December 1993).
