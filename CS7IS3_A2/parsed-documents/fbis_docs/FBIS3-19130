German Deputy Peter Reuschenbach greeted the rally. Here is a report by Mimoza Cika: [Cika] With their participation today in the protest under the leadership of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] branch, all Albanians who live and work in Germany showed that they are living proof of the national and political determination and devotion. LKD Branch Chairman Afiz Gagica addressed the demonstrators and stressed the motto of this protest. Mr. Peter Reuschenbach, chairman of the parliamentary group to the German Bundestag for Albania, also greeted the demonstrators. Various representatives of high-level German organizations and bodies also greeted the rally participants. The petitions addressed to the high-level German authorities are based on the main demands to stop the violence and the Serbian systematic state terror against the Albanian population in Kosova and to prevent the eruption of an armed conflict in the Republic of Kosova by withdrawing the armed police forces from the Republic of Kosova. They also asked Germany and the united international states to recognize the independence of the Republic of Kosova.
