In a speech at the outset of a conference on the trade and economic aspects of developments in Central and East Europe, which is organized by the Washington-based organization European Institute, Shifter said that this group would be headed by Under Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff. Shifter, who is director for Central and East Europe in the National Security Council, declared that the formation of this group was the result of an overall revision of U.S. foreign policy carried out after the accession of Bill Clinton's administration. Following this analysis of foreign policy, it was decided that special attention must be paid to Central and East Europe, Shifter said, and stressed the significance of the success of political and democratic reforms in this region for the United States. At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that no new financial resources from the U.S. budget could be expected in support of cooperation with Central and East Europe. The main issue is how to make optimal use of existing funds, Shifter said, and stressed, in particular, support of the private sector. The decision to form the group for Central and East Europe was made about two weeks ago and is to meet for the first time within the next few days, Richard Shifter told CTK. All important departments of the U.S. Administration will be represented in this group, including the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and Agriculture. The conference on Central and East Europe organized by the European Institute is attended also by Czech Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy.
