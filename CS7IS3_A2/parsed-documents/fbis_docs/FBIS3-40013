In a statement to the Bundestag Budget Committee, Mr. Goehner parliamentary state secretary in the FRG Economics Minister, stressed that the originally agreed goal of completing 36,000 apartments by the end of 1994 is not in danger as far as one can say at the moment. Goehner said that Burlakov's repeated accusations are due to his duty to care for his soldiers. According to the Russian Defense Ministry, about 220,000 apartments for soldiers are currently missing, and Germany's contribution is just alleviating the problem. According to Goehner, some interim building deadlines have not been observed. The delays are three months at the most. The biggest delays happened in 1992. According to the state secretary, 15,000 apartments are finished. In total, the Federal Government provides 8.35 billion marks, with which at least 45,000 apartments in 40 building sights, including all technical and social infrastructure are being built. In addition, two housing construction combines and about 20 factories for building and equipment materials are part of the program.
