Valentin Stoyanov, spokesman for the president, informed the journalists that, during the talks, the situation in the Balkans was discussed, and more specifically, the situation in former Yugoslavia. The Bulgarian head of state again confirmed our steady position regarding the observance of the embargo and declared that an incident such as the one with the Khan Kubrat vessel is not something strange against the background of the situation that exists at present in the Balkans. We suffer not only because of the economic losses related to the embargo, but also because of the emergence of such forces, which act in a provocative manner against Bulgaria's interests, the president said. Prior to his departure Mr. Poos gave a news conference, at which he summarized the results of his meetings with President Zhelev, Deputy Prime Ministers Evgeni Matinchev and Valentin Karabashev, and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. [Begin Poos recording in French fading into Bulgarian translation read by the announcer] This was a bilateral visit, but it immediately engulfed all European subjects, which were invoked in all the talks. We witnessed Bulgaria's ambition to most rapidly join the European structures, which was evident in all the talks I had here. I have the opinion that the steps related to ratifying the trade agreement with the European Union and the reform in your legislature, that already began, will facilitate this process, Mr. Poos said. He stressed that the protocol on the agreement to exchange the ratification documents, that was signed at the Foreign Ministry, will give an impetus to developing bilateral relations between Bulgaria and Luxembourg.
