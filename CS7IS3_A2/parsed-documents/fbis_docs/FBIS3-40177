This reform has now been basically completed; in terms of the ministerial-level bureaucracy, the numbers of department- and bureau-level units and division-level units have been reduced from 15 and over 90 to 12 and over 60 respectively, and the number of functionaries has been reduced from 577 to 320. Those office workers and department, bureau, and division-level cadres rendered surplus have all been placed. The new Ministry of Chemical Industry has begun to function in accordance with the new functional requirements. The former Ministry of Chemical Industry managed over 6,000 chemical enterprises and institutions at the county level or above in the chemical industry system. The ministry was not only responsible for approving chemical projects and allocating materials and funds, but also responsible for making production plans of enterprises; even plans and arrangements concerning enterprises' equipment overhauls were made by the ministry. The scope of management was excessive, and management was carried out in an overly detailed manner. The new Ministry of Chemical Industry will not only manage the previous chemical sector, but also manage, in a comprehensive manner, the chemical industry which consists of different sectors such as the petrochemical, coal chemical, salt chemical, and refined product chemical sectors and enterprises of different ownership statuses such as foreign-funded chemical enterprises and township chemical enterprises. Even since its establishment, it has broken away from the traditional views and practices characterized by intervention in enterprises' production and business activities, and has instead concentrated on macro-level management. For instance, the chemical industry production planning conference, recently gathered by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, was mainly devoted to analyzing the situation of the chemicals market next year, inviting the comrades in charge of the relevant ministries and commissions to discuss what chemical materials provided by the chemical industry their respective sectors would need and how much of each material they would need, and then making macrolevel production plans for the next year on the basis of market demand. The practice, prevalent at the previous years' production planning conferences, of haggling over plan targets with directors of chemical industry departments or bureaus of the localities, resulting in the Ministry of Chemical Industry being eventually forced to impose plans on its subordinates, was changed. According to a source, this year's plan, made by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in view of market demand and the actual situation of enterprises, was based on the superior's working in concert with its subordinates and was deeply welcomed by the localities and various quarters. Leading comrades of many localities said that this change on the part of the Ministry of Chemical Industry was not only conducive to making production in line with demand, but also conducive to adjusting the product structure of the chemical industry and improving economic efficiency, and that thus the change had won profound support from the people and enterprises. In the process of transforming the function of government, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has given particular emphasis to providing services for the "two ends," providing services both for the localities and enterprises and for foreign businesses. Since its establishment, the new Ministry of Chemical Industry has dispatched investigation groups to conduct investigation at the grass roots on many occasions, and has also held symposiums of various kinds so as to hear enterprises' appeals and demands and to keep enterprises informed, thereby helping enterprises resolve a series of practical problems in development. With the rapid development of our national economy, some large chemical enterprises abroad have been shifting their attention to China in terms of their investment plans. In view of this development, the Ministry of Chemical Industry informed enterprises of the said situation in a timely manner, and informed foreign businesses of the state of development of chemical industry across China, thereby making the two sides very happy. Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has signed comprehensive cooperation agreements with 12 large chemical companies such as Japan's Asahi Chemical Industries, Eastman Chemical Company of the United States, and Germany's Bayer AG and the Economics Ministry of the Netherlands, and has signed project cooperation agreements with General Electric of the United States and Germany's BASF AG, involving 122 projects of exploratory activity and cooperation. Recently, the ministry also signed agreements with the Mexican Government on economic and technological cooperation on petrochemical and chemical industries. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has so far signed joint-venture contracts worth a total of $230 million and joint-venture intention agreements involving a total of $800 million with foreign businesses.
