Augustin Ngbanda, President Kolingba's former secretary of state for public security, and Joseph Kanda "reportedly masterminded acts of social and political agitation, as well as creating pockets of social tension in some districts of Bangui," Claude Dobanga, minister of interior and national security, asserted. The RDC did not react to these accusations today. On 6 March, Dobanga denounced "the detention of weapons of war and the organization of pockets of tension in some districts of the capital by certain dignitaries of the former regime." According to the minister, this situation resulted in the carrying out of "attacks against foreigners, with technical assistants as the innocent targets." Early February, two other RDC members, Lamido Daouda Ibrahim and Mahamat Salle, were arrested and detained at the gendarmerie, according to informed sources. The two men, the president and secretary general of the Central African Republic's National Association of Livestock Breeders, were accused of distributing weapons to the Zaraguinas, a local nickname given to "armed robbers." In the middle of January, the government had announced "coercive measures" against the Zaraguinas who were stealing, looting, and kidnapping travelers and livestock breeders on the roadside.
