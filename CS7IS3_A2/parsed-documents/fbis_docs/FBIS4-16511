What they could do though, was uphold President Nazarbayev's proposal for the creation of a Eurasian union. According to Suleymenov, economics must in the long run prevail over politics. In its present shape the Commonwealth of Independent States failed to work. The 400-plus agreements between its members were disregarded. But if two or three or four republics interested in cooperation formed a Eurasian union, the union would work. Suleymenov said that although many were afraid that the creation of supranational organizational structures would infringe on their sovereignty, Kazakhstan had no fears of that. And just because it was not afraid of that, President Nazarbayev launched his call for a Eurasian union. In the foreseeable future all Commonwealth republics would -- one after another -- uphold the Kazakh initiative. Although some failed to see working models for cooperation, Suleymenov said, such models did exist and there was no need for inventing them from the scratch. The European Union, with its concerted customs and economic policies, and transnational banks and payments, set an example to follow. The emergence of a partnership on the order of the European Union would, among other things, resolve the problem of dual citizenship. A person who wanted to change citizenship would be welcome to do so. According to Suleymenov, there was no wise alternative to the creation of a Eurasian union. The former Soviet republics would never be able to separate. They needed each other. And even now, they showed a higher degree of integration that the member-nations of the European Union. So, concluded Suleimenov, what they had to do, was join forces. They broke up only to join forces on a new foundation.
