The nations involved are India, Hong Kong, Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Panama, Egypt, Algeria and Kazakhstan. An official said that the countries are expected to attract more investment from Korean companies. As of the end of last June, Korean firms had invested an estimated $365 million in the 10 countries. Domestic companies are expected to be active in investment in India in the wake of Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's visit to Seoul last September, the official said. With Hong Kong, Korea should take action after 1997 when the island state will be handed over to China, he said, adding that there has been no investment pact signed by the two sides although Korea and China concluded a similar pact last year. Mexico is important as it is a member of the three-nation North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) put into effect Jan. 1 this year. Mexico without investment guarantee pacts with foreign countries due to a constitutional ban is seeking such pacts to attract foreign investment, he said. The agreement with Argentina will be signed soon as obstacles have been brushed away, the official said. The government is also seeking an agreement with Kazakhstan as domestic companies are eager to invest in the country which has a large number of ethnic Koreans. Korea has concluded investment protection pacts with 24 countries and initialed them with eight.
