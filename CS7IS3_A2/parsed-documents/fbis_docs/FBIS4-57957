Vicente Briceno has the story: [Begin recording] [Briceno] Alvarez reported that Transportation and Communication Minister Cesar Quintini Rosales still heads that ministry, but Quintini, who was at Miraflores Palace apparently attending a Council of Ministers meeting on 25 May, refused to deny reports of his alleged removal from the cabinet. Alvarez noted that any governmental change is the decision of the president alone, thereby explaining that ministers are not hired, nor do they buy their posts. The OCI chief rejected the existence of any ambiguity as a result of the division in the economic cabinet by ironically stating that the only division at the Council of Ministers is Defense Minister Division General Rafael Montero. [Alvarez] There were rumors on a subject inherent to the president: the change, dismissal, or removal of ministers. No one else can make this decision. Therefore, these are unofficial rumors. [Briceno] Despite the OCI director's statements, it is a fact that President Caldera could be thinking about revamping the executive cabinet. [end recording]
