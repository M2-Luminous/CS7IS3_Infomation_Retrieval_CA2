FBIS3-39227 "drweu031__a94011" FBIS-WEU-94-031-A Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 ANNEX Inter-European Affairs EC Nuclear Safety Projects `Top Priorities' BR1102160594 Brussels RAPID Database in English 10 Feb 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY BR1102160594 Brussels RAPID Database Language: English Article Type:BFN [EC Document No. DOC/IP/94/108: "Commission Confirms There Is No Delay in Eastern Nuclear Safety Projects"] [Text] Ensuring the safety of nuclear reactors in Russia, the Ukraine and parts of East Europe continues to be one of the top priorities of the European Commission's assistance program, PHARE [Economic recovery project for Poland and Hungary] and TACIS [Technical assistance to CIS]. These safety programs, which are in the interests of both the local populations and of West Europe, have led the Commission to commit ECU275 million for a variety of projects including the sending of EU nuclear experts on permanent on-site missions at six Russian and two Ukrainian plants. Since the beginning of this and other international assistance programs, the question of liability in the case of accidents has been an issue. Internationally the Paris and Vienna Conventions deal with the question of liability by making the country where the plants are located responsible in the case of accidents. Neither Russia nor the Ukraine are members of these conventions. In order to allow their safety programs to move forward, the main international donors such as the EU and the United States have negotiated arrangements to cover liability with the Russian authorities. For example, U.S. Vice President Gore reached an agreement with the Russian authorities during his December 1993 visit to Moscow. In the summer of 1993 the European Commission arranged with the Russian authorities that Russia would accept liability for all TACIS projects currently underway. Therefore, contrary to press reports today, there is no delay in the projects which were launched in 1993. These are proceeding according to plan. However, the current EU-Russia arrangements do not cover the next stage in the program which will include the supply and installation of hardware. Therefore the Commission has been negotiating with the relevant authorities in order to extend the areas for which they will be responsible. The position of the Commission is that the Russian authorities should accept liability for work carried out in their plants since this is international practice and will become the rule as soon as Russia and Ukraine join the Paris and Vienna conventions. The Russian authorities are currently considering a proposal tabled by the Commission in Moscow at the beginning of February. This proposal was discussed yesterday with the European industry. The Commission is keeping in close contact with other international donors such as the United States and the multilateral nuclear safety fund set up on the initiative of the G-7 in order to find an acceptable solution to this problem of liability.
