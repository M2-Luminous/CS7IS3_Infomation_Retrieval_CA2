At a press conference before his departure for Hungary Mr. Klaus Kinkel said his talks in Sofia were fruitful and focused mainly on bilateral relations, Bulgaria's striving to integration with the European structures and the situation in the former Yugoslavia. This morning Mr. Kinkel had talks with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov and was received by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. Mr. Kinkel invited the Bulgarian foreign minister to visit Germany. "Mr. Kinkel's visit has inspired us with fresh hope in our striving to integration with the European structures and with courage to push with the economic reform", said Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. "Germany wishes to help Bulgaria on its difficult road of reform", German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said. He specified, however, that this may be help for self help. Mr. Kinkel said the same in Albania. "As a friend I would like to advise Bulgaria to make itself more attractive". Mr. Kinkel said. He added that Germany would continue its support for Bulgaria, as well as for the Central European states, especially after June 1, when it will take over the presidency of the European Union. Bulgaria may count on Germany's support in its striving to integration with the European Union, GATT, NATO and the organization to succeed the Cocom [Coordination Committee For Multilateral Export Controls], as well as in the establishment of relations of association with the Western European Union. Mr. Kinkel discussed in Sofia the situation in the former Yugoslavia and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] and Kosovo in particular. "It is necessary for Serbian suppression measures to cease there", Mr. Kinkel said, stressing the solutions offered by the peace plan which would also affect Kosovo. German Foreign Minister Kinkel believes that a solution should be found to the disputes between Macedonia and Greece and that Greece should lift the embargo it has imposed on Macedonia. In Sofia Mr. Kinkel also discussed the events in Gorazde. "Serbian attacks on Gorazde are unacceptable", the German foreign minister said. He added that the solution depends to a great extent on Russian influence on the Serbs.
