He deserves such a punishment. For a while, some criminals have resorted to using violence and terrorist acts to hijack Chinese civilian passenger aircraft to Taiwan, thus seriously endangering aircraft passengers' lives and property, jeopardizing flight safety, and creating abominable influences on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as throughout the world. Hijacking civilian aircraft is a terrorist act that seriously threatens people's lives and safety. This kind of act is in violation of Chinese law, and all countries and regions throughout the world consider it a serious crime and impose stern punishments on plane hijackers. International conventions in this regard contain stipulations for dealing with plane hijackings; all countries and regions of the world have the obligation to crack down on aircraft hijackings. Why have aircraft hijackings occurred so frequently across the Taiwan Strait? By recalling the few aircraft hijackings over the last few years, any person with a sense of justice and without political prejudice can see that the reason why plane hijackings have occurred so frequently is simply because of the Taiwan authorities' connivance with and giving unprincipled protection to hijackers. It is simply the Taiwan authorities' giving unprincipled protection to aircraft hijackers that has finally resulted in abominable consequences, and these abominable consequences have not only brought suffering to some mainland people but have also brought misfortune to some Taiwan compatriots. On 2 October 1992, Jiang Xiaofeng attempted to hijack a plane to Taiwan. This resulted in a disaster that killed 128 people, including 30 Taiwan compatriots; that injured 53 people, and that destroyed three planes. Zhuo Changren and his partners, who hijacked a plane to Korea in May 1983 and who were later received by Taiwan, joined the black society in Taiwan and kidnapped and killed a man, thus posing a danger to the people in Taiwan. This incident also proves that aircraft hijackings have also brought misfortune to Taiwan compatriots. As for the issue of how mainland hijackers of aircraft are treated, although the Taiwan authorities have changed their attitude of considering plane hijackers to be "anticommunist heroes" and have sentenced the criminals Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai, who hijacked a plane to Taiwan on 6 April 1993, to 10 years in prison and have sentenced the plane hijackers Zhang Wenlong, Yang Mingde, and Han Fengying to six to nine years in prison; and although Taiwan's procuratorate has demanded that some other mainland plane hijackers be sentenced to 12 years or more in prison, these sentences, as has been pointed out by Taiwan's media, are too lenient for such serious crimes, even when using Taiwan's "law" as the criterion. The Taiwan authorities' arguments for refusing to repatriate plane hijackers not only cannot not hold water but also are ridiculous. One of their arguments is the so-called "humanitarian considerations." In fact, plane hijackers use passengers as hostages in an attempt to serve their evil purposes, thus seriously jeopardizing passengers' lives and flight safety. Therefore, only the stern punishment of criminal hijackers of aircraft can ensure passengers' safety, which is truly humanitarian. Another thing is that, in dealing with plane hijackers, the Taiwan authorities still focus on the motive for the crime, thinking that, objectively speaking, the hijackers' cases deserve sympathy. Actually, in a society ruled by law, the decision concerning any crime should be strictly based on the facts of the crime. Moreover, according to the investigations conducted by our departments concerned and by the Taiwan police, some criminal aircraft hijackers were people who were on the run for embezzling public funds, some were habitual gamblers who were on the run because of their inability to pay their gambling debts, some were people who ran away from paying their business debts, some were suspects in major burglaries, and some were people who hoped to go to Taiwan to get rich and enjoy themselves. Not only some people with insight and the news media of Taiwan have denounced all these practices of the Taiwan authorities. Taiwan's police and procuratorial authorities, who have handled the various plane hijackings, have also have been bothered by the frequent hijackings and have openly suggested to the Taiwan authorities that "plane hijackers be sent back to the mainland after they are tried," saying that "otherwise, the evil trend will never be stopped." Our opinion is that to fundamentally solve the problem of hijacking planes to Taiwan and to reduce aircraft hijackings to the minimum or to completely prevent such incidents from occurring, the most direct and effective way is for the Taiwan authorities to repatriate and hand over all criminal hijackers to the mainland. Here is something that is noteworthy: In their working consultations, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation have reached a common understanding -- that is, plane hijackers across the strait must be repatriated. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will sincerely put aside the political and legal problems that cannot be solved for the time being and, with a pragmatic attitude, find a way that is acceptable to both sides so that an agreement on repatriating plane hijackers can be reached at an early date. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will make practical efforts to thoroughly prevent plane hijackings across the Taiwan Strait. Only by doing so can the Taiwan authorities make themselves not guilty both to history and to compatriots on both sides of the strait.
