Under the plan, foreign companies will be able to handle cargo at Chinese ports and operate some inland and coastal shipping routes. Huang Zhendong, Minister of Communications, said it will bring China's marine shipping policies in line with international norms. He said overseas shipping firms will be allowed to handle cargo at Chinese ports open to foreign vessels, and to operate shipping lines to and from the ports with approval. "Upon endorsement, they can even run joint ventures to handle shipping on coastal routes or inland rivers," he said. However, the Chinese partner must have a majority stake in the company and hold senior and legal posts. Vessels must also be approved by the ministry and fly Chinese flags. Foreign firms can set up wholly-owned agencies to canvass cargo, issue documents and negotiate contracts for their ships. But such agencies will be unable to serve domestic waterways, Huang said. By the end of last year, 190 firms were engaged in international shipping in China, 56 of which were Sino-foreign joint ventures with an aggregate capacity of 21.8 million DWTs (dead weight tons). Three foreign independent subsidiaries two from the U.S. and one from Norway, have received the right to handle agent services for their fleet. Huang also promised a favourable environment and increased transparency to entice investment into docks and roads. "We have drafted provincial rules governing the use of foreign investment in highway and waterway construction," he said, but declined to say when they would be released. He said foreign businesses are being encouraged to start joint or wholly-owned ventures to build wharves and construct and operate highway projects. But Chinese must have a majority share in joint ventures that build public docks vital to the national economy. Huang also said the ministry will present a list in the near future of infrastructure projects that promise high economic returns and are in line with State industrial policies. Foreign investors have built container or chemicals terminals in Nanjing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenzhen, while more projects are under discussion. Huang praised Guangdong as being the vanguard in the country's use of foreign investment in highway construction. The province has entered contracts or letters of intent with a total foreign pledged input of $3.5 billion. But at the moment China is attracting the most money in the form of foreign loans. Since 1980, the ministry has utilized about $2.5 billion in loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank, and 290 billion yen in loans from the Japanese Government.
