(Djemal Nazzar) reports: [Begin recording] [(Nazzar)] The UGTA is meeting the national federations of all the sectors. The meeting is taking place to assess, coordinate, and make preparations for the congresses of some federations. This meeting, the first of its kind, has come late, according to the UGTA secretary general, in view of the UGTA's many national activities, particularly its participation in talks with the government, contributions to the political dialogue, and participation in the national concord [wifaq] conference. The secretary general briefed the trade union cadres on the results of the conference; he also talked about the role of the workers in the transitional phase. [Benhamouda] Our role as the General Union of Algerian Workers is naturally to contribute to strengthening and supporting the state. However, what is important to us is rebuilding the economy; to rebuild it as a strong economy so that we can protect our workers. [Nazzar] The UGTA's negotiations with the government received the lion's share of time in discussions. Abdelhak Benhamouda talked about another new point that would be raised at the forthcoming negotiations with the government. Again, the point concerns a salary increase. [Benhamouda] We will be starting additional negotiations when we submit this file to the head of government. The negotiations will address the difference [between the UGTA demand and the government's offer], because the treasury minister said only 8 billion [currency not specified] while we had agreed on 32 billion. Therefore, we will demand a salary increase in the next phase. [end recording]
