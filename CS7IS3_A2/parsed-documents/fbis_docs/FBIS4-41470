It is expected that in the course of a three-day direct dialogue a permanent consultative council on foreign investments under the Russian Cabinet of Ministers will be created. It will be headed by Chernomyrdin. The council is expected to meet no less than twice a year. "The main purpose of the economic council, which is being created for the first time, is to hear attentively the potential investors," Chernomyrdin said in an ITAR-TASS interview on the eve of the meeting. "We would like to know what ways western business people suggest for increasing investments in Russia, what is hampering their work and how the Russian Government could help remove the unnecessary barriers on their way, including in the sphere of taxation." Chernomyrdin expressed hope that they would manage to pass over from words to action at the first Moscow meeting in promoting investments in the Russian economy. The firms we invited to take part in the meeting are not at all newcomers on the Russian market, he stressed. These include the well-known companies Coca Cola, Procter and Gamble, BASF, Mars, Ernest and Young, United Technologies, Citycorp etc. Informal meetings of government officials and business people will be held today, and the main work will start on Monday.
