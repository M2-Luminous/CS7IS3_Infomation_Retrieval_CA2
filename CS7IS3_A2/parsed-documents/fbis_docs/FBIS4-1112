[passage omitted] Philippe Gaillard, the ICRC representative in the Rwandan capital, spoke to us on the telephone about an hour ago: [Begin Gaillard recording] The situation in Kigali is extremely tense. Only 15 minutes ago -- it is now exactly 1850 hours in Kigali -- we had to rush to the ground floor of this building because of an exchange of heavy weapons fire between the RPF and government troops. Rebero hill was under fire for most of the day, and the hotel on top of that hill, occupied by the RPF, is now ablaze. The situation in Kigali, as elsewhere in Rwanda, is despairing and desperate. This is dialogue by the gun and the machete -- nothing else. [passage omitted] I take this opportunity to appeal to the international community, and especially to the Rwandans listening to RFI, to stop this suicide. All are losers in this war. All are losers.
