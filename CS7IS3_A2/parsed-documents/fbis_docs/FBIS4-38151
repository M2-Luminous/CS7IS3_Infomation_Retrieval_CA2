They can go to any extent. The recent export of contaminated fertilisers to Bangladesh was not just an isolated incident or a mistake. The shipment which was returned by the Bangladesh authorities, was sent by a company quite notorious for such acts of covertly flouting international rules. It is not only the company which is responsible for exporting the deadly cargo to Bangladesh but the US government is also to be blamed. The role of the United States government in exporting poisonous food stuff and fertilisers can lead the people of this part of the world to believe that Washington deals in only death either by arms or by having the people use poisonous materials. It is not a secret that food stuff and fertilisers are subjected to thorough checking before they are allowed to be marketed in the United States. The Food and Drug Administration of the United States boasts of very high standards in making sure that only those goods reach the shelf which are fit for human consumption. But the same standards are not applied to the goods which are destined for a Third World country. In fact every thing that is considered unfit for an American to consumer is allowed to be exported to Asia, Africa and South America. Does not this amount to killing innocent and poor people of these countries? What else can this lead us to believe? Killing seems to be part of the American way of life. It is however astonishing that rulers in these parts of the world always remain oblivious to such criminal acts of the West. The US is not the only country engaged in this dirty business of exporting the rejected goods to the Third World. Recently a Danish company sold an environmentally hazardous plant to a Pakistan firm. But no action was taken by the Pakistani government. Technology is very important for development, but we must not allow the technological advanced countries to play havoc with our lives. These companies need to be blacklisted for any business with Pakistan. The government must remain alive to its duty of protecting the lives of its citizens. We cannot blame the Danish company for selling us a plant processing chlorine which has been built according to environmental specifications of the 1950s. It is we who are at fault. While buying the machinery the Pakistani firm have saved some money but it has certainly put many Pakistani lives at risk. It is the duty of the government to look into the matter and have the firm close down this factory. Such companies must also be punished for violating the environmental protection regulations. The government of Pakistan needs to learn from the erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, which promptly checked the consignment of contaminated fertiliser and sent it back to its country of origin. That is what the government of Pakistan must do.
