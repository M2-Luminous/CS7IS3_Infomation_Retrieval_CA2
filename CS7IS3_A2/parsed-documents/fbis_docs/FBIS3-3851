Thanks to these brisk markets, the province, which lacks natural resources, has become one of the country's richest. Statistics show that over 80 percent of local commodities go through these markets. The economic boom in Wenzhou city, a pioneer in the shift to the market-oriented economy, can be dated back to the early 1980s, when smart local people grasped golden opportunities to become well-off as the government loosened economic control. Many stalls selling clothes, shoes and other small commodities were set up and gradually gathered together into markets for various special items. Last year the province injected 1.83 billion yuan into market expansion and renovation. In 1982 the Yiwu Small Commodities Market was launched. It claims to be the largest of its kind in the country, registering 4.52 billion yuan in turnover last year, a jump of 2.47 billion yuan from 1992. Now it has eight trading zones, 16,000 stalls and a complete set of service facilities, with over 30,000 businessmen and 100,000 customers streaming into the market every day. Another noted market is China's "textile city" in Shaoxing County, which achieved a turnover of 3.5 billion yuan in 1993, more than double the previous year's figure. Every day the market of 70,000 sq m receives 30,000-100,000 people and sends more than one million m of cloth to various parts of the country. Riding the crest of the fast-growing economy, the markets of production materials and factors of production have also seen a robust development in the province. A financial market has taken shape with the setting up of three centers specialising in securities, foreign currency and inter-bank lending, respectively. Meanwhile, the labor market helps over 200,000 people find jobs in Zhejiang every year. The province's 290 capital goods markets register a total of more than 18 billion yuan in annual turnover. At present, the province is making efforts to boost the markets dealing with futures, property rights and real estate, to further develop the local economy.
