According to some leaders of the United Workers Front (FUT), peaceful marches will be held in several cities early on Monday, but it is feared that extremists will take advantage of the situation to create disorders. Since Friday, one day before President Sixto Duran-Ballen decreed the increase to obtain funds to deal with a growing fiscal deficit of a little over $200 million, protests were already anticipated. Students, workers, housewives, transporters, and citizens in general have expressed their disagreement with the increases, but the government said it had no other choice in the face of its economic situation after it had to grant a salary increase to 120,000 public school teachers. The fact that the increases were announced on Saturday night postponed the street protests, which are being announced for Monday by labor federations, one of whose leaders, Edgard Ponce, announced that a nationwide strike for an indefinite period might be staged. The Catholic Church has also indicated that the increases are very high and the bishop of Cuenca, the country's third largest city, said the poor are the ones punished the most because, he explained, the wealthy have cars and other means of transportation. He said the peasants will have to "pay the consequences" and he added that even though they produce food, they have to sell their products at low prices because they do not have the means to transport them to the cities. "It is terrible to have to increase fuel prices or to have to create new taxes. This has caused much anguish for the president," his daughter Alicia said on Sunday. She added that "as a good father, he did not want to do so, but the Ecuadoreans have to understand that it was necessary so the government can fulfill its goals." "It is very hard to undertake the social projects the people need if there are no funds," the president's daughter explained to justify the increases. After describing the measure as "a clumsy maneuver to violate the law," the Ecuadoran Socialist Party said the increase is "an unbearable tax on the Ecuadoran people." It proposed that the people go to the streets to show the government "their total and increasing discontent." The wave of discontent was becoming general in Quito, Guayaquil, and Riobamba. Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo and General Guido Nunez, the police commander, have warned that the Armed Forces are ready to safeguard peace and they said that any person who is found disrupting order "must take responsibility for his actions." Victor Granda, secretary general of the Socialist Party, announced that a suit of unconstitutionality against the increase will be filed on Monday "because it worsens the Ecuadoran people's poverty." He indicated that "we will struggle in the streets to organize a social movement that must demand the trial and removal of Ecuadoran Vice President Alberto Dahik. [no end quotation mark as received] Dahik, a conservative economist, has been blamed for the economic policy of the government of right-wing Duran-Ballen. Even though the government has insisted it will not authorize increases in bus fares and intermunicipal transportation, beginning Sunday some Quito taxi drivers have begun to charge up to 40 percent more on their urban runs.
