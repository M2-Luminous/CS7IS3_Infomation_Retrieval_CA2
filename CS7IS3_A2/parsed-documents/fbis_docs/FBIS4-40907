Asked whether Russia's position at the Partnership for Peace talks has weakened with regard to NATO, and whether this is the reason why he is rushing off to Brussels, Kozyrev replies: "What rush? There is no rush. To begin with, most other states have already signed, only a few remain. We are trailing right at the back of this process. But I don't think that this has happened because we have been asleep or idle all this time. Simply we have our own difficulties. It is one thing if a small poodle tries to walk through these gates, but quite another matter when an elephant like Russia tries to do the same thing. "No one is rushing us, and we are in absolutely no hurry, but we are not falling behind either. We have no such objectives. We have a completely different objective, purely and simply pragmatic. We believe that when NATO came to understand our logic, and when we were able to work out the documents, such as the framework -- well, that was not real work, but still, we had to weigh up, consider, and discuss everything. So, when we worked out this protocol, we then signed it when we were ready. "Is it right that everyone is offered the same document? Some people here believe that we should not sign such a document because, they say, mighty Russia should not sign just like other states. Well, I don't even know which is more prevalent here, ignorance or cheap arrogance. If we talk about the practical reason, well, then the situation is somewhat different. I had to have an urgent meeting with the U.S. secretary of state on an absolutely unrelated matter, namely Korea. We are such a huge country, and this is obviously acknowledged in this protocol. Eastern politics are as close to us as those of the West, because Korea is also near abroad for us, if you want. When one goes to Vladivostok, it becomes clear that if something happens on the Korean peninsula, bomb blasts will be heard there as well." After a comment by program presenter Sergey Dorenko to the effect that Russia's present position with regard to NATO could equally be interpreted as a weakening of a formerly militant and harsh stance, or as a great diplomatic victory, Kozyrev concludes: "There will be no economic G-8 summit this time, and I must say that we were ready for this. However, half of the entire agenda is already meant to include eight countries. I must say that after two years of Russia's existence in its new capacity, that is not a bad result."
