FR940616-2-00166 FR940616-2-00102 VI. Other Matters Section 504␣Requirements Recipients will be expected to comply with the requirements of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, and 24 CFR part 8. Section 504 prohibits discrimination based on handicap in federally assisted programs. Prohibition Against Lobbying On February 26, 1990, at 55 FR 6736, the Department joined in the issuance of a government-wide interim rule advising recipients and subrecipients of federal contracts, grants, cooperative agreements and loans exceeding $100,000 of a new prohibition against use of appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the federal government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. In general, this rule prohibits the awarding of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, or loans unless the recipient has made an acceptable certification regarding lobbying. In addition, the recipient must file a disclosure if it has made or has agreed to make any payment with nonappropriated funds that would be prohibited if paid with appropriated funds. The law provides substantial monetary penalties for failure to file the required certification or disclosure. Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with the Department's regulations at 24 CFR part 50 which implement Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays at the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, room 10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that the policies announced in this Notice would not have a significant impact on the formation, maintenance, and general well-being of families except indirectly to the extent of the social and other benefits expected from this program of assistance. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that the policies contained in this Notice will not have federalism implications and, thus, are not subject to review under the Order. The promotion of fair housing policies is a recognized goal of general benefit without direct implications on the relationship between the national government and the states or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Drug-Free Workplace Certification The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of federal agencies to certify that they will provide drug-free workplaces. Thus, each applicant must certify that it will comply with drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 24, subpart F. Section 102 HUD Reform Act Documentation and Public Access Requirements; Applicant/Recipient disclosures Documentation and Public Access Requirements HUD will ensure that documentation and other information regarding each application submitted pursuant to this NOFA are sufficient to indicate the basis upon which assistance was provided or denied. This material, including any letters of support, will be made available for public inspection for a five-year period beginning not less than 30 days after the award of the assistance. Material will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. In addition, HUD will include the recipients of assistance pursuant to this NOFA in its quarterly Federal Register notice of all recipients of HUD assistance awarded on a competitive basis. (See 24 CFR 12.14(a) and 12.16(b), and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these documentation and public access requirements.) Disclosures HUD will make available to the public for five years all applicant disclosure reports (HUD Form 2880) submitted in connection with this NOFA. Update reports (also Form 2880) will be made available along with the applicant disclosure reports, but in no case generally for a period of less than three years. All reports_both applicant disclosures and updates_will be made available in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and HUD's implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 15. (See 24 CFR subpart C, and the notice published in the Federal Register on January 16, 1992 (57 FR 1942), for further information on these disclosure requirements.) Section 103␣HUD Reform Act HUD's regulation implementing section 103 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 was published May 13, 1991 (56 FR 22088) and became effective on June 12, 1991. That regulation, codified as 24 CFR part 4, applies to the funding competition announced today. The requirements of the rule continue to apply until the announcement of the selection of successful applicants. HUD employees involved in the review of applications and in the making of funding decisions are limited by part 4 from providing advance information to any person (other than an authorized employee of HUD) concerning funding decisions, or from otherwise giving any applicant an unfair competitive advantage. Persons who apply for assistance in this competition should confine their inquiries to the subject areas permitted under 24 CFR part 4. Applicants who have questions should contact the HUD Office of Ethics (202) 708&hyph;3815 (TDD/Voice). (This is not a toll-free number.) The Office of Ethics can provide information of a general nature to HUD employees, as well. However, a HUD employee who has specific program questions, such as whether particular subject matter can be discussed with persons outside the Department, should contact his or her Regional or Field Office Counsel, or Headquarters counsel for the program to which the question pertains. Section 112␣HUD Reform Act Section 13 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act contains two provisions dealing with efforts to influence HUD's decisions with respect to financial assistance. The first imposes disclosure requirements on those who are typically involved in these efforts_those who pay others to influence the award of assistance or the taking of a management action by the Department and those who are paid to provide the influence. The second restricts the payment of fees to those who are paid to influence the award of HUD assistance, if the fees are tied to the number of housing units received or are based on the amount of assistance received, or if they are contingent upon the receipt of assistance.
