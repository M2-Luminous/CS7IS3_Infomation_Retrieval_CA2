In his work report to the current meeting on frontier defense that began 1 February, State Councillor Luo Gan, who is also secretary general of the State Council and chairman of the National Frontier Defense Committee, pointed out: Since the last meeting in 1979, China has achieved remarkable success in work related to frontier defense, thanks to the conscientious discharge of such duties as consolidating frontier defense, promoting good-neighborliness, bringing prosperity to the people along the borders through development, and maintaining stability that gradually put itself onto a track of peacetime development and management and helped create a peaceful and tranquil environment for reform and opening up. On the basis of upholding the five principles of peaceful coexistence, China has normalized relations with all its neighboring countries, thus creating the best ever surrounding environment since the founding of the nation, which brought economic construction along the frontiers, particularly the rapid development of border trade. Army-government and army-people relations as well as solidarity among the various nationalities along the borders have been further consolidated and strengthened. The army-police-people joint defense effort has turned out to be a good frontier defense format under the new situation. After analyzing the development and changes in the internal and external situations and conditions along the borders, Luo Gan pointed out: Under the new historical period, China's frontier defense must be guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; adhere to the party's basic line; conscientiously implement the principles and policies of the party's Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission on frontier defense as well as the relevant state laws and regulations; resolutely safeguard state sovereignty and territorial integrity; preserve and develop good-neighborliness with neighboring countries; strengthen nationality solidarity; uphold reform and opening up; promote economic development along the border areas; maintain border security and stability; and create a fine surrounding environment conducive to the socialist modernization drive. Hence, it is necessary to firmly develop a consciousness on national security, territory, and sovereignty; actively promote cooperation and exchanges with neighboring countries in various forms and levels; energetically develop border trade; severely crack down on various criminal activities, including smuggling, drugs and firearms trafficking, and the sale of women; and maintain normal order along the border areas to ensure that reform, opening up, and economic construction are carried out in a peaceful, tranquil environment, both internally and externally. The meeting demanded governments and frontier defense committees at various levels along the border areas to further adapt themselves to the needs of establishing a socialist market economic system by unifying ideological understanding and deepening reform. Besides, it is necessary to strengthen the legal aspect of frontier defense, speed up infrastructure construction, improve personnel quality, and strengthen organizational leadership to create conditions more favorable to strengthening frontier defense management. Over 170 representatives from the frontier defense front attended the meeting, during which they exchanged experiences in frontier defense management, studied characteristics and missions of frontier defense under the new period, and discussed draft laws and regulations pertaining to frontier defense management.
