Thus, they have made great contributions to safeguarding the country's stability and public order and ensuring a smooth progress of establishing a socialist market economy and pushing ahead with the modernization drive. Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of China's Supreme People's Procuratorate, made the remarks to the current session of the Eighth National People's Congress here today. Last year, Zhang said, procuratorates at various levels in the country investigated more than 56,491 cases involving embezzlement and bribery, misappropriation of public funds, tax evasion, refusal to pay taxes and frauds in export tax refunding. Procuratorates at different levels investigated and punished 1,037 cadres at or above county level involved in such offenses in 1993, with 64 being bureau-level officials and one being a vice- ministerial level official, Zhang said. Procuratorates at all levels last year firmly carried out the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's directions on fighting against corruption, focused their efforts on investigating and dealing with major cases. In the September-December period, they investigated 8,538 major cases each involving embezzlement and bribery of more than 10,000 yuan and misappropriation of public funds valued at 50,000 yuan and more and investigated and punished 715 officials at or above country level involved in such offenses. In cooperation with public security, state security, judicial, administrative departments and courts, China's procuratorates appropriately dealt with some major cases with great impacts, safeguarding the country's political and social stability, according to Zhang. For instance, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country last year staged nationwide struggles against train robbery, larceny, kidnapping and abduction of women and children, and prostitution. In the period, they carried out struggles against narcotics trafficking and confiscated arms from smugglers in Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and waged anti-smuggling and illicit emigration fights in southeastern coastal and border provinces and regions. In 1993, Zhang said, procuratorates across the country approved the arrest of 532,394 criminal suspects and took proceedings against 479,860 of them to people's courts, of whom 129,219 were involved in major cases. At present, China's public order is generally stable, but there are still some unstable factors, Zhang said. Hostile forces and elements abroad have never stopped their activities to split, subvert and infiltrate China and steal secrets from the country. At home, at the same time, sabotage activities by splittists and illicit activities under the cloak of religion have become more serious. Major heinous criminal cases are on the rise, the number of violent crimes has increased by a bigger margin, public order in some rural areas is out of control and, organized crime runs rampant in some cities and towns, leaving people with no sense of safety, Zhang said. Cases of larceny, destruction of state important production facilities, looting of state property and fighting with weapons among groups of people take place frequently, he added. In his speech, Zhang also touched upon supervision over law enforcement and training of procurators. As for tasks of procuratorates this year, Zhang said that first, in the anti-corruption struggle, procuratorates will concentrate their efforts on handling major cases and investigate mainly cases involving officials and staff members in party and government organs, judicial departments, administrative law enforcement departments and economic management departments. Second, procuratorates will continue to crack down on serious criminal offenses; Third, they will strengthen supervision over law enforcement and promptly correct law violations in judicial work; Fourth, training of procurators will be improved, the procuratorial system will be reformed, and a socialist procuratorial system suited to a socialist market economy and having Chinese characteristics will be built.
