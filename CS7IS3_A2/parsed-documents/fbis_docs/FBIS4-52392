Tokyo Gov. Shunichi Suzuki said the Japanese delegation wants to incorporate a paragraph on Japan's demand for the return of Kunashiri, Etorofu, Shikotan and the Habomai group of islets. However, the Russian delegation refused the request, pointing to an estimated 8,000 cases of territorial violations by Japanese fishing boats near the southern Kurils in 1993 alone. Both sides will study further the wording of the statement, Suzuki said. Twelve governors headed by Moscow Gov. Anatoliy Styazhlov and 17 governors and vice governors from Japan are discussing measures to expand bilateral trade and other relations at the 13th conference, which opened earlier in the day and will run through Thursday next week. Styazhlov told participants that Russia will have to dispel fears about political and social instability if it is to convince hesitant Japanese companies to join in exploiting the country's rich natural resources.
