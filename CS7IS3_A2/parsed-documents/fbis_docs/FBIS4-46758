He noted the need for further consolidation of cooperation among railroads, in particular the railroads of the Russian Federation and Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan is devoting a great deal of attention to the creation of rail transport corridors, which are important not only for the particular region but also for Russia and the other countries of the CIS. They have in mind construction of new rail lines from Tedzhen through Seraks to Meshkhed and from Gazandzhik to Gyzyletrek; these lines will provide the shortest route to Iran and on to the Persian Gulf for freight from Russia's eastern regions, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan as well as for international transit freight. Salarmurat Niyazov stressed that the doors are open for mutually advantageous cooperation by all interested states in carrying out these projects. As for Russia, a joint working group has been formed on the basis of the protocol of the talks between the RF minister of railways and the chief of the Turkmen State Railway to study the set of questions related to Russian participation in building the above-named rail lines. As the result of its work, which should be completed before 1 September of this year, proposals will be prepared for the governments of Russia and Turkmenistan. The support of the RF Ministry of Railways for the formative process and efficient operation of Turkmenistan's independent railway was noted as part of the development of bilateral Russian-Turkmen cooperation. At this meeting questions of improving the quality of transportation ties between Russian and Turkmenistan were also discussed. In conclusion the President of Turkmenistan wished the participants of the 11th meeting of the Council on Rail Transportation good results and successful implementation of the decisions adopted in the interests of further development of mutually advantageous cooperation.
