What has been the CDU's biggest mistake in the east? [Eggert] I am not sure that there has been any big mistake by the CDU. It is often forgotten that it has been four years since unification. Only a few critics imagine what would have happened if unification had not taken place. This does not rule out that in addition to the large amount of help -- one out of two marks that the east is using is produced in the west -- a lot of ignorance and arrogance has also been carried from the west to the east. In addition, the expectations of the people in the east were too high and cannot be fulfilled, especially not in times of recession. Now this is attributed to the party that is in the government. [DIE WOCHE] Are the circumstances to be blamed? [Eggert] If a party is no longer accepted, then 80 percent of the blame naturally goes to itself. There were several mishaps, personnel quarrels, and homemade affairs. In addition, we are now paying the bill for the fact that the CDU has been too clumsy to present the complicated problems, which have accumulated within the briefest possible period, as such and to show approaches to solutions. I believe that there has never been any election period during which so many problems needed solving at the same time. By the way, during the time of the upheaval, it was also not made clear enough to the former GDR citizens that even though a state had collapsed, their life achievements are not worthless. [DIE WOCHE] Can the CDU still turn the helm around before the Bundestag elections? [Eggert] I just hope that at the Hamburg party congress the CDU will make one thing clear: Solving material questions is worth more than preserving power at any cost. My experiences show that the voter punishes opportunism. He notices when he is made promises that cannot be kept. [DIE WOCHE] Do you place your hopes on the chancellor? [Eggert] It is not only me who is against pursuing the election campaign with just one man. I am far too much of a theologian not to know that a message can be spread only by many people. The more messengers there are, the more visible is the range of the messages.
