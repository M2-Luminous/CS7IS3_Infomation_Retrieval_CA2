FR940622-1-00012 FR940622-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;18&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. This proposal would require the removal and replacement of the transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear) within certain time intervals and would establish a retirement life for the ring gear. This proposal is prompted by reports of failures of the ring gear due to slow-growth fatigue cracks. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Comments must be received by August 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;18&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.
