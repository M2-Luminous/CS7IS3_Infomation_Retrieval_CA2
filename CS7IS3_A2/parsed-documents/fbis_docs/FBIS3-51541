Enriquez added: "I will take the opportunity to exchange views with some of the U.S. generals. The opportunity is great not only to learn about general culture but to learn about the views of the military authorities of that country with regard to Guatemala." Concerning the possibility of discussing the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols (PAC) after the letter sent by the president to his counterpart Bill Clinton, he said: "if they ask me about the PAC's, I will reiterate what De Leon Carpio stated, that they will disappear when the internal armed confrontation ends." In addition, he noted that the PAC's have significantly drawn down in Guatemala as a result of a drop in the subversive effort. Consequently, these patrols have gone from 1 million members in 1983 to 433,000 in 1993. He also said that there were only 17,000 weapons among them. In many departments, the PAC's were turned into committees for development without the control of the armed institution. He further remarked that the Defense Ministry budget has always been less than those of the Education and Health Ministries. At present, it is only 8.2 percent of the national budget. On another topic, the minister said that, if necessary, in a meeting to be held with certain labor leaders he will tell them that he favors the yes vote in the referendum because it is a legal mechanism and because the Army is the guarantor of the constitutional order. He said he has read the constitutional reforms and that he believes they are aimed at improving public administration in the country because in the case of the confidential points [confidenciales] and other important matters, there is nothing that hurts society. "They are measures that if implemented, we will have the Guatemala we want in the near future, perhaps, slowly, but surely and within the framework of the Constitution," he noted. He stated that if he were a civilian and had the option to vote, he would vote yes because it is a benefit. He said that he supports the reforms because "it is not a matter of backing a political party, it is not party politics. It is truly something done for Guatemala." During the news conference, Enrique officially presented Colonel Morris Eugenio de Leon Gil, the new chief of Information and Press Department of the Army (DIDE). De Leon Gil promised to be open to the media 24 hours a day.
