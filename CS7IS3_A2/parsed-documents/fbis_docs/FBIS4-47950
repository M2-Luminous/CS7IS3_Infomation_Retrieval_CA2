A preliminary hearing by the commission said on Wednesday it was unfortunate Gen van der Merwe had not consulted Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel before authorising an export permit for 1,000 LM4 rifles destined for the KwaZulu Police. The statement issued by the NUM said the Ministry of Law and Order should curtail the general's powers, which appeared to put him above the law. NUM said also it seemed as if Eskom management was making Gen van der Merwe "a sacrifical lamb in an attempt to hide the real facts".
