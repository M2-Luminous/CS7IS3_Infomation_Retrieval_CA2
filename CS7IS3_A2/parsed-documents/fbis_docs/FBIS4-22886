Akhanov, V.A. Korniyenko, J.U. Mamutov, Soil Science Institute at the Kazakh Republic's Academy of Sciences, Almaty; UDC 631.619] [Abstract] The great length of excess toxic salt removal from the soil in rice growing areas (requiring four-to-six years to reach the necessary fertility) and the eventual resalinization process which requires periodic repeat treatment prompted the development of new rice growing practices on high-saline salts. The use of the new method developed at the Soil Science Institute at the Kazakh Republic's Academy of Sciences (NTOZ) is based on using the synergy effect of the new low-volume ameliorating agents which alleviate boric toxicosis in the soil and plants, eliminate the pathogenic microorganisms, and normalize the nutrition conditions. The new practices make it possible to inactivate the harmful impact of elementary salts, thus leading to higher and biologically more valuable yields of rice and other rice rotation crops on highly saline soils and salt marshes without washing them beforehand. They are also applicable to nonsaline calcareous soils in the arid zone. The new methods are implemented by traditional agricultural procedures used in rice growing. In NTOZ, the permissible level of soil salinity is 15-20 times higher than in conventional rice growing practices while the rice vegetation period is shortened by 10-12 days. The NTOZ method does not call for new flow or spillway systems, special fertilizers, or special tilling procedures. Tables 2.
