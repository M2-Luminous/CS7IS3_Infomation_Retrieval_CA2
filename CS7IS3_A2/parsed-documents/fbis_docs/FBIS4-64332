This was announced by the environmental spokesman of the SPD Bundestag group, Michael Mueller. The Federal Government dealt with a corresponding inquiry by the SPD late in the evening yesterday. "Military enterprises are the main culprits," particularly in former USSR, but also in Western countries, Mueller stressed. Mueller called for a worldwide agreement against dumping nuclear material and a ban on nuclear-powered submarines. The member of the Christian Democratic Union, Klaus Harries, suggested controls on draining radioactive waste water from the reprocessing plants in Sellafield (Great Britain) and La Haque (France). The Federal Government sees no need to speak of a "general contamination of the world seas" because of the dumping of radioactive waste resulting from the civilian and military use of nuclear energy. The European coastal waters (North Sea and Baltic Sea) are not directly endangered.
