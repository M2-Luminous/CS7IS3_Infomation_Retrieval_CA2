"Several tanks were withdrawn out of the northern part of the (NATO-declared) 20 kilometres (12-mile) exclusion zone," UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) Canadian Lieutenant-Colonel Bill Aikman told reporters. He said the tanks were spotted moving at about the 10 kilometres (six-mile) portion of the zone by UN military observers. The observers "did not have the capability to stop the tanks," Aikman said. But he said the movement of the 6 or 7 tanks was a clear violation of the NATO ultimatum that expired a week ago for all heavy artillery to be withdrawn from Sarajevo, where Serbs besiege a mainly Moslem population. As of the expiration date, all heavy guns, including tanks, were to be withdrawn or placed under UNPROFOR control. If not, NATO warplanes were to strike the weapons. Aikman said the Serb tanks "appear to have been hidden somewhere and then moved out." They went through a point north of Vogosca, in hills north of Sarajevo. Aikman said UNPROFOR would be "increasing patrols in the area to determine if there are any more" heavy weapons there. UNPROFOR has admitted the Serbs have not handed over all their weapons and the Bosnian Government charges that the Serbs have kept up to 70 percent of the weapons they had targeted on Sarajevo in the exclusion zone.
