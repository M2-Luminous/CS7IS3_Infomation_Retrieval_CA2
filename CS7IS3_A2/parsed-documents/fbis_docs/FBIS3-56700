For the first time all the ambassadors of the former Soviet republics have gathered in Moscow. Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev made a speech whose keynote was the protection of Russia's interests in the CIS and Baltic countries. The process of the conference itself confirms KOMMERSANT-DAILY's predictions that the more often Russian leaders assure that there will be no revision of the country's foreign policy after the 12 December elections, the more obvious it becomes that this revision has grown urgent. The conference is analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY's commentator Georgiy Bovt. Andrey Kozyrev stated that as of now protection of the interests of Russians in the former Soviet republics is one of the strategic priorities for Moscow. Meanwhile the Concept on Foreign Policy, adopted by the Security Council in March 1993, in its section dealing with relations with the CIS, makes no mention of this problem whatsoever (Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Moldova were simply passed over in silence); the section on relations with the Baltic states does not elaborate on this problem sufficiently. The year 1993, however, can be called "the year of Russian refugees." They have been emigrating in masses even from such seemingly "agreeable" countries as Kyrgyzstan. Their exodus has intensified from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, the war-torn Tajikistan, and -- as a result of the "policy of soft eviction" -- from the Baltic countries. The number of Russian-speaking refugees (defined according to UN criteria) has already reached 2 million people. The 12 December elections showed that the artful rhetoric of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Russian Federation Communist Party has found a response among the greater part of the electorate. The thesis that votes for the Liberal Democratic Party and the Communist Party are votes "against the methods of reforms" is partly a delusion. In fact the disintegration of the USSR is still being painfully perceived by many in Russia -- even if at the emotional, everyday level. It seems that the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry also understands this. Although in a recent article in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA Andrey Kozyrev still maintained that the president is the guarantee of Russia's course and its protection against national extremism, and that this course itself will remain just as predictable, open, and oriented toward partner-like relations with the outside world, the minister's speech yesterday showed that adjustments are already being made. For the first time he openly articulated the thought that has long been aired in corridors on Smolenskaya Ploshchad [Foreign Ministry] that the former Soviet republics are the sources of "main threats" to Russia's interests. This was followed up with another fundamentally new conclusion: Moscow's strategic task consists in "preserving a military presence" in this region. Because, as Kozyrev now believes, to pull out of the CIS completely is just as absurd as to send tanks there. The minister fears a strategic vacuum that could be filled by unfriendly forces; he did not specify who he has in mind -- the mujahedin in Tajikistan, the fundamentalists in the Transcaucasus, the Romanian nationalists in Moldova, or even NATO in the Baltics. The head of the Foreign Affairs Ministry also touched on the problems of an economic union in the CIS. Noting the risk involved in hasty actions, he nonetheless gave a possible appraisal of Russia's and Belarus' plans to merge their monetary systems. It seems that the wish to get rid of the guilt complex for the Belovezhskaya Forest agreements -- even at the price of the ruble's destabilization -- is increasingly affecting the politicians who remain in the government. Meanwhile the idea of "Western liberalism" may be replaced, for instance, by the idea of "putting together a quasi-USSR." It is too soon to say yet which motives will prevail: The neighbors' overwhelming attraction to NATO, the wish to win the electorate back from the Liberal Democratic Party, or the intention to divert the Russians' attention from the collapsed reforms.
