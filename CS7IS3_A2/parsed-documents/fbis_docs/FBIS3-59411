If we also figure in the current domestic national debt, together with the projected budget deficit for the current year, we will have reached a total debt of approximately 7,500 billion lei by year's end. This poses the problem of where we will get the resources to repay this money, since the majority of the credits have been earmarked for consumption, which means that they are not producing anything. The situation would be different if these sums were utilized productively, in which case repayment could be made from the value which would be newly created as a result of the utilization of the productive capacities in question. In the report concerning the economic and financial situation of the country during the first six months of this year, which the Ministry of Finance presented to the government, a separate chapter is devoted to the national debt. This concept has been brought back into currency after having been abandoned during the communist period. The first reference to this term was made over 100 years ago, in 1865. Romania has had national debt during the whole period since then, with the only difference being that this fact was no longer acknowledged during the past 45 years. At present, despite the fact that people talk many times about the Romanian state's national debt, the country lacks a general framework of regulations concerning methods for constituting it. For this reason, we believe that it is of the utmost importance for the bill to be passed which has already been submitted to Parliament by the Ministry of Finance; at the present time, this bill is being discussed by the committees of the legislative forum. According to the provisions of this bill, the national debt represents the sum total of pecuniary obligations incurred by the state through domestic and foreign loans, in its own name or guaranteed by it abroad. As you can see, the state can procure the necessary financial resources both on the domestic market and from abroad. In other words, the national debt has a domestic and a foreign character. The loans incurred on the domestic market can be utilized to cover some needs generated by the existence of a budget deficit, temporary cash shortfalls, public expenditures of national interest, and the refinancing of the national debt. The foreign portion of the national debt can be constituted as a consequence of the medium- and long-term loans that have been contracted directly or by commercial companies, self-governing public-works administrations, and local public authorities with state guarantees. These loans are for the realization of economic development, recovery, and adjustment programs, for objectives and actions in the public interest, and for the creation and maintenance of the foreign-currency reserve, but also for the cancelling out of the effects of calamities. The loans taken out by the state appear as an understanding between, on the one hand, a physical or juridical person and, on the other hand, the state, through which the former consents to make a sum of money available to the state, in the form of reserves, for a fixed period. At the time a loan is taken out, the state sets the date repayment is due, which can be closer or further off in time, depending on certain conditions. The loans are effected through the issuance of transferrable securities: bonds, annuity deeds, and other government certificates. For example, if the borrower is the central bank, treasury notes are issued. These public certificates ensure the holders of a certain counter-benefit, in the form of interest, gains, or other material advantages, besides the repayment of the amount that was borrowed. The Figures Show the Debt Statistics The medium- and long-term credits contracted by the Romanian state as of of 30 June 1993 amounted to the sum of $4,339.9 million, of which $2,869.8 million were incurred directly by the state (66.1 percent) and $1,470.1 million were contracted by economic agencies (33.9 percent). Out of the total foreign credits incurred and guaranteed by the state, $2,827.3 million have been drawn on. Out of the value of the foreign credits contracted directly by the state, $2,605.9 million are earmarked for consumption, which represents 90.8 percent of the incurred debt; the remaining $263.9 million (9.2 percent) are earmarked for development. The domestic portion of the national debt as of the same date of 30 June 1993 was 482.7 billion lei and consists of: the financing of the state budget deficit for the year 199 [as published] (32.9 billion lei), the bank loan to cover the domestic portion of the national debt, which has been created through the state's taking over the losses and the nonperforming credits of the state-financed economic agents as stipulated by Law 7/1992 (155.9 billion lei), the state budget deficit for the year 1992 (261.3 billion), the loan for the financing of the expenditures which revert to the Romanian side from the intergovernmental Convention concerning the collaboration on the construction of the Krivoi-Rog Industrial Complex (21.5 billion), and the loan incurred through the issuance of government bonds for the financing of the state budget deficit for the years 1991 and 1992 (11.1 billion lei). I should explain several terms so that we can better understand these figures. Thus, incurred credits are understood to mean the sum total of the credits contracted by Romania, while credits drawn on mean the amounts which have already been utilized. The mathematical difference between the two represents the value of the foreign credits which our country has a right to use, but which are frozen due to our failure to fulfill some contractual clauses. A third term that is used is the service of the national debt, which is, in the opinion of many specialists, the best measure of a country's debt. A country's debt includes the payments owed for the repayment of the national debt, which represent the installments falling due, but also the interest payments and any possible commissions. One Government, One Compensation -- Until When? As one can see, one part of the domestic portion of the national debt is constituted through the state's absorbing the losses of some economic agents, of the unprofitable ones. In other words, the ordinary citizen is compelled to pay the bill for the inefficiency of companies that, since they are treated with leniency, consider it normal to operate with losses, for which they can in no way be blamed. They think that the state will probably take care of them no matter what! And it would seem that they are right, when the Executive, not finding (or not wanting to find) an alternative, is scheming up a new so-called compensation, by means of which the arrears will once again be absorbed into the national debt. Is this how people wish the much-trumpeted financial discipline to be enthroned? We doubt that the IMF experts, who are expected in Bucharest this week, will agree with this way of thinking. Or, probably, the government is waiting for those experts to leave so that in the end, once the agreement has been signed at last, it can finally act undisturbed. If the other previous experiments were not sufficient proof that this solution (which treats the effects and not the causes) leads nowhere except to a new financial freeze, as has already been demonstrated, then the same thing will be tried again, based on the principle of one government, one compensation. Until when, however? Where have we found the resources to finance this debt up to now? In the case of the domestic loans, one part was paid off through the agency of the National Bank, by resorting to the printing of money. This has led to the growth of the currency mass which is in circulation, without any quid pro quo in the way of commodities and services, and it has led to the reduction in buying power of our money and to the increase in prices. And we still ask ourselves what the source of the inflation was! In the case of the loans contracted at the banks and by public offerings, since the state is obliged to pay those loans back at their nominal value, the amount the state owes will have been seriously eroded by inflation by the due date. This means that in real terms the obligation will have been liquidated. All that notwithstanding, the foreign credits contracted from various international bodies have the greatest weight. Unlike domestic debts, they labor under the disadvantage of being expressed in dollars. This means that they are constantly being revalued through the depreciation of the exchange rate, so that they actually keep pace with inflation. Expressed in lei, at the current exchange rate of almost 1,000 lei to the dollar, the credits which have been incurred are up to somewhere over 4,000 billion; if we add the accrued interest to this figure, the total amount exceeds 6,500 billion lei. If we also figure in the current domestic national debt together with the projected budget deficit for the current year, we will have reached a total debt of approximately 7,500 billion lei by year's end. This poses the problem of where we will get the resources to repay this money, since the majority of the credits have been earmarked for consumption, which means that they are not producing anything. The situation would be different if these sums were utilized productively, in which case repayment could be made from the value that would be newly created as a result of the utilization of the productive capacities in question. But due to the fact that the first installments will be due starting in 1995, this question does not yet trouble government circles. They are probably working on the premise that, by that point, others will be called on to pull the chestnuts out of the fire.
