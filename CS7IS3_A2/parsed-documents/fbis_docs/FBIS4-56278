As we have said, the painful and regrettable events that Mexico has experienced in the first quarter of this year -- in addition to its tragic human dimension -- have generated effects on the nation's economy in general and on the financial markets in particular. The financial markets reflect these temporary or transitory events however. It is important to acknowledge that these have been adjusting in a disorderly [as heard] fashion. This orderly adjustment, within a legal framework, demonstrates that our markets are much more stable than in the past, much more mature than in the past. It also demonstrates we have more solid financial institutions than in the past, that we maintain an unchanging economic policy that does not vary with passing incidents, rather it maintains its course, steered by its guidelines. We also have a much healthier and more stable economy. This transparent adjustment has occurred in an economy that is completely different from the past. Currently we have an economy that is much more open to outside markets, more diversified, which, together with the financial sector, has allowed us to absorb these events. I would like to simply point out some of the important changes that have taken place and that are reflected in the consensus of the agreement that we recently ratified. The government, within the agreement, must comply with its commitments. For example, it must not have a fiscal deficit in keeping with Congress' mandate and it must maintain a cautious monetary policy. This can be achieved through the new Banco de Mexico, which has autonomy at the constitutional level and has as its main goal safeguarding the currency's purchasing power, that is, to keep inflation low. Obviously, when faced with this temporary uncertainty, the markets, as I said, adjust to the circumstances. The temporary interest rate increases are the appropriate reply. Nevertheless, these rate increases are transitory and for the short term. You may recall some events in the past, and not the too distant past. You may recall for example, in March 1992 when interest rates started to fall there was uncertainty, the interest rates then started to climb, the exchange rate fell more than planned. At that time, it was said this could turn back the progress made. Nevertheless the course was maintained, there was calm, positions and guidelines were maintained. As a result, the interest rates went down again, the stock market also started to recover. Do you recall a more recent event in October 1993, which was not long ago. Remember that at that time, there were external events; now there are internal and external events, as I said before. We had to adjust the markets at that time and you will recall that in October the interests rates rose; there was an adjustment in the stock market, however, and the course and the guidelines were maintained. There was no fiscal deficit; there was no more printing of currency, no more statements that inflation does not count. On the contrary, the course was maintained. In this way, as in all difficult times, such as those we are now overcoming and those that we will certainly have to overcome in the future, the guidelines, the course, the spirit, and renewed motivation must be clearly maintained. Let us recall some important changes that have taken place in the past years. From an economy with sky-rocketing inflation, that averaged over 80 percent and that at times totalled 200 percent a few years ago, last year, our inflation rate was down to 8 percent. From March to March [years not specified] it was 7 percent, and from April to April, from May to May, we will continue reducing it. From an economy that had a public sector deficit of 17 percent of what we Mexicans produced in 1982, and 11 percent in 1988, we now have an economy that has no deficit or any surplus. The government now only spends what it has, it does not overspend to subsequently tax the individuals with inflation. We do not spend more than we have. This is also a government -- one must recall because at times we forget -- for which barely 10 years ago 60 percent of its budget consisted of paying interest; 20 percent was disbursed in transfers to companies such as [name indistinct], and Metalmecanica, and so forth. The other 20 percent that remained was earmarked for education, health, and social security matters. In our current budget, 56 percent is earmarked for education, health, potable water, sewers, ecology, and housing. We only earmark 10 percent of the transfers to the payment of interest; previously it was 60 percent of the budget. The rest is spent on basic support programs for the countryside, support for ecology, and so forth. Let us take a look at these very important changes. From a government that spent on things and paid interest, we now have a government that spends on its people, on its community. Its largest disbursements are for fundamental matters such as education and health, to give the community better opportunities for education and thereby better opportunities to access the job market and for a decent life. You can note the significant change from a totally protected economy that was overregulated with trade barriers to an open economy, with fewer regulations, and with a dynamic exporting sector. This is an economy in which only a few years ago 90 percent of its exports was made up of petroleum. Last year, 87 percent of our exports were not petroleum, they were nonpetroleum exports. This year, most certainly, given the dynamics in nonpetroleum exports, more than 90 percent of the exports will no longer be petroleum. This is an economy in which, during the first two months of this year, the dollar amount of nonpetroleum exports grew 28 percent. Nonpetroleum exports are growing 28 percent annually. The figures are the most dynamic in the Western Hemisphere. This is because the companies have been transformed to participate successfully in the international markets. Undoubtedly, there is still a great deal to do, but we should not let any passing event make us doubt the strength we Mexicans have to develop. It certainly is not time to change course. It is time to advance unitedly, with courage, and with conviction toward a future that will certainly be more prosperous and more just. Let us not become discouraged for any reason. In the past, we have overcome problems, we are currently doing this, we will overcome them again in the future when they arise. Mexico has a guideline, it has leadership, and a course. Mexico has a first-class work force, it has businessmen who have demonstrated their courage, their valor to risk their capital. Today, we commemorate this at the Banco de Oriente, in these times of reforms and changes, so we can have stronger companies, better jobs, better projects that benefit Puebla, Tlaxcala, the region, and Mexico. I congratulate all of you bank shareholders, advisers, and employees. You are truly a source of pride for the state, for the region, and it must also be said that men and women such as you, who risk your capital and who generate jobs, are a source of pride for Mexico. Thank you very much.
