The Delhi Vidhan Sabha results show that the political tableau of this metropolitan city is not the same. The continuously rising population and the changed socio-political environment have sent the vote banks from one party to another party's coffers. A review of the political activities of 1993 indicates that this year was not very good for the Congress (I) and Janata Dal parties in this state, while the state's BJP has set new standards of success and has established its rule in Delhi. It was successful in increasing its prestige among the people. Meanwhile, the Congress (I) leaders in this city were occupied in groupism, accusations and counter-accusations, and fighting with each other. The same is true for the state's Janata Dal. Instead of trying to strengthen the party in the state and increasing its support base, the Janata Dal leaders spent the whole year fighting over leadership. Both these parties because of their weakness have not played their expected role in Delhi Vidhan Sabha. The Congress (I), of course, was defeated, and the Janata Dal did not take advantage of the situation as it could have. The Delhi branch of the Communist Party under the leadership of M.M. Gope, and the CPI (M) behind its local leader Jogender Sharma, tried to increase their political activities by holding public meetings and rallies. However, they failed in luring the Delhi voters. Janata Dal won over them. By snatching away the traditional votes, it proved that it can be the cause of some party's victory and other party's defeat. The results of the Delhi Vidhan Sabha elections held on 6 November show that the votes cast for Janata Dal had spoiled Congress (I) arithmetic, and it was defeated by the BJP. Senior Congress (I) leaders have admitted that if the Janata Dal was not in the race, the Congress (I) would not have faced this defeat. Despite its weak organization and lack of money, the Janata Dal's stealing Congress (I) votes can be called its achievement. Actually, the Janata Dal limited itself to one dimension during 1993. Neither was its organization strong nor did it manage to increase its support base. Its unity was broken because of the internal strife and leadership conflict. The last year was not good for the Congress (I) in Delhi. The local leaders remained busy in groups politics all through the year and weakened the state party with accusations and counter accusations. The atmosphere was hostile to the state president, Mr. Hari Kishan Lal Bhagat, during the whole year. Efforts were made to cut off his control. R.K. Dhawan, member of the Congress Working Committee and a legislator; New Delhi legislator Rajesh Khanna; and Jagdish Tytler, legislator from Delhi Sadar and a cabinet member; joined forces against Mr. Bhagat. The call for changing the leadership was raised repeatedly. Now after the defeat in the vidhan sabha elections, the demand for changing state's party leadership has become stronger. The main reason for the defeat of the state's Congress (I) was its internal strife and loss of its traditional vote bank. Once during the last year, the prime minister reproached the Delhi leaders, however, it was not effective. On one side, Mr. Bhagat's residence at 34 Prithvi Raj Road was the meeting place for the local leaders, while Mr. Dhawan's house in Golf Link and Mr. Rajesh Khanna's government residence in Lodhi Estates were the meeting places for the dissenters. Both sides played this game which was disgraceful, and the Congress (I) leaders in Delhi will never be able to forget the catastrophe it led to. This year has been very pleasing for the local leaders who are controlling Delhi government now. They may not have been as successful as expected in other states, but in Delhi, which is a miniature reflection of India and on whose palpitation moves the whole country, BJP's access to its throne is a major victory. It is a commendable achievement for the BJP to have the first chief minister in Delhi's newly elected vidhan sabha. The reason for is the BJP leaders' active involvement in local problems. The Congress (I) lost its face in front of Delhi voters in 1993, and the BJP put its entire energy to win their respect. Despite this success, there has been some minor skirmishes among the state BJP leaders. Some workers also got a taste of it. Mr. Om Prakash Kohli was elected as president of the state party organization again for two year. He has started working on tightening the state's organizational structure. It has also been kept in mind not to offend the veteran senior leaders. While trying to strengthen the party, active cooperation from various BJP units including the RSS [Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh] was sought. Despite some conflicts, the RSS was successful in keeping its clout at the state level. The state BJP had been actively increasing its support all year. It was for the first time that it prepared a large vote bank in rural Delhi. Strategies were planned to include people living in slums and refugee resettlement camps through meetings and conferences. It was successful in this effort. All in all, the BJP managed to form new vote banks in Delhi. The Sikhs have always influenced the politics in this metropolis. The Sikh community and their political groups have their own importance here. Before the 1984 riots, this groups had traditionally stayed with the Congress (I). However, it drifted away from this party after that. The state BJP took full advantage of this situation and tried to get the Sikhs with them. Their success in these efforts resulted in more about 80 percent of Sikh votes coming to the BJP. Opposed to it, the Muslim voters remained away from the BJP for the whole year. If we review the activities of the this past year, this group has been suspicious about the situation in Delhi. Although this group was angry at the Congress (I), part of it stayed with it because of the Janata Dal's frailty, and a larger part supported the Janata Dal. That was the reason for the polarization of the Muslim votes in Delhi politics. The decision to vote was based on the candidates themselves in the vidhan sabha election. The Muslim politics also showed that it is not limited to the inner city now; its votes can be cause of victory or defeat in areas outlying Delhi. The caste equation proved to be neutral in this changing political platform in Delhi, still there are some seats where victory or defeat was decided by the caste equation alone. Some seats in eastern and outer Delhi, caste played strongly in decisions and votes were cast according to caste decisions. The composition of seats has also changed because of the rapid urbanization of areas around Delhi. Thus, 1993 has continuously shook the Delhi politics and politicians. This year has been the year of 'political examinations,' the results of which will help the political pundits to spread their political chess game in the coming years.
