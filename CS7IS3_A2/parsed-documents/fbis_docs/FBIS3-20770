Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari said at the news conference that, in the 1994 fiscal year, revenues would amount to 24 percent of the GDP while expenditures would be a little higher -- 24.5 percent of the GDP. [passage omitted] How Big Is the Deficit? How high is this year's budget deficit expected to be? The government proposes 8.9 billion tolars; 50 percent less than stated in the budget memorandum, or 0.5 percent of the GDP. This year's net borrowing would be even lower -- 7.5 billion tolars. The total budget deficit would amount to 30.8 billion tolars; internal debts would be 5.5 billion tolars and external debts close to 25 billion tolars. How much revenue are to be derived from taxes? About 373.9 billion tolars or 22.7 percent of the GDP; 12 billion tolars more than proposed in the memorandum. Other sources of revenue would contribute nearly 20 billion tolars. More Funds for Investment How will these funds be spent? Salaries, material or other expenses, defense, social services, payments to contractors, subsidies, interest payments, state guarantees for loans, and direct state financing would cost 348.4 billion tolars; 4 billion tolars less than proposed in the memorandum. Investments would amount to 42.9 billion tolars; 8 billion tolars more than planned in the memorandum. [passage omitted] [Box, p 3] Allocations to Ministries Gaspari also wanted to put to rest, as he said, the "fashionable debate" on which ministry got the most and which the least funds. He pointed out that the administration did not interfere with proposals sent from the Presidency of the Republic, the Constitutional Court, and Parliament because this is not in its jurisdiction. The amounts also do not reflect the mission of the ministries. The ministries have received the following allocations: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Tolars in millions | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |President of the Republic |202 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Parliament (State Assembly, State Cou-|2,690 | |ncil, and Ombudsman) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Office of the Prime Minister |602 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Government agencies |17,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Finance |92,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Internal Affairs |19,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Foreign Affairs |4,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Defense |24,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Justice |2,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Economic Activities |7,900 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Economic Relations and De-|7,500 | |velopment | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry |10,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Transport and Communicati-|26,300 | |ons | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Environment and Urbanizat-|5,700 | |ion | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Labor and Human Affairs |86,700 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Health |3,200 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Education and Sports |62,100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Science and Technology |13,300 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ministry of Culture |9,600 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [Box, p 3] Salaries Taxed at 45.4 Percent Minister Gaspari: "The government does not expect an increase in the tax rate.
