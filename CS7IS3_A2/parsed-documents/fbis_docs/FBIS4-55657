Three party members decided to leave the SZS before the coming elections and have launched a petition campaign, the aim of which is to register the "genuinely Slovak Green Party." One of the founders of the new party is a former SZS member, who was recently caught as she unlawfully manipulated the registration cards of SZS members. [passage omitted] Only 17 days after this incident, she set up the new party. According to the SZS Presidium, the three signatories of the appeal for the establishment of the new party distinguished themselves by minimal activism in protecting the environment, and their departure represents no loss for the SZS from this viewpoint.
