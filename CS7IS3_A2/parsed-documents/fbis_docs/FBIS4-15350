Otherwise, "local residents scared by the 1992 war will simply not let the Army out, regarding it as a guarantor of peace and stability in the Dniester region", he noted, commenting on the progress of Russian-Moldovan talks on withdrawal of the 14th Army from the former Soviet Republic. According to General Lebed, a sort of military and political balance has spontaneously developed in this region of Moldova. If Russian troops are pulled out before the crisis is settled, it may upset the fragile balance and revive the conflict. The commander believes that even after peace guarantees are furnished, "the Army should stay in the region for some time to make sure that political decisions are being properly implemented". However, "no steps have been taken so far to settle the conflict between Kishinev and Tiraspol," Lebed pointed out. The Russian commander said "the situation in the republic has radically changed following Moldova's parliamentary elections and plebiscite on independence. Dniester authorities were taken unawares by these events and are presently searching for new decisions. I will judge about Tiraspol's position by whom President Igor Smirnov will name to head the negotiating team. If these are the same leaders -- Vasiliy Yakovlev or Anna Volkova -- there will be no serious dialogue," General Lebed stressed. The 14th Army commander believes that Russia's peacekeeping role in settling conflicts on CIS borders has good prospects. "Russian officers in the Dniester region managed to iron out the differences, which could have never been smoothed by peacekeepers from third countries. This is just a matter of psychology: People who once served in the same Army know one another quite well. Very often, they drop official attitudes and solve their problems in terms of human relations. This proves extremely helpful," he emphasised. General Lebed expressed concern over the current ambiguous status of the 14th Russian Army. He said favourable economic conditions should be cretaed for the Army's withdrawal. "We should offer something to people coming to a new place instead of withdrawing them to the open country, as it was in 1988-89," the commander pointed out. In today's interview with the Kishinev newspaper "MAKLER-TELEGRAF," Lebed denied any involvement into political activities in the Dniester region. He said he had stepped down as a deputy of the Dniester supreme legislature after Dniester militants were sent to Moscow to defend the dissolved Russian Parliament. Speaking of last October's events in Moscow, the commander confirmed that he had been invited to take part but rejected the proposal. Lebed dismissed allegations about his unofficial relations with former Vice- President Aleksandr Rutskoy and said he had no intention "to play his part in Russian politics."
