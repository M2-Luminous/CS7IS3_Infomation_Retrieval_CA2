Wrapping up the historic debate on his opening speech to South Africa's first democratically elected Parliament, Mr Mandela paid tribute to the central role played by the people and their many organisations in gaining democracy. Quoting the Freedom Charter, Mr Mandela traced the struggle for democracy. "Today, all the members of the house, no matter which party you belong to, are here in the full knowledge that you are the legitimate representative of the will of the people," he said. The ANC had resisted undemocratic attempts to shackle majority rule. "The plan for a government of democratic unity we put forward -- and which is now operative -- is inclusive and democratic," he said. The ANC had expanded its primary Cosatu [Congress of South African Trade Unions]/SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance to include the patriotic front, with its commitment to inclusivity for the sake of nation-building finding its latest expression in the government of national unity. "Admonitions directed at our address about the dangers of a majority party abusing its majority to stifle and swamp smaller parties are, therefore, grossly misplaced. Our record in this regard should certainly speak for itself." "We are not expecting uncritical adulation and applause." The people's confidence in the future should not however be undermined by constant insinuations that the ANC was indifferent to the concerns of political minorities when it had consistently demonstrated how seriously those concerns were taken. "Our objective is to continue operating in this balanced way, true to the precept of the Freedom Charter that all national groups shall have equal rights, the overriding obligation of course being to meet the needs and improve the lives of the suffering people." He was encouraged that this was generally agreed to by all parties. He said there had been moving moments in the debate as speakers responded to the exciting, inspirational and liberating possibilities and realities of new-found South Africanness. "Listening to our Afrikaner compatriots in this house hailing the dawn of the new democratic South Africa as an event of liberation for themselves rather than an experience of loss; hearing the honourable leader of the Freedom Front (General Constand Viljoen) publicly acknowledging and paying tribute to the demonstrated desire of the majority party to create an inclusive nation where there is place for all -- these were some of the moments which captured the new spirit abroad in our land." These responses had demonstrated an encouraging generosity of spirit, reciprocating the generosity abundantly displayed by the oppressed and suffering people who had mandated their leaders to negotiate a future of peace, forgiveness and inclusivity.
