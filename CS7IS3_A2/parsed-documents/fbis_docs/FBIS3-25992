Provincial party Deputy Secretary Zhi Yiming, Vice Govenor Xu Shanlin, and leaders from the Ministry of State Security attended and addressed the meeting. Zhang Yongkui, chief of the Shaanxi Provincial State Security Department, made a work report. The meeting pointed out: Since the introduction of reform and opening up in Shaanxi, the situation has developed very fast. But the better the situation, the more we should heighten our vigilance. At present, the world is not quite peaceful, factors causing instability are increasing, and spy and intelligence organizations as well as some hostile forces outside the borders keep carrying out sabotage activities. The province has a heavy task of defending state security. Viewed from the angle of opposing peaceful evolution and preserving the country's prolonged stability and tranquility, we must correctly understand the importance of strengthening state security, remain sober-minded and maintain vigilance against enemy movements on the concealed front, and strengthen the province's state security. The meeting requested all offices, mass organizations, enterprises, and institutions to frequently carry out education on state security among their personnel, to solidly cultivate the mentality of everyone being responsible for state security, to help state security institutions with their work, and to crack down on all kinds of crimes damaging state security to ensure the smooth carrying out of reform, opening up, and economic construction.
