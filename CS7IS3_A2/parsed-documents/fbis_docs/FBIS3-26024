Therefore, they possess traits of both legal responsibilities and their own. Civil liabilities possess the following legal traits: 1) Civil liabilities are enforced by state compulsory measures. Compulsory enforcement by the state is an important feature of legal responsibilities, as well as civil liabilities. This is a major difference between civil liabilities and moral obligations. 2) Civil liabilities are legal responsibilities arising from failure to perform civil obligations in violation of the demands of the Civil Law. Civil liabilities differ from civil obligations; civil liabilities are not civil obligations but the legal consequences of not performing such obligations. In other words, civil liabilities are predicated on civil obligations. 3) Civil liabilities are mainly responsibilities regarding property. It is the common task for laws governing various activities, as well as a task for the Civil Law, to protect socialist public property and the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal entities. Nevertheless, protection measures under the Civil Law possess traits different from those of laws governing other activities. This fact determines the Civil Law's scope and principles. 4) Citizens and legal entities are encouraged to conscientiously perform their civil obligations and fight against lawbreaking acts. Civil liabilities can be divided into two major categories: contractual and tortious liabilities. Contractual liabilities, also called liabilities arising from contractual violations, mean civil liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties who violate contracts. Tortious liabilities, also called liabilities arising from causing people harm, mean civil liabilities that should be undertaken by the parties who infringe on state and collectively owned property, as well as the property and persons of other people. There are four general principles governing civil liabilities: 1) The principle of protecting the legitimate civil rights and interests of civil rights principals. This principle calls for holding any unit or individual civilly liable for infringing on other people's civil rights and legitimate rights and interests. 2) The principle of fixing responsibility for errors. This is the principle of assigning civil liabilities, which holds the performer of an act civilly liable for his or her erroneous act. 3) The principle of fairness in assigning responsibility. It urges people's courts to seek truth from facts, show fairness and reasonableness, and abide by the law in handling civil cases. Courts should uphold the principle of fixing responsibility for errors without unduly focusing on the errors. They should consider the interests of both parties and correctly handle civil disputes so as to enhance harmony and unity between the parties and benefit their production and lives. 4) The principle of exoneration as a consequence of force majeure. Except otherwise provided for by law, the parties concerned are absolved from responsibility for not honoring contracts or causing other people harm as a consequence of force majeure.
