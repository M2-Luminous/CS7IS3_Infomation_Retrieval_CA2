FR940217-1-00080 FR940217-1-00014 Other contractual requirements would include, in the case of a third-party servicer disbursing or delivering funds under the Title IV, HEA programs or other funds to students, a requirement that the servicer confirm a student's eligibility before disbursing or delivering those funds to the student. A contract with that servicer also would require the servicer to agree to calculate and pay refunds and repayments in accordance with applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations. Any contract with a third-party servicer would have to provide for the return to the institution of all applicable records and funds held by the servicer if either party terminates the contract, if the servicer stops providing services for the administration of a Title IV, HEA program, or if the servicer goes out of business or files a petition under the Bankruptcy Code. The servicer would have to return not only Title IV, HEA program funds, but also institutional or other funds held by the servicer for the purposes of the Title IV, HEA program for which the servicer no longer provides services. Consistent with the time frames for other reporting requirements in 34 CFR part 600 that could affect an institution's eligibility or participation, this section also would require an institution to notify the Secretary, within 10 days, each time the institution enters into a new contract with a third-party servicer or significantly modifies an existing contract or if such a contract is terminated. The Secretary intends this provision to cover substantive modifications to existing contracts, such as the inclusion of additional responsibilities or any significant increase in the volume of work performed, and not to cover minor modifications such as a routine adjustment of the compensation owed to a third-party servicer due to inflation. This section also would require the institution to notify the Secretary, within 10 days, if a third-party servicer stops providing services for the administration of a Title IV, HEA program, goes out of business, or files a petition under the Bankruptcy Code. Any notification from an institution would have to include the name and address of the servicer. Upon the request of the Secretary, an institution that has a contract with a third-party servicer would have to provide information relevant to the contract and to the servicer's responsibilities for administering Title IV, HEA programs as well as a copy of the contract. These changes are necessary for proper monitoring of and accountability for Title IV, HEA program funds. The requirement for a third-party servicer to agree in a contract to observe all applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements, special arrangements, agreements, and limitations is necessary to avoid situations where the servicer improperly argues that it cannot comply with these actions due to provisions in its contract with an institution. The provisions governing the circumstances under which a third-party servicer must return records and funds to an institution are necessary to protect the interests of participating institutions and students in the event that a third-party servicer is no longer able to provide the services promised under a contract. In addition, the notification provisions would help keep the Secretary informed about those third-party servicers authorized to administer the Title IV, HEA programs on behalf of an institution, would assist the Secretary in providing appropriate materials and funds only to authorized third-party servicers, and would help the Secretary to obtain timely access to institutional records. Section 668.81‚ê£Scope and special definitions. The Secretary proposes to amend this section to provide that the Secretary may initiate an emergency action against an institution or third-party servicer, fine an institution or servicer or limit, suspend, or terminate the institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program or the servicer's eligibility to contract with an institution to administer any aspect of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, if the institution's servicer, acting under contract with the institution, violates any statutory provision of or applicable to Title IV of the HEA, any regulatory provision prescribed under that statutory authority, or any applicable special arrangement, agreement, or limitation prescribed under the authority of Title IV of the HEA. This change also makes clear that an institution is always responsible for the actions of its servicers regarding its participation in the Title IV, HEA programs and remains subject to possible administrative action.
