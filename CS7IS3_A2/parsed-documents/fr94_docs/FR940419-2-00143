FR940419-2-00143 FR940419-2-00085 Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 75␣/␣Tuesday, April 19, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3705; FR&hyph;3561&hyph;N&hyph;02] States That Receive a Match Reduction Under the HOME Investment Partnerships Program Because of Fiscal Distress or Severe Fiscal Distress AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, HUD. ACTION: Notice of match reduction under the HOME program. SUMMARY: Starting with Fiscal Year 1993 funds, participating jurisdictions must provide a 25 percent matching contribution for HOME funds drawn from the participating jurisdiction's Treasury accounts for rental assistance, housing rehabilitation and acquisition of standard housing, and a 30 percent matching contribution for HOME funds drawn for new construction, unless the participating jurisdiction has received a reduction in the match requirement. This notice provides information on the level of fiscal distress for each State and indicates those States that receive a reduction in the match requirement for Fiscal Year 1994 because they are in fiscal distress or severe fiscal distress. DATES: The match reductions published in this notice are applicable for FY 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Kolesar, Director, Program Policy Division, Office of Affordable Housing Programs, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20410, telephone (202) 708&hyph;2470, TDD (202) 708&hyph;2565. (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Match Reduction for States A HOME interim rule is published elsewhere in today's Federal Register . Section 92.222(a) of this interim rule sets out the criteria for determining fiscal distress and severe fiscal distress for participating jurisdictions that are States. This notice is published to announce the States that receive a match reduction for Fiscal Year 1994 under these distress criteria. This notice lists all States (as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia which are, by statute, defined as States for the HOME Program), the average per capita income (PCI) for each, how the State's PCI relates to the national average PCI (which was $14,277 for 1989, the latest data available), the percent of each State's families in poverty and how that relates to the national average (which was 10.58 percent in 1990), the average personal income growth rate in the State over the most recent four quarters, and how that relates to the national personal income growth rate during that period (which was 5.4 percent from the end of the third quarter of 1992 to the end of the third quarter of 1993). Thus, to qualify under the PCI criterion, the PCI for the State must be less than $10,708. To qualify under the poverty criterion, the State's percent of families in poverty must be 13.23 percent or higher, and to qualify under the personal income growth rate, the State's rate must be 4.0 percent or less. As the interim rule indicates, States that satisfy one of the criteria are considered in fiscal distress and receive a 50 percent match reduction for the term specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(4). States that satisfy at least two of the three distress criteria are considered in severe fiscal distress and receive a 100 percent match reduction for the period specified at 24 CFR 92.222(a)(3). The list of States follows as appendix A to this notice. Dated: April 8, 1994. Andrew Cuomo, Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.
