Because of Singapore's strategic location and excellent facilities such as its international airport, he said, the Republic could serve as a distribution point for tourists going to Indonesia. He made these points when he received Singapore Foreign Minister Prof S. Jayakumar, who called on him at the presidential office, Bina Graha, yesterday. The Indonesian leader expressed keen interest in getting Singapore's contribution in promoting tourism. Prof Jayakumar told THE STRAITS TIMES after the meeting that "we agreed that this was an area for further cooperation for the mutual benefit of both countries." Singapore receives an average of six million visitors a year, compared to Indonesia's three million. Mr Suharto also noted the progress made in the development of Bintan, Batam and Karimun in the Riau province, in which Singapore had a role under the Growth Triangle that includes Johor. With such a development, he said, there would be more opportunities for Singapore investors to invest here. Prof Jayakumar is in Jakarta for a two-day official visit at the invitation of his Indonesian counterpart Ali Alatas, with whom he had an hour of talks on Monday. During his meeting with Mr Suharto, they also discussed the preparation for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which Indonesia is hosting here in December. "We noted that both Indonesia and Singapore shared common interests in the value of APEC and how it would be of benefit to ASEAN countries," he said. Mr Suharto, who is currently chairman of the 110-member Non-Aligned Movement, took over the chairmanship of APEC after the heads of government gathering in Seattle last November. APEC comprises the six members of ASEAN, the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mexico and Papua New Guinea. On bilateral relations, they noted that there were good personal ties between leaders and officials. They agreed to look for ways to strengthen ties between the new crop of ministers and officials. Prof Jayakumar, who is also the Law Minister, was accompanied by Singapore's Ambassador to Indonesia Edward Lee. He also called on his counterpart, Utoyo Usman, at his office yesterday. Summing up his impressions of the visit before flying home yesterday afternoon, he said: "It has been a very good trip". His visit is part of the traditional series of courtesy calls made by newly-appointed ASEAN foreign ministers on their counterparts. Prof Jayakumar, who has already visited Kuala Lumpur and Bandar Seri Begawan, will be going to Bangkok and Manila as well.
