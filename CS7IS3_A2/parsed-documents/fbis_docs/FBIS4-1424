Swart] [Text] Johannesburg April 28 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] hinted on Thursday [28 April] it might not accept the outcome of the election, which it said were not free and fair. At a news conference in Johannesburg, IFP Transvaal political director Themba Khoza said: "At the end of the day, we will remember this election as embarrassing -- the most embarrassing election this country has ever had." He said there were feelings within the IFP that the party should either withdraw from the election or declare it unfair and not free. The IFP would do everything to avoid this. "Of course, we want to save the situation, else there will be chaos." Mr Khoza said the main problem was ballot papers which did not include the IFP sticker. "Voters have their identity checked and go through the process at the polling stations. But at the last stage, when they want to make their cross they find no IFP name. Many people went away without making a cross -- now they have ink on their hands and cannot vote." Mr Khoza urged IFP supporters to go back to the polls "ink or no ink" and cast their votes. The Independent Electoral Commission would have to accept this. Asked how the IEC would be able to prevent voters who supported parties other than the IFP from voting a second time, Mr Khoza said: "We are open to suggestion." In addition to the ballot paper problem, IFP supporters were being threatened by ANC members at the polls and were encountering a hostile attitude from IEC officials, Mr Khoza claimed. "Our people are also being tricked into voting for the National Party. Officials tell them if there is no IFP name they should make the cross at the bottom -- the space reserved for the NP." The IEC should have heeded the IFP's request for a postponement of the election -- not only to give the party a chance to campaign, but to avoid the "inefficiency and chaos" at the polls. "We wonder whether or not we should accept the outcome of this election. While we have every reason to declare this election null and void, we are trying to avoid this by making other suggestions. The issue is sensitive and the slightest mistake could cost the country dear." While he was "very depressed" at the way the election was being run, Mr Khoza said voters' attitude to the IFP was impressive. "If the election was based on constituency instead of proportional representation, we would be in Parliament running the show."
