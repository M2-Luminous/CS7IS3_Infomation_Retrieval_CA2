The experts agree, however, that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy, which has been criticized for its zigzag course, does contain a pragmatic element of willingness to compromise. However unsuccessful Secretary of State Warren Christopher's Beijing talks that made human rights the precondition for renewing the most-favored-nation clause may seem, there is little doubt that Clinton's team will find a way out of the dilemma. The positive signals by Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen indicate that Clinton does not want to become a prisoner of his election campaign promises. In these calculations, the nuclear potential of North Korea, which is still resisting inspections, still plays an important role. In a Security Council debate on sanctions, China's veto could still bring about a decision. In view of the great number of Iranian "defense attaches" discovered by the South Koreans in Pyongyang, nuclear nonproliferation remains a crucial topic for the White House. The Chinese are not the only ones encouraged to take a tougher course by the noticeable power vacuum in Washington. The Russians are claiming power in Bosnia and the Middle East. The recent blocking of stricter sanctions against Iraq by China, Russia, and France has shown that Security Council decisions opposed to U.S. interests may face opposition as well. Meanwhile, Washington is trying to get the disrupted Israeli-Palestinian autonomy talks going again by a number of security policy compromises and to keep the reins of this complex peace process in hand by roping in Syria's Hafiz al-Asad, Jordan's King Husayn, and Lebanon's president. Clinton and his team concentrating on social reforms have had to learn that foreign-policy developments are hard to control. The fact that debates on regional conflicts, which have often been regarded as nuisance, are very well suited to diverting attention from the Whitewater scandal is something that even people from the depths of Arkansas have realized. With "pragmatic partnership," Clinton's new defense secretary, William J. Perry, is trying to find a basis for America's Russia policy that is more acceptable to Congress because it is geared to security policy, not so much on reform assistance as it used to be. This policy might be consolidated by Moscow's participation in the "Partnership for Peace." Recently, Clinton was able to bask in the light of the Bosnian Croat-Muslim confederation ceremony. What is also certain, however, is that a U.S. President taking a pragmatic course makes U.S. foreign policy difficult to assess for a world that is waiting for someone to take the lead.
