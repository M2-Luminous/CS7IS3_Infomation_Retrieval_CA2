The deputy head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhu Shanqing, told YONHAP in an interview: "China abstained from voting when the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution on North Korea and this is China's latest position. But the North Korean nuclear problem should be resolved by continuous dialogue between South and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North Korea." Zhu, who arrived here on March 16 at the invitation of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, appeared to be hinting that he opposes sanctions against Pyongyang. Asked whether Chinese President Jiang Zemin will come to Seoul, he said, "Jiang will certainly visit Seoul. Since this is an important matter, Jiang and President Kim Yong-sam will consult on it when they meet in Beijing next week." President Kim's visit to China will help strengthen bilateral ties remarkably, Zhu said, adding that the planned trip by DLP Secretary-General Mun Chong-su to Beijing will help improve relations and mutual understanding between the DLP and the Chinese Communist Party. "This visit to Seoul was very helpful and I found many common aspects in politics, economics and culture between the two countries," he said.
