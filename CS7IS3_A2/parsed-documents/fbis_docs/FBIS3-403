Addressing a news conference in Pretoria after the rightwing transitional assembly's decision to boycott the elections, Gen Viljoen ruled out all possibility of continuing with the electoral process. His dramatic 11th-hour registration of the Freedom Front on Friday night would be allowed to lapse and no candidate lists would be submitted, Gen Viljoen said. The "provisional" registration of the Freedom Front had been a "strategic option" to put to the transitional assembly but was rejected at the session. The decision had not been taken unanimously but by a "vast majority." Both Gen Viljoen and transitional assembly "President" Ferdi Hartzenberg denied there was a split looming in the AVF's ranks over the issue of going to the polls. Gen Viljoen said he was happy with the rightwing transitional assembly's decision. Dr Hartzenberg said the boycott would diminish the legitimacy of the polls and the AVF would not be part of subjecting the Afrikaner people to communist rule. Continued pressure would be placed on the polls, he added. They still wanted a plebiscite or a referendum to determine support for the volkstaat and its borders. "I have an obsession to arrive at a position where my people will survive," the general added. International mediation was still an option and negotiations would carry on, he said. Said Dr Hartzenberg: "We and others are not accommodated and the ball is in court of government and the African National Congress." The borders of the volkstaat were not made known on Saturday, but the map had been distributed among transitional assembly members and would be discussed at a later stage, he added. Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene Terreblanche also expressed his satisfaction with the decision. Dr Hartzenberg said AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's decision to register the organisation on Friday night for the election was "good," but the assembly had considered all the benefits and drawbacks and decided not participate in the election. Referring to the "provisional" registration for the polls by the Inkatha Freedom Party, an AVF Freedom Alliance [FA] partner, Dr Hartzenberg said the FA members were free to each make their own decision as to whether to participate in the poll. Different decisions would not affect the FA's unity, he said. Dr Hartzenberg's announcement was applauded by rightwing supporters who attended the open session of the assembly's meeting in the Dutch Reformed Church synodal centre. All the leading rightwing figures, including the Mulder brothers, were present. Outside the venue, rightwingers displayed a banner criticising Gen Viljoen's provisional registration. It said participation in the election would amount to treason.
