The BELGA news agency learned this from government circles. Some 800 paracommandos were put on standby as early as yesterday evening. They are standing by to evacuate the 1,500 Belgians in Rwanda and if necessary, also other foreigners, should the Belgian Government so decide. The Cabinet reconvenes at 1500 hours [1400 GMT] to discuss the situation in Rwanda. It will decide whether an evacuation will be launched. At the military airport of Melsbroek, security has been put on standby. However, the men have received the direct command to say nothing. France, too, is said to be considering deploying its troops in the central African republic for a possible evacuation of its fellow countrymen, but for the time being, no decision has been made. There are some 600 French in Rwanda, most of them living in Kigali. [passage omitted]
