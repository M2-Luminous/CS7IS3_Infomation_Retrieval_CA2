These promises have been fulfilled, unlike the promises to create a free economic zone, to promote industry, and to make Kalmykia a center of world trade and tourism. On 26 April 1993, the republic's Council of Ministers and the heads of rayon administrations laid down their powers. The president undertook the formulation of the government and the appointment of presidential representatives to the rayons. Only two of the 13 former heads of administration became such representatives. The disbanding of the Supreme Soviet took place rather quietly and in an apparently painless manner for the republic. At its last session, the Supreme Soviet simply adopted the decision to disband itself--only two deputies voted against it. Work had been performed with each deputy. The president had met with practically all of them, and, pressuring some and promising something to others, he achieved the necessary outcome of the voting. A professional parliament comprised of 25 members was created on the basis of the Supreme Soviet. The list was presented by the president and consisted primarily of his supporters. During the 11 months of its existence, the parliament never once spoke out against the president, even on the most minor matters. In 1994 the republic press began calling this a puppet parliament. The parliament members did not take offense at this, which was not surprising. After all, there have beem known cases of repeal of certain parliament decisions which the president did not like for some reason. The rayon level was left without even any formal representative institutions. The president's representatives became the masters there. The structure of power in the republic turned into a pyramid, subordinated to the president, whose slightest whims were not only carried out by the structures of executive power, but also legitimized by the quasi-parliament. After the elections, the opposition in the republic found itself shattered and demoralized. The parties of democratic orientation--the RPRF [Republican Party of the Russian Federation] and the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], initially spoke out in support of the president, agreeing even to voluntary self-dissolution (this was one of the principles of candidate Ilyumzhinov's pre-electoral program). The Cossacks and the religious associations followed suit. Finding themselves in the real opposition to the president were the "Slavs of Kalmykia" movement, the Kalmyk organization of the CPRF [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] and the Free Party of Kalmykia--the party of the Association of Farmers of Kalmykia, the only one of the listed organizations which had a material base and some influence. Already by the Fall of 1993, it was becoming clear that the large-scale projects for flourishing of the republic's economy according to Ilyumzhinov were experiencing a collapse. Ilyumzhinov was not able to add to his authority also among the regional leaders. He continued to be perceived as an outsider, primarily because his goals and intentions remained unclear. During the Moscow events of 21 September - 4 October 1993, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov tried to play solo. It seems the Kalmyk president increased his rating, making people speak much about him. However, this was only at first glance, and only in the "western" understanding of political ratings. In the political space of Russia such actions led to Ilyumzhinov's total political defeat. Ilyumzhinov lost even more after 4 October, when he in fact expressed full loyalty to the President of Russia. Here we should remember that open opposition to Yeltsin during those days was demonstrated only by two republic leaders--Khakasia Supreme Soviet representative Shtygashev and Ilyumzhinov. However, Shtygashev, whose position in his republic was must less stable than that of Ilyumzhinov, did not repent in anything, and the Center did not dare touch him. Yet, even if it had wanted to, Moscow could not have touched Ilyumzhinov. By the Spring of 1994 it became ultimately clear that the republic was in such a difficult position as never before. Moreover, it became known that the credit in the amount of 14 billion rubles (R) obtained from the RF Central Bank in November 1992 by the commercial bank "Step," which was controlled by Ilyumzhinov, judging by the reporting note of Minister of Internal Affairs of Russia V. Yerin, had gone for conversion to currency funds for a group of persons headed by Ilyumzhinov. The compromise was set in motion after the events of 3-4 October in Moscow, but then the matter was frozen, not without some grounds, as many observers believe, in exchange for Ilyumzhinov's initiative. As a result, the republic found itself without money, and people did not get their wages for several months. And here a political crisis ensued, triggered by the president's announcement about abolishing the republic's constitution. On 8 February 1994 the session of parliament adopted an amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia-Khalmg Tangch, according to which the words "sovereign" and "sovereignty" were deleted from the constitution. The justification for this was the adoption of the new Constitution of Russia, which stated that Russia is a federative state. The decision was discussed and adopted, naturally, at the proposal of the president. This event did not evoke any particular emotion in the republic. However, already on 11 March at the expanded session of the parliament, the president announced that he would repeal the republic's constitution and would declare the direct effect of the federal constitution on the territory of Kalmykia. This announcement by Ilyumzhinov could not remain without consequences. Heated discussions flared at the closed meeting of parliament which was held immediately after the expanded one. Six deputies spoke out against the president's announcements. Among these six was the editor-in-chief of the official government newspaper IZVESTIYA KALMYKIYI, Mankya Koneyev. Ilyumzhinov suggested to Koneyev that he submit his voluntary resignation. The president's press secretary was appointed as the new editor-in-chief of the newspaper. On 18 March, a session of the republic's parliament was held in Elista, devoted to the new Basic Law. A decree by which the Steppe Code must be approved by the Constitutional Assembly comprised of 300 members was adopted by a majority vote. On 22 March, the draft of the Steppe Code (Basic) Law) of the Republic of Kalmykia was published in the newspapers. The code was developed, apparently, in record time (no more than a week). According to the draft, the supreme power in the republic becomes the president. The Legislative Assembly--the People's Hural--may be disbanded by the president, for example, as follows: "The President of the Republic of Kalmykia may disband the People's Hural prior to expiration of its term if the People's Hural does not ensure stability in society." No mechanism for dismissing the president was provided in the code. The Constitutional Assembly was held on 5 April. The opposition did not participate in it. The representatives of the opposition parties and movements refused to propose candidates to the Constitutional Assembly, while 8 parliament deputies who had voted against the Steppe Code on 18 March did not attend. The assembly was held in one day and was concluded at 2:30 with the adoption of the Steppe Code. One person voted against it--the first secretary of the Kalmyk Republic Committee of the CPRF, and one other person abstained. Of all those who spoke, only one proposed amendments to the text of the code. The others criticized the opposition and said that the adoption of the code was a progressive step of world significance and that soon other republics would follow the example of Kalmykia. Hero of Socialist Labor and poet David Kugultinov presented a speech in which he announced that the very word "constitution" is deeply loathesome to him, since the constitution did not protect the Kalmyks during the time of Stalinism. Nevertheless, the most odious parts of the code were slightly re-worked. On 7 April, the decree of the Constitutional Assembly was published in the newspapers. Thus, the Republic of Kalmykia-Khalmg Tanch now bears the name of the Republic of Kalmykia, and it must live according to the Steppe Code (Basic Law) of the Republic of Kalmykia. That which is going on in Kalmykia is in line with the general tendencies of behavior of executive power in the regions of Russia, and reflects as if in a warped mirror all that is going on in the Russian center itself, at the top of the executive vertical. The tendency of President Ilyumzhinov toward theatrical effects and a certain political "Khlestakov mannerism" merely attract attention to the republic, and give the all-Russian processes a clearly apparent character. We will recall that Ilyumzhinov disbanded the Supreme Soviet of his republic five months before the Moscow events, and after 21 September and until the beginning of October 1993 sharply criticized Yeltsin specifically because he did not follow his lead--he did not fully take into consideration the Kalmyk experience. At that time these words were perceived as a curiosity. However, it is possible that it was specifically Ilyumzhinov's experience which was taken into consideration by presidential analysts in developing Edict No 1400. But even if this is not so, both cases of disbanding of the soviets were links in the same chain. After his election as president, Ilyumzhinov frankly exposed the motives for his future actions--"the opposition will get in the way"--and did not heed its admonitions about the necessity of the latter for democracy. It is characteristic that, in the words of Ilyumzhinov, the opposition may hinder the progress of economic reforms in the republic. All year President Ilyumzhinov spent at the top of the pyramid of power without any indications of hindrance from the opposition--and what about the reforms? Not one of the president's pre-electoral promises has been fulfilled. Moreover, the real economic situation in the republic has deteriorated. The republic needs subsidies for almost 100 percent of its budget--income from the sale of wool and other farm products is absent due to low purchase prices. The much-advertised projects for participation of foreign companies in the construction of an international airport and the provision of video and telephone services to every shepherd's station, as well as the idea of turning the republic into the capital of world Buddhism, were also from the realm of discussions on the topic of "it would be nice to build a bridge." However, a system of organs of power has been formulated which legitimizes a regime of uncontrolled personal power of the president. The exotic manner of the Kalmyk president's actions hinders Moscow observers from seeing an analogy. Certainly, the stories about Ilyumzhinov's mediation during the talks between Yeltsin and Nazarbayev, or the next idea about holding a meeting of the Dalai llama, the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia give reason to smile. But, in fact, we do not really want to smile. The executive power, which is dedicated to itself, is incapable of effectively resolving the real problems. Even if we discount the cases of outright corruption and expenditure of budget or attracted funds for personal needs (and such cases have been, are and will be)--even the most honest and best heads of administration are powerless under current conditions to make any global changes in the life of their region. They simply do not have the means for this. Under conditions of the absence of control on the part of the representative power, efforts to find these means at any cost may inflict tangible loss both upon the region and upon the state as a whole. As for Kalmykia's prospects, they are bleak. A new round of political confrontations in the republic is inevitable. The national problems, which have been long forgotten for the last two years, will also become more acute. But the main thing is that now the citizens of the republic will not be lured to any elections by any promises.
