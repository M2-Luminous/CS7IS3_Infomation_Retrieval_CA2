[passage omitted] Yesterday, after his audience with the prime minister, preceded by the one granted him by the president of the Republic, Mr. Juppe spoke to our correspondent Pierre Adipo. Let us listen to him. [Begin Juppe recording] First, I would like to thank the prime minister for devoting some of his time to me, despite his heavy schedule. In coming to Abidjan, you know it is my first official trip to francophone Africa, I wanted to demonstrate all the importance we attach to what happens in this country. The success of the economic reforms under way in the whole region will be staked here, and after this first series of meetings I must say that I am confident about the future. Courageous measures have been taken, they are being applied with a lot of determination, and the initial results are emerging. This is what I was discussing with the prime minister, but, of course, we also discussed cooperation between France and Cote d'Ivoire. You know that your country can count on my country's friendship.
