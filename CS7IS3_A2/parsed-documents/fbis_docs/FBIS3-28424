"Missile threat" and "export of missiles" by the DPRK is a false propaganda invented by those bent on stifling it by military force, the analyst says, and goes on: The U.S. bellicose quarters dislike the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and are trying to gratify their wild ambition for aggression on the DPRK at whatever cost. The U.S. hardline conservative forces are scheming to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea and build a "theatre missile defence system" together with Japan on the pretext of the DPRK's "nuclear and missile threat". This is aimed at maintaining and strengthening their military position which is in danger in northeast Asia owing to the economic and military aggrandizement of Japan and at tightening control on Japan and South Korea under the cloak of "security". As for the DPRK's defence power, it is self-defensive and the DPRK is a peaceloving state. Missile threat is presented not by the DPRK but by the United States which is working to maintain and strengthen their military position in Northeast Asia. The U.S. hardline conservative forces must not miscalculate the strength of the DPRK. If they increase their military forces and dare choose to use strength, we will make a corresponding choice.
