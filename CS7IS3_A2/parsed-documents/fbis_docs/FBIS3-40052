In an interview granted to us by the French foreign minister, he said that he was in favor of a "contract" between these powers that would allow them to revive efforts to accomplish an "overall peace plan" for Bosnia, before any international conference was held with all the sides involved. An incident near Tuzla on Tuesday [22 February] nearly led to NATO air intervention. [Trean] Why did we wait so long before issuing an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs? [Juppe] Quite simply because in diplomacy, as in life, decisions are made once the desire and a proper time have been established. We have long had the desire, as have some of our partners, but not everyone. There was a great deal of hesitation about the use of force by the Europeans, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces], and the United Nations, as well as by certain countries outside the European Union. Others were prepared to use any pressure, including force, and I believe that France was one of those. As for the timing, it was a result of the shock caused by the attack on the Sarajevo marketplace on 5 February -- although we might feel that that is emotional diplomacy and deplore the excessive influence of television and the images it shows. It was from that point that the desire, expressed more or less explicitly during the NATO summit in January, found the right time to crystallize. The arguments that we highlighted, and which had not been heard beforehand, were then heard as a result of that tragedy. [Trean] Could the same schema apply in other cases, in other words, could we loosen the siege of certain Muslim enclaves with the help of military pressure? [Juppe] I hope that we do not have to see the same tragedies repeated to do so. In my analysis, we do not currently need new ultimatums for the other safe areas. The system is perfectly operational and France is determined to ask for it to be used if necessary. For Tuzla, it has been decided to base the airplanes used in the airlift at the airport. If the Serb batteries hinder this, then there is no need for an ultimatum. NATO's air response can be instantaneous because we would be acting within the framework of adopted resolutions. The same holds true for Srebrenica, Gorazde, and the other safe areas. The problem could arise, however, in the other areas not covered by Resolution 836. Here, I am thinking of Mostar and Vitez. [Trean] So why has the Tuzla airport not been opened yet? [Juppe] Because the general line taken until the NATO ultimatum -- and that was where there was a turning point -- was to achieve the objective without using force. What UNPROFOR tried to do in Srebrenica and Tuzla was to apply the UN decisions by mutual consent, i.e., to gain the agreement of the Serbs. It was on the way to achieving this, since in Srebrenica things are getting under way and in Tuzla the date of 7 March was chosen on friendly terms. [Trean] Is there really a difference between "air support" and "air strikes?" [Juppe] Yes. The terms of the Sarajevo ultimatum were: You withdraw or we will strike. In the other safe areas, the terms are: If you attack us, we will respond. That is not the logic of an ultimatum. For the time being, we must try and use the momentum gained by Sarajevo to unblock the situation. Later on we will see whether we need other ultimatums. [Trean] A lot of UNPROFOR resources are converging on Sarajevo. Is that not a risk for the other areas? [Juppe] It is indeed a risk. It is true that we gave priority to Sarajevo. In the next few days we are going to run up against the question of UNPROFOR's total resources. That means two things: money and troops. France is prepared to redeploy its resources within Yugoslavia, but we are not in a position to increase the total number of troops. The British have taken more or less the same position. There is going to be a problem there. The American position is clear: No troops as long as an agreement has not been signed. However, in my opinion, if the United Nations genuinely wants to we can quite quickly find the needed reinforcements. }Sarajevo Under UN Administration [Trean] France asked a meeting of the Security Council to decree that Sarajevo be placed under UN administration. What does that mean in concrete terms? [Juppe] A Security Council meeting would be helpful at this point: First, to take stock of what has happened and to remark that progress has been made; and second, to recall the demand made by the United Nations and NATO, namely the lifting of the siege against Sarajevo. That particular element has not been obtained: The lifting of the siege does not mean simply stopping the shelling, but free movement and the unhindered flow of supplies to the city. There is also the matter of putting the idea of UN administration of Sarajevo into concrete terms via an official decision. This is part of the European peace plan, which was accepted by the parties involved, and which was accepted in principle by the Americans and the Russians. In concrete terms, this means defining a perimeter: the nine districts of Greater Sarajevo, for example. It also means appointing a UN authority that would exercise the power of administration or coordination for the entire area, whereas at present there are numerous players on the ground, both civilian and military. Lastly, the purpose of this resolution could be to ask this coordinator to quickly suggest the resources needed to effectively implement this administration -- here I am thinking of the running of essential public services, such as water, gas, etc.) so that the Security Council could deliberate on things apart from more or less subjective or theoretical assessments. [Trean] Administration evokes memories of the colonial mandates. That sounds like the relinquishment of sovereignty. [Juppe] There is currently a plan whose principles have been agreed, but which has not been signed. This plan, which includes the agreement concluded on board the Invincible in September 1993, notes that, for the Sarajevo region, we are not yet capable of reaching an agreement on the allocation of the territory between the Serbs and Muslims. [Trean] You mean on a division? [Juppe] In the absence of an agreement, we have decided that in Sarajevo power will be wielded by the United Nations for a period of two years, so that in the meantime the parties can reach an agreement on a definitive status. It is therefore a temporary administration so that this problem will not prevent the conclusion of a comprehensive agreement. That is the underlying thinking. This is not supervision forever. [Trean] What exactly will this UN authority cover? [Juppe] The city will be run by the United Nations. To do that it must be demilitarized, which presupposed controlling heavy weapons and infantry. [Trean] Did you talk about this with Mr. Izetbegovic last week? [Juppe] Mr. Izetbegovic agreed to the principle last November, but I did not talk to him about it in detail last week. We had other topics on our minds, particularly the ultimatum. [Trean] It seems pretty difficult to have it accepted by the Bosnians. [Juppe] The same is true for the Serbs. They are present in Sarajevo: There are Serb areas and Serb troops. It is valid for everyone. [Trean] But it is the capital of the Bosnian state. [Juppe] It is the capital of a state which currently does not exert its authority over all of Bosnia. We are therefore completely justified in obtaining this mandate on a provisional basis, just as in Mostar. Russian Game [Trean] The French approach contains the idea of a kind of role-sharing between the powers, with each one supposed to exert pressure on such and such a party in the conflict. Do you think that the Russians are going to play the game and really obtain concessions from the Serbs? Would they not rather play the old Russian-Serb alliance, as they have been doing virtually openly so far? [Juppe] The Russians have already obtained concessions from the Serbs. [Trean] Because there was an ultimatum that caused them considerable bother... [Juppe] First of all, this ultimatum remains binding. Next, everyone understands now that we had an interest in finding a solution. It is actually a bet on the attitude of both Russia and the United States: Has each party now really been persuaded that a rapid peace settlement must be found? That is what Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Clinton say. Peace Plan in Two Weeks [Trean] Mr. Yeltsin says it in the same sense as the Serbs, who are the first to want an agreement based on the current foundations. [Juppe] That has been true for a long time, for two reasons: Because they got what they wanted and because they have a real interest in obtaining a gradual lifting of the sanctions, but the Serbs finally gave up in Sarajevo. There were victory cries in Pale, but we have to make allowances for the intoxication: They yielded because they were in a situation of political and military inferiority and because the Russians told them to yield. So the game of wielding power over the parties has begun. The question now is to know whether the Russians are prepared to say to the Serbs: As regards the control of the territories, here are the few essential conditions needed to conclude an agreement. That is the only bet we are making -- just as we are betting on the American attitude. The Americans have already told the Bosnians: No provocation, respect the cease-fire, and put your weapons under UN control. That is what they got. Now, with our consent, they are exploring the idea with the Muslims and Croats of a Croat-Muslim confederation within the framework of the broad principles of the European plan, i.e., covering 51 percent of the territory. The whole question is knowing whether this game of Russian pressure on the Serbs and American pressure on the Muslims and Croats is going to be able to comprise a peace plan in the next two or four weeks that will be accepted by the Europeans and agreed by all parties. Croat-Muslim Confederation [Trean] Is France neutral in this game of pressure? [Juppe] No, France is not neutral, much less is it inactive. First of all, it is France that called on the Russians and Americans to enter the field. We now have two roles to play: The first is remembering that Europe is involved and that it is one of the parties involved; and the second is making sure that the various players involved, especially the Americans, are aware that the solution currently being worked out must not be a solution that pushes one of the parties aside. We must try and reconcile the viewpoints of the various parties. [Trean] So far the Croats have rejected the idea of a confederation... [Juppe] They have already suggested it. It is my understanding that the Croats and Muslims have already given their agreement in principle to this idea of a confederation. This raises many questions: Are we definitely sure that it is confined to the 51-percent limit on the territory (17.5 percent plus 33.3 percent)? I have been told yes. Will it comprise two confederal entities or will it be a confederation divided up into districts? This is not yet clear. One of the possibilities will be to have a single state with five districts: three Muslim districts, and two Croat districts. Third, will this entity -- whatever form it takes -- have links with the Serb entity? Will it be part of a Bosnia-Herzegovina that is theoretically independent and a member of the United Nations, with a Serb part and a Croat-Muslim part? Or, on the contrary, would it be a solution that would encourage the Serb part to take back its freedom and move closer to Belgrade? Owen And Stoltenberg `In Retreat' [Trean] Is the unity of Bosnia-Herzegovina no longer defended by anyone? [Juppe] In the current situation, it is a fiction. The Croat-Muslim confederation has at least one advantage: It makes it possible to solve the problem of access to the sea, which is one of the sticky points in the negotiations. The part of the territory that goes up to the port of Neum would belong to the confederation and, in the event of a secession, it would return -- under full sovereignty -- to that party of the confederation not responsible for the secession. However, it remains to be seen whether this solution is acceptable to the Serbs. [Trean] Would that involve a few concessions by them? [Juppe] It would assume that the Serbs and Muslims agree to discuss enclaves in the east and possible arrangements in central Bosnia. [Trean] Do you think that all this will be feasible? [Juppe] That is the question we are asking ourselves today, especially bearing in mind the breakdown in the discussion process. [Trean] Are the negotiators, Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg, losing their grip on the negotiations? [Juppe] Messrs. Owen and Stoltenberg agreed to step back a little to see what the current talks yield. So when and how are we going to get everyone to sit down around the table and see if we reach a feasible solution? We must get there as fast as possible. `Our Essential Interests' [Trean] Are you thinking of a new international conference? [Juppe] No, first of all, I am thinking of contacts between the various players involved. That could then lead to something that will resemble an international conference. The Russians suggested it, and so did the Germans, but the Americans are a bit hesitant and I share their hesitance: Before committing ourselves to this kind of exercise, there must be an agreement between the Americans, Russians, and us on the basis of an overall settlement. [Trean] What, for you, is a "feasible" plan? [Juppe] The best peace plan is a plan that can be accepted by everyone. [Trean] Does this exercise between great powers also involve Croatia, Kosovo, and Macedonia? [Juppe] It will have to, but what we are currently discussing is a settlement in Bosnia. The rest will be the topic of a large conference. The situation is actually more stable in Krajina and there are Croat-Serb talks which, according to President Tudjman, are tending to make progress. As for Kosovo and Macedonia, things will be more difficult. The international community recognizes the sovereignty of Serbia in Kosovo. We will have to obtain the guarantee that the rights of minorities in Kosovo will be guaranteed and respected. This will have to be obtained within the framework of, say, another exercise, such as the large conference on the Balkans. [Trean] Can we tackle the problem of Macedonia, while Greece is president of the European Union? [Juppe] That has not stopped practically every country of the European Union from expressing a certain amount of displeasure at the recent Greek initiatives. All this is unreasonable. The Greeks must be encouraged to resume the negotiation process. Of course, Macedonia too must make some gestures. But such gestures will not be obtained by a blockade. [Trean] In your opinion does France have a particular responsibility in this region? [Juppe] As the president of the Republic said: "It regards us." Indeed, it concerns us for many reasons: Because it is in the middle of Europe; because there are enormous risks of it spreading; because the conference on stability in Europe advocated by the prime minister would have much more weight if we managed to unblock this matter; and because it calls into question the entire policy of enlarging the European Union to include the countries of central and eastern Europe. The two big problems in European integration by the year 2000 will be enlargement and security. We cannot suppose that there will be a sort of enclave in the Balkans that does not concern us. I truly think that our interests -- perhaps not our vital interests, but certainly our essential interests -- are at stake in this affair, and that justifies us devoting time and energy to it.
