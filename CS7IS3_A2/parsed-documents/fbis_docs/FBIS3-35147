(Lel) stated that Akol was dismissed because of intensive pressure brought to bear by foreign forces and the so-called alliance against Lam Akol's opposition to a reunion with rebel Garang. He pointed out that Machar was not empowered to dismiss Lam Akol by himself. (Lel) attacked Garang, describing him as a criminal and a double-crosser. Machar and Akol had led the faction that split from Garang in August 1991. They formed the Nasir group, which fought in fierce battles against Garang in some areas, with both sides incurring heavy loses. The conflict then turned into mutual retaliatory campaigns and attempts at tribal revenge, the last of which took place last week when tribes from upper Nile and Bahr al-Ghazal attacked a camp west of Nimule housing the families of combatants of the Garang faction, many of whom fled to Uganda.
