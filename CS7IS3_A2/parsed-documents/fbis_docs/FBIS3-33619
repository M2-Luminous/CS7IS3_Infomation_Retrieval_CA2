CAF Chairman Enrique Garcia Rodriguez told LA MANANA that the agreement will be instrumental in helping Aladi member countries in their integration drive. The article quotes Garcia Rodriguez as saying: "We believe we can play a support role in trade exchanges between the different integration areas like the Andean Group; the Common Market of the South; the group of three -- Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela; the Central American Common Market; and Chile, which even though it is not a member of these groups, furthers an open policy toward integration." Garcia Rodriguez noted: "Seventy percent of CAF credits are earmarked for bolstering private initiatives."
