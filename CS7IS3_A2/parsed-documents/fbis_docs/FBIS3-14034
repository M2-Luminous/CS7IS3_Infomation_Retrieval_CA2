He had earlier expressed the view that an `independent' Kashmir was being sought by Washington so that it could serve as `spying post' against China within the grand strategy of `encirclement'. According to him, the continuation in force of the Pressler Amendment was a victory of Jewish and Hindu lobbies against Pakistan. On the American insistence that India and Pakistan should normalise their relations, the general is of the view that the two South Asian states are sought to be brought together as a par tof the `encirclement' policy by Washington. Needless to say, the retired chief of the army staff is saying things that people want to hear, given the political environment in Pakistan. Because there is such a uniformity of intellectual opinion in the country, some rules of debate are not being observed, somewhat like the one way debates shown on PTV. At the risk of being called Jewish agent, let us look at the views expressed by the general who, it must be said in all fairness, believes in debate. Would an `independent' Kashmir be a good listening post against China when a much less isolated Nepal or even Pakistan would be available? What kind of `listening' would Washington want in addition to the satellite surveillance it already has over China? Would it want to use Kashmir militarily when it has missiles that can be delivered effectively and probably more accurately from the Indian Ocean? [passage omitted] *
