FBIS4-34694 "drlat121_m_94010" FBIS-LAT-94-121 Daily Report 23 Jun 1994 Brazil Corruption Charges Against Senator, Deputy Dismissed Corruption Charges Against Senator, Deputy Dismissed PY2306023594 Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television in Portuguese 0000 GMT 23 Jun 94 PY2306023594 Rio de Janeiro Rede Globo Television Portuguese BFN [Text] Surprising decisions were made today in Congress. Despite recommendations by the respective Constitution and Justice Committees, the plenums of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies respectively today dismissed charges against Senator Ronaldo Aragao and Deputy Ezio Ferreira. The process against Senator Aragao began four months ago, and evidence that he was guilty was produced every step of the way. The Senate special committee recommended early this month that Aragao be impeached. Yet the plenum of the Senate today reached an altogether different decision. Facing charges of having moved $700,000 in his banking accounts in one year and of having obtained benefits from construction companies, Aragao -- the only senator included on the list of the Congressional Investigating Committee on the budget scandal -- will not be impeached. In a secret vote, 28 senators voted for the impeachment, while 19 voted against it. Because 41 votes were needed to impeach Aragao, the process against him was dismissed. Upon leaving the Senate, Aragao declined to make remarks to reporters. He only said that he was relieved and that the Senate has done justice. There was also surprise in the Chamber of Deputies, which today heard the case of Deputy Ezio Ferreira, who was charged with moving 35 billion real cruzeiros in his banking accounts and having received checks from construction firms. Despite a recommendation approved earlier by the Constitution and Justice Committee that Ferreira be impeached, the plenum today dismissed the charges against him. Ferreira's attorney rebutted the charges, and tempers flared during the process. Yet the final vote came 73 votes short of impeachment. The Chamber of Deputies has thus dismissed the case against him.
