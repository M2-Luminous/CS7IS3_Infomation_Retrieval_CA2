DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT Office of Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing [Docket No. N&hyph;94&hyph;3763; FR&hyph;3676&hyph;N&hyph;01] Notice of Funding Availability for FY 1994; Invitation for Applications: Public Housing Development AGENCY: Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, HUD. ACTION: Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 1994 for public housing development; invitation for applications. SUMMARY: This NOFA announces the availability of FY 1994 funding, and invites eligible public housing agencies (PHAs) to submit applications for public housing development. Applications are limited to: (1) Replacements for demolition/disposition subject to section 18 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA); (2) Replacements for homeownership transfers under the HOPE I Program, and homeownership sales under section 5(h) of the USHA; (3) Unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts; and (4) ``Other'' applications. All successful applicants will be required to participate in the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, unless granted an exception. This NOFA also provides instructions regarding the preparation and processing of applications. The Department is also encouraging applicants to form ``partnerships'' consisting of cooperative arrangements with community-based entities to provide housing, and is encouraging PHAs to engage in ``mixed income'' development (wherein public housing units are integrated within market-rate developments). This is being done by providing additional points for such efforts (see sections III.E.5 and IV.E. of this NOFA). This NOFA is not applicable to the Indian housing program. * * * * * SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement. The information collection requirements contained in this NOFA have been approved by the OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 2577&hyph;0033, 2577&hyph;0036, and 2577&hyph;0044. I. Introduction A. Authority Sections 5 and 23 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (USHA) (42 U.S.C. 1437c and 1437u); and sec. 7(d) of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)). Public housing development regulations are published at 24 CFR part 941; demolition/disposition regulations are published at 24 CFR part 970; section 5(h) regulations are published at 24 CFR part 906. The interim and final regulations for the public housing FSS program were published on May 27, 1993, at 58 FR 30858, and 58 FR 30906, respectively, and will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. (The FSS final rule simply adopts the FSS interim rule as the FSS final regulations.) The Notice of Program Guidelines for the HOPE&hyph;1 program was published on January 14, 1992 at 57 FR 1522. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program number is 14.850. B. Fund Availability The Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriation Act of 1994 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993) (1994 Appropriations Act) makes available up to $598 million of budget authority (grants) for public housing development/Major Reconstruction of Obsolete Public Housing (MROP) under section 5(a)(2) of the USHA. Since some of the appropriated funds are to be derived from the recapture of prior year obligations, the actual amount available may be less. At the beginning of Fiscal Year (FY) 1994, the available amount was $542,796,616, which included $149,534 in available carryover funds. As recaptures of funds within the Annual Contributions account occur during the fiscal year, these amounts will be made available for allocation to public housing development up to the fully appropriated amount, plus carryover. In accordance with section 624 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub.L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (HCD Act of 1992), HUD has established a set-aside of five percent of appropriated funds (up to $29,900,000 depending on recaptures) for the development of housing designated for disabled families, and up to $119,200,000 (depending on recaptures) for activities involving MROP activities. Applications for designated housing for disabled families and for MROP activities will be the subject of separate NOFAs to be published by the Department. The use of funds for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA is limited to the lesser of 30 percent of the amount appropriated for development or $150 million. One half of one percent of the appropriated amount (up to $2,990,000) has been set aside for technical assistance and inspections. Units transferred or sold to residents under HOPE I or section 5(h) are subject to replacement in accordance with section 304(g) of the USHA. Based on experience, the Department will provide up to $76,059,534 for such replacements. The balance of funds will be fair shared. The following table illustrates the distribution of grant authority. ␣ 1Purpose 1Amount 2(Maximum) 2(Minimum) Housing for Disabled $29,900,000 $26,635,460 MROP Activities 119,200,000 116,139,686 Sec 18 Replacement Units 150,000,000 150,000,000 Technical Assistance/Inspections 2,990,000 2,663,547 HOPE I and Sec 5(h) Replacement 76,059,534 63,546,250 Fair-Share 220,000,000 183,811,673 n,s ␣ 598,149,534 542,796,616 C. Fund Assignments Section 213(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (HCD Act of 1974) requires that funds be allocated on a fair share basis, except for (a) amounts identified as Headquarters Reserve and (b) amounts determined incapable of geographic allocation. The amounts identified by category below are maximums. 1. Headquarters Reserve Threshold-approvable applications for housing resulting from unforeseen housing needs resulting from natural and other disasters; housing needs resulting from emergencies, as certified by the Secretary, other than such disasters; housing needs resulting from the settlement of litigation; and housing in support of desegregation efforts shall be assigned Headquarters Reserve funding. (Headquarters Reserve amounts are limited in accordance with section 104 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (Pub.L. 101&hyph;235, approved December 15, 1989), to five percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under the USHA and section 101 of the HUD Act of 1965. Thus, Headquarters Reserve funding decisions will be made by Headquarters and may affect the distribution of grant authority shown above.) 2. Fair Share Depending on recaptures, up to $220 million will be fair shared to approve category 4 (``other'') applications. These fair share funds will be distributed to Areas (formerly Regions) on the basis of the following fair share factors, which reflect the most recent decennial census data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies, amount of substandard housing, and other measurable conditions. Because of errors in FY 1993 in calculating category 4 scores under the June 28, 1993, NOFA (58 FR 34670) for the Laconia Housing and Redevelopment Authority (LHRA) in New Hampshire and the Nahunta Housing Authority (NHA) in Georgia, fair share funds in the amounts of $753,400 and $759,400, respectively, will be awarded from the fair share amounts provided to the New England and Southeast Area before making FY 1994 selections, and assigned to the LHRA and NHA applications. The correction of these errors shall not adversely affect their participation in the FY 1994 rating and ranking process. If a new application is filed by the LHRA or NHA under this NOFA, they will be rated and ranked on the same basis as other applications, as if no error had been made. Any unused assignments will be redistributed, proportional to need, among remaining Areas with approvable unfunded ``other'' applications. Fair share and Headquarters Reserve funds are also subject to the requirement of section 213 of the HCD Act of 1974 that not less than 20 percent nor more than 25 percent of the HUD aggregate program funds covered by the statute be allocated for use in nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, public housing development fund allocations to select ``other'' applications may be modified before assignment in order to ensure Departmental compliance with this statutory and regulatory requirement (see 24 CFR 791.403(a)). ␣ 1Area 1Fair-share factors (%) New England 7.2 New York/New Jersey 18.3 Mid-Atlantic 9.4 Southeast 13.8 Midwest 15.1 Southwest 7.7 Great Plains 3.6 Rocky Mountain 2.5 Pacific/Hawaii 18.7 Northwest/Alaska 3.7 n,s Total 100.0 3. Non-Fair Share Thirty percent of the appropriated amount, up to $150 million, will be made available for applications for replacement housing subject to section 18 of the USHA. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable applications for replacement units for HOPE 1 or section 5(h) homeownership transfers or sales. 4. Remaining Balances Any residual funds not reserved under categories 1, 2, and 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other'' approvable applications. D. Conformity to Regulations and NOFA Requirements While conformity with 24 CFR part 941 is required, this funding effort is also subject to the additional specific requirements, consistent with the regulations, that are set forth in this NOFA. Applicants also should consult Handbook 7417.1 REV&hyph;1, the FY 1994 detailed Processing Notice, and the FSS interim and final regulations published on May 27, 1993 at 58 FR 30858 and 58 FR 30906, respectively, which will be codified at 24 CFR part 962. The selection criteria specified in this NOFA may not be added to or modified. II. Application Process Overview A. General All applications shall be submitted to the appropriate Field Office by the application deadline date. The Field Office shall screen each application for completeness and will provide the PHA a 14-day opportunity to furnish missing technical information or exhibits, or to correct technical mistakes. Each application will then be subjected to a ``pass/fail'' threshold examination. Approvable category 1, 2, and 3 applications will be reported to Headquarters for further action. Category 4 passing applications will be forwarded for rating to Rating Panel(s). One or more Rating Panels, comprised of HUD Field representatives appointed by Headquarters, shall be convened for the purpose. Category 4 applications will be rated by the Rating Panel(s) based on Field Office analyses. Headquarters will determine the funds required to approve category 1, 2, and 3 applications and select category 4 applications based on Rating Panel ratings and recommendations. B. Categories of Applications Each application must be for one of the following categories: 1. Replacement units for demolition/disposition approvals, subject to section 18 of the USHA (Category 1) 2. Replacement units for HOPE I or section 5(h) home-ownership transfers or sales (Category 2); 3. Public housing to be funded from Headquarters Reserve (Category 3); or 4. ``Other'' development applications intended to increase the public housing stock (Category 4). Category 4 applicants are limited to no more than one application per locality. C. Application Approval 1. Up to the available amount for category 1 applications (see Section I.B. of this NOFA) and all category 3 approvable applications will be funded. 2. Up to $76,059,534 will be made available for approvable category 2 applications. 3. Category 4 (other) applications will be funded up to the fair share amounts for each Area. 4. Funds not required for categories 1, 2, or 3 will be added to the funds to be fair shared for ``other'' approvable applications. D. Disclosure of Information The Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (HUD Reform Act) prohibits advance disclosure of funding decisions (see 24 CFR part 4); civil penalties related to advance disclosure are set out in 24 CFR part 30. Application approval/non-approval notifications shall not occur until the Congressional notification process is completed. E. Records Retention Applications and materials related to applications (e.g., Field Office analyses, application scoring sheets, and notifications of selection/non-selection) will be retained in the appropriate Field Office for five years, and be available for public inspection in accordance with 24 CFR part 12. III. Application Requirements A. All Applicants Each application must specify the housing type (new construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition), development method (conventional, turnkey, or acquisition), and community for which the project is proposed. No more than one housing type, development method, and locality may be proposed for an application. Each application shall consist of an original and two copies, and must include the following: 1.
