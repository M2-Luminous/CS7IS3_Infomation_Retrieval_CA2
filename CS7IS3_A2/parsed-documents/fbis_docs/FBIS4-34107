The Cuban president arrived for the meeting at 0700 dressed in civilian clothes. He wore a white long-sleeved guayabera shirt, which is Cuba's typical dress. The revolutionary leader's appearance in public without his classic olive drab uniform, which he has worn since the struggle in the Sierra Maestra mountains, caused a veritable commotion among the virtually 1,000 reporters covering the conference. It was undoubtedly one of the most important news stories of the summit's opening day. After meeting with Felipe Gonzalez, the Cuban president left for the summit, which was to begin with the participation of 22 heads of state and government of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal, in addition to the vice president of the Dominican Republic. PRENSA LATINA learned during a conversation today with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina that President Fidel Castro will participate in the entire program of the summit and will also hold bilateral talks with other presidents and personalities. This confirmed that Castro will meet with Chilean President Eduardo Frei on 16 June and that Castro is arranging meetings with five other chiefs of state. There is also a possibility that he will meet with businessmen, congressmen, and representatives of organizations that have expressed solidarity with Cuba.
