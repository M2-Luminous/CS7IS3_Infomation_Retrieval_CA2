FR940705-1-00018 FR940705-1-00007 III. EPA's Analysis of the District of Columbia's Oxygenated Gasoline Program As discussed above, section 211(m)(2) of the Act requires that gasoline sold or dispensed for use in the specified control areas contain not less than 2.7 percent oxygen by weight. Under section 211(m)(5), the EPA Administrator issued guidelines for credit programs allowing the use of marketable oxygen credits. The District of Columbia has elected to adopt a regulation requiring 2.7% oxygen content for each gallon of gasoline sold in a control area. The following sections of this notice address some specific elements of the state's submittal. Parties desiring more specific information should consult the TSD. Applicability and Program Scope Section 211(m)(2) requires oxygenated gasoline to be sold during a control period based on air quality monitoring data and established by the EPA Administrator. The District of Columbia has established the control period as November 1 to the last day of February control period which is consistent with the EPA guidance. The District of Columbia oxygenated gasoline regulations require oxygenated gasoline to be sold in the entire District of Columbia, consistent with the requirements of section 211(m)(2) of the Act. 20 DCMR Section 500, Subsection 500.4 requires all parties in the gasoline distribution network, including ``carriers'', to generate and maintain records detailing compliance. However, the definition of ``carriers'' is not found in Section 199, entitled Definitions and Abbreviations, or any other section of 20 DCMR. The lack of a definition for ``carriers'' compromises the enforceability of the regulation and is a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the Act. Transfer Documents The District of Columbia has included requirements related to transfer documentation in its regulation. These transfer document requirements will enhance the enforcement of the oxygenated gasoline regulation, by providing a paper trail for each gasoline sample taken by state enforcement personnel. Enforcement and Penalty Schedules State oxygenated gasoline regulations must be enforceable by the state oversight agency. EPA recommends that states will visit at least 20% of regulated parties during a given control period. Inspections should consist of product sampling and record review. In addition, each state should devise a comprehensive penalty schedule. Penalties should reflect the severity of a party's violation, the compliance history of the party, as well as the potential environmental harm associated with the violation. The District of Columbia's enforcement strategies and penalty provisions are found in 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Sections 100, 101, 102, 104 and 105. 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Sections 101 and 102 give the authority to inspect and issue notice of violations to the alleged violator. 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 104 provides the alleged violator the opportunity for a hearing. 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 105 provides penalties which include a fine of up to $5,000 per violation or imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or both. The District of Columbia's enforcement and penalty provisions are acceptable. Test Methods and Laboratory Review EPA's sampling procedures are detailed in Appendix D of 40 C.F.R. Part 80. EPA has recommended that states adopt these sampling procedures. The District of Columbia has not adopted EPA sampling procedures or any other sampling procedure which would be acceptable to EPA. In addition, the District of Columbia has failed to include in its' regulation procedures for the calculation of oxygen content in the gasoline sampled. Both the lack of sampling procedures and oxygen content calculations compromise the enforceability of the regulation and are a deficiency under Section 110(a)(2) of the Clean Air Act. Each state regulation must include a test method. EPA's guidelines recommend the use of the OFID test, although parties may elect to use ASTM&hyph;D4815&hyph;89 or another method, if approved by EPA. The District of Columbia has elected to use the ASTM&hyph;D4815&hyph;89 method which is consistent with EPA guidelines. Labeling EPA was required to issue federal labeling regulations under section 211(m)(4) of the Act. These regulations, published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1992, 6 required the following statement be posted for a per-gallon program or credit program with minimum oxygen content requirement: 6 See note 3. ``The gasoline dispensed from this pump is oxygenated and will reduce carbon monoxide pollution from motor vehicles.'' The Federal regulation also specifies the appearance and placement requirements for the labels. EPA has strongly recommended that states adopt their own labeling regulations, consistent with the Federal regulation. The District of Columbia has adopted labeling regulations consistent with the federal regulation. EPA Analysis EPA is proposing a limited approval of the additions or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199, definitions for the terms ``blending plant'', ``distributor'', ``non-oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenate'', ``oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenated gasoline control period'', ``oxygenated gasoline control area'', ``refiner'', ``refinery'', ``retailer'', ``retail outlet'', ``terminal'', and ``wholesale purchaser consumer''; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 into the District of Columbia SIP, which was submitted on October 27, 1993. EPA is also proposing to disapprove the additions or amendments to 20 DCMR Chapter 1, Section 199, definitions for the terms ``blending plant'', ``distributor'', ``non-oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenate'', ``oxygenated gasoline'', ``oxygenated gasoline control period'', ``oxygenated gasoline control area'', ``refiner'', ``refinery'', ``retailer'', ``retail outlet'', ``terminal'', and ``wholesale purchaser-consumer''; Chapter 5, Section 500, Subsections 500.4 and 500.5; Chapter 5, Section 502, Subsection 502.18; Chapter 9, Section 904, Subsections 904.1 and 904.2 for the limited purpose of allowing the District of Columbia the opportunity to correct certain deficiencies. These deficiencies are located in Section 199 (lack of definition for the term ``carrier'') and Section 502 (lack of sampling procedure and lack of a procedure to calculate the oxygen content of the gasoline sampled). EPA is soliciting public comments on the issues discussed in this notice or on other relevant matters. These comments will be considered before taking final action.
