Sakaguchi, speaking at the G-7 jobs conference in Detroit, acknowledged that the weak economy has made unemployment an "increasingly serious" problem in Japan but argued that the vaunted Japanese employment practice is under no threat of extinction. Sakaguchi put up a spirited defense of lifetime employment in Japan in response to a "theme" paper the U.S. Government prepared for the jobs meeting that appeared to challenge the Japanese employment system. The U.S. paper, prepared by White House chief economist Laura Tyson, argues that the low Japanese unemployment rate -- 2.5 percent last year -- reflects a tendency among Japanese firms to retain workers even during cyclical downturns. Tyson described the bloated payroll in Japanese companies as a form of "hidden unemployment" which she said is "sizable and rising." "This along with other changes (in the Japanese economy) are putting the Japanese 'lifetime' employment under real strain," the Tyson report said. Sakaguchi said Tyson's characterization of the Japanese employment system is off the mark. "As a matter of solemn fact, those workers remain employed. They are actually working at the workplace and drawing their pay. I think it's not appropriate to describe the situation as `hidden unemployment'," Sakaguchi said in a prepared statement. Sakaguchi, the sole Japanese cabinet minister represented in the G-7 jobs conference, told his G-7 colleagues that Japan's private-sector businesses are under no "forced obligation" to retain their workers. Japanese managers do so, he said, because they believe employees' "understanding and good will" is essential for a company's long-term well-being. Sakaguchi said Japanese employers are by no means abandoning their lifetime employment system, noting that Japanese firms usually use natural attrition -- rather than outright dismissal -- in restructuring their businesses. "Japanese firms still pay a lot of attention to maintaining long-term stability in their employment system," Sakaguchi said. The Japanese labor minister, however, acknowledged that Japan itself has a thing or two to learn from its G-7 partners when it comes to employment policy. One such factor, he said, is inflexibility in the Japanese pay system. Sakaguchi said Japanese firms that give their employees the assurance of job stability should change their pay system, which is largely based on the number of years an employee has worked in the company rather than job performance. Japanese companies should, therefore, introduce a more efficient job evaluation system, such as those already established in other G-7 countries, Sakaguchi said. Another lesson Sakaguchi said Japan should learn from its G-7 partners is to foster a job market that would enable workers to change companies more easily, when requiring a new job. "At a time when vast changes are taking place in industries and at a time when workers too are changing their way of thinking, we too should realize there will be more labor movement across companies and industries in Japan over the long run," he said.
