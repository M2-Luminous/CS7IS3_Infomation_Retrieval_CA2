FR940805-1-00169 FR940805-1-00017 The proposed rule represents only procedural and clarifying changes. These proposed changes would not impose any costs on either U.S. or foreign operators. Therefore, a competitive trade disadvantage would not be incurred by U.S. operators abroad or foreign operators in the United States. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the FAA certifies that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities because the proposed rule would only address procedural and clarifying changes. Such changes would not impose any cost burdens or result in any cost savings. Federalism Implications This proposed amendment would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The respondents affected by the proposed new procedures are private citizens, not state governments. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does contain no information collection requests requiring approval of the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96&hyph;511), there are no requirements for information collection associated with this proposed rule. Conclusion For the reasons discussed in the preamble, and based on the findings of the Regulatory Flexibility Determination and the International Trade Analysis, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not economically significant under Executive Order 12866. However, historically there has been significant public interest in the FAA's rules of practice in civil penalty assessment actions. For this reason, the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is a significant regulatory action under the Executive Order. For the same reason, this proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979), due to the public interest in rules of practice for civil penalty proceedings. In addition, this proposal, the FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
