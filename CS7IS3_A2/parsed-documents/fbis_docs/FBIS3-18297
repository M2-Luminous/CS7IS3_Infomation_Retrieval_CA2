According to information obtained from military sources, General Dogan Bayazit, secretary general of National Security Council [NSC], and General Aydin Ilter, the commander of the Gendarmerie Forces, are heading the command-level team which is taking initiatives for a military intervention. It was reported that there is a deep uneasiness within the Armed Forces, and that factions have been formed and that polarization between them has increased. It was indicated that Dogan Gures, chief of the General Staff, is trying to keep his post by making concessions to the team which has set out toward an intervention. The other faction is mostly made up of staff colonels who are influential in the 1st Army Headquarters in Istanbul. It is believed that with the forced retirement of Ground Forces Commander Muhittin Fisunoglu, who had distanced himself from the Americans after the assassination of [former] Commander of the Gendarmerie Forces Esref Bitlis, the way now has been opened to the most pro-American forces in the Army. The second faction, however, has taken a position against Bayazit for participating in the meetings of the Masonic lodges, and against Ilter in connection with the murder of General Bahtiyar Aydin, Major Cem Ersever and Commander of the Tunceli Regiment Kazim Cillioglu that followed the death of Bitlis. The Most Pro-American Team Is Making Preparations for a Coup A source close to the 1st Army Headquarters told AYDINLIK: "The two factions in the Army are clashing. Preparations are under way for a coup. The first faction is the Dogan Bayazit-Aydin Ilter team. This is the most pro-American team. These are the people who are making preparations for a coup. They will turn the elections into a bloodbath. They will eliminate their opponents in May. They have now set out to install Dogan Bayazit as chief of the General Staff." General Dogan Bayazit, who was appointed as the secretary general of NSC set up after 12 September [1980 military intervention] as a shadow cabinet, is being described as the "most pro-American officer." Bayazit, who despite coming from the ordnance service rose in the Army because of his special warfare capabilities, is known for his disregard for the law. After having been promoted from commander of the General Staff Operations Department to the commander of the Aegean Army, he was unexpectedly appointed as the general secretary of the NSC. Bayazit revamped the general secretariat. With the established of the Public Security Unit by a decision made at the latest meeting of NSC, Bayazit placed the civilian intelligence organization in Turkey under his control. Bayazit's younger brother, Admiral Vural Bayazit, is the commander of the Naval Forces. Both brothers are pro-American and are in close contact with the Masons. Gendarmerie Is the Strike Force Commander of the Gendarmerie Forces General Aydin Ilter had taken part in a coup attempt during the Gulf War. Ilter, who had resigned as commander of 7th Army Corps in protest of President Turgut Ozal, was later promoted. While still the chief of the Ground Forces staff, he was unexpectedly appointed commander of the Gendarmerie Forces after the assassination of Esref Bitlis. Of all the other armed forces units, the Gendarmerie was transformed into the most effective strike force against the Kurdish people in the southeast. The Gendarmerie, with its 180,000 men, has the most advanced equipment and arms. The Gendarmerie, which in the past was the most neglected force, has been turned into the most important force because the regime finds itself bogged down in the Kurdish problem. In a statement to DEFENSE AND AERONAUTICS magazine, he asked for the total transfer of the internal security to the Gendarmerie. "They Will Turn the Elections Into a Bloodbath" It is being claimed the Army team, which has set out toward a military intervention, will use the elections and 21 March Nowruz [Kurdish new year] to execute its plan. The source that provided information to AYDINLIK said: "They will turn the elections into a bloodbath. They will provoke an Alawi-Sunni clash. They will exploit the Sivas incident [when some 30 people died in a hotel fire last year in protest over a conference on The Satanic Verses]. Plans are being made for the death of hundreds of people. The government will be incapacitated. They are planning major incidents in Istanbul, Ankara, Sivas, Kahramanmaras, Yozgat, and Erzerum." The officers who are opposing the coup see the latest statement by RP [Welfare Party] deputy Hasan Mezarci and the press' exaggeration of it as a plot hatched by the Bayazit-Ilter team. They indicated that the distribution of the pro-Ataturk pamphlets all over Turkey is being done by this team. It was indicated that under pressure from the pro-coup team, Dogan Gures, who after taking over as chief of General Staff tried to strike a balance between the Army factions, has extracted concessions from the government. There are speculations that by extending Gures' term of office the civilians are trying to win him over against coup attempts. It was claimed that Gures is trying to keep Ilter and Bayazit under control by appointing many of his own followers to the Gendarmerie Forces command and NSC General Secretariat. It is being reported that ground forces officers have been appointed to the critical posts at the Gendarmerie.
