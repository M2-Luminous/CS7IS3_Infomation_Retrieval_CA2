The letter is as follows: His Excellency Butrus Butrus-Ghali, UN Secretary General: Esteemed His Excellency Secretary General, Paying my respects to Your Excellency, I send this letter to you regarding an important measure taken by the government of the Republic recently to establish a new peace guarantee system on the Korean peninsula. As you know already, the DPRK Government, through a statement of the Foreign Ministry on 28 April, proposed to the United States to hold negotiations to establish a new peace guarantee system that would replace the old armistice mechanism. As you confirmed personally during your visit to our country toward the end of last year, an unstable [pulanjonghan] state of truce, neither peace nor war, has lasted for over 40 years on the Korean peninsula. The situation on the Korean peninsula has become all the more strained [kinjang haejigo issumyo] and the possibility of a total armed conflict is gradually increasing [chonmyon muryok chungdolui kanungsongun chomjom to kojigo issumnida] with the amassing of huge reinforcements in and around South Korea and the stepping up of military actions against us on the pretext of the nuclear issue by the United States from the start of this year. The Korean Armistice Agreement and its observation mechanism should have controlled such actions, but they have failed to play any role due to the U.S. side's systematic acts of division and destruction [chegyejogin yurin malsal haengwiro hayo]. In 1956, the United States expelled the Neutral Nations Inspection teams stationed at appropriate ports of entry under Paragraph C, Article 2 of the Korean Armistice Agreement from the area under its control and, on June 21, 1957, it unilaterally renounced Subparagraph 13d of the Korean Armistice Agreement which stipulates that the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat equipment shall be ceased. Since then, the United States has shipped sophisticated weapons including over 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons into South Korea without any restrictions and it has become all the more undisguised of late in its shipments of such combat equipment. While working to systematically destroy [chegyejoguro pagoe hayo odaga] the military armistice mechanism, the U.S. side completely paralyzed [wanjonhi mabi sikyossumnida] it on March 25, 1991, by unilaterally appointing a South Korean serviceman as the senior member of the UN Forces side to the Military Armistice Commission [MAC] without any legal justification or qualification in view of the Armistice Agreement. Present-day reality in which the basic provisions of the Armistice Agreement that should guarantee peace on the Korean peninsula have been scrapped [pagi toeyotko] and the armistice observation mechanism now remains in name only, requires that decisive measures [kyolchongjok taechaek] be taken to establish a new security guarantee system to save the situation [sataerul susubhago] which has reached a danger line [wihom kyeson] and to prevent arms buildup and the outbreak of another war. In fact, the Korean Armistice Agreement signed on 27 July 1953, was a tentative measure taken to stop combat actions between the two hostile sides [kyojon ssangbangsaiui] in anticipation of future conversion into a peace agreement. Therefore, the adoption of resolution 3390-B, calling for the dissolution of the UN command and the replacement of the Armistice Agreement by a peace agreement at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly in 1975, was a very just measure [maeu chongdanghan chochi] to ensure a lasting peace [hangujogin pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and it opened a bright prospect for the final solution [chonggukchok haegyol] of the Korean question. The DPRK Government has taken initiatives and proposed negotiations on many occasions to ensure durable peace [kongohan pyonghwa] on the Korean peninsula and made tireless efforts [kkujunhi noryok hayossumnida] to put them into effect. Nonaggression was vowed by the North and the South through the agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation and exchange between the North and the South adopted in 1992 as a result of our positive efforts. But we are still in a state of truce vis-a-vis the United States which keeps its Armed Forces stationed in South Korea. The UN command, recognized as a signatory to the Armistice Agreement, serves the strategic aim of the United States to isolate and stifle [korip apsal] us and establish control over Asia and the Pacific region, which is an aim which has nothing to do with the UN mission to keep peace in South Korea. I think, therefore, that there is no condition for the U.S. Forces present in South Korea to act as the UN Forces any longer. Taking into consideration the actual conditions where a grave situation threatening peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun omjunghan sataega] had been created on the Korean peninsula but there was no rational institutional mechanism capable of controlling it, the DPRK Government proposed to the U.S. side to negotiate the establishment of a new durable peace guarantee system that will replace the old armistice mechanism and, at the same time, took practical measures, recalling all the members of the Korean People's Army [KPA] side from the MAC, setting up the KPA mission at Panmunjom as a new mechanism for negotiations with the U.S. Forces side and of appointing the chief and members of the mission. This is, to all intents and purposes, an innovative and well-intentioned step [hyoksinjogigo sonuijogin chochi] to make a breakthrough in establishing a new security guarantee system for peace on the Korean peninsula and a peaceloving step that took into account the publicly accepted international usage whereby some countries abandoned the relationship of hostilities after the Second World War and declared peace relationship instead. I think that the United Nations must pay due attention to our proposal in the sense of liquidating its unpleasant past affairs [pulmihan kwagorul chongsan hanun] with our country, its member state, and in the sense of fulfilling its resolution to replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement. The nuclear issue over which some countries are now making a fuss is, in fact, not a question to be discussed by the United Nations, but one that must be solved through DPRK-U.S. dialogue [chomi taehwa]. If the United Nations, yields to the unjust demand [pudanghan yogudaero] of some countries and attempts to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula in such a manner as to impose sanctions on someone else, it will, no doubt, bring catastrophic consequences menacing peace [pyonghwarul wihyop hanun pagukchogin hukwarul kajo oriranun koson] in Asia and the rest of the world, not to speak of the Korean peninsula. With a view to accelerating [taguchigi wihayo] the process of replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement in accordance with the resolution of the 30th General Assembly, the United Nations must take a practical step to dismantle the UN command, a framework of the old armistice structure. In conclusion, I express the hope that Your Excellency will pay particular attention to our peace overture to establish a new peace guarantee system through DPRK-U.S. negotiations [chomi hyopsang] and actively cooperate in its materialization.
