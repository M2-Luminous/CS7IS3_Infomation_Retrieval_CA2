Pena Gomez, who was nominated by the Dominican Revolutionary Party [PRD], demanded that the elections be annulled in several provinces, claiming that some 200,000 voters were unable to vote because their names did not appear at the voting tables. Pena Gomez added that such irregularities constitute "major fraud" and asked his followers to remain alert because he believes "a serious attempt against democracy is under way." "These incidents are very serious, and the elections should be held again in those cities and provinces where the irregularities took place," Pena Gomez indicated. Pena Gomez accused the Central Electoral Board [JCE] of excluding some 200,000 opposition supporters from the voter registration list to guarantee the reelection of President Joaquin Balaguer, candidate for the Social Christian Reformist Party. He stated that he will challenge the electoral results before the relevant authorities and demand new elections and the presence of international observers during the vote count. "We will also ask the OAS to investigate the event," he added. PRD sources agreed that if Pena's request is admitted, elections will be held again in nearly 40 percent of Dominican territory. This morning the JCE revealed that after counting 34.92 percent of the votes, Balaguer had obtained 43.64 percent and Pena Gomez 41.03. Pena Gomez claimed that Balaguer's followers decided to suspend the vote count in Santo Domingo -- where nearly 30 percent of all voters live -- "because they know they are losing here." The PRD candidate said there was fraud in Santo Domingo and some provinces in the country's interior, particularly in an area inhabited by black Dominicans who work in some 20 sugar mills. President Balaguer downplayed an eventual challenge of the election results, saying that "everyone will be satisfied with the way in which this electoral process has unfolded." According to foreign journalists, the situation in the country is unstable. Three trucks carrying armed policemen have been deployed around PRD headquarters. Dominicans went to the polls yesterday to elect a new president, vice president, 120 deputies, 30 senators, and 105 mayors.
