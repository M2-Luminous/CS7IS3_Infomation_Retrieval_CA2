FR940228-1-00047 FR940228-1-00007 The revisions to 42 CFR part 1004 of that final rule were meant only to conform the regulations to new statutory changes resulting from OBRA 1990, and were not meant to be a comprehensive rewrite of part 1004. This regulation sets forth a more complete and comprehensive rewrite of this part. Among other revisions: •These proposed regulations would eliminate the current procedural distinction between ``substantial'' violations and ``gross and flagrant'' violations. This is an artificially created procedure that has no basis in law or legislative history to provide a distinction between the two types of violations. Experience in processing these cases has shown that the second meeting is just a repeat of the first meeting since the present regulations preclude any new violations identified in the second meeting as serving as the basis for a sanction recommendation. Under these proposed regulations, which are consistent with a recommendation from the Administrative Conference of the United States, an opportunity would be provided for a meeting with the PRO and to provide additional information. The regulations would also provide that any violations of the obligations that are identified during a corrective action plan period would be used to support the PRO's recommendation regarding unwillingness or inability to comply with the statutory obligations. •These proposed regulations also codify the agreement reached among the American Medical Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Office of Inspector General with regard to PRO physicians involved in the sanctions process. Under this agreement, no physician member of the PRO panel may be in direct competition with, or have a substantial personal bias against, the practitioner or other person being considered for sanction. •Section 1004.30(e) of these proposed regulations would provide instructions to the PROs on the actions to be taken when a physician relocates after receiving a sanction notice. •Among the factors considered by the OIG in imposing an exclusion, in addition to the practitioner's or other person's previous sanction record, are any prior problems that such person has had with the Medicare carrier or intermediary. We are now proposing to include as an additional factor any prior problems that any State health care program has had with such practitioner or other person. •The current language of §1004.90(b)(1) concerning the OIG's review responsibilities (that would now be designated as §1004.100(b)(1)) would be modified to state that the OIG will review the PRO report to determine whether the PRO followed the ``regulatory requirements of part 1004.'' •The existing definition of the term ``physician'' appearing in §1004.1 would be deleted in order to conform with the HCFA definition of this term. B. Preliminary Hearings These proposed regulations would amend part 1004 by allowing a practitioner or other person in specified rural areas or counties of a specified population to request a preliminary hearing when notified of an exclusion from participation in the Medicare program by the OIG as a result of a PRO recommendation under section 1156(b) of the Act. The preliminary hearing would be solely on the issue of whether such practitioner's or other person's continued participation in the program during the appeal to an ALJ would place program beneficiaries at serious risk. Criteria for entitlement. Entitlement to such a preliminary hearing would apply to providers or practitioners for whom an exclusion is proposed who practice in a rural Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) for their specialty or in a county with a population of less than 70,000. For purposes of this entitlement, a practitioner's or other person's practice is where over 50 percent of his, her or its services are rendered. Health professional shortage areas are designated by the Secretary and are defined in regulations at 42 CFR 5.2. Since HPSAs are not specifically designated by rural or urban classifications, we are proposing that any HPSA not located in a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) would be considered a rural HPSA for purposes of these regulations. Both section 1886(d)(2) of the Act and regulations at 42 CFR 412.62(f) use these MSAs as the basis for determining an urban area or rural area for computing Medicare prospective payment rates. Although Public Law 100&hyph;203 divided the definition of urban into large urban and other urban areas, it did not change the differentiation between urban and rural. Therefore, we are proposing to classify any HPSA not located in a MSA as rural. There are seven different HPSA specialty categories. These HPSA specialty categories are described in current regulations at 42 CFR part 5, Appendices A through G, and include primary medical care, dental, psychiatric, vision care, podiatric, pharmacy and veterinary manpower. In determining eligibility for a preliminary hearing, we are proposing to use these categories for all practitioners and other persons to whom they apply. For all practitioners not covered by the specialty categories, we are proposing to use the ``primary medical care'' specialty category for determining eligibility for a preliminary hearing. This means that any practitioner who practices a specialty other than those identified in 42 CFR part 5 will be regarded as practicing in a rural HPSA only if that area is designated as an HPSA for ``primary medical care.'' The ``primary medical care'' category will also be used for all other persons and facilities, e.g., hospitals, with the exception of those ``other persons'' qualified under the ``psychiatric'' manpower category. Information on a county's population size would be obtained by the OIG from the responsible officials of that county.
