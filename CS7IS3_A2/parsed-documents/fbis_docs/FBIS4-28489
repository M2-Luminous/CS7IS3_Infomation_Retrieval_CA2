Since that time, several Diet members and heads of municipalities have been arrested on charges of graft or influence peddling. After this scandal broke, there has been an attempt to reform the bidding process for public works projects. In December 1993 the "Special Committee on Public Works" of the Central Construction Industry Commission issued the following recommendations: 1) replace the private-tender bidding system with a more competitive system; 2) abolish the guarantor system for project completion; and 3) create a bidding oversight council. These recommendations are currently being put into effect. These efforts constitute the most significant reforms since the competitive private-tender bidding system was introduced in 1900. During the open debate on public works in the mass media, the collusion between general contractors and heads of municipalities received the most attention. Since then, however, several problems with the public works system have surfaced. First, the number of politicians accepting illegal contributions in exchange for public works contracts is not limited to heads of municipalities. Several Diet members have been arrested or implicated for overstepping their authority. Second, many career civil servants have retired to take positions with general contractors, inviting suspicion of collusion between those placing orders for public works contracts and those receiving the orders. Third, dango [bid-rigging by collusion among construction firms] has become widespread. Dango has rendered competition ineffective, and this is the sole reason for the high cost of public works projects in Japan. Fourth, the number of public works contracts has increased despite staff reductions at public agencies and a relative decline in their technical capabilities. General contractors have had to cooperate with public agencies during the planning, design, and accounting phases without receiving compensation. If they do not receive the contract, companies cannot recover these costs. This is one reason why general contractors have used dango to coordinate their bids. The declining ability of government agencies and municipal agencies to plan and design projects has also created several problems. For example, an exceptionally large number of public works projects have had to be redesigned during the construction phase because the original designs were inadequately prepared. In Western Europe and North America, large public works projects are evaluated during the planning stage and the results are made available to the public. In Japan these projects are seldom evaluated and the results are almost never disclosed. This is the single greatest cause of inefficient projects whose costs far exceed benefits. Fifth, in Japan the government or municipal agency sets acceptible price ranges for bids on public works projects. These are supposed to remain confidential, but are often leaked to general contractors. We will have to address these problems if we are to reform the bidding system for public works projects. It is often argued that switching to a bidding system based on open competition will solve all of these problems, but that is not necessarily true. In subsequent articles in this series, I will point out the critical issues that have to be considered in any redesign of the bidding system for public works projects. [21 Apr 94 p 31] [Text] The Great Dilemma Public works projects are carried out using tax money to benefit the public. Accordingly, those public agencies that place orders for public works have a responsibility to ensure that the public receives the highest quality for the lowest cost. In other words, the focus of the public works bidding system should be on "cost" and "quality." It is difficult to eliminate poor quality and ensure high quality work in a construction contract. In order to ensure quality work, one must choose an honest and competent contractor who is motivated to insist on quality in whatever form it takes. If we were able to make "quality" objective, it could be built into contracts. In reality, however, it is often difficult and even impossible to quantify something like "quality," especially when technologies and circumstances change. For this reason, contracting agencies have broad discretionary powers when it comes to ensuring quality. Private companies need only concern themselves with issues of cost and quality, but in the case of public works attention must also be given to "fairness" and "corruption prevention." Private companies use their own money and thus can be self-serving, but since public works use taxpayer funds they cannot be used to benefit only certain people. Moreover, impropriety by the contracting party is essentially an internal matter for private companies, but a public issue for government agencies. The difficulty in designing a new public works bidding system is in the trade-off between "cost," "quality," and "corruption prevention." It is nearly impossible to achieve all three of these goals perfectly in a single public works project. For example, if cost minimization and corruption prevention were the only two goals and a perfectly open competitive bidding system were established, it would eliminate dango. If under the open bidding system the lowest bid automatically won the contract, it would eliminate corruption because the contracting agency would not have any discretionary powers at all. If the contracting agency were unable to tamper with the process in response to bribes, influence peddling would disappear. However if price were the only factor in the open bidding system, this would cause quality problems. If lower costs were the primary objective, contractors would cut corners and shoddy workmanship would result. Moreover, if cost minimization and quality assurance were the only two goals, the contracting agency would need discretionary powers to appraise quality in order to balance these two objectives. However if the contracting agency is given discretionary powers, the possibility of corruption occurs. It is often argued that regular rotation of officials and strict penalties would severely limit corruption in the professional civil service ranks, but the structural collusion resulting from the illegal influence of politicians as well as former civil servants taking positions with general contractors would remain. It is therefore impossible to create a public procurement system that can meet these three objectives perfectly. Under the current system, a delicate balance is maintained between these three objectives. Whatever system is adopted, there is an inherent incompatibility between technological, political, and social factors. [23 Apr 94 p 31] [Text] Corruption Prevention and Quality Assessment In order to prevent corruption in public works, the discretionary powers of contracting agencies must be reduced. This is the reason why most countries have gone to an open bidding system for public works contracts. Under a competitive bidding system based on price alone, it is impossible to promise that public works contracts will go to specific companies. For this reason, it is possible to eliminate unfair practices such as contracting agencies receiving bribes from contractors. Since politicians also attempt to meddle with the process, a competitive bidding system based on price would also make it impossible for politicians to conspire to award contracts to a particular company. Another advantage of a competitive bidding system is that it would end the problem public agencies have with cost consciousness. If the lowest cost bidder automatically won the contract, it would reduce costs even if the contracting agency had no incentive to do so. A competitive bidding process would seem to be the ideal public procurement system, but it has one fatal flaw. It does not ensure quality. If the lowest cost bidder won every contract and there was a rise in instances of shoddy workmanship due to cost-cutting measures, the ultimate cost to the public could actually increase. In order to ensure quality in a competitive bidding system based on price, detailed quality specifications would have to be laid out before bidding took place. Rigorous inspections would have to be conducted after the construction was completed to ensure compliance. This may be difficult to verify. Some of my readers may have had the experience of laying down clear guidelines for the construction of a new home. After the house is built, some of you may have discovered how difficult it is to determine whether the contractor used the specified materials behind the walls. Even in the relatively simple case of a private residence, innumerable inspections are required. When a contractor places an extremely low cost bid, the chance of shoddy workmanship rises. Some form of oversight will be needed in the public works bidding system to ensure quality work and to eliminate defective workmanship. Every country has some kind of inspection process, and there is no such thing as a purely competitive system without quality considerations. In the United States the federal government has a competitive bidding system, but bidders must be underwritten by bond companies or insurance companies. These companies conduct studies prior to the placement of the bid. These companies conduct inspections after a contract has been awarded as well. In order to ensure that construction is completed as specified, both the contracting agency and the insurance company conduct inspections. The contracting agency usually focuses its attention on the more technical aspects. The inspection process is extremely severe on companies that do not obtain the desired results. The detailed inspections include interviews with engineers and technicians. Every country conducts investigations, but the timing and methods vary. The openness and transparency of these inspections also vary. The Japanese private-tender bidding system is unique in concentrating its investigations at the time of bidding. The contracting agency has broad discretionary powers to conduct inspections, and the results are not made public. [24 Apr 94 p 22] [Text] Two Sides of Discretionary Power Despite the fact that inspections are inadequate when it comes to ensuring product quality, they form the heart of all public works bidding systems. If inspectors are made responsible only for objective criteria and their discretionary powers are eliminated, then the opportunities for corruption will be greatly reduced. Although all elements that are objectifiable should be made objective, problems remain. Professor Kelman at Harvard University conducted a case study on public procurement of computer systems in the United States and published the results in Procurement and Public Management (1990). According to his study, excessive objectification of demands produces great inefficiencies. Under the U.S. procurement system, a party which is not the lowest cost bidder can win a contract, but claims of superior quality must be objectively demonstrated. However, past experience is not considered significant. For example, in one case when a government computer system would go down, the contractor often did not send the appropriate specialist. Instead it would send a less qualified technician. Despite this track record, the competent authorities considered this subjective information and would disregard it during procurement bidding for new government contracts. In order to build the case that the contractor's support services were substandard, the contracting agency would have to limit its inquiry to statistical data from studies conducted by other government agencies and private firms. Under such an arrangement, support services continue to deteriorate because the extra effort and cost associated with improving support services have no bearing at all on whether the company will receive any new government contracts. Therefore, excessively objective demands in the review process harm quality assurance. But if these objective standards are relaxed and discretionary powers increased, there is no assurance this discretionary power will only be used to improve quality. The old Japanese National Railways (JNR) established more flexible standards in order to improve quality, but the public corporation began to use extremely expensive special parts. It is said this occurred primarily to ensure lucrative positions in these special parts companies for retired JNR officials. While discretionary powers must be given to contracting agencies in order to ensure quality work, organizational measures are also needed to make sure that these discretionary powers are exercised properly. First, efforts to expose and punish wrongdoing should be strengthened in order to prevent the abuse of this discretionary power in the form of bribe-taking. Politicians have also been implicated in public procurement corruption scandals, because it is difficult to penalize them for overstepping their authority. If something is not done to strengthen jurisdictional barriers, political-influence scandals will only intensify. Second, public disclosure and an effective system of formal complaints would help eliminate criminal abuse and arbitrary use of discretionary powers. In western Europe and North America, all uses of discretionary power by whomever for whatever purpose is made public. This does not happen in Japan. The public must have confidence that such discretionary powers are being used properly. [25 Apr 94 p 19] [Text] Dango Prevention and Dumping Competition is the most effective way to lower construction costs. Japanese construction costs are relatively high compared to western Europe and North America, and much of this can be attributed to the lack of competition resulting from the spread of dango. Since last year bidding prices have been dropping with the breakup of some dango, but the elimination of dango is still a long way off. Economists have recently begun to study competitive bidding. According to Tatsuyoshi Saijo, an assistant professor of economics at Tsukuba University, dango somehow quickly forms if bidders are allowed to confer with each other. Consequently, one could say that it would be extremely difficult to prevent dango if an environment is created in which bidders are able to confer. In order to prevent dango, we must rigorously enforce a prohibition on contact between bidders as they do in the United States, or actively support outsiders who have not participated in meetings with other bidders in the past. Under a restricted competitive bidding system, there are geographical limitations on qualified bidders. This only encourages the tacit formation of dango. The recent reforms have also abolished the guarantor system for project completion and have placed limits on joint ventures. This has made conferences between bidders all but inevitable, and has created a hotbed for dango. Recently, Chairman Maeda of the Japan Federation of Construction Industry Organization called for self-restraint concerning contract "dumping." His comments have evoked much criticism. If there were no dango, low priced bids would begin to emerge. Naturally, there is a possibility of shoddy workmanship with low priced bids, but stronger industry oversight and penalties for negligence are the proper response. With price competition, many new companies have emerged in regions outside the major metropolitan areas. Companies that could not compete under the private tender system have also been revived by open competition. However, few of these companies have resorted to intentionally negligent work in order to build a track record and increase market share. In such circumstances, the elimination of price competition by establishing price floors would do even more harm. Loss-generating contracts due to intensive price competition have increased the overcapacity problems of an industry already in recession. For example, many companies have too many engineers and not enough work. Even though some have idled their engineers, they must still pay their salaries. By placing bids under cost, they create work for their idle engineers and reduce the expense of keeping them on the payroll. However, once prosperity returns and demand outstrips supply, these companies turn a profit. Regulating low cost bids in order to prevent loss-generating contracts will only create a situation in which there is constant overcapacity and lead to even more excessive competition. Price floors intended to support the industry in times of recession will only encourage overcapacity by encouraging new companies to enter the fray. It will also help inefficient companies to survive. [26 Apr 94 p 25] [Text] Peculiar Price Estimate System Japan's price estimate system, by which bidders calculate their costs, does not allow contracts to be awarded above a certain price. This strict price estimate system is peculiar to Japan. In western Europe and North America proposals are usually allowed to fall within a certain range. Where price estimates are set, differences in price estimates can vary by as much as 10 percent (for example) within a fixed range. More contract awards are thus determined by price estimates. Because bidders take part in dango, there would be no upper limit on cost increases if not for price estimates. With the spread of dango, price estimates are the only means of restraining the skyrocketing price of successful bids. However, if recent reforms are successful at preventing the dango, then the need for price estimates will decrease. According to "accounting laws governing estimates and account statements," price estimates must be kept confidential until the bidding actually occurs. There is no rule stating that price estimates cannot be made public after the bidding process is over, but it is rarely done. Stories of leaked price estimates have appeared in the press, and the most recent bidding system reforms have centered on the question of whether or not confidential price estimates have any purpose. According to economic studies of the competitive bidding process, price ceilings can sometimes serve to reduce the price of the successful bid. However, it works best if these price ceilings are known to bidders prior to the bidding process. Confidentiality, as in the Japanese case, makes little sense. Confidential price estimates only increase the insecurity of the bidders in the process. Services such as auction houses set the lowest acceptable price at the start of bidding. The starting price, or lowest acceptable price, is usually made public prior to the auction. Because the price limits are determined by an expert appraisal specialist, disclosing price limits has the same effect as disclosing appraisal information. Making appraisals public is believed to narrow price differentials among bidders and intensify the competition. Prior disclosures of price estimates are prohibited in Japan, but ex post facto disclosures are not. Because of the proliferation of dango in Japanese public works bidding, winning contracts are often said to be nearly identical to the price estimate. If the price estimate were publicly disclosed after the bidding, the situation would become more clear. It would serve to curtail the activities of dango. The winning bid would come in lower than the price estimate in order to conceal the existence of dango. At the very least, it would hold down costs. Because there does not appear to be any harm in ex post facto disclosures, there is no reason why price estimates should not be made public after bidding has closed. In addition to the problems addressed in this series of articles, there are other issues that have to be considered when reforming the bidding system, such as introducing a construction management (CM) system and improving quality in the planning and design stages. I hope to have another opportunity to examine these problems at a later date.
