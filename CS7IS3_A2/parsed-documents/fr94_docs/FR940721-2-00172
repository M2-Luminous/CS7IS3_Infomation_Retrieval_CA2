ANA expects an application from a consortium to have goals and objectives that will create positive impacts and outcomes in the communities of its members. In situations where both a consortia of tribes and the tribes who belong to the consortia receive ANA funding, ANA expects that consortia groups will not seek funding that duplicates activities being conducted by their member tribes. •Projects that will not be completed, self-sustaining, or supported by other than ANA funds, at the end of the project period. •The purchase of real estate (see 45 CFR 1336.50 (e)) or construction (see ACF Grants Administration Manual Ch. 3, Section E). •Projects originated and designed by consultants who provide a major role for themselves in the proposed project and are not members of the applicant organization, tribe or village.
