Together with their supporters, the present candidates for "governors" and local "parliaments" may be divided into three camps. The first of these, which includes present leaders of the oblast and of numerous industrial enterprises and farms, and also individual scientists and representatives of a number of influential public and national-cultural societies, supports the idea of creating in the region a Free Economic Zone "Europe-Center" (precisely under this name a package of documents was submitted for the consideration of the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Council). The main author of the bill, Ukraine's people's deputy Serhiy Ustych, who masterminded and inspired the project and is the leader of the group, is also one of the real claimants to the post of chairman of the oblast council. He is also supported by a considerable number of the more than 200 registered candidates for 60 seats in the "parliament" of the region. The most significant of their arguments is, first and foremost, the advantageous economic and geographical situation of Transcarpathia (it borders upon four post-socialist states), which may serve for Ukraine as a kind of bridge between the countries of eastern, central, and western Europe, as an experimental proving ground for the development of civilized entrepreneurship, for the attraction of foreign investments for technical and technological re-equipment of production, and may promote our country's integration into various economic, financial, and other structures of the world. The second camp, which unites, first and foremost, representatives of local cells of Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for Perestroyka], Ukraine's Democratic Party, Ukraine's Republican Party, Ukrainian Nationalist Assembly, and a number of other organizations of national democratic denomination that are adamantly against the Free Economic Zone project in its present form. In their opinion, the introduction of a Free Economic Zone may lead to Transcarpathia's secession from Ukraine and to a situation where the region will be plundered by Western investors. They also fear that it will enable those officials who govern the region, to make a fortune at the expense of others. This is the position adhered to by former people's deputy of Ukraine and presently candidate for "governor" Viktor Bed. On the whole, he does not reject the idea of a Free Economic Zone and comes out decisively in favor of free entrepreneurship and various economic experiments. However, he believes that the introduction of the zone is premature as long as questions of ownership, civilized privatization, or land reform in the region remain unresolved. Nor does he agree with the present project of the system of management of the Free Economic Zone, when members of the so-called Oversight Council or General Directorate are not elected nationwide. Yet another claimant to the seat of chairman of the Oblast Council and former first secretary of the [Communist] Party Oblast Committee Professor Vasyl Khymynets is also opposed to the present variant of the bill on a Free Economic Zone in Transcarpathia. In his election campaign, he exclusively promotes legitimization of the results of the oblast referendum held on 1 December 1991 on granting the region the status of a special self-governed administrative territory, which is not the same as a Free Economic Zone (even though some politicians try to equate these entirely dissimilar notions). One more candidate -- the present presidential representative in Uzhhorod Rayon, Ukraine's people's deputy Mykhaylo Dancha, if elected "governor," will seek legislative confirmation of the special economic rights of self-government. Finally, the third "team" includes those who, in principle, also support the idea of a Free Economic Zone in Transcarpathia. However, not on the scale of the entire oblast, but, to begin with, in individual towns or districts. Present mayor of Uzhhorod Emil Landovskyy is a proponent of such a stand. He has also actively joined the struggle for the highest post in the region. He and his supporters believe that such an approach is the least risky and, if it fails, the losses from the experiment will be minimal. When it proves its viability by concrete results, it may be introduced throughout the territory of the oblast. As is known, the "old" composition of the Supreme Council "killed" the initial bill on the Free Economic Zone in Transcarpathia. Although, in the opinion of many, at that time political ambitions prevailed over sound economic common sense. The working group analyzed the constructive criticism and proposals voiced at the Supreme Council session, amended the project and sent it to the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Council for further consideration. Incidentally, the package of documents has already been approved by a number of authoritative international institutions and experts, by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, an organization for industrial development -- a key structure of the United Nations, which is also ready to take an active part in attracting investments for implementing major programs. Thus, by voting for a supporter of a particular trend in the development of Transcarpathia, the voters will determine the future of the region.
