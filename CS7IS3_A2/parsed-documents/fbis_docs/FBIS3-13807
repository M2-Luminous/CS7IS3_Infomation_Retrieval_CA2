The United States literally "payed off" the UN Security Council, Layla Shahid, the Palestinian general representative in France protested. It was at Washington's wish alone that the vote on the draft resolution on the Hebron killing was delayed for three weeks, although the text had been amended and the voting procedure -- paragraph by paragraph -- had been drawn up several days ago, she explained to us. And, above all, this is the first time that a U.S. Administration has ventured to exclude East Jerusalem from the perimeter of the occupied territories. The paragraph of the preamble relating to Jerusalem -- on which the United States abstained -- makes provision for the Council to "reaffirm its relevant resolutions which state that the fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 is applicable to the territories occupied by Israel in 1967, including Jerusalem, and Israel's responsibilities in this regard..., condemns, and so forth." The French Government even approached Washington to obtain explanations on this subject, she said. In vain. Washington's position on the eastern part of the holy city is particularly serious because it violates the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on 13 September by the PLO and Israel, in other words by the two sides most directly involved. Indeed, the text makes provision for the city's fate only to be discussed during the second phase of the peace negotiations and for "the two sides to agree that the agreements secured in the interim period should not undermine the result of the negotiations on permanent status or anticipate it." Before the vote, Washington "used outright blackmail on the Palestinians: Return to the negotiating table and we will discuss the measures to be taken," Dennis Ross, the U.S. coordinator in the peace negotiations, said in substance to Yasir 'Arafat last week, Layla Shahid explained. The PLO is reversing the terms of the equation and refusing to be held solely responsible for the suspension of the process. The Palestinian general representative thinks that the U.S. attitude on Jerusalem is a "negative message, an insult not only to the Palestinians but to the whole Muslim world," she said. In addition to Washington's attitude, Mrs. Shahid thinks that it is "the cowardice" of the international community which, through the Council's slowness in approving a text, is another "negative message" to the population of the occupied territories. Although Russia has the merit of "at least having tried" to show the United States that it could not lay down the law, Europe, our interlocutor deplored, is totally incapable of acting on its words at Security Council level. Before resuming negotiations, the PLO and Israel must discuss what this "international presence" stipulated by the resolution will be: "Will it be UN or multinational forces, civilian or military? From whom will they receive their mandate, how many men will they have?," Layla Shahid asks. In short, we are not out of the woods, and the situation on the ground will continue to be at the mercy of all the extremists.
