In the morning, when inspection personnel visited a garment store inside an exquisite commercial building, they noticed a large sign reading "40 perecent discount on all goods at this counter" on some counters. However, prices marked on the commodities gave no further explanation. Take, for example, a suit priced for 800 yuan. People were confused as to whether or not the price included the 40 percent discount. As a matter of fact, the discount was given on certain commodities only. Hence, inspection personnel decided that such a "misguided price mark" constituted price fraud. In accordance with the provisions "against fraud and staggering profits," selling commodities with false bargain, discount, and minimum prices is price fraud. At noon, at a Sino-foreign cooperative fast food restaurant, inspection personnel saw the menu's price for Italian spaghetti as 40 yuan; black pepper pork chops, 40 yuan; and seafood salad, 30 yuan; and one line of small words at the bottom saying: served with soup, bread, salad, and coffee or tea. A customer complained that because of the vague connotation of the prices, he once spent over 100 yuan in ordering three main courses at the restaurant. After some inquiry, it was learned that the prices were those for a complete dinner. In other words, each main course should be served with soup, drink, and other side dishes. Therefore, a customer who mistakenly ordered more than one main course would not be able to finish the dinner. Under such circumstances, the service personnel would leave the mistake uncorrected and make the best of it by serving the side dishes for only one main course. Law enforcement officials believed that such equivocal practices of pricing by the management in fact encroached upon consumer interests and, from a different perspective, was aimed at reaping staggering profits. At some restaurants and cafes catering to average consumers, the prices of drinks were generally found to be exorbitant. A bottle of high-grade Shaoxing rice wine was selling for 30 yuan; Dynasty white grape wine, for 80 yuan; and Great Wall white grape wine, for 80 yuan; whereas their prime costs were 4.2, 22, and 21 yuan, respectively. There were also pricing irregularities such as "Maotai [spirit], 400 yuan." Was the 400 yuan the price for a bottle or glass? How many ounces? The commodity price department and industry and commerce administration have already instructed on-the-spot those having violated the provisions on pricing to correct them or to remedy them in a specified time limit; and have meted out harsh punishments depending on circumstnces. In accordance with the provisions "against price fraud and staggering profits," lawbreakers were ordered to refund their illegitimate incomes to consumers and were given a fine from one to 10 times the illegitimate income. Shanghai has implemented these provisions with a view to standardizing pricing activities following market deregulation. These detailed and supplementary rules of the relevant state regulations reflect Shanghai's tough approach to supervise pricing according to the law and to perfect the legislation of pricing. Nevertheless, an authoritative source has emphasized that the implementation of the provisions is by no means tantamount to returning the previous practice of direct price controls. He has urged consumers in general to conscientiously apply the provisions to protect their interests. It is understood that very few complaints against activities of "price fraud and staggering profits" in markets were filed yesterday.
