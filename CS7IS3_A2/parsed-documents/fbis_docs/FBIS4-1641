According to a source from Beijing, yesterday state security and public security departments in Beijing once again received instructions from their higher authorities to place pro-democracy activities under strict control before the Ching Ming festival and adopt resolute measures if necessary. The source said: Departments concerned began to launch operations yesterday and made covert arrangements to watch the homes of dissidents and the places where they usually carried out their activities. The higher authorities ordered their subordinate departments to persuade, as far as possible, pro-democracy activists to travel outside Beijing and persuade the pro-democracy activists who were currently in the other parts of China to "spend a few more days amusing themselves" there. Well-known pro-democracy activist Wei Jingsheng previously planned to hold a gathering in Beijing on 29 March to mark the 15th anniversary of the pronouncement of his court verdict. However, as of now, he has not returned to Beijing, and is still in Qingdao. May 4 is a sensitive day during which the mainland authorities maintain sharp vigilance. During the Ching Ming festival every year, Beijing Municipality is on the alert and all relevant personnel renounce vacation and do their utmost to throw themselves into security work.
