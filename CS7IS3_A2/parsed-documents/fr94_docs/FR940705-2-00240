FR940705-2-00240 FR940705-2-00091 Passage through two sets of doors shall be the basic requirement for entry into the animal area from access corridors or other contiguous areas. The animal containment area shall be physically separated from access corridors and other laboratories or areas by a double-door clothes change room, equipped with integral showers and airlock. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;h. Liquid effluent from containment equipment, sinks, biological safety cabinets, animal rooms, primary barriers, floor drains, and sterilizers shall be decontaminated by heat treatment before being released into the sanitary system. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes shall be monitored with a recording thermometer. The effectiveness of the heat decontamination process system shall be revalidated every 30 days with an indicator organism. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;i. An exhaust air ventilation system shall be provided. This system shall create directional airflow that draws air into the animal room through the entry area. The building exhaust, or the exhaust from primary containment units, may be used for this purpose if the exhaust air is discharged to the outside and shall be dispersed away from occupied areas and air intakes. Personnel shall verify that the direction of the airflow (into the animal room) is proper. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;j. If the agent is transmitted by aerosol, then the exhaust air shall pass through a high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filter. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;k. Vacuum lines shall be protected with high efficiency particulate air/HEPA filters and liquid disinfectant traps. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;l. In lieu of open housing in the special animal room, animals held in a BL3&hyph;N area may be housed in partial-containment caging systems (e.g., Horsfall units or gnotobiotic systems, or other special containment primary barriers). Prudent judgment must be exercised to implement this ventilation system (e.g., animal species) and its discharge location. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;m. Each animal area shall contain a foot, elbow, or automatically operated sink for hand washing. The sink shall be located near the exit door. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;C&hyph;2&hyph;n. Restraining devices for animals may be required to avoid damage to the integrity of the animal containment facility. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D. Biosafety Level 4_Animals (BL4&hyph;N) (see Appendix Q&hyph;III&hyph;C) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1. Standard Practices (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a. Animal Facility Access (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(1). Individuals under 16 years of age shall not be permitted to enter the animal area. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(2). The containment area shall be locked. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(3). The containment area shall be patrolled or monitored at frequent intervals. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(4). The containment building shall be controlled and have a locking access. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(5). The Animal Facility Director shall establish policies and procedures whereby only persons who have been advised of the potential hazard and who meet any specific entry requirements (e.g., vaccination) may enter the laboratory or animal room. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(6). Individuals shall enter and exit the animal facility only through the clothing change and shower rooms. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(7). Personnel shall use the airlocks to enter or exit the laboratory only in an emergency. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;a&hyph;(8). Animal room doors, gates, and other closures shall be kept closed when experiments are in progress. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b. Decontamination and Inactivation (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(1). All contaminated liquid or solid wastes shall be decontaminated before disposal. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(2). The work surfaces and containment equipment shall be decontaminated when work with organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules is finished. Where feasible, plastic-backed paper toweling shall be used on nonporous work surfaces to facilitate clean-up. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(3). All wastes from animal rooms and laboratories shall be appropriately decontaminated before disposal in an approved manner. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(4). No materials, except for biological materials that are to remain in a viable or intact state, shall be removed from the maximum containment laboratory unless they have been autoclaved or decontaminated. Equipment or material that might be damaged by high temperatures or steam shall be decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(5). When ventilated suits are required, the animal personnel shower entrance/exit area shall be equipped with a chemical disinfectant shower to decontaminate the surface of the suit before exiting the area. A neutralization or water dilution device shall be integral with the chemical disinfectant discharge piping before entering the heat sterilization system. Entry to this area shall be through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(6). Needles and syringes shall be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(7). Supplies and materials needed in the animal facility shall be brought in by way of the double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock that shall be appropriately decontaminated between each use. Appendix Q&hyph;II&hyph;D&hyph;1&hyph;b&hyph;(8). An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and wastes shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area.
