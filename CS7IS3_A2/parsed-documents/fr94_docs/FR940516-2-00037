Specifically, Transwestern is modifying its tariff: (i) To improve and streamline the capacity release program, (ii) to add provisions pertaining to the EBB interactivity function, (iii) to allow Transwestern to maintain better control of its system, and (iv) to revise certain miscellaneous provisions, as set forth in its tariff filing. In light of actual experience under Transwestern's capacity release program, Transwestern states that it proposes to: (i) Shorten the timeline for releases for one to three months, (ii) provide for partial day capacity releases, (iii) revise the minimum notice revisions so that such do not apply to pre-arranged deals at maximum rates, (iv) collapse the Notice of Available Capacity and Notice of Original Transaction into one notice called an Offer to Release Capacity, (v) delete Form C, (vi) revise the term section of Form D_Capacity Release Agreement, and (vii) revise certain miscellaneous capacity release provisions as explained in its tariff filing. Such modifications will simplify Transwestern's capacity release program and make it more user-friendly. With respect to Transwestern's EBB, Transwestern states that it proposes to: (i) Add provisions relating to the EBB interactivity function (i.e. direct posting of Offers to Release Capacity and bids), (ii) delete provisions regarding the posting of buy-sell arrangements, and (iii) delete provisions relating to a shipper's posting of a request to purchase supplies. With respect to operational provisions, Transwestern submits that the following tariff modifications will enable it to maintain better control of its system. In light of actual experience under Order No. 636, Transwestern proposes to: (i) Decrease the tolerance level in its Operator Balancing Agreement (``OBA''), (ii) provide additional incentives for the timely resolution of imbalances, (iii) accommodate parties who wish to be aggregators for OBA purposes, (iv) provide for an Alert Day in the event of operational distress, (v) provide for real-time nominations by shippers, and (vi) change the operator confirmation deadline form 5:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Central time. Finally, Transwestern is making certain miscellaneous tariff revisions relating to: (i) The now-obsolete FTS&hyph;2 cost-based sales rate, (ii) the definitions of ``day'' and ``month'', (iii) errors in billing and prior period adjustments, (iv) nominations of receipts and deliveries, and (v) pre-OBA shipper imbalance provisions, as explained in more detail therein. Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before May 17, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any persons wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;11777 Filed 5&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
