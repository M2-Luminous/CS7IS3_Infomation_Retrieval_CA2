The Sofia Helsinki Watch organization made this assertion in its review of the state of human rights in Bulgaria during 1993. The association considers that the Constitutional Court should be consulted again for a ruling on how far the DPS conforms to the Constitution. At the last DPS national conference Ahmed Dogan declared that the movement is "a party on an ethnic basis," which is forbidden by the Constitution. The association points out that at present the courts refuse to register parties on an ethnic and religious basis. The Sofia Helsinki Watch considers that the Political Parties Act is very liberal. The absence of any meaningful lower limit for the number of members in a party permits the existence of dozens of citizens' associations that engage political activity in theory, but in practice mainly exist to exploit the privileges of duty-free imports.
