In FR Document No. 94&hyph;3250, beginning on page 6661, column 1, for Friday, February 11, 1994, a sentence was incorrectly stated. The first paragraph should be changed to clarify that the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., did not participate in the submission of the revised Options Disclosure Document (``ODD'') and to indicate that the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') filed the revised ODD on behalf of, rather than in conjunction with, the American Stock Exchange, Inc., the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc., and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
