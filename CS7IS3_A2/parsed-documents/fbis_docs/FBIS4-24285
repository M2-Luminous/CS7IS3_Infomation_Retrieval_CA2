Even before this summit began, Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, was at pains to clarify that there is to be no further devaluation. The adjustment of 11 January is the final one. This comment is in response to the concern expressed by certain African heads of state, and is also intends to kill off the rumors still circulating in Africa. This statement by Alain Juppe was recorded by Laurent Bertaud: [Begin Juppe recording] We have not changed our strategy in any way. The strategy for the franc zone is the maintenance of fixed exchange rates, and all these rumors circulating are clearly being fostered by those who want to make the operation fail. This was a once and for all adjustment, and, I repeat, we have good reason to believe today that it is succeeding. This is due to many factors: the aid that has been made available by France -- which, contrary to what has been said, has not abandoned Africa, quite the opposite -- and by international financial institutions, but it is also due to the determination of the African governments and the maturity of the people, who have displayed a strong sense of responsibility when faced with what is obviously a difficult measure.
