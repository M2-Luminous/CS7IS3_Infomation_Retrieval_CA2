Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated this after receiving the letter during his meeting today with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's political adviser. Musa said he and Dr. Sha'th discussed recent developments from the Palestinian and Israeli points of views and the situation in Hebron. On the other hand, Dr. Sha'th stated that he has come to Cairo to continue the negotiations started in Tunis to insure the speedy implementation of the Security Council resolution [904] and provide the Palestinian people in the occupied Arab territories, especially in Hebron, with protection in view of the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He noted that today's meetings, as well as the conference for supporting the Palestinian police that will begin in Cairo tomorrow, will focus on providing safety and security for the Palestinian people, particularly in Hebron. Dr. Sha'th said that the Palestinian delegation under his chairmanship and the Israeli delegation under the chairmanship of Amnon Shahaq, the Israeli chief of staff, will hold a meeting later today to resume the Tunis negotiations on implementing the Security Council resolution and insuring protection for the Palestinian people. He added that tomorrow's meeting is to decide on the number of Palestinian policemen needed to keep the peace in the Palestinian territories. It has become clear after the Hebron massacre that there is a dire need for Palestinian policemen who are capable of establishing security. Sha'th described the Security Council resolution on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre as good, despite the U.S. reservations. He said it is the first resolution that provides certain elements of international protection for the Palestinian people. It asks the Israeli side to provide protection to the Palestinian people. On Israel's proposal to provide an international presence in the occupied territories by extending the term of representatives from the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in the occupied territories, Sha'th said that the presence of these two organizations does not obviate the need for international presence as stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement and the Security Council resolution. He noted the continued suffering of the people in Hebron, who have curfews imposed on them.
