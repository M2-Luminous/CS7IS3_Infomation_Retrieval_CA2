The Oeiras [outside Lisbon] NATO commander spoke about the possibility of that command being closed down. Some people assumed that this information was a fact, and this was a good enough reason for NATO and the Ministry of Defense to want to know what was really going on. More details from Cid Saldanha: [Saldanha] It all started with an interview Admiral Carmo Duro gave about a NATO exercise. In response to a question by Renascenca, the Oeiras NATO commander spoke about a hypothetical closure of this Atlantic command, a possibility that may never come through. It all depends on NATO's will and the opinion of its member countries: [Begin Commander Carmo Duro recording] If NATO is to be paying increasingly less attention to the MSCs [military sealift command], let us admit that some ideas generated on the other side of the Atlantic lead to, or might lead to, NATO saying that it does not want any more MSC's in the Atlantic. At that stage, I believe there would be a greater pressure for this command to be rotating. The issue will be more of a national concern rather than a NATO concern, at that point. [passage omitted] As I have stated, this is a possibility that may be raised; and, although I do not have access to documents, it is in some people's minds. It is possible it will be brought up at the [word indistinct] Maritime Seminar scheduled to take place at the end of June; it may or may not. It all depends on the sensibility Admiral Miller finds in other commands -- the SACEUR. [end recording] [Saldanha] The SACEUR -- the NATO Command in Brussels -- recorded the interview and sent it to NATO in Oeiras. [passage omitted] Admiral Carmo Duro's words did not go down well, either in Brussels or at the Ministry of Defense in Portugal. [passage omitted]
