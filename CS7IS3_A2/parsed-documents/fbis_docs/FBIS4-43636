He said the delivery of visas would be a test of North Korea's will to resolve the latest crisis, sparked by its refusal to allow IAEA inspections of a nuclear reactor suspected of diverting fuel for military use. [passage omitted] Two inspectors are already in North Korea at the Yongbyon experimental reactor, but they must be replaced after having worked under difficult conditions, the Agency said. Yongbyon had discharged some 8,000 nuclear waste rods before the inspectors could get there to supervise the process, but they are still too hot for any extraction of plutonium, Meyer said.
