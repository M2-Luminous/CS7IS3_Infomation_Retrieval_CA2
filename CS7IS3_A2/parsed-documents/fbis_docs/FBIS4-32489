Magyar, who is a member of the SZDSZ's negotiating delegation, said that the planned agreement maximally meets their prior expectations. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What will be the structure of the planned coalition agreement? [Magyar] It will have a relatively short introduction that lays down the coalition's goals and substance. This will be followed by three big blocks: The first one lists the governmental guarantees, the second deals with issues related to the government's structure, and the third will contain the materials coordinated in the special committees. This last section is the longest, making up almost three-quarters of the full text. The coalition's government program is based on the coordinated materials of the special committees. The appendix of the section on structural matters contains the list of ministers. Finally, there will be a brief clause that states that the agreement has to be approved by the congresses and conventions of the two parties. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Will you make public all the points of the planned agreement? [Magyar] Naturally, the 150- to 160-page coalition agreement will not have any secret clauses. As a matter of fact, full publicity is a guarantee for both sides because a possible violation of the agreement cannot be punished through legal means. At the same time, the public will be able to question us about implementing the contents of the agreement. In my view, the agreement of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the SZDSZ will create a precedent in Hungary because this kind of political agreement has never been made before. I find it very important that the document deals with all the important issues in great detail. I believe that this agreement will also have a beneficial effect on Hungarian political culture. Public attention has mainly been directed to the work of the main delegations, while 50 to 60 people on each side took part in the joint work of the special committees. It is extremely important that, through this, the parliamentary groups and the experts of the parties can fully identify with the coalition agreement. People who will later have to act together in the government's work have, perhaps for the first time in their lives, worked together on the special committees. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What do you expect from the SZDSZ's convention on 26 June? [Magyar] I am certain that the majority of the delegates will accept the coalition agreement. I would remind people that, at the last convention, SZDSZ Chairman Ivan Peto said that only those people should vote for entering the coalition talks who really want the coalition. Even then, the proposal on entering the talks received 80 percent support. I believe that the coalition agreement that is to be signed today maximally meets our prior expectations.
