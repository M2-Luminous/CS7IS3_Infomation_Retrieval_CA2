FR940406-2-00053 FR940406-2-00031 [OPP&hyph;180929; FRL 4771&hyph;2] Receipt of Application for Emergency Exemption To Use Imidacloprid; Solicitation of Public Comment AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: EPA has received specific exemption requests from the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the ``Applicants'') to use the pesticide Imidacloprid (CAS 105827&hyph;78&hyph;9) to treat up to 13,000 acres of apples to control aphids. The Applicants propose the use of a new chemical; therefore, in accordance with 40 CFR 166.24, EPA is soliciting public comment before making the decision whether or not to grant the exemption. DATES: Comments must be received on or before April 21, 1994. ADDRESSES: Three copies of written comments, bearing the identification notation ``OPP&hyph;180929,'' should be submitted by mail to: Public Response and Program Resource Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. In person, bring comments to: Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA. Information submitted in any comment concerning this notice may be claimed confidential by marking any part or all of that information as ``Confidential Business Information.'' Information so marked will not be disclosed except in accordance with procedures set forth in 40 CFR part 2. A copy of the comment that does not contain Confidential Business Information must be provided by the submitter for inclusion in the public record. Information not marked confidential may be disclosed publicly by EPA without prior notice. All written comments filed pursuant to this notice will be available for public inspection in Rm. 1132, Crystal Mall No. 2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Andrea Beard, Registration Division (7505W), Office of Pesticide Programs, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., SW., Washington, D.C. 20460. Office location and telephone number: Floor 6, Crystal Station #1, 2800 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA, (703) 308&hyph;8791. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicants have requested the Administrator to issue specific exemptions for the use of imidacloprid on apples to control aphids. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request. The Applicants state that aphids have been a chronic pest of apples in Oregon and Utah. Aphids feed on the plant tissues of young trees, which can stunt growth and affect future tree productivity. On large, vigorous trees, the primary concern is fruit damage. Aphids excrete such large amounts of honeydew that it drips on the fruit, causing russetting or providing a substrate for the growth of sooty mold. The value of such damaged fruit is considerably reduced, as it is diverted to a processing market. The Applicants state that some of the registered alternative pesticides, while once effective, have lost much of their effectiveness due to build-up of resistant aphid populations. Others are said to only provide suppression, and not adequately control aphids. One of the registered alternatives (phosphamidon) that is still somewhat effective for this pest problem was withdrawn from the market in 1991, due to non-support for re-registration, and existing stocks have been mostly depleted. Another chemical (mevinphos) was previously used for this pest, but because of human risk concerns the manufacturer removed all labeled uses of mevinphos on apples and pears from the label in 1993. Therefore, the Applicants claim that Oregon and Utah apple growers are left without adequate means to control aphids. The Applicants anticipate crop value losses of approximately 10 percent without the availability of imidacloprid this growing season. The Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture propose that imidacloprid be used at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.), or 6.4 fluid oz. of product, per acre with a maximum of 5 applications. No more than 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fluid oz. of product) applied per year. Oregon proposes treatment on up to 9,500 acres of apples. This would total approximately 4,750 lbs. of a.i, or 2,375 gal. of product. Utah proposes treatment on up to 3,363 acres of apples. This would total approximately 1,682 lbs. of a.i., or 841 gal. of product. This is the first time the Applicants have applied for the use of imidacloprid on apples. A section 18 for this use of imidacloprid was issued by the Agency to Washington State on March 7, 1994 for up to 160,980 acres. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the applications themselves. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above. The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Oregon and Utah Departments of Agriculture.
