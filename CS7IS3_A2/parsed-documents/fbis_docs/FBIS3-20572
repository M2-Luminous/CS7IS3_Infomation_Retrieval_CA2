Grain system reform in China's market economy has become a hot spot to which economists and government policy departments pay close attention. Thus, this newspaper is printing portions of the key problems research report (the full text of which consists of approximately 70,000 words) of the Rural Development Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. This report was managed and written by the noted agricultural economist, Mr. Deng Yiming [6772 0001 7686]. It is hoped that this report will cause more experts and scholars to pay close attention to and further examine the problem of grain market reform. By now grain prices have been substantially deregulated throughout the country, and grain markets have been opened up. However, because of the incompletely developed market mechanism as well as frictions between the new and the old systems, some new problems will unavoidably appear in the wake of grain market deregulation. Only by facing these problems squarely can reform be further intensified. The Grain Price Fluctuation Problem Price fluctuations are unavoidable during the period of change from planned grain procurement and marketing to a market mechanism. The reasons are three: 1) The peasant household grain self-sufficiency rate is high, but the commodity rate is low. In China, approximately 80 percent of the population is engaged in agriculture, and the grain self-sufficiency rate is approximately 70 percent. Thus, during lean harvest and bumper harvest years, the decline and rise in the market supply of grain is greater than in a country in which all grain is commodity grain. 2) The peasant household degree of self-sufficiency is high, but the elasticity of supply and demand is slight. In China, where the degree of self-sufficiency in grain production is fairly high, the elasticity in grain supply and demand is much lower than in a country where all grain is commodity grain. According to price elasticity theory, when the supply and demand curves change causing a rise or fall in prices, supply and demand curve elasticity determines the size of the price change. In China, which has high self-sufficiency in grain production, once the grain market is deregulated, market price fluctuations are bound to intensify because of the low elasticity of supply and demand. 3) The risk avoidance behavior of grain producers and consumers. Chinese peasant households farm on a very small scale, each household farming an average 6.4 mu. The same applies to the scale of products farmed. The commodity grain rate is low, each household supplying approximately 600 kilograms of commodity grain a year. Storage capacity is very small. Peasant household reaction to market prices is very much the same. In bumper harvest years when market supply increases, grain prices fall. Peasant household expect prices will fall further, so they rush to the markets to sell off their grain. This causes a sudden increase in the grain supply. Supply is far greater than demand. This drives grain prices far down. In lean harvest years when market supply declines, grain prices rise, and peasants expect that prices will rise further. They hoard their grain, thereby further decreasing the supply of grain in the market. This drives prices up, intensifying market grain price fluctuations. In China, city and town residents are the main grain consumers. An overwhelming majority of them have low incomes, so they are unable to withstand great ups and downs in prices. Market deregulation, which causes a slight grain shortage, frequently results in panic buying, which causes a tremendous rise in grain prices in turn. When grain market prices fall, urban residents expect that grain prices will continue to fall. A wait-and-see attitude results in low market demand for grain, so the market price continues to fall. The foregoing features of grain producer and grain consumer production and consumption is risk avoidance behavior following the setting of grain prices by the market. This behavior seeks to reduce to the minimum both production and consumption risk. The Problem of Grain Price Differences During the period of state monopoly procurement and marketing, the price paid peasants for their grain was held down in order to industrialize rapidly, and transportation expenses were borne by the state. This permitted the maintenance of low consumer prices, which were in keeping with low consumer wages. Thus, industry made super profits. However, this dampened peasant interest in growing grain, thereby accentuating the difference between supply and demand for grain. In order to increase the grain supply to ameliorate the difference between supply and demand, the state had no choice but to raise the grain procurement price tremendously during the late 1970s while keeping the consumer's price the same. This produced a grain production and consumption price inversion, the shortfall made up by the state treasury. By 1990, the public grain subsidy amounted to 42 billion yuan. The treasury found this to be an unbearable burden, so a rise in the sale price of grain became imperative. As a result of two consumer price rises, the procurement and the market price has become identical. There is virtually no difference between the grain production and consumption price. The next step will be to deregulate grain markets, impelling grain producers, dealers, and consumers toward the market. Once grain markets have been deregulated, the grain production and consumption price difference is expected to widen. 1. Analysis of the reasons why the grain production and consumption price will widen following grain market deregulation. First is system change factors. Following grain market deregulation, the state will abolish government subsidies to producers and dealers. The following formula will be used to handle prices between producers and consumers: grain producer price + grain dealer price (transportation and selling costs + profit) = consumer price. The identical buying and selling price will become history. Second is transportation and marketing system efficiency factors. The size of the difference between the grain producer and grain consumer price depends on the efficiency of the transportation and marketing system. If efficiency is high, the difference is small; if efficiency is low, the difference is great. The current state of China's transportation and marketing system is as follows: First, more than 90 percent of the dealings in commodity grain in China are by state-owned grain enterprises. Once grain markets have been deregulated and state-owned grain enterprises are pushed into the markets, they will very likely become grain corporations of a monopoly character that manipulate market grain prices to garner super monopoly profits. This will widen the difference between the production and consumption price. Second, since the scale of production and consumption of China's grain producers and consumers is small and extraordinarily scattered as well, in addition to which the infrastructure is antiquated and markets are greatly cut up, transportation and marketing system profits and storage losses are very great. Once grain markets are deregulated, bank interest rates will rise again. That will dramatically increase transportation and marketing costs, thereby leading to a widening of the production and consumption costs. Third, China's road and communications facilities are antiquated, and markets are very much chopped up weakening contact among markets. In addition, storage facilities are inadequate. Storage losses are great and costs are high. This increases the difference between grain producer and consumer prices. 2. Detrimental effect of the widening of the difference between grain production and consumption prices. Once grain markets are deregulated and the difference between grain production and consumption prices widens to a certain point, the result will be detrimental to both producers and consumers, and ultimately the damage to people having low incomes will be greatest. Politically speaking, the peasants grumble about too low grain prices. They wish grain prices were somewhat higher so that their income would be somewhat greater. Consumers complain about grain prices being too high. They wish grain prices were somewhat lower so that they did not have to pay as much. This puts pressure on the government. In addition are problems such as the price risks of grain producing areas and needy marketing areas.
