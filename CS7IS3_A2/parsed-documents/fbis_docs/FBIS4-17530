A preliminary agreement was reached on this score here today between the Turkmenian Ministry for Petroleum and Gas and officials of the Chinese National Oil Corporation, accompanying Li Peng, premier of the PRC State Council, in his 12-day tour of four Central Asian countries-members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). China undertakes to build the necessary pipeline, says the bilateral protocol of intent. A commission, including Turkmenian, Chinese and Japanese experts, will be set up shortly to draw up the project, the document notes. The question of building an Asian super-pipeline was raised during Turkmenian President Saparmurad Niyazov's visit to China in November 1992. Representatives of Turkmenian and Chinese business circles have also concluded an agreement to deliver 20,000 tonnes of cotton to China, to promote contacts between the Chambers of Commerce of the two countries, to supply to Turkmenistan Chinese-made electrical household appliances, and to build steel-smelting and aluminium plants.
