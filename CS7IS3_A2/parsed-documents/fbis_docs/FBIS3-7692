But compared with the present, things were simple and clear-cut back then. Values could be classified into two categories: communist or noncommunist. Most countries belonged to either the communist or noncommunist bloc. Only a handful of countries remained nonaligned and neutral, and these were of little geopolitical significance. Regardless of whether it be the U.S. or Soviet bloc, there was a strong stranglehold from the center against outlying areas. For example, under the former Soviet structure, it was inconceivable for the DPRK (North Korea) to engage in such acts as developing nuclear weapons on its own. The two blocs armed themselves with nuclear weapons and contested their destructive power. By expanding their "mutual assured destruction" capabilities in the form of simple, clear-cut figures, and by acknowledging a balance based on a sense of fear which existed between them, the two blocs were able to maintain a chilly state of peace on a global scale. With the end of the Cold War, the structure of conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union collapsed, and the threat of nuclear war faded. However, the forces that moved the world became dispersed, creating a complicated structure and making it difficult to grasp the situation in terms of figures. In Bosnia, tribal, ethnic, and religious strife as well as distrust and hatred have accumulated over hundreds of years and have now risen to nearly uncontrollable levels. Bosnia is just one example; there exists many similar situations throughout the world. Looking at the situation in Bosnia, it can be acknowledged that the people there are hardly capable of restoring order. Therefore, the United Nations and regional organizations such as NATO have been asked to deploy military forces. However, as exemplified in Somalia and Bosnia, the "superhero" capabilities of the United Nations and other organizations are very limited. In these cases, nuclear weapons are worthless; it may be like trying to use oversized spears in a confined fighting space. To restore order in bogged down regional conflicts, it would be necessary to deploy massive conventional forces and policemen. However, there is hardly any country that can get its people's consent to bear such risks and costs. Although this situation must be rectified, enormous effort and considerable time will be required to carry it out. It must be acknowledged that, for the time being, the international community lacks effective means of dealing with Bosnia-type conflicts. In that case, what will follow an era of "chilly peace" is probably an era of "dubious peace." In such an era, what can be considered vitally important as security measures will be: first, to try to detect sparks of war well in advance, and second, to do all that can be done to prevent conflicts from spreading to surrounding areas. Looking at the regions surrounding Japan, it goes without saying that the most dubious area is the Korean peninsula. The following possibilities can be considered in regards to the danger on the Korean peninsula: 1) use of nuclear weapons by North Korea; 2) North Korea's invasion of the ROK via conventional forces; and 3) abrupt internal collapse in North Korea. As for the first two possibilities, it would be an act of suicide for North Korea as long as the United States is firmly determined to retaliate. In this regard, it is hoped the United States would give a clear signal to North Korea, with no room for any misunderstanding. There exist hardly any common terms other than "carrot and stick" between North Korea and normal countries. Therefore, countries such as the United States, the ROK, and Japan should hold a strong stick while hanging tasty carrots before North Korea, and corner it into making a choice. If North Korea should keep on playing with fire, these countries should try to convince it to stop doing so by showing that continuing to do so would only do it more harm than good. It is also necessary to exercise adequate caution regarding the danger of provoking internal collapse in North Korea should the stick policy turn out to be too strong. It should not be forgotten, also, that even if the stick were not used, the danger of internal collapse continues to exist. In case of internal collapse, military threats may diminish for the time being, but there would arise increased danger of the development of a situation on the Korean peninsula similar to the Bosnian situation, and it may continue for a long time. In short, the crisis on the Korean peninsula is similar to Bosnia in that it cannot be resolved easily. To deal with this situation, we must stop employing the simple binary-style way of thinking [nishin-ho-teki hasso] as was done in the Cold War era. We have now entered an era where it is necessary to "learn about the foe, as well as about oneself" in order to carry out a highly intellectual diplomacy which combines hardness with softness, flexibility with firmness.
