This is the essence of the new Federal Government regulation on the mobilization of citizens, whose Article 35, as announced by the Federal Defense Ministry's information service, says: "If citizens-conscripts do not respond to a general mobilization call up in numbers prescribed by individual mobilization plans, relevant district bodies, that is military-territorial bodies, will order the mobilization service to directly and personally inform the conscript who failed to report and warn him about the possibility of the use of force if he does not report in a period of time not shorter than 12 hours." One of the innovations in this regulation is that the mobilization of combat units and institutions will be carried out in due time and gradually and that, unlike what was prescribed by regulations until now, only certain institutions or parts of institutions, as well as an optimal number of conscripts needed for the consolidation of the country's defense system, will be liable to mobilization.
