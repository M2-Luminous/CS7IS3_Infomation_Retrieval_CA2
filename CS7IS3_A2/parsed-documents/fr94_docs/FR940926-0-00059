FR940926-0-00059 FR940926-0-00011 Noxious alien plants such as Schinus terebinthifolius (Christmasberry) have invaded the dry to mesic lowland regions of the Hawaiian Islands. Introduced to Hawaii prior to 1911, Christmasberry forms dense thickets that shade out and displace other plants (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Both of the Oahu populations of Ctenitis squamigera, the West Maui population, and one of the Lanai populations are negatively affected by this invasive plant, as is the population of Diplazium molokaiense at Schofield Barracks (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava), a shrub or small tree, has become naturalized on all of the main Hawaiian islands except Niihau and Kahoolawe. Like Christmasberry, strawberry guava is capable of forming dense stands that exclude other plant taxa (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). This alien plant grows primarily in mesic and wet habitats and provides food for several alien animal taxa, including feral pigs and game birds, that disperse the plant's seeds through the forest (Smith 1985, Wagner et al. 1985). Strawberry guava is considered one of the greatest alien plant threats to Hawaii's wet forests and is known to pose a direct threat to the populations of Ctenitis squamigera and Diplazium molokaiense in the Waianae Mountains on Oahu (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). It also threatens the populations of Ctenitis squamigera on Lanai and East Maui (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Fountain grass is a fire-adapted bunch grass that has spread rapidly over bare lava flows and open areas on the island of Hawaii since its introduction in the early 1900s. Fountain grass is particularly detrimental to Hawaii's dry forests because it is able to invade areas once dominated by native plants, where it interferes with plant regeneration, carries fires, and increases the likelihood of fires (Cuddihy and Stone 1990, Smith 1985). Fountain grass threatens the native vegetation at PTA, competing with Asplenium fragile var. insulare (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Toona ciliata (Australian red cedar) is a fast-growing tree that has been extensively planted and has become naturalized in mesic to wet forests (Wagner et al. 1990). This tree threatens populations of Ctenitis squamigera and Diplazium molokaiense in the Waianae Mountains of Oahu (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Those same populations are threatened by Syzygium cumini (Java plum), a large evergreen tree that forms a dense cover, excluding other taxa. Java plum is an aggressive invader of undisturbed lowland mesic and dry forests (Smith 1985). Myrica faya (firetree) has attracted a great deal of attention and concern for its recent explosive increase on several Hawaiian islands. It is capable of forming a dense, nearly monospecific stand (Cuddihy and Stone 1990). Because of its ability to fix nitrogen, it outcompetes native taxa and enriches the soil so that other alien plants can invade (Wagner et al. 1990). The Lanai populations of Ctenitis squamigera are threatened by the invasion of firetree (HHP 1991; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Although not yet widespread in the Hawaiian Islands, Cinnamomum burmanii (Padang cassia) could become a dominant component of Hawaiian mesic forests (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). A dense and enlarging stand of it threatens a population of Ctenitis squamigera on Lanai (HHP 1991). Fire constitutes a potential threat to three of the endangered fern taxa growing in dry to mesic grassland, shrubland, and forests on the islands of Oahu and Hawaii. On Oahu, fire is a potential threat to Ctenitis squamigera and the population of Diplazium molokaiense on the Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. These populations are located near an area currently utilized as a military firing range. Fires originating on the firing range have the potential of spreading into the native forest habitat of the two fern taxa (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Fire is also a potential threat to the population of Asplenium fragile var. insulare at Pohakuloa Training Area on the island of Hawaii (Shaw 1992), where military exercises utilizing live ammunition are conducted. The presence of fountain grass at Pohakuloa Training Area increases the potential of fire. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by these taxa in determining this final rule. Based on this evaluation, this rulemaking will list four taxa_ Asplenium fragile var. insulare, Ctenitis squamigera, Diplazium molokaiense, and Pteri lidgatei _as endangered. All 4 endangered taxa are known from fewer than 10 populations and 3 of the taxa number no more than 100 individuals. The four taxa are threatened by one or more of the following: Habitat degradation and/or predation by feral goats, sheep, cattle, deer, and pigs; and competition from alien plants. Small population size and limited distribution make these taxa particularly vulnerable to extinction from stochastic events. Because these four taxa are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, they fit the definition of endangered as defined in the Act. Critical habitat is not being proposed for the four taxa included in this rule for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section below. Critical Habitat Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for these taxa. All of the taxa have extremely low total populations and face anthropogenic threats. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the Federal Register , as required in designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to these plants from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to their decline. All involved parties and the major landowners have been notified of the general location of these taxa. Protection of the habitat of the taxa will be addressed through the recovery process and through the section 7 consultation process. Two Federal departments conduct activities within the currently known habitat of the endangered plants_the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense. One taxon is found in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where Federal law protects all plants from damage or removal. Three taxa are located on land owned or leased by the Department of Defense or on nearby State lands. Three of the taxa are found on Schofield Barracks Military Reservation. Although military and ordnance training takes place on this federally owned property, the impact areas and buffer zones for these activities are outside the area where the taxa occur. One taxon is known from Pohakuloa Training Area on the Island of Hawaii. The Army is aware of the presence and location of this taxon, and any Federal activities that may affect the continued existence of these plants will be addressed through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for these taxa is not prudent at this time, because such designation would increase the degree of threat from vandalism, collecting, or other human activities and it would not provide overriding benefits.
