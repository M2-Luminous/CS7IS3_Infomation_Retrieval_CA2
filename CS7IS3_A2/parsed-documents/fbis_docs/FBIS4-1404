He made this comment on Tuesday [26 April] in his final press interview before the Independent Electoral Commission releases the results of the nationwide poll. The ANC leader, certain to be the country's first black president, is scheduled to cast his vote at a polling booth just outside Durban on Wednesday -- the day general voting kicks off. Speaking to SAPA in the Presidential Suite of a downtown Johannesburg hotel on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Mandela said he had received assurances from SA Defence Force and SA Police generals of their full co-operation. "We are exchanging information and removing any feeling of insecurity on their part, and I think we have established good relations between ourselves and the security forces. "I have addressed firstly a meeting of all the police generals together with Mr Hernus Kriel (law and order minister) and his deputy, and the full staff of the SA Defence Force together with Minister of Defence Mr Kobie Coetsee and his deputy, Mr Wynand Breytenbach." Mr Mandela added perceptions of the security forces at grassroots level would also have to change to enable better interaction between them and the community at large. "It is a question of supporting the security forces and making them legitimate and credible in so far as the masses of the people are concerned. Members of other population groups have already been drawn into the command structures of the security forces, and this has helped to restore confidence in the security forces. "We are departing from the case where blacks are only there to carry out orders of the command strctures that are solely white." The ANC believed in additional steps to galvanise the community behind the police and army. "It is also a question of a change in training of the security forces...that they should be trained in such a way that the poor image they have amongst the black community is removed. "The introduction of community policing is also going to be a major factor in improving the relationship between the security forces and the masses of the people," the ANC president said. The ANC and government had already gone far towards redressing racial imbalances in the security forces, he added.
