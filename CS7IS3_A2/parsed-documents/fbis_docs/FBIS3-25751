Dr. Mocumbi said his government will ask the Supervisory and Control Commission, the body in charge of implementing the peace agreement between the Mozambican Government and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance], to become involved. This is because the government would need to use troops to bring the Young Pioneers under control, but under the terms of the peace agreement with Renamo, any such troop movements must be approved by the commission.
