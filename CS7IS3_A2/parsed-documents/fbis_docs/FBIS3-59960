It was learned that Gandarillas Soriano had been pursued for several months by the antinarcotics organizations, until he was located while having dinner with friends in the El Jacuu steak house. The drug trafficker was sent to La Paz, but was returned to this city to face trial under the precepts of Law No. 1008. According to antinarcotics authorities Gandarillas Soriano is linked to the case for which Juan Carlos Velez is being tried, and presumably has links with Nando Gutierrez Mansilla, who is currently jailed in Chonchocoro. FELCN sources indicated that Gandarillas Soriano is a much more important trafficker than Logio Yoyo Nunez Vaca and Hernando Nando Gutierrez, who were arrested in the ``Without End'' and ``Gigantic White'' operations respectively.
