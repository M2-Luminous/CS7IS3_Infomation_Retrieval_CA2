The preferential tax rate of 15 percent will be replaced by a single national corporate-tax rate of 33 percent, a move Hong Kong analysts say will have an adverse effect on China's ambitious drive to tap international capital markets. The first batch of nine Chinese companies granted a listing on the Hong Kong stock market would, however, continue to enjoy the privilege as they had negotiated the deal before the decision was made, Liu, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said. Hong Kong analysts said the higher rate would pull down the attributable earnings of companies seeking overseas listings by about 20 percent, while they questioned how long the 15 percent and 33 percent rates could co-exist. However, there was, they said, a logical motive behind the move as a clear and unified tax rate was one of the conditions China must fulfil before it was eligible for full membership of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). China hopes to join GATT this year. Liu did not say whether the new rate would apply to foreign- invested ventures which still enjoy corporate tax rates of between 15 percent to 24 percent. He did say, though, that the 33 percent rate would apply to the 22 Chinese firms which have been approved for listing in New York and Hong Kong by next year. Liu brushed aside arguments that the new rate would be unfair to the 22, saying the decision was part of the mainland's ongoing tax reforms. Under China's new tax regime, which came into effect in January, all Chinese enterprises are subject to the unified 33 percent tax rate. Previously, state-owned firms had to fork out 55 percent, while foreign ventures in special economic zones and coastal cities paid the 15 percent to 24 percent rate. The tax rate for foreign companies elsewhere in China was 30 percent. However, confusion still remains. Despite the new tax regime, local authorities in special economic zones and coastal cities, where most of the country's joint ventures are concentrated, have said that joint ventures will continue to enjoy the same tax rates as before. Beijing tax authorities decided to maintain the 15 percent rate for the first nine Chinese companies to list in Hong Kong. This move was apparently because of concern among overseas investors that the new rate would make public offerings less attractive. To date, seven of the nine firms have listed, while the other two are slated for flotation in the first half of the year.
