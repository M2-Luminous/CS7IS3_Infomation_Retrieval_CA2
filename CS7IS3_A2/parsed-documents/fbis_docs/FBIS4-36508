President Hafiz al-Asad received the delegation for two full hours. The Russian Armed Forces chief of staff signed with his Syrian counterpart, Lieutenant General Hikmat al-Shihabi, 12 documents related to cooperation in the technical military field. Mikhail Kolesnikov, head of the Russian delegation, termed this as a new starting point in Russian-Syrian military cooperation. These documents were signed against the background of the agreement on military cooperation in the technical field that was signed in April between Syrian Defense Minister Lieutenant General Mustafa Talas and Russian Deputy Premier Oleg Soskovets. This agreement has paved the way for the resumption of military cooperation between the two countries, especially since the USSR was the main exporter of arms to Syria before its collapse.
