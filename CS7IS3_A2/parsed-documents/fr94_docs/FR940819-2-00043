ADDRESSES: Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, Crystal Square 3, Suite 403, 1735 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Virginia 22202&hyph;3461. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Beverly Milkman (703) 603&hyph;7740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 5, 1993, April 22, June 3 and 24, 1994, the Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58 FR 39013, 59 FR 19164, 28847 and 32686) of proposed additions to the Procurement List. After consideration of the material presented to it concerning capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the commodities and services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined that the commodities and services listed below are suitable for procurement by the Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c and 41 CFR 51&hyph;2.4. I certify that the following action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major factors considered for this certification were: 1. The action will not result in any additional reporting, recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities other than the small organizations that will furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on current contractors for the commodities and services. 3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish the commodities and services to the Government. 4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41 U.S.C. 46&hyph;48c) in connection with the commodities and services proposed for addition to the Procurement List. Accordingly, the following commodities and services are hereby added to the Procurement List: Commodities Line, Multi-Loop 1670&hyph;01&hyph;063&hyph;7761 Cup, Disposable 7350&hyph;00&hyph;761&hyph;7467 7350&hyph;00&hyph;914&hyph;5088 7350&hyph;00&hyph;914&hyph;5089 Crate, Wood 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0277 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0278 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0279 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0280 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0281 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0282 8115&hyph;00&hyph;NSH&hyph;0283 (Requirements for the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane, IN) Services Janitorial/Custodial, U.S. Army Reserve Centers, 1130 Arthur Avenue and 185 15th Avenue, Rockford, Illinois Janitorial/Custodial, Building 426, Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico Janitorial/Custodial, Schultz Maintenance Complex, Wilson Creek Road, Ellensburg, Washington Operation of Postal Service Center, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas Parts Machining U.S. Postal Service, National Inventory Control Center, Topeka, Kansas This action does not affect current contracts awarded prior to the effective date of this addition or options exercised under those contracts.
