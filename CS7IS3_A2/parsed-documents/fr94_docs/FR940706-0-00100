For purpose of this subpart, smoking is defined as carrying or inhaling a lighted cigar, cigarette, pipe or other lighted tobacco products. §551.162 Designated no smoking areas. All areas of Bureau of Prisons facilities and vehicles are no smoking areas unless specifically designated as a smoking area by the Warden as set forth in §551.163. §551.163 Designated smoking areas. (a) At all medical referral centers, including housing units, and at minimum security institutions, including satellite camps and intensive confinement centers, the Warden shall identify ``smoking areas'', ordinarily outside of all buildings and away from all entrances so as not to expose others to second-hand smoke. (b) At all low, medium, high, and administrative institutions other than medical referral centers, the Warden shall identify outdoor smoking areas and may, but is not required to, designate a limited number of indoor smoking areas where the needs of effective operations so require, especially for those who may be employed in, or restricted to, a nonsmoking area for an extended period of time. (c) To the maximum extent practicable nonsmoking inmates shall be housed in nonsmoking living quarters. §551.164 Notice of smoking areas. The Warden shall ensure that smoking areas are clearly identified by the appropriate placement of signs. The absence of a sign shall be interpreted as indicating a no smoking area. Appropriate disciplinary action shall be taken for failure to observe smoking restrictions. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16309 Filed 7-5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;05&hyph;P
