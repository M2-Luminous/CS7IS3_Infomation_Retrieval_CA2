It is becoming a sought-after place for international cooperation in research on forest ecosystems. Set up in 1960, this nature reserve covers more than 190,000 ha. It joined the network of international biosphere protection areas in 1980. Specialists point out that the same kind of forests had once existed in North America and Europe, but they have vanished because of human felling or through glacier movements. That leaves Changbai as an important genes store for temperate zone animal species and plant varieties. It has been calculated that there are 2,500 kinds of plants, 500 kinds of vertebrates and nearly a thousand kinds of invertebrates in the area. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up Changbai Mountains Research Station of Forest Ecosystems there. According to a deputy director of the station, with China's wider opening to the world, ecological research has also ended its seclusion. Since the research station first invited two ecology advisers from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to inspect the station in 1979, more than 100 overseas experts have been there to cooperate with Chinese research staff in their studies. It has finished a cooperative research program with Germany, and another program with Britain, studying the application of forest nitrogen, is going on. It is also involved in joint studies of volcanic history with the Swiss Academy of Science, and the research of volcanic activity and changes of vegetation with Japan. The participation of noted world experts and scholars has helped the research there to move further and faster.
