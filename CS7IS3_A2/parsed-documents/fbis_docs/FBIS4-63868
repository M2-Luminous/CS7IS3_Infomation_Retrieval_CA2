According to an agreement signed Tuesday [24 May] at the Meskuciai air base in Lithuania, the three nations intend to create a joint system of air space control. Baltic defense officials say the plan has a number of technical and financial advantages, especially considering intentions to join NATO structures. Supposedly, a Baltic air space control system can be created in 5 to 10 years. During talks in Meskuciai, the three countries agreed to create a joint pilot training center in Lithuania. On Wednesday, Estonian Air Force pilots flew their first training flights on Lithuanian planes. Lithuania's Air Force is considered the strongest among the Baltic states with its four Czech-made jet fighters L-39, two transport planes L-41, which were donated by the German Government, and several Soviet-made AN-2 biplanes. Two Lithuanian L-39's and one helicopter will participate in celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Latvian Air Force in Riga Saturday. The celebration will also be attended by a Lithuanian delegation, headed by the acting Air Force Chief, Colonel Stasys Murza.
