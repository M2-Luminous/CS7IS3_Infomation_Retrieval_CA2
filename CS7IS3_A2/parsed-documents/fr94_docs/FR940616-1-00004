FR940616-1-00004 FR940616-1-00002 The Committee considered and decided not to expand the definition of eligible client member to include individuals who are eligible for non-LSC-funded services provided by the recipient, because it wished to insure that the focus of the legal services program remains on the poor community. Section 1607.2(d). The proposal revises the definition of governing body to clarify that, in addition to the governing bodies of recipients who have as a primary purpose the provision of legal assistance to eligible clients, it also applies to the governing bodies or policy boards created pursuant to §1607.6(e). Section 1607.2(e). This definition of recipient appears in 45 CFR part 1600, but is repeated here for clarity in interpreting this part. Section 1607.3␣Composition Section 1607.3(a). The proposal includes general language, applicable to all categories of board membership, that requires board members to be supportive of the purposes of the LSC Act, and to be interested in and knowledgeable about the delivery of quality legal services to the poor. The current regulation does not include any similar requirement for client board members, but does include similar, although not identical, requirements for attorney and ``other'' board members. The proposal removes the reference to the board reflecting ``the characteristics'' of the client community, in part because it is not clear what that language means and in part because it could be construed to be inconsistent with diversity requirements that are included later in the rule for each category of board membership. Section 1607.3(b). With respect to attorney board members, the proposal revises the language of the rule that is based on the requirements of the McCollum Amendment, which require a majority of the board members to be appointed by state, county and municipal bar associations. The revision clarifies that the appointments can be made by one or more such bar associations, so long as those bar associations collectively represent a majority of attorneys practicing law in the recipient's service area. If there are minority or gender-based bar associations that represent attorneys practicing in a particular locality, those bar associations may be included in the mix of bar associations that make appointments of attorneys to a recipient's board, especially if their inclusion would help to insure that there is appropriate diversity among the attorney members of the board. In addition, although the rule, consistent with the language of the McCollum Amendment, states that the appointments are to be made by the ``governing bodies'' of the bar associations, the Committee recognizes that different bar associations should be free to exercise their appointment responsibility in a manner consistent with their own policies, procedures and practices. The McCollum Amendment does not direct LSC to impose any particular method of appointment on a bar association. The proposed rule also adds language which is based on part of the McCollum amendment that makes it clear that national support centers are not required to use the American Bar Association (``ABA'') or a collection of all state bars to appoint their attorney members, simply because they provide service nationally. The proposed rule also recognizes that some recipients, especially Native-American or migrant programs, may have offices in one state, but also provide services in one or more adjacent or nearby states. The language is intended to permit those programs, if they so decide, to have the bar associations of the other states in which they provide service make appointments as well as the bar of the state in which their principal office is located. In addition, the proposed rule explicitly states what is implicit in the language of the current regulation, i.e., that the additional ten percent of the board members who must be attorneys, but who are not covered by the McCollum amendment, may be selected by the recipient's governing body, if it so chooses. The proposed rule does change current law with respect to the additional ten percent of attorney board members in one respect, however. Under the current regulation, the additional attorneys must be representatives of bar associations or other legal organizations, e.g., law schools. This requirement is not contained in the LSC Act. Under the proposed regulation, the recipient may select attorneys who are not representatives of any particular bar or legal organization, or may select attorneys who are affiliated with non-legal organizations, as long as they are admitted to practice in a state within the recipient's service area, and as long as the organization has an interest in the delivery of legal services to the poor. Thus, the recipient would be able to select lawyers who represent the business community or the United Way and may be helpful in fundraising, or lawyers who provide substantial pro bono services to the client community and may be helpful in designing a recipient's private attorney involvement program. Finally, the proposed regulation revises and relocates the section that relates to diversity among attorney board members. This provision is a variation of the language previously found in §1607.3(c). It is revised to incorporate a more current statement of the concerns addressed by that subsection, but no substantive change is intended. While the language of the proposed rule specifically mentions race, ethnicity and gender, it also includes a reference to other factors that may be relevant in a particular legal community and population of the area served by the recipient, including, for example, age, physical abilities and religious belief. Section 1607.3(c). The proposal includes a number of changes in the language that relates to client board members. The principal revision addresses an issue that has remained ambiguous under the language of the current regulation and has caused problems for some LSC recipients. The proposed revision would codify the current LSC interpretation of the language to require that client board members be selected by client groups that have been designated by the recipient. This proposal also adds language that more accurately reflects the kind of groups or organizations that would be appropriate client groups for purposes of eligible client member selection. In addition, the proposal adds a diversity goal for client board members that is similar to the requirement for attorney board members.
