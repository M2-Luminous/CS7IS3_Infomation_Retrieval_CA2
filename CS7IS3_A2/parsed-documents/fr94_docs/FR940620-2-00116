FR940620-2-00116 FR940620-2-00063 Based on concerns expressed by providers and others about the length and readability of the vaccine information materials (each of the three existing vaccine information pamphlets is 10 pages long) and the lengthy development and revision process required by the rulemaking process (development of the materials took approximately three years), the Department of Health and Human Services proposed legislation to amend section 2126 to provide for simplification of the vaccine information materials. In section 708 of Public Law 103&hyph;183, the Preventive Health Amendments of 1993, which was enacted on December 14, 1993, Congress revised section 2126 to: (1) delete the requirement for development and revision of the vaccine information materials by rulemaking; (2) simplify the information to be included in the materials; and (3) clarify that the materials must not only be provided to the parent or legal representative of a child receiving a covered vaccine, but also must be provided to any adult who receives a covered vaccine. CDC intends to repeal the vaccine information materials currently contained in Appendix A of 42 CFR Part 110, effective September 30, 1994. Section 2126, as amended by Public Law 103&hyph;183, requires that information contained in the revised materials be based on available data and information, be presented in understandable terms, and include: (1) A concise description of the benefits of the vaccine, (2) A concise description of the risks associated with the vaccine, (3) A statement of the availability of the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and (4) Such other relevant information as may be determined by the Secretary. The law also requires that the materials be developed after notice to the public, with a 60-day comment period, and in consultation with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, appropriate health care provider and parent organizations, and the Food and Drug Administration. On January 26, 1994, CDC published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 3752) seeking public comment on proposed new vaccine information materials which were drafted under the revised law. The 60-day comment period ended on March 28, 1994. On February 2, 1994, CDC met with consultants from the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, Food and Drug Administration, American Nurses Association, Children's Defense Fund, March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, National Association of County Health Officials, American Academy of Pediatrics, Ohio Parents for Vaccine Safety, Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies Coalition, Dissatisfied Parents Together, Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, American Osteopathic Pediatricians, and American Academy of Family Physicians. Comments were submitted by 32 individuals or organizations in response to the January 26 notice, and varied from those that focused on conceptual objections to word choice suggestions. Comments from the consultants, along with the comments submitted in response to the January 26 notice, were fully considered in revising the vaccine information materials, and suggestions were incorporated if deemed appropriate. Examples of comments that were incorporated are the addition of a sentence stating that vaccines may be given simultaneously; the addition of information on how to learn more about the vaccine (from the vaccine package insert, or other sources); the use of graphics and a standard format for all VISs; and the revision of the vaccine schedules to be consistent with recommendations of both the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and the American Academy of Pediatrics. Following consultation and review of comments submitted, new vaccine information materials which comply with the provisions of the revised section 2126 have been finalized and are contained in this notice. They are entitled ``Polio Vaccine: What you need to know before you or your child gets the vaccine,'' ``Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Vaccine (MMR): What you need to know before you or your child gets the vaccine,'' ``Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP): What you need to know before your child gets the vaccine,'' and ``Tetanus and Diphtheria Vaccine (Td): What you need to know before you get the vaccine.'' Vaccine Information Materials Required Use As required under section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. ยง300aa-26), effective October 1, 1994, all health care providers who administer any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, or polio vaccine shall, prior to administration of the vaccine, provide a copy of the relevant vaccine information materials contained in this notice: (1) To any adult to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine, and (2) To the legal representative of any child to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine. The materials shall be supplemented with visual presentations or oral explanations, in appropriate cases.
