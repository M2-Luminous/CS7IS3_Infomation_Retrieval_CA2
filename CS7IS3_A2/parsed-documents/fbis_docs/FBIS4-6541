FBIS4-6541 "dreas078__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-078-A Daily Report 10 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan Status of SDF in Post-Cold War Era Examined Status of SDF in Post-Cold War Era Examined Inadequacy of Reserve System OW2004143994 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 22--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2004143994 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Article by Shigeru Handa, from the "Building of the New SDF Following the End of the Cold War" series; part four entitled "I Shamefully Say That I Am a Soldier in the SDF Reserves"] [Text] Last winter, a group of reservists from the Ground Self-Defense Force [GSDF] underwent marksmanship training at the Kitafuji Training Ground in Yamanashi Prefecture. About 120 reserves from Shizuoka, Yamanashi, and Kanagawa Prefectures participated in the training. Many wore spectacles for the elderly because they had been discharged from the Self-Defenses Forces [SDF] at the mandatory discharge age. Kenso Goto, 60, said after finishing his training: "Why did I come here? I came here to meet old friends again." He was a warrant officer in the reserves. Reservists undergo five days of markmanship training every year. It is rumored that the fixed number of the GSDF members will be reduced when the Guideline for Defense Buildup is reviewed, and that the reserves are a "trump card" for the GSDF. The GSDF, which has 46,000 reserves, intends to maintain its combat capability by making up for future reductions in its numbers by using the reserves, but there are a host of problems with the GSDF reserve system. Uniforms are given to reservists when they report to training; they pin their insignia on and begin markmanship training. Unlike SDF members on active duty, no officer is in charge of overseeing their training, and no call-up training has ever been conducted to prepare them for an emergency. The GSDF reserve system falls short of meeting the requirement for immediate preparedness, and has a fatal defect in maintaining the reserves as supplementary combat capabilities. The "Guideline for Defense Buildup," which was formulated 18 years ago, clearly carries a provision calling for the "expansion" of the reserves to bolster the SDF's combat capabilities during an emergency. If the expansion in the provision aims at bolstering the nation's combat capabilities by calling up the SDF reserves in large numbers and by making emergency procurements of such mainstay military hardware as tanks and fighters (as a senior official in the Defense Agency [DA] interprets), then the SDF reserve system should be revamped. The "Defense Issues Council," an advisory body for Prime Minister Hosokawa, held its fifth round of meetings on 6 April. Providing an explanation of the provision at the meeting, the Defense Agency said: "In the past we studied it, but we do not do so now. We have no system for emergency procurement." Explaining the reason for the DA leaving the provision untouched, a senior DA official has said: "We need legislation to strengthen our combat capabilities in the event of an emergency. However, we fear being interrogated in the Diet about such legislation." While some say such "legislation is locked in a safe," others say the legislation has been shelved because of a lack of tension in Japan's neighbors. Seiki Nishhiro, an adviser to the DA who was involved in formulating the Guideline for the Defense Buildup, has recalled: "The provision was fake." What has the DA done over the past 18 years since the Guideline for the Defense Buildup was formulated? Another senior DA official has said: "If the DA takes aggressive measures to enforce the provision and announces the recruitment of SDF reserves, the people will undoubtedly criticize the DA for trying to institute a draft." Although the 1992 Defense White Paper described the SDF as "the people's forces," the DA in fact feels alienated from the people. Bureaus in the DA as well as the Ground Staff Office in the GSDF have begun studying ways to adopt a new SDF reserve system, but they will certainly encounter rough sailing in their study. Recently the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development has been raised, and Prime Minister Hosokawa, who expressed an for disarmament, announced his resignation on 8 April. Several senior DA officials are revealing their hopes that the current SDF reserve system will be strengthened by external factors, asking: "Will the direction of the winds change?"
