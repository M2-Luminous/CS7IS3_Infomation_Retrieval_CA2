ADB said the plantation project, which is to cover 9,000 hectares, will increase annual wood production by 128,000 cubic meters and to reduce pressure on exploitation of natural forests. The bank noted that the overwhelming dependence of Lao economy on forest resources has led to a rapid decline of forest cover in the country. To check the rapid depletion of the country's forest resources, the Lao government has launched a new system of forest resource management to classify forest land into production, protection and conservation, and reforestation areas. The plantation project, a part of the new system, is to be carried out in eight districts in Vientiane Prefecture and the Provinces of Vientiane, Bolikhamsai and Savannakhet to reestablish tree cover on unstocked and degraded forest lands.
