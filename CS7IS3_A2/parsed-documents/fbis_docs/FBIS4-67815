The portable bomb approximately the size of a cup of tea or a small ball is presumably capable of destroying every living thing in the radius of a large modern city or rayon. Britons engaged in collecting material concerning this for 18 whole months, trying to find the confirmation of rumors that have been disturbing the Western press for a long time -- rumors to the effect that secret smuggling channels are being used to ship out of Russia ``red mercury,'' the very existence of which is denied by scientific-technical experts. No, asserts G. Roberts, who leads the narration in the sensational British television research. This substance is not a myth: it is, in fact, a major component in a ``clean'' thermonuclear bomb that has presumably been made in Russia and nowhere else in the world. True, his conversational partners on the topic of ``red mercury'' remain, as a rule, anonymous, and their testimony sounds, one has to admit, not too convincing. The attempt to get hold of responsible and knowledgeable commentators finally led the film makers to Yekaterinburg, where they photographed scenes that greatly resemble old James Bond hits: secret meetings at twilight with certain unknown individuals who first promised to provide the needed information, but at the last moment disappeared, frightened by the consequences. Nevertheless the group from England would appear to have succeeded in learning the secrets about the weapon that can become a new and even more frightening threat for all of mankind. They met with a Russian scientist who personally, over a five-year period, allegedly participated in work on this project. In any case the film's consultants were convinced that that testimony is substantiated. Another eminent expert in the field of nuclear physics, American Professor Cohen, has stated firmly that American scientists, so far as one can judge from the materials that were collected by the British television group, are lagging seriously behind their Russian colleagues in this area. In Cohen's opinion, now it will be impossible to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world. At the end of the film there is an interview with the head of a major German company. That entrepreneur states that he knows personally about proposals concerning such major sales of ``red mercury'' from Russia, and that he was simply terrified. [Editor's note] A representative of RF Ministry of Defense has rejected the hypotheses concerning the existence both of ``red mercury'' and the ``ninibomb'' that was created on its basis (see IZVESTIYA, No. 70).
