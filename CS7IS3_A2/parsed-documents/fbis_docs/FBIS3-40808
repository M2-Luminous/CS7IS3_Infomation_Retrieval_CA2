The following is the text of the statement made by the Union Minister of Commerce, Mr. Pranab Mukherjee, in Parliament today. The Uruguay Round talks have been concluded last night and an overall agreement covering trade in goods, trade in services, trade related intellectual property rights, trade related investment measures, trade in textiles, and trade in agricultural commodities has been crystalised for adoption and ratification by the Governments of the 117 countries which have been involved in the negotiations. As the Government has clarified on more than one occasion, in both Houses of Parliament, India has been a consistent supporter of an orderly multilateral trading system. Such a system confers the benefits of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment to all members, benefits of reduced tariffs and increased market access and the protection of a Multilateral Dispute Settlement Mechanism. It is expected that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round will result in significant expansion in world trade as a result of which India should be able to increase its own exports by $1.5 billions to $2 billions annually in addition to the normal growth. The reduction in export subsidies on agriculture by developed countries will make Indian agricultural exports more competitive in world markets. It may be mentioned that despite their strong reservations regarding permitting the import of rice, even countries like Japan and South Korea have agreed to allow market access for rice to other exporting countries. As I had informed the House in the course of my reply to the discussion last week, taking the product and non-product agricultural subsidies together, India's aggregate subsidy works out to a substantial negative figure thereby providing a very large scope for further augmentation of agricultural subsidies if the Government were to choose to raise the subsidies from the current levels. The proposed agreement provides for a subsidy level of 10 per cent of the value of the agricultural produce which is far higher than the current negative level of subsidy. The agreement has also clarified that consumer subsidies under the Public Distribution System for the rural and urban poor are outside the scope of disciplines and our PDS system can thus be continued without any difficulty. While we would give reasonable protection to plant breeders new develop how plant varieties under the Agreement, the rights of farmers and researchers will also be fully protected. As I have already clarified in the House, in the "sui generis" legislation which is being drafted for this purpose, the interests of our farmers will be safeguarded. As stated by me earlier in the House, the agreement does not place any explicit obligation to patent naturally occurring genes and gene sequences. I am already on record that Government do not intend to permit patenting of naturally occurring genes and gene sequences in the patents legislation which would have to be instituted in 10 years after coming into force of the proposed agreement. While India had initially not been in favour of inclusion of Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights in the scope of the Uruguay Round, it had ultimately to go along with the rest of the world community. A country like ours, which does not presently recognise product patents in the field of drugs, food products and chemicals, has been allowed a transition period of 10 years for establishing a product patent regime for such items. If we were to opt out of the new agreement, the possibility of our major trading partners insisting upon a much earlier introduction of product patents on the threat of imposition of restrictions on the export of our goods into their markets cannot be ruled out. Members may be aware that under such pressure some developing countries very recently decided to introduce an entirely new patent regime in accordance with the wishes of some developed countries to safeguard their market access to those countries. I had also clarified in the House that the fears regarding an inordinate rise in the price of patented drugs after the introduction of product patents are not quite justified because under the agreement, the government would be able to undertake compulsory licensing for non-commercial public use as well as to prevent situations of either inadequate availability or exorbitant pricing. Besides, the Government retains the right to institute price control on drugs. As regards the agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures, the position is that the Government retains its sovereign right to decide what type of foreign investment it wishes to allow into the country. Conditions can also be imposed regarding fulfilment of export obligations to balance the outgo and inflow of foreign exchange by such ventures. The only requirement under the agreement is that once a unit has been allowed to come into the country it will be treated at par with other indigenous units in terms of regulations and policies. As regards textiles, though we are unhappy with the extension of the quota regime by importing countries for another 10 years and unsatisfactory annual rate of enhancement of the import quotas, it has to be recognised that the commitment to finally phase out the quota regime after 10 years is a positive gain for textile exporting countries, including India. In the final hours of the Round, an attempt was made by some industrialised countries to alter the textile agreement of the draft final Act to our disadvantage. The argument given was that India, while benefiting from the open trading system and in spite of being competitive in textiles, had kept its market closed. Forceful suggestions were made that we should open our market also on a reciprocal basis. We took the position that the multi-fibre agreement was a derogation from GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), and the integration of the Textiles trade into GATT was not something that required any contribution from us. We sustained our position in spite of concerted demands on us. We also successfully resisted concerted moves to extend the period of integration of textile trade from 10 to 15 years by taking a strong position on the issue. The Standing Committee attached to the Commerce Ministry, which had gone into the implications of the Dunkel Draft in great detail, has recommended in its report, that while all efforts should be made to safeguard India's interests in key sectors of agriculture, textiles, services and Intellectual Property Rights, at the end of the day, India should remain a part of a multilateral trading system rather than opting out the same and getting totally isolated from the rest of the world. On the whole it is our considered judgment that India has more to benefit from the expansion of world trade through the Uruguay Round Agreement rather than pursuing any alternative course of action.
