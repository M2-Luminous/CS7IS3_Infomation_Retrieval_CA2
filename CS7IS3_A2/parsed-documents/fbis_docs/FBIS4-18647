Moreover, he is holding a trump card to make the duelists agree. A sort of compromise between federalism and decentralization, i.e., to divide Italy in 25 or 50 counties to which the exclusive right to levy taxes is granted. In addition, he wants to put a ceiling to revenue tax pressure, a superministry of economy, and a reform of IRPEF [personal income tax]. And what if the pole for freedom wrecks? Would Ciampi remain prime minister? The professor has no doubts. "I believe that these elections have a clear political significance. The fact of Ciampi remaining in his seat would become a problem only if a majority cannot be established. However, this would be bad luck, not for Ciampi, who is a trustworthy person and who has been working well as governor of the Bank of Italy, but because the new parliament is unable to guarantee a government majority." [Vaiano] How can a joint program be worked out between both duelists? [Martino] The element which can bring them together is the willingness to hold the flood of taxes in check. If we hold on to the present rate, in the year 2000 we will have an average taxation level of 60 percent, with public expenditure nearing 75 percent of national income. We want -- and I do not know whether we will introduce it at once or in two phases -- a sole 33-percent personal income tax rate and a significant increase in personal tax allowances, in order to exonerate the have-nots and protect the big families. [Vaiano] The big obstacle seems federalism, however... [Martino] If I interpret the issue correctly, the majority of League voters considers federalism a restraint to the unbridled expansion of a wasting and corrupt state. [Vaiano] And what will Forza Italia propose? [Martino] The local government levels are too numerous. There are about 350,000 city councillors; this is a real army of employees. It should be possible to create one local body covering a sufficiently large territory to allow the financing of its own governing level, but which would also be small enough to maintain the population's control over the functioning of the local government. It would be a kind of county. [Vaiano] How many could there be? [Martino] Between 25 and 50. Their dimension should be somewhat smaller than a region and larger than a present province. [Vaiano] Will taxes be paid at the central level or the county level? [Martino] The authority to impose taxes could be taken away from the central government and transferred to the local level. On two conditions, however: There should be a balance and a certain percentage of the yields should be transferred to the central government. [Vaiano] Will the new government proceed to antideficit measures soon? [Martino] I am against mending measures like the ones we have seen over the last few years. The system needs to be changed, and expenses should be cut. We will not use tax squeezing methods. Privatizations can be carried through gradually. And we will stay alert not to incite inflationist flares. [Vaiano] Are you thinking of setting up a superministry of economy? [Martino] Yes, although there is also another hypothesis: the merger of the Finance and Budget Ministries, which would be the easiest solution. [Vaiano] What will happen to taxing treasury bills and stock exchange transactions? [Martino] Government stock cannot be affected at all: for moral reasons, because the state has made a contract with the saver, and for economic reasons, because panic would emerge among savers. Also in the field of capital gain I do not see any new taxes. [Vaiano] Will there be a major purge at the top of the state and government bodies? [Martino] We will follow a third path, between the model of an immovable bureaucracy, which gradually becomes too powerful, and the American model, which replaces 2,000 civil servants following a change in the administration. [Vaiano] However, there are many headhunters, especially for RAI [state broadcasting company]. [Martino] The statements about RAI can easily be explained by the -- justified -- resentment about the way in which some election programs were conducted.
