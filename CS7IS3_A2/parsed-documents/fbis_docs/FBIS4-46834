Yefimov's press conference by Yu. Vereshchagin: "Problems of the Transportation Complex"] [Text] Russian Minister of Transportation V. Yefimov held a press conference in Government House on the subject "Transport: the People, the Work, and the Problems," in which he provided details on the current situation in the country's transportation and highway complex. In the minister's words, Russia's transportation system is entering the market with more and more confidence day after day. Many enterprises have been converted to share holding and privatized. The state sector (including the Ministry of Railways) accounts for 37 percent of the transportation complex today. Following the economic recession in 1991 and 1992, it began a slow recovery. Currency receipts from this sector of the economy are increasing. Air transport, as an example, provided 40 percent more foreign exchange for the treasury than in the preceding year; river transport increased its currency contribution by 25 percent, and the throughput capacity of river ports was increased by 1.5 times as much... Now, V. Yefimov said, under the aegis of the Ministry of Transportation, a program is being developed to prevent idle time in Russia's transportation production line and establish inspection systems. Licensing of the right to operate all means of transportation in the complex is being vigorously introduced. Beginning on 1 July, the ministry is starting a new activity--certification of personnel involved in transportation safety. This means that a specialist who is certificated will be able to prove his right to inspect means of transportation. Then V. Yefimov dwelled on the features of the different transportation sectors. Despite the economic difficulties, a gradual updating of the technical equipment, as well as the enterprises and complexes, is taking place gradually in the maritime and river fleets, in the airlines, in facilities for motor vehicle drivers, and in the Federal Highway Service. Aviation enterprises, for example, acquired 54 new current-generation aircraft last year: the Il-96, Tu-204, An-124, and other aircraft. Federal programs are being worked out in civil aviation subunits today to improve the unified system for air traffic organization and aviation safety. A state program is being established to develop civil aviation up to the year 2000. Last year, 17 new air routes were opened. The situation in maritime transport continues to be complicated because of changes in the transportation market for services and nonpayments. The number of obsolete vessels written off in 1993 (59) exceeded the number added (15). Nevertheless, the Russian fleet continues to stand its difficult watch. Overall profit from its activity last year amounted to 600 billion rubles [R]. For the first time this year, Russia's shipping companies ordered about 80 vessels, most of which will be built in domestic shipyards, with their own funds and the funds of Russian and foreign investors. Construction and renovation of several major ports are under way. Russia should continue to be a great sea power, the minister said. As V. Yefimov noted, preparation of the river fleet and ports for the current navigation season has been conducted under difficult financial conditions. Russia's river transportation facilities include about 100,000 kilometers of shipping channels, 4,700 shipping companies and ship owners, 120 river ports, and over 100 ship repair yards. The process of changing enterprises to share holding is being completed in this sector now. A little over 25 percent of the stock remains with the state in this case. But the chief concern, in the minister's opinion, is the fact that shipping and the ports have turned out to be in an extremely critical financial situation without payment in advance, inasmuch as many clients still have not settled accounts for the work performed last year. As a result, the river transportation workers do not have anything to pay for ship fuel and electricity, and, finally, to pay their specialists' wages. A paradoxical situation is taking shape: the fleet is prepared to work and shippers have the commodities and the need to ship them by water routes, but the consumer does not have the funds to pay for the products and the transportation tariffs. The river transportation workers who supply regions in the far north are in an even worse situation. Practically no cargo has accumulated yet at the transshipment ports, and petroleum products are not being purchased, although they are available in sufficient amounts at the petroleum bulk plants for transshipment. In addition, there are numerous problems in keeping the locks, canals, and other water route facilities in working order. About 100 million passengers are transported every day by motor vehicle and suburban electrical transportation service. They account for 87 percent of the passenger service provided by all modes of transportation. In most regions, V. Yefimov noted, the problems of subsidies for unprofitable passenger vehicle enterprises still have not been resolved. The Department of Automotive Transport has worked out a special program to get out of this difficult situation. In particular, it provides for a system of steady financial support for suburban passenger transport services, production organization, and the purchase of rolling stock and spare parts. The program stipulates that about 3,000 buses be manufactured at the sector's enterprises and that new capacities be established to turn out trolley buses in Bryansk and streetcars in Yekaterinburg. It takes into account the standards regulating passenger services in large cities and the countryside. Thanks to a special system for financing and managing the country's roads in the economic crisis, the Federal Road Department managed to save the country's dilapidated road network from destruction in 1993, to put a stop to the disintegration of repair enterprises, and to retain their personnel. In the minister's words, the process of bringing the highway network up to date has begun, the Ministry of Transportation has begun to implement a road traffic safety program, and general-use roads, which had no financing in the recent past, are being included in the republic network... Over the past 2 years, the length of the highway network has increased by 40,000 kilometers. Main routes such the ones between Moscow and Voronezh, Omsk and Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk, and Chita and Khabarovsk are being renovated. Several large bridges are being built. In a word, Russia is crawling out of the quagmire of impassable roads little by little. And, as a whole, the transportation and highway complex--the TDK--is moving out of a state of confusion and apathy. A great deal of work lies ahead.
