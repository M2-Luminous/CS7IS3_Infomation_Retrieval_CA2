According to the statistics of the Czech Republic Police, the growth of economic crime surpassed even the so-far most widespread property-related crime, which rose 15.4 percent last year in comparison with 1992, and violent crime, with its increase of 6.7 percent. Policemen specializing in this field, the number of whom remained virtually unchanged last year, managed to solve 77.1 percent of the offenses in the sphere of economic crime (it was 83 percent in 1992). The almost 18,500 economic offenses resulted in damages in excess of 4.2 billion korunas [Kc] last year. Because the police statistics cover only proven cases, the police staff specializing in this area estimate the actual extent of the damages to be far higher. The volume of ascertained economic crimes will apparently continue to grow in the years to come because many so-far-undetected cases may be discovered by the control activity of the financial authorities. Economic crime currently comprises primarily embezzlement and fraud, but there is also a high percentage of larceny (including the theft of shipments), bribery, unauthorized enterprise, smuggling, illegal currency trading, transgression of economic discipline, unauthorized use of vehicles that do not belong to the user, etc. On a long-term basis, property-related crime (particularly burglary and simple theft) dominates among its individual forms. With its more than 327,000 cases, it represents about 82 percent of all crimes. The total damage caused by property-related crimes surpassed Kc9.6 billion, and only 21 percent of them have been solved.
