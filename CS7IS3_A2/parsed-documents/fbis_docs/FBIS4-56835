FBIS4-56835 "drlat090_j_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 Panama Opposition Candidates Concede Defeat Opposition Candidates Concede Defeat Doctrinaire Panamenist Candidate PA0905172694 Panama City Radio KW Continente in Spanish 1600 GMT 9 May 94 PA0905172694 Panama City Radio KW Continente Spanish BFN [Interview with Jose Salvador Munoz, president of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, by unidentified correspondent; place and date not given -- live or recorded] [Correspondent] Can you give us your opinion on the electoral process yesterday? [Munoz] I gladly take this opportunity to address the Panamanian people and to congratulate them on my own behalf and on that of my party for the civic spirit demonstrated yesterday. It shows that we have matured a great deal. I hope that the same civic spirit displayed yesterday will serve all of us Panamanians to demand that our government leaders keep their promises. We now have two processes: We concluded one, which was to elect our government leaders. The next one, the next stage of this democratic process, is to demand of our government leaders the fulfillment of the mandate we have bestowed on them. I am drafting a note to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares congratulating him on his victory and reminding him that our country faces serious problems in the next five years and that all Panamanians hope he will always act in the interests of our fatherland. [Correspondent] There are many people in Panama, especially the adversaries of Dr. Perez Balladares, who believe that the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party] -- which we assume won the elections -- could signify a return to militarism, reprisals, and persecution. How do you view the PRD's return to power? [Munoz] I have no doubt whatsoever that some people will try to collect on the debts they are owed, so to speak. Nevertheless, I think that Dr. Perez Balladares has enough talent to realize that such a situation in Panama would cause a confrontation. He must also understand that even though he won, he has 70 percent of the people against him. He won with 30 percent of the votes, which we must respect and support, but he also has 70 percent of the people against him. I don't think that he, being the talented man that he is, would allow the feelings or the political misconceptions of some party member to create a situation for him that would provoke a confrontation, which would make it even more difficult for his government. I don't think that will happen. [Correspondent] Do you consider yourself part of the opposition to Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares? [Munoz] I am another Panamanian who headed a political party. I am waiting with my party for a reasonable time period to pass to take the political measures we consider advisable. [Correspondent] Thank you for your statements to Radio KW Continente. [Munoz] Thank you again for the opportunity to reiterate my message to the people congratulating them for the way they behaved yesterday and to remind them that it is the people's obligation not only to vote but to demand of their government leaders fulfillment of their promises and, therefore, to demand their attention whenever they deem it necessary. Thank you very much.
