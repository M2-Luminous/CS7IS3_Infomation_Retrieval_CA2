In fierce fighting, the aggressor lost 30 soldiers. "Members of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina from Donji Vakuf's 370th Brcko Brigade are scoring only successes in this region. In less than 24 hours the enemy has lost another two T-55 tanks. A general danger alert is in force in Bugojno as we report." According to Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic, "after the bestial shelling of Bihac and the outskirts of Cazin yesterday, in which one person was killed and several wounded, the night in the Bihac and Cazin area was somewhat quieter. Nevertheless, the chetniks sporadically shelled their old targets, the suburbs of Bihac, the outskirts of Cazin, the Bihac-Cazin road, and the industrial zone." Sadikovic also reports that a "new artillery-tank attack was launched on the Grmusko-Srbjanski plateau early this morning," and that "the attack is still in progress." Travnik correspondent Ahmet Begicevic reports that "owing to the shelling, a general danger alarm was sounded in Travnik at about 2200 [2100 GMT] last night. The chetniks fired an artillery shell at the town from the Vlasic plateau, causing substantial material damage and wounding one person. Travnik was also sporadically shelled overnight. At 0730 this morning, the general danger alarm was sounded again after another shell had been fired on the town." According to the studio announcer, "the extremists of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] seriously violated the cease-fire agreement on several occasions yesterday, especially in the central parts of Mostar, the Information Service of the 4th Army Corps reports. The fighters of Vinko Martinovic yesterday violated the cease-fire that is otherwise being observed across the entire operational zone of the 4th Army Corps. Members of this formation fired several times using an RPG [expansion unknown] and splinter ammunition at the line of separation from the direction of the Health Center. The HVO extremists also attacked the road junction near the bus station in Mostar with a sower of death [M-84 machine gun]. Provocations continued throughout the night. "Regarding the latest serious violation of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, the Command of the 4th Army Corps has lodged a protest with the Spanish UN battalion, expecting the representatives of the peace forces finally to do something, considering that previous warnings have not yielded any results. (?Similar) provocations by irresponsible groups and individuals from the HVO were also registered on the Prozor front, in the Orahovica region. "The defense lines in this part of the 4th Army Corps' operational zone were also the target of artillery attacks by the Serbian aggressor, especially in the region of (?Djelimic), the Information Service of the 4th Army Corps reports."
