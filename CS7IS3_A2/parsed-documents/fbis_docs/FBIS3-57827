Together they have a second and probably last opportunity to speak, in an ambitious way, about employment. For the SP leader, the precondition for success is social partners' readiness to depart from cheap cliches and "simplistic thought patterns." If the consultation fails, they will also be responsible for the negative employment results. Vandenbroucke said that he had reason to look back with satisfaction on the past political year. In particular his party's major renewal, both structurally and substantially, visibly pleases him. He has succeeded in overturning the SP's almost fossilized structures and in gradually constructing a modern, political membership party. He reminded listeners of his successful referendum, in which more than 95,000 SP members were given an opportunity to express their opinions, an invitation which almost half of them accepted. "Did you know that a few years ago we didn't even have a central members' register?" Vandenbroucke quickly added. Moreover, the recent party congress agreed to update the contents of the traditional socialist message. "For a long time social progress was equated with purely materialistic progress. We broke with this vision, and now insist that social emancipation also involves raising the quality of life and society. Contrary to some opinions, this is very much a message of and for the average Fleming, i.e., not just for intellectuals." New Spring The chairman concurs that the six hearings the SP organized aroused enthusiasm primarily among intellectuals. "Possibly this has more to do with the death of the culture of meetings than with the rich contents. You cannot get average people out of their homes any more for a meeting, only professionals still make this effort." The party leader went on to state that a new generation of socialists was ready to embody this doctrine. "It is these newcomers who made the success of the SP congress two weeks ago. At the risk of forgetting names, I would point to the rich contribution of people like Jan Peeters, Johan Vande Lanotte, Leo Peeters, Renaat Landuyt, Anne Van Lancker, Carlos Lisabeth, Dany Vandenbossche, and Francy Vanderwildt. They seem to be the first blossoming buds announcing a new spring for us." Vandenbroucke answered the question as to whether this renewal would also be apparent in the list of candidates prepared for the communal elections, with the statement that local policies cannot be dictated from SP headquarters on Brussels' Keizerslaan. "The local departments received a clear suggestion from me to give the enlargement a chance in the communal elections. In Mechelen and Ghent they have already made the first moves in this direction. For me, the real test only comes in December 1995, with the next parliamentary elections." He was not ready to give away much about the preparation of the SP list of candidates for the June 1994 European elections. "I wanted first of all to know whether the government would survive. Now that I am certain, I am beginning my talks." He recognizes that European Commissioner Karel van Miert in first place would "be a particularly good thing, but, for various reasons, this is not a simple matter." Insistent questions as to whether he would head the list were brushed aside with enigmatic smiles: "You'll hear about it, the question is not that urgent yet." We noted the same reserved attitude when the Vanvelthoven affair was placed on the table. "We expect total integrity from our mandataries. Louis [Vanvelthoven] [Former president of the Flemish Council] acted consistently, I don't want to say anything more about this." Vandenbroucke finds it very irritating that this affair is mentioned in the same breath as the SP scandals. At the same time he appears very conscious of the problems threatening the [Prime Minister] Dehaene cabinet if Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme is pressed further into the corner by the courts [for his alleged involvement in the Agusta helicopter bribery case] and should this Walloon politician eventually refuse to act upon this appropriately. Voting Rights For Vandenbroucke, 1993 was the toughest year for Flemish socialists since the split of the BSP (Belgian Socialist Party) at the end of the seventies. "We continued to participate in the government after an election defeat; the budget preparation and control were difficult and demanded considerable effort; the economy is doing particularly badly, forcing us to prepare a crisis plan. Despite this we note that the opinions polls once again give us a slight edge. Although it's not enough yet. At the end of the government's term of office, we should end up at our true level, a good 20 percent," the SP chairman philosophized. With his negative opinion on granting voting rights to migrants, he was asked if he is not rejecting a number of left-wing intellectuals, while some "brown thinking" supporters consider him just a little "too flexible" when it comes to foreigners? "I am in favor of votes for migrants via naturalization, let's be clear on that. But arguing about this right now plays only into the hands of the extremists and to the disadvantage of the tolerant center." A little later, Vandenbroucke openly recognized that his participation in the "hand-in-hand" demonstration through Antwerp did him no electoral good. This by no means implied that he will not appear in future antiracist demonstrations. The socialist leader is counting on the government to implement its crisis plan with a triple aim: to prove the prophets of employment doom wrong, to achieve the reform of the pension system and health insurance, and to give solid results by 1995 in the fight against fraud. At the same time, the Flemish Government received a compliment in this festive period from Vandenbroucke for its recent decision to encourage the distribution of work by giving the so-called second check. "I hope that the federal social partners will take equally creative paths, in order to proceed to the necessary redistribution." Almost passionately he went on to add: "I would ask the ABVV [Flemish wing of Socialist Trade Union] and the ACV [Flemish wing of Christian Trade Union] to show, after the new year, that the unemployed are as important for them as the employed. Indeed it is high time that we spoke a little less about what is impossible, and a little more about what is possible?" VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] Finally, Vandenbroucke has no plans to soften the discussion about what future we want for Flanders and the Flemings. As a result he continues to challenge the VLD to disclose its alternatives. "Moreover I notice a steadily increasing similarity between the VLD and the `Reaganomics' of the early eighties: the relating of totally unbelievable statistics to ideological coherence, i.e. only the rich fare better. In concrete terms, the middle class is entitled to hear from the VLD how much it is really going to cost them." In 1994, politically interested Flanders will therefore again be able to witness several rounds of powerful verbal-ideological fighting between the SP and the VLD. Just as long as this does not become personal, it is -- at times -- even very interesting.
