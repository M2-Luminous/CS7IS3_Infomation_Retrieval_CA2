Those results stem from a poll requested by Telemetro Television Network which included interviews conducted in 1,260 houses in Panama, Cocle, Chiriqui, Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas Provinces from 9 to 11 February. The Federico Guerra consulting firm carried out the poll. The results of the poll show that Perez Balladares obtained a 32.8 percent preference rating; Carles a 16.3 percent; and Blades 14.8 percent. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber is in fourth place with 9.9 percent; industrialist Samuel Lewis Galindo [Solidarity Party candidate] came in fifth with 2.9 percent; Christian Democratic Party candidate Eduardo Vallarino, the sixth position with 2 percent; and last place is held by Jose Salvador Munoz [Doctrinaire Panamenist Party candidate] who obtained 0.2 percent. The poll results also indicate that 21.1 percent of the people interviewed remain undecided on who they will vote for in the 8 May presidential elections. Comparing this poll with others carried out at the end of 1993, it can be noted that Carles, who did not appear in the latter, has managed to overtake other candidates, including Ruben Blades, in this one. Blades, however, has suffered a decline in his popularity rating. Furthermore, the poll results reveal that although Perez Balladares and Carles obtained the highest preference ratings, they are also the candidates who obtained the highest negative ratings. Of polled interviewed, 31.3 percent stated they would not vote for Carles, another 20 percent objected to Perez Balladares' candidacy, 14.8 percent objected to Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, 7.6 percent of those interviewed said they would not back Blades, 3.3 percent would not support Vallarino, 1.9 percent likewise regarding Lewis Galindo, and 1.6 percent do not intend to vote for Jose Salvador Munoz. The Telemetro poll included interviews in 105 sectors of the country. In each sector 12 homes were chosen. Regarding candidates for city mayor, Omaira Correa leads with a 31.5 percent preference. She is followed by Andres Vega Cedeno [PRD] with 21.3 percent, Ana Mae de Endara 10.3 percent, Isabel Corro [Labor Party] 2.1 percent, Hernan Arias [Christian Democratic Party] 1.3 percent, Jose Manuel Paredes [National Unity Mission] 1.2 percent, and Maribel Cuervo de Paredes 0.4 percent.
