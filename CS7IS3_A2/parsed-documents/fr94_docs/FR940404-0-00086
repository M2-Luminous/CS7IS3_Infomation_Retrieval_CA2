FR940404-0-00086 FR940404-0-00023 1. The amended regulations are intended to help teach inmates responsibility and management of resources. The former collect call system provides little or no incentive for inmates to shoulder personal responsibility for the costs of their telephone calls, as collect call billing shifts the costs to other parties. This excuses inmates from exercising a basic form of decision-making on how to spend their funds, a decision that must be made every day by other adults. The Bureau believes that encouraging inmates to face practical life-style choices is an integral part of the rehabilitation process. In recognizing the importance of developing this skill, the Bureau provides education programming for life-coping skills such as budgeting. This is consistent with the Bureau's statutory mandate, as set forth in 18 U.S.C. 4001 and 4042, to provide for inmates' ``government, discipline, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and reformation.'' By providing for the operation of a debit-billing system in which inmates are responsible for the cost of their telephone calls (unless there is good cause for the placement of a collect call or a compelling circumstance justifies the placement of a call at government expense), the amended regulations help the Bureau to meet its statutory mandate. In order to exercise their telephone privileges, inmates will have to establish their priorities, purchase telephone credits at the prison commissary, and manage the expenditure of their telephone credits. Moreover, by taking responsibility for the costs of their telephone calls and managing their telephone credits, inmates gain an increased sense of control over their lives. The switch from the former collect system to the debit billing ITS also provides an added incentive for inmates to obtain the higher-skilled and higher-paying prison work assignments. Through such work, inmates can develop occupational skills and the discipline of working on a regular basis, factors which contribute to an inmate's successful return to society. In recognition of this fact, the United States Congress has mandated work assignments for all inmates, except as necessitated by security considerations, disciplinary action, medical reasons, or other programming involvement. See 18 U.S.C. 4121; Public Law 101&hyph;647, 104 Stat. 4914. By providing an incentive to work to obtain money for telephone calls, the amended regulations and the ITS debit-billing system encourage the fulfillment of this Congressional objective. 2. The amended regulations are intended to increase the incentive for inmates to participate in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (IFRP), a program that encourages inmates to set and meet regular payment schedules, consistent with their resources, for their court-imposed fines, restitutions, and other financial obligations. The program stresses the importance of fiscal responsibility. See 28 CFR part 545 subpart B. The Bureau considers the inmate's efforts to fulfill financial obligations as indicative of the inmate's acceptance, and demonstrated level, of responsibility. This is one factor in determining an inmate's readiness to return to society. Participation in the IFRP is voluntary, but inmates who refuse to participate are restricted in their commissary spending, not eligible to receive a furlough or consideration for community placement, and not permitted to work in Federal Prison Industries. These amended regulations add another restriction to this list: 28 CFR §545.11(d)(10) provides that inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP are allowed to place no more than one telephone call every month, at the inmate's expense, absent authorization from the Warden for additional inmate-paid calls based upon compelling circumstances. Inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP retain the same access as other inmates to unmonitored attorney calls arranged by unit staff. See re-designated 28 CFR 540.102 and 103, formerly §§540.101 and 102. The Bureau's policy of offering inmates the choice of participating in the IFRP, with its clearly stated consequences, has been an effective means of helping inmates fulfill their legitimate financial obligations. Since its full implementation in 1987, through February, 1994, the IFRP has resulted in the collection of approximately $81,000,000.00 toward payment of inmate fines, debts, and restitution to victims. The Bureau notes that the IFRP, by assisting in the collection of fines and legal debts, helps to accomplish not only a major priority for the Department of Justice, but has also been upheld as serving the valid penological objective of rehabilitation by facilitating repayment of debts. See Johnpoll v. Thornburgh , 898 F.2d 849 (2d Cir., 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 819; James v. Quinlan , 866 F.2d 627, 630 (3rd Cir., 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 870). By limiting the telephone privileges of inmates who refuse to participate in the IFRP, the Bureau is providing an additional incentive for inmates to pay their debts to society and is managing telephone privileges in a manner consistent with other privileges conditioned upon voluntary participation in the IFRP.
