Documents obtained by THE GUARDIAN show elaborate procedures are being put in place to guard the confidentiality of papers on foreign policy and police co-operation -- subjects which the Maastricht Treaty brought for the first time within the ambit of the European Union [EU]. The proposals amount to a blueprint for an EU official secrets act. They include all the paraphernalia of counter-espionage, such as codes for the electronic transmission of sensitive information, perforation numbers to personalise each copy of written material, and a classification hierarchy to distinguish between top secret, secret, confidential, or merely restricted. The changes relate to work done by the secretariat of the council of ministers, where the collective decisions of national governments are prepared and executed. Niels Ersboll, its secretary-general, has told representatives of his 2,200 staff that he expects 370 will need positive vetting. They will be assessed by the security services of their own country. Most will be lawyers and translators. The plan has caused uproar among secretariat personnel who think vetting unnecessary since staff regulations already allow for violations of secrecy to be punished by dismissal and loss of pension rights. Gunther Lorenz, vice president of the staff association, said yesterday that his members particularly objected to the lack of opportunity for an appeal against a negative security report which might blight an official's career. Staff considered themselves to be members of a European civil service which proudly resisted national interference. Now they might be refused clearance because of behaviour in their home countries during their youth. Staff wanted minimum guarantees, including an appeals procedure. They might be balloted on a strike. "We feel we are not strong enough to stop the vetting completely, but we want some minimum guarantees," Mr Lorenz said. "If a member state's security service writes a negative report, it must give reasons against which the official can appeal. "If we do not obtain satisfaction, we will be obliged to convene a general meeting and, if necessary, call a general strike." Senior officials believe a full strike is unlikely, but they are aware of the danger of a work to rule. In previous disputes staff have come close to immobilising the council of ministers by refusing to work in any language other than their mother tongue. In the face of this threat, diplomats from the member states have made a few concessions, but it is understood they are being resisted by hardliners on the K4 committee of senior representatives from the Home Office and EU interior ministries. The fourth draft of the plan will be discussed today in Brussels. Before the Maastricht treaty came into force co-operation between member states was handled outside the Community framework. Alex Falconer, Labour MEP for Mid-Scotland and Fife, who led the parliament's successful campaign to quash previous attempts to introduce a Community official secrecy regime, said the council of ministers was trying to bypass democratic control. Diplomats are aware that the issue could have serious repercussions in Sweden, Norway and Finland, whose governments are negotiating membership of the EU. The proposals are likely to meet opposition in the European Parliament.
