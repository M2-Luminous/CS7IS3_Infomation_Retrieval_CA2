The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118, a margin of 12, after 17 defectors from the seven-party coalition undermined the coalition's unity. The package of four bills was designed to completely overhaul the mechanism for electing the powerful House of Representatives, the lower house of Japan's two-chamber Diet, by introducing a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat districts and proportional representation. The package is also designed to unify fundraising channels to direct all funds into the coffers of political parties, which would then distribute corporate donations among individual politicians. Hosokawa, who rose to power after voters stripped the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of its 38-year lock on power last July, has repeatedly said he would place priority on passage of the package and vowed to "take responsibility" if it failed -- a euphemism for resigning or disolving the lower house for a snap general election. However, Hosokawa told a news conference after the voting that he "is not thinking" of stepping down as premier or dissolving the lower house for the election. "In the 10 days remaining before the end of the current Diet session I will do my utmost to push the political reform package through the Diet," the premier said. He said he would do his best to hammer out a compromise package by arranging for the Diet to set up a 20-legislator consultative body, comprising 10 legislators from each chamber. Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition LDP [Liberal Democratic Party], told a separate new conference, however, "The vote margin is serious enough to forestall thinking by the coalition of further moves they might take." Kono pressed Hosokawa to live up to his repeated pledges to resign, saying, "It is extremely serious that the coalition could not secure passage even after it substantially extended the Diet session. He should consider these things." Kono also suggested that he would consider a suprapartisan proposal to legislate an alternative bill to impose tough penalties on legislators who take bribes. On August 10, Hosokawa told his first news conference after taking power that he would assume responsibility for failure of the package to clear the Diet by the end of the current Diet session, then tentatively set to end December 15. After the package failed to clear the Diet by the provisional deadline, Hosokawa extended the session by 45 days until January 29 and resumed his bid to push the package through the Diet. The premier ruled out seeking to separately legislate the bill that would place stricter curbs on acceptance by politicians of shady political contributions. Hosokawa said he wants to reconcile differences with the LDP through a summit with Kono. He said his readiness to accept the LDP-proposed revision of the package grew following the failure to pass it, saying, "As the result of the developments in the Diet, there is greater room for a compromise with the LDP." Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Diet Affairs Committee, told reporters the SDP leadership would be pressed by coalition partners to account for the breakdown of the package. SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of SDP executives Thursday he would "take responsibility" as chairman of the party if the rebellion by some SDP legislators scuttled the package in Friday's vote. A total of 17 legislators of the SDP, the biggest force in the seven-party coalition, voted against the package while two SDP legislators refrained from attending the voting session. The dissenting SDP members have long criticized the package for carrying the possibility of undermining the parliamentary strength of the SDP, saying that the proposed 274 single-seat electoral districts would be disadvantageous to SDP legislators. They have also chided the coalition for refusing to plug what they called "loopholes" in the package's anti-graft provisions designed to bar legislators from accepting bribes or buying votes. Yasuo Nishino, one of the 17 SDP rebels, told reporters, "The Diet should place priority on legislating provisions to prevent bribe-taking." The SDP dissidents outnumbered five LDP dissidents who crossed party lines to vote for the bills. Meanwhile, Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower chamber's Steering Committee, said the lower chamber will convene its plenary session on January 25 to vote on a motion to ask the upper chamber to agree to establish the 20-member two-chamber consultative body. If the two-chamber consultative body fails to work out a compromise bill, Hosokawa has the choice of disbanding his cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber for the election.
