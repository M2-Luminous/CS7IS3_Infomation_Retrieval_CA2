FR941222-0-00127 FR941222-0-00019 •Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.023=0.063). •The result is the payback rate. Step 2: Compare the calculated payback rate (0.063) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less than the maximum rate, the borrower's payback rate is 0.063. Step 3: Calculate the annual repayment amount by multiplying the borrower's AGI by the payback rate: ($25,000×0.063=$1,575). Step 4: Calculate the monthly repayment amount by dividing the annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($1,575 12=$131.25). Step 5: Calculate the borrower's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of one): ($25,000^$7,360=$17,640). Step 6: Multiply the borrower's discretionary income ($17,640) by 20 percent: ($17,640×.2=3,528). Step 7: Divide the amount calculated in Step 6 by 12 months: ($3,528 12=$294). Step 8: Compare the amount calculated in Step 4 ($131.25) with the amount calculated in Step 7 ($294). The lower amount is the formula amount. The formula amount is $131.25. The borrower's monthly payment under the formula amount would be $131.25. Step 9: Compare the monthly formula amount ($131.25) to the $15 floor repayment amount. Because the formula amount is greater than the $15 floor, the borrower's monthly formula amount is $131.25. Step 10: Compare the formula amount calculated in Step 9 ($131.25) to the capped amount, which is the monthly amount the borrower would repay under a 12-year standard amortization schedule. If the interest rate is seven percent, the 12-year standard amortization amount is approximately $10.28 for every $1,000 of debt. In this example, since the borrower has $12,500 in debt, the capped amount is approximately $128.50 ($10.28×12.5). Because the formula amount ($131.25) exceeds the capped amount ($128.50), the capped amount is the minimum monthly repayment. The borrower has the option of paying the formula amount (or any higher amount). Example 2. Married borrowers both repaying under the ICR plan with a combined Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of $30,000. The husband has $5,000 of Direct Loans. The wife has $15,000 of Direct Loans. The couple has two children. Step 1: Calculate the husband's payback rate. Because his debt is greater than $1,000, the payback rate is calculated on the basis of the formula in §685.209(b)(2)(iii) as follows: •Subtract $1,000 from the amount of the husband's loans: ($5,000^$1,000=$4,000). •Multiply the result by 0.000002: ($4,000×0.000002=0.008). •Add the result to 0.04: (0.04+0.008=0.048). •The result is the husband's payback rate. Step 2: Compare the husband's calculated payback rate (0.048) to the maximum payback rate (0.15). Because the calculated rate is less than the maximum rate, the husband's payback rate is 0.048. Step 3: Calculate the husband's assumed AGI by multiplying the couple's total AGI ($30,000) by the amount of the husband's loans ($5,000), divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($30,000×$5,000 $20,000=$7,500). Step 4: Calculate the husband's annual repayment amount by multiplying the husband's assumed AGI ($7,500) by his payback rate (0.048): ($7,500×0.048=$360). Step 5: Calculate the husband's monthly repayment amount by dividing his annual repayment amount by 12 months: ($360 12=$30). Step 6: Calculate the couple's discretionary income (AGI minus HHS Poverty Guideline for a family of four): ($30,000^14,800=$15,200). Step 7: Calculate the husband's portion of the couple's discretionary income by multiplying the couple's discretionary income ($15,200) by the amount of the husband's loans ($5,000) divided by the total amount of the couple's debt ($20,000): ($15,200×$5,000 $20,000=$3,800). Step 8: Multiply the husband's discretionary income by 20 percent: ($3,800^.2=$760). Step 9: Divide the amount calculated in Step 8 by 12 months: ($760 12=$63.33).
