To those who believe that the government has not gone far enough down the road to reform and has been too cautious, he replies: "Rarely have 12 months seen as many reforms." After pointing out that the budget deficit "we found when we arrived in office was twice the size reported by the Socialists," he states: "Privatization has made it possible to find the resources needed to fight unemployment and to ensure social progress and jobs." [Jacquemart] Many people say, and not just in the opposition, that the Balladur government has not reformed France to any great extent, especially in fields such as state education, where urgent changes are needed. If the government could be criticized for something, would it not be for being too cautious? [Alphandery] What more do you want? Rarely have 12 months seen as many reforms! In a difficult economic context and without any room for maneuver, we have implemented more reforms in one year (and a year is a short time) than our predecessors managed in five years. Moreover, recent polls have shown that the majority of the French people agree with our actions. We have implemented reforms in every domain: pensions, taxation, justice, decentralization of authority toward the regions, the environment, etc. Where I am concerned, at [Prime Minister] Edouard Balladur's request, I have devised the tax structure for the largest loan ever issued in France, worth 110 billion French francs [Fr]; I have started to modernize taxes on savings; and reformed the status of the Banque de France, the Banque Nationale de Paris [BNP], Rhone-Poulenc, and Elf. [Jacquemart] Let us talk about that. Will not this privatization be used, above all, to plug the gaps in the state budget? [Alphandery] A baseless accusation! We need to both respect the property interests of the state and those of investors. The price set in each case corresponds to a medium-term price. Do not forget that the price of shares rises and falls on the stock market. As a result, we have to keep a margin when we float the shares. Recent experience has shown that we were right not to listen to what many people were saying at the time. I should add that we are subject to a bottom rate set by the privatization committee, whose independence is recognized by everyone and was clearly established by a law I had recently adopted. This is another aspect of privatization in France. Then again, and I am not afraid to repeat it, this privatization has proved a considerable success. [Jacquemart] But you should have used the profits to offset the national debt. [Alphandery] In the last six months we have made Fr76 billion. This money was vitally needed, in particular to shore up economic activity, recapitalize public companies, and therefore, at the end of the day, to fight unemployment. Believe me, I would have preferred to have used the money generated from this privatization to offset the national debt, but we scarcely had any choice -- necessity knows no limits! The budget deficit that we found when we arrived in office was twice the size reported by the Socialists a few months earlier. In any case, I would like to point out the coherence that exists between the government's financial and social policies. Privatizations make it possible to find the resources needed to fight unemployment and to ensure social progress and jobs. Developing Popular Partnerships [Jacquemart] You are therefore privatizing through necessity rather than conviction. We have come a long way since the motivations of [the last right-wing government in] 1986! [Alphandery] Not at all! We have not lost sight of the essential reasons that encourage privatization. It is precisely because the French people know full well that the switch to the private sector is good for companies and therefore good for the economy, and that privatization is no longer a subject of ideological controversy. Privatized companies now have more elbow room, in particular to face up to their financing requirements. Privatization is expanding the Paris stock market. Above all, it gives us the opportunity to make the French people the owners of our major companies by broadening the public shareholding and employee participation. Finally, let me add that I agreed that the state should assume its responsibility as a shareholder, both for Bull and Credit Lyonnais, solely with a view to their privatization. [Jacquemart] Of all the reforms implemented by the Balladur government, which, in your opinion, was the most decisive? [Alphandery] The Giraud law, even if it is the current trend to criticize it. After all, it tackles the unemployment problem at its roots. Why does France have a higher rate of unemployment than its partners? Because there is not enough flexibility in the job market; because the labor costs, especially for unqualified labor, are too high; and because there is insufficient vocational training for young people and French companies have taken too little interest in this aspect, unlike German companies. What we have been doing in the last 12 months has been aimed at solving these problems. That is the direction taken by the Giraud law. It introduced more flexibility by annualizing working time and introducing services checks [to create more services jobs]; it reduced labor costs for low-paid jobs by including family policy in the budget -- an idea that I have pushed for for a long time -- and it aims to get companies more involved in youth training schemes. [Jacquemart] People were expecting a government for jobs. We are still awaiting the results. When will the trends begin to be reversed? [Alphandery] Of course, that is the crucial question. But let us tackle one hurdle at a time! First we have to restart the economy. When I announced last autumn, in a period of general gloom, that activity should take off again at the start of 1994 and that we would achieve growth of 1.4 percent this year, my forecast gave rise, at the very least, to a degree of skepticism. Today, this figure is being confirmed. I could even be accused of having been too pessimistic! Of course, growth of 1.4 percent is nothing to write home about. However, we should remember that we have only been in office for 12 months. One year is long enough for our inheritance to be forgotten and too short to harvest tangible results. We need time before an economic policy can make its effects felt, especially where unemployment is concerned. Thanks to the combined measures of supporting the economy and the structural provisions of the five-year law on employment, it is reasonable to anticipate that we will see a reversal of the trend toward the end of the year. Thus, the national accounts show that France will again see real job creation starting next summer. That is an optimistic note for the currently difficult social climate. Moreover, France has perhaps gone too far in improving productivity in services. Look at the countries that are standing up best to unemployment, Japan and the United States. You can see that they have retained many service jobs in shops, car parks, and public transport. The government is thinking about how best to create more jobs in these sectors. [Jacquemart] What are you most proud of? [Alphandery] In a country where unemployment is rife, that is not the question that concerns me the most. However, I am pleased that I have been able to design a financial policy that aims to mobilize short-term savings for the sake of economic recovery. Can this money be plowed into the manufacturing sector -- where the jobs are created -- and be used to kindle the economy? That question has given rise to various measures whose overall coherence has not always been appreciated: Monetary policy that aims at obtaining a durable fall in short-term rates faster than the fall in long-term rates; the tax instrument of the Balladur loan, which I wanted to accelerate the consolidation of savings; a reform of savings tax to redirect short-term savings toward long-term investments; and the ambitious program of privatization which we have already mentioned: All those measures are intended to spark growth and curb rising unemployment. [Jacquemart] What has been the greatest failure in your domain? [Alphandery] In a way, our greatest failure is not having been able to find the right words to dialogue with young people. Unfortunately, the same holds true for all governments in all countries, irrespective of their political leanings. How can you convince them that the CIP [youth job training contract] is first and foremost their passport to their first job in the company and that, in that way, it is the key to social integration?
