The Thai Commercial Counsellor in Washington, Nupthong Thongyai, said the US International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) recently submitted a request to the USTR that Thailand be kept on the list until the Copyright Law is amended. The IIPA also suggested placing China on the list of Priority Foreign Countries (PFC) which may face trade retaliation from the US because they do not have sufficient protection for US copyright works. It said copyright violations in China were hurting US manufacturers. China is on the PWL after being removed from the PFC list in 1991. The US will announce this April whether it will remove Thailand from the PWL, but such a move is not expected until the draft amendment of the Copyright Law passes its third reading in Parliament. A source in the Thai music industry said China was copying foreign compact discs. Some of the copies were being shipped to Thailand for sale locally and resale aboard. Mr. Nupthong said the US still wanted Thailand to lower its tariffs on exposed film from the current rate of 10 baht per metre to five baht, but the case was not serious as the countries had agreed they should negotiate on this issue under General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks.
