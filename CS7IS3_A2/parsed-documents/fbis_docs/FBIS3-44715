This measure states that people from elsewhere in the Mainland with RMB [renminbi] 1 million worth of investment in the municipality and have had their items or businesses operating for more than two years may also apply for such residential status. Other qualified applicants include overseas people who have bought a housing unit specially for overseas buyers measuring over 100 sq. metres and Mainland personnel hired by a particular Shanghai entity for at least three years. The regulation stipulates that people with this special residential status have to renew it annually with the municipal public security department. Following such renewals after certain years, the provisional residential status may be changed to permanent residential status. People with such residential status can have their spouse and children apply for the same status provided that they meet the requirements. They will enjoy the same treatment in their daily living as all other Shanghai residents including being able to send their children to a child care centre and receive a general education, applying for a business licence and the installation of gas and telephone.
