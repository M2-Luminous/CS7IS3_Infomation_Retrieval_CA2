Arkhipov, by A. Bayduzhiy, under the rubric "Problem": "Russia Has Become a Mecca for Illegal Migrants: According to Yuriy Arkhipov, Head of the Foreign Migration Administration of the Federal Migration Service, This Benefits the West"] [Text] [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] One of the tokens of recent times has been the mounting flow into Russia of citizens of states that only recently were called Third World countries. How many refugees from the far abroad are there on Russian territory? [Arkhipov] Here we need to clarify concepts. From the legal point of view, it is not refugees coming to Russia but people wishing to claim refugee status. They can become refugees only after the appropriate procedure, which assumes submitting a petition to the migration services, lodging of the petitioner at a temporary housing center, and verifying the data given in the claimant's declaration. Only after this can the individual be recognized a refugee and be issued a refugee certificate for Russian territory. Foreigners who have not gone through all these steps are not considered refugees and are on the country's territory illegally. According to data from the health care organs, such immigrants from the far abroad here number more than half a million, and their number continues to grow. Every day up to a hundred new illegal migrants arrive in Russia. As for official refugees, here the situation is somewhat confused. Before Russia joined the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees in 1992, there were a significant number of foreigners on Russian territory who flooded in uncontrollably due to the openness of our borders with certain new states of the Trans-Caucasus and Central Asian regions. At the same time, the office of the Administration of the UN High Commissioner for Refugee Affairs (UVKB OON), which without the consent of the Russian organs of power began to undertake the massive reception of immigrants from the far abroad, issuing its own certification as "requiring asylum in the Russian Federation," began operations in Moscow. Most of the migrants had counted on the assistance of the UVKB OON primarily to move to the developed countries of Western Europe and Scandinavia. There are about 50,000 such UVKB-registered individuals in Russia. Since our country joined the convention, all of them, according to this organization's office, must be recognized almost automatically as refugees on Russian territory. Naturally, we cannot agree to this. Right now the Federal Migration Service is carrying out a reregistration of those registered by UVKB representatives, and in the process many violations have been uncovered: some of the migrants have two certificates; others' documents have changed hands more than once; and certificates have been issued without dates or numbers and without individual files being opened on them. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Which means, if you don't count the individuals registered by the UVKB, there are officially still no refugees from the far abroad in Russia? [Arkhipov] Absolutely correct. The Russian law "On Refugees" provides that an individual who has arrived on our territory must immediately declare himself as seeking asylum in Russia. We have many migrants who entered the country three or four years ago and have been living on Russian territory in the hopes of leaving by any means possible for other countries and who are involved in semi-legal business operations. They make themselves known only when they have dealings with the lawkeeping organs, or if they are unsuccessful in getting to the West. So in what capacity can we consider them? As people seeking asylum, refugees, or, more likely, as illegal migrants? However, the Western states and the UVKB OON ignore the nonstandard situation in Russia, believing that we are intentionally dragging our heels about giving these individuals refugee status. Here it should be noted that as soon as Russia joined the convention, literally a week later, seven Western states tightened up their visa procedures. That is, they made our country virtually the last. The West profits if this great mass of refugees from the Third World stays in Russia, which protects the West from their penetration. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] So joining the convention was a mistake on Russia's part? [Arkhipov] When it was being signed, we were evidently counting on the West beginning to assist the Russian-speaking population that had started to arrive on Russian territory in massive proportions. However, these hopes were not vindicated. According to the Western states, the Russian-speaking citizens arriving here were not refugees, unlike the Somalian, Kurdish, and African migrants, for example. That is, in joining the convention, we did not take into account the political, economic, social, or moral-psychological consequences of this step. According to our assessments, the cost of maintaining a single family of migrants from the far abroad from the moment they cross the border until the decision is made on whether or not to present them with refugee status (according to the law, this should take three months) comes to more than 3 million rubles. Naturally, that kind of money is nowhere to be found. Our country's doctors have proved unfamiliar with many of the diseases from which the African and Asiatic refugees suffer, and it is difficult to control them. For instance, as a result of tests on migrants registered by the UVKB, several people infected with the AIDS virus were discovered who later disappeared and whom we have never been able to locate. One more miscalculation turned out to be the fact that Russia has become nearly the sole state in the world to join the convention on refugee status and its protocol in full. The United States joined only the protocol; other states signed the convention after setting many qualifications, thanks to which they can refuse to implement some of its conditions. Moreover, Russia has gone even further. The law "On Refugees" passed in Russia is broader than the convention, which has evoked surprise even among international experts. Much more developed countries would not have permitted themselves this. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But at one time passage of the Russia law "On Refugees" was offered up to us as a major accomplishment in the sphere of guaranteeing human rights. Now it is judged differently? [Arkhipov] By the law's appearance, yes; but by its content, not entirely. The law proved more declaratory than really effective. A certain hastiness in its passage in the existing edition led to many legal gaps and disparities. It lacks any reference whatsoever to a mechanism for offering refugee status. It turns out that in order to obtain the latter, a foreigner only has to submit a statement. Imagine the cost of the standard implied by the law providing for offering refugees housing "from a special housing fund designated for refugees," which no one had created at the time the law came out! And so forth. Right now we have prepared, based on the experience we have, and sent out for approval, amendments to the law "On Refugees" and forced resettlers. The excessively expansive--in comparison with the convention--interpretation of refugee status has been deleted, a procedure for offering that status has been introduced, and not only the rights of refugees but also the rights of the state with respect to them have been set forth more precisely. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Does Russia have centers for work with refugees from the far abroad? [Arkhipov] Not yet. So far we have not managed to create them, not only for economic reasons but also due to the sharply negative attitude of local authorities and the population. Right now preparations are being completed for opening the first such center in Perm Oblast, and altogether there are plans for up to 10-12 regional centers for temporary lodging. This is a half-closed institution, where foreigners will be located to ensure their safety under guard. We cannot allow huge masses of people who do not know the languages or rules of the country and who, it has to be admitted, treat our laws with extreme negligence to resettle at will across Russia. But here another problem arises. The majority of the migrants from the far abroad are concentrated in Moscow and under no circumstances do they wish to leave it. Recently we suggested that a group of Kurds resettle in Tver, and en route half of them ran away. Are these refugees? If the police have to be sent to catch someone, then this is not a refugee but an illegal migrant, and adequate measures must be taken, up to and including deportation. [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] For some reason I haven't heard anything about even a single case of such deportation or expulsion. [Arkhipov] For this you have to ask the passport and visa service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is supposed to deal with the deportation of citizens found illegally on Russian territory. Although, as far as I know, in 1993, there were a few instances of citizens of China and Vietnam being expelled from Russia. In general, the deportation process right now in many ways makes no sense: you can spend millions of rubles on the expulsion of foreign citizens, but tomorrow, given our open borders, they will turn up in Moscow again. Deportations are not going to solve the problem of illegal migration. We must come to an agreement as quickly as possible with the states of the former USSR, either on establishing strict visa control along the perimeter of the CIS, or else on stopping the transit of migrants to Russia through those countries. And naturally, Russian passports must be introduced.
