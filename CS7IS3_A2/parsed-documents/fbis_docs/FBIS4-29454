This will be the first Japan-ROK summit talks since President Kim's visit to Japan last March. However, it will be the first such talks held in the ROK since the last talks were held in Kyongju between former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Kim Yong-sam last November. Cheju Island has been designated as the site for talks because diplomatic authorities from the two countries expect that in promoting Japan-ROK summit diplomacy, it will be desirable to follow the Western style -- holding frequent meetings in an informal atmosphere. The last talks held in Japan were between [former Prime Minister] Kiichi Miyazawa and [former ROK President) No Tae-u in Kyoto, in November 1992. The upcoming summit talks will be held over the weekend. With the Naples summit scheduled for 8 July, Japan intends to exchange views with the ROK on such issues as the North Korean nuclear program and the Korean peninsula situation.
