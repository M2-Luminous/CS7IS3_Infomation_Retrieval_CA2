FBIS4-3899 "drchi080_w_94004" FBIS-CHI-94-080 Daily Report 26 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Reporters Support Xi, Demand Clarifications Reporters Support Xi, Demand Clarifications HK2304090794 HK2304090794 BFN [Editorial Report] Hong Kong MING PAO in Chinese on 23 April publishes on page A6, below the fold, a half-page 1,000-character "statement" signed by 118 China affairs reporters from 23 news organizations in Hong Kong, on the case of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, who has been convicted and jailed in Beijing for allegedly stealing state secrets. Entitled "Statement on the Xi Yang Case by Hong Kong Reporters Covering China Affairs," this item is also published, in Chinese, in the 23 April edition of the English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST. The POST version takes up the lower left quarter of page 22, in the paper's sports section. Both the MING PAO and POST versions are enclosed within a heavy black border, with the headline in large, bold characters. The statement does not appear in the 23 April editions of any of the other Hong Kong papers on regular coverage at Hong Kong bureau: HONGKONG STANDARD, EASTERN EXPRESS, HSIN PAO, and LIEN HO PAO, nor in the PRC-affiliated TA KUNG PAO and WEN WEI PO. Neither was the statement mentioned in the 0500 GMT "News at One" cast for 23 April on Radio-Television Hong Kong (RTHK). The full text of the statement reads as follows: "We are a group of Hong Kong reporters who constantly visit mainland China to cover China affairs. Here we express our indignation and resentment against the case of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, who has been charged with 'stealing state banking secrets,' and found guilty without an open, fair trial, and has been sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for two years. "Despite the fact that Chinese officials and official media have time and again stressed that Xi Yang's case was an individual one, and that it has nothing to do with press freedom, nevertheless, we Hong Kong reporters, who constantly visit Mainland China, found the case to be shocking and worrying. In fact, the behavior of Xi Yang, which which the Chinese authorities brought charges, was very familiar to us as our work style in our routine coverage of Chinese affairs. Should Xi Yang be found guilty, then we will face the same crisis, and Xi Yang will be neither the first nor the last reporter to be apprehended. "Since the PRC implemented reform and opening up, Hong Kong news workers -- including Xi Yang -- have played an important and promotional role in China's economic growth. We hope the Chinese Government will adopt an open and practical attitude and that it will respect Hong Kong reporters' coverage methods and their right to report news according to the usual practices of world news coverage. "We believe that Xi Yang's case has revealed two important issues: First, the Chinese authorities' definition of `state secret' is vague; second, according to the document, `On Matters of Attention for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for News Coverage,' our news coverage activities in mainland China can almost invariably be charged as `illegal.' "The Chinese definition of `state secret' is very arbitrary and vague, and even some basic materials are listed as classified documents, which results in very great difficulties for reporters' news coverage. Furthermore, they can be charged on the grounds of `prying into' and `stealing' state secrets. This being the case, we strongly require the Chinese authorities to explicitly publish the definition of the category of `state secrets,' while reviewing and revising it according to customary international practice. "In addition, Hong Kong reporters going to mainland China for news coverage are liable to violate the `Matters of Attention for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for News Coverage' because these rules and regulations stipulate that an application must be filed before going to mainland China for the purpose of news coverage, and furthermore, that no news coverage activities beyond those specified in the application are allowed. Practice over the past four and half years has demonstrated that these regulations are impractical. We require the Chinese authorities to remove promptly these restrictions on news coverage. "To express our strong resentment against the handling of Xi Yang's case, and to urge the Chinese authorities to face our anxieties and requirements squarely, as of today and until 31 May 1994, we have decided to boycott all news coverage activities in the north which are funded by the Chinese authorities by invitation as being of propaganda and tourist values. At the same time, we appeal for support from our employers. "On the other hand, we urge the Hong Kong and British Governments to actively follow up Xi Yang's case through diplomatic channels, while requiring the Chinese Government to clarify the definition of `state secrets' and to lift the restrictions placed on news coverage by the requirement to submit applications beforehand. "We require our media employers to make a commitment that they must bear legal, moral, and economic responsibilities should their employees be held in custody or detention while conducting news coverage in mainland China. We hope that the Hong Kong Press Guild, the Hong Kong Association for News Administrative Workers, and the Hong Kong Reporters' Association will support us in setting out these requirements to the Chinese authorities."
