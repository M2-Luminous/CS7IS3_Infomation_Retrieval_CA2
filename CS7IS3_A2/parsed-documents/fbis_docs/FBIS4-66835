They know the causes and motives for the theft and explosion of bombs, and the murder of innocents. Perhaps this was the reason the shocking confessions of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi in front of television cameras aroused such wide-ranging reactions among all sectors of the people of all walks of life. Despite the fact that these confessions have thrown back the curtain to expose the secrets of the terrorist organizations, they left question marks in the minds of many--and exclamation points, too! To discuss these confessions, and exactly what they mean, and the extent to which they will help to fight terrorism, we met with a large group of intellectuals, thinkers, religious scholars, and sociologists, to hear their reactions and draw results and lessons from them. To start with, former Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil says that "the confessions of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi played a major role in enlightening the people, especially the youth, as to what is going on in the terrorist groups. There are a number of points that caught my attention in these confessions, such as the fact that they derive their thought from books, despite the different circumstances in which they were written, as is happening in Egypt now. There are some who believe that the circulation of these books should not be tolerated, that they should be confiscated, but my view is different. Books should be produced to respond to these, and in an accurate and detailed way, so that there may be a discussion of every line and every paragraph in these books, because they have become the major germ of terrorism. "We must also review the teaching methods in use, and a way of instruction that better suits our programs. "We must take into consideration, regarding these groups, the fact that while in Algeria they have known political targets, they are different here. These groups have no clear target, and are divided up into small groups, each of which has as its goal the gathering of the largest number in order to get more funds from abroad. This explains their conflict over leadership, because leadership is the source of profit. This requires us to have a genuine position, because these funds come from abroad in the form of alms and contributions from some fraternal Arab countries. This is brazen interference in Egypt's internal affairs and we must not allow it. We must take strong measures against it, and monitor the movement of these funds in the banks, and the persons. When a Saudi Arabian person provides these funds, he should be accused and charged, and a verdict must be handed down in absentia, with no niceties, and no threat to Egypt's security in the name of spreading the Islamic faith. As to this talk of unemployment as a cause of terrorism, these confessions made it clear that it is false. It revealed that those youths found a way to easy money and marriage and easily achieved legal opinions, such as those certifying the offficial permissibility [of almost any act]. This penitent, 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, was not unemployed, and his colleagues were not unemployed. The link between unemployment with terrorism is an attempt on the part of those who sympathize with these groups to find an excuse for them. But there is no excuse for them, because they are acting to destabilize the government in Egypt and to weaken it at home and abroad." Bats and Phantoms! Prominent writer Tharwat Abazah says, "First of all, the Egyptian media have dealt with this talk, and shown it. The content of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions had been much discussed among citizens, but without confirmation like marriage, without documentation and legitimization and so on. Today, however, it has been confirmed by one of their own, indeed by one of their leaders. What pains me, however, is that some opposition newspapers are attacking this dialogue because he told the truth, and they have been against the truth for their whole history. Instead of apologizing for what they have perpetrated against our people, they attack the man. I consider them to be beyond the pale of the Islamic religion. God will judge them. I believe that the government can confront them only with arms. As to the dialogue and discussion, it is meaningless. We will not engage in dialogue with bats and phantoms. Is there anyone who says: `I am a terrorist and I want dialogue?' Discussion here is a laughable word. What we have heard from 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi needs no discussion--it needs a clash, it needs to be confronted with arms and no other means." Possible and Permissible Liberal Party chief Mustafa Kamil Murad believes that the broadcast of the confessions of repentant terrorists--or even of convicted nonrepentant terrorists--was absolutely essential. "It helps, in the first place, to reveal the secrets of their terror networks; second, to help them present their violent, extremist ideas; third, and most importantly, to mobilize public opinion against terrorism, which targets the security of the nation and the safety of its citizens." He reaffirms the importance of dialogue with those terrorists by all possible means and all available methods. He emphasizes the necessity of presenting these dialogues to psychiatrists for analysis. In this way, leads could be found that would be of use in confronting this dangerous phenomenon. He believes that discussing the terrorists' ideas and getting to know their tendencies are more important than trying to locate the sources of the extremist books the terror groups use in formulating their own laws--no matter whether these books are printed secretly in Egypt or smuggled in from abroad. "The problem must be attacked at its roots. The confrontation here must be through dialogue, and dialogue alone." The Nature of Our Conditions Labor Party leader Engineer Ibrahim Shukri refused to comment on the confessions of repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, saying that he had not seen them, and so could make no judgment on how true the confessions were. He believes that the terror phenomenon in general reflects "the nature of the conditions we live in, politically, economically, and socially. It is not easy for us to deal with the confessions, based on some statements printed here and confessions broadcast there." He says that a dialogue is needed with these groups to discuss the various views and present all points of view so that we can find a genuine way out of the problem, and a decisive solution to this dreadful phenomenon. Just Rumors Yasin Siraj-al-Din, a Wafd Party leader in Cairo, says, "If we believe 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions, in his capacity as an actual terrorist, then I believe that they were very significant, the more so because they confirm what we have heard about terrorist organizations--we used to imagine that they were just exaggerated rumors!" He thinks that the media's initiative in spreading this kind of awareness is indeed an intelligent one, "especially because it comes in the form of the confessions of one of the penitents who lived among the terrorists for 17 years. We as men of law have this to say: a confession is the best possible evidence." He added that "these confessions are the best means of spreading awareness among all sectors of youth, especially those who have joined the ranks of violence and terrorism, or those who are thinking of joining. Repeating this process with other, similar persons will create for us a virtual bulwark against violence and extremism for all our citizens, no matter what their background." Willing Tools Assistant Secretary-General of the NPUG [National Prrogressive Unionist Grouping] Party Rif'at al-Sa'id says, "Apart from the practical value of 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi's confessions, and their extensive and decisive effect of broad masses of the Egyptian people who listened to them on television--the main information medium reaching the broad masses of Egypt--they reveal to us two primary truths. How often have we voiced them! Many people turned away when we voiced them: - "The first truth is that terrorism begins as an idea. This man, according to his own words, never wielded a gun, but he made others wield them, and convinced them and taught them to do that, and told them that it was a legitimate thing to do. They became willing tools in his hands. Thus we discover that the real terrorist, committing the greater crime, is the one who issues the religious edict. The man courageously acknowledges that. Based on this we may reaffirm that we must fight these misleading, so-called Islamic ideas, which are opposed to the truth of Islam, in the cradle; that is, in the sphere of ideas, where they are born. This could mean in the mosque, in the education process, or in the media. This is the first truth 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi taught us. - "The second truth is that there is no moderation and no extremism in the trend of political Islam, as long as it is born as an idea. Those who repeat extremist ideas and all the preachers of so-called political Islam, become by necessity partners in terror. 'Adil 'Abdal-Baqi has offered us proof not only in the relation between ideas and terrorism, but also in the field of funding. A lawyer, one of the most famous preachers of political defeatism, explained that he was offered a quarter of a million pounds. One of the owners of an economic Islamization company funds the terrorists directly. Then they come to us saying they are against violence. How can we believe them? That is the question." Step By Step Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim, professor of Sociopolitics at the American University, believes that "the confessions are a new model in uncovering the secrets and dynamics of the extremist movements' recruitment of adolescents, and their exploitation of the adolescents' piety, winning them over step by step to join the extremist groups. The new thing that the repentant terrorist revealed to us is the organized operations to isolate the victims of this recruitment from the mainstream of normal social life by creating a rift between them and society. In this way they hear no alternative thinking, nothing dfferent from what they are being taught. "I might add to that the gradual intensification in the doses of thought to turn them away from the government and society. Estranging them from society makes it easier for the extremist organizations to create a rift even between the recruited victim and the people closest to him--his family and his friends. It ends with the recruited victim become wholly dependent on the organization to fill all his psychological, social, and economic needs. By magnifying this dependency, the recruited victim becomes more blindly obedient to the orders he gets, including orders to rob, sabotage, destroy, and murder. "As he commits any of these crimes, he becomes more dependent; his personal security is strongly linked to the organization's satisfaction with him, and he enters the vicious circle. He is more obedient to their orders; with this obedience of his, the orders implicate him even more; with his deeper involvement, he becomes their prisoner. It is they who hide him and protect him. Amid all this the recruited victim's own mind is totally cancelled out; he becomes a sort of robot. "In short, what the repentant terrorist 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi has revealed to us is a physiological Iranian autopsy of a journey that began with innocent piety and ended with atrocious crimes. It is very important to know all the episodes, steps, and details of this journey, for preventing and treating them. This is turn must rest on the vital importance of youth being able to join the mainstream of public life. If the young want to talk politics, let them do it. If they want to talk about religion, let them. If they want to get involved in politics, religion, or athletics, let them. And in every field in which the young get involved, let us ensure and insist that there be total pluralism, and plenty of room of argument and debate. "This means that the government should stop fearing pluralism in the broad sense of the word. All the extremist groups need in order to recruit these innocents, is that there be no alternatives, active or intellectual, for them to express their legitimate needs. "Egyptian emotions and minds must be reopened; the minds, so that they can engage in issues of the present and future, and the emotions so that they may become more compassionate and sympathetic. "The official totalitarian thinking that societies use paves the way for another totalitarian idea, opposed to state policies. There are many examples of this, chiefly what has happened in the former Soviet Union and in Yugoslavia. They went from being fierce communists to being even fiercer fascists, from leftist totalitarianism to racist and fascist totalitarianism." Useful and Significant Professor of Sociology, Dr. Hasan al-Sa'ati, adds that the confessions of the repentant terrorist are useful and significant, and that we should emphasize such dialogues in order to help correct the mistaken ideas of youth, with which these groups tempt them. Dr. Hasan Sa'ati believes it is necessary to take advantage of the terrorist's remarks--especially his saying that it was economic and social problems that moved him and those like him along that road. "The government must work diligently to solve the problems of unemployment and intellectual vacuity among youth with religious awareness and the sound preaching of clerics who have a correct knowledge of religion." Dr. Hasan Sa'ati recommends the confiscation of the books and memoranda the terrorists use; religious scholars should respond to them and refute the glaring errors they contain regarding religion and society. The Return of Debates Dr. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim, president of the Committee on Religious Affairs in the People's Assembly and vice rector of al-Azhar University, says, "What the young penitent says about the absence of preachers is the truth. There is no genuine, realistic, systematic, dialogue with the young. Religious scholars have not sat down and talked with them, especially recently. In the early 1980's, there were serious dialogues in which religious scholars such as Dr. Musa Lashin, Dr. Ahmad Haykal, Dr. al-Ahmadi Abu-al-Nur, and the late Dr. Mrhammad al-Tayyib al-Najjar, took part. These dialogues, initiated by Major General Hasan Abu-Basha, bore fruit--I do not know why these public debates ceased. Why did they turn into public parties to which members of local parties and a large number of attendees, who had no wish for dialogue, were invited? The same well-known, unchanging people spoke." Dr. 'Umar Hashim says that: "there are books containing erroneous ideas, and the publishing of them should stop, and they should be corrected. There are other books, which do not contain errors, but which are interpreted erroneously by the young. The repentant youth read these books with his own understanding; but science should be studied with scholars, not taken from the newspapers. This was the error for which he was responsible. "The lesson to be learned from these confessions is for us to fill the mosques with qualified teachers; a mosque without a qualified teacher would be better off shut down, instead of producing erroneous and destructive thought. Society's Responsibility Prof. Fahmi Huwaydi believes that the youth said, at the outset, that he had not found anything in the school curriculum that satisfied his wish to acquire knowledge; this was the responsibility of the teaching curriculum, which is incapable of arming our children with the minimum of knowledge needed to protect them from erroneous thinking. He also understood from his remarks that the mosques were not carrying out their role in creating awareness among youth. The question is: why has this happened at this time? He added that the youth spoke of the "caravans of consciousness-raising" that imposed their views, and had become a failed bureaucratic exercise. He pointed out that the unemployed youth had got married and was given a house, which confirmed the existence of a social dimension to the problem. The fact that the young man said he was ready to die poses an important question about who is responsible for giving youths a cause for them to defend and for which they would die. Fahmi Huwaydi believes that this statement gives society the greater responsibility of creating a national dream and goal for youth. Society is responsible for many aspects of this problem, such as unemployment, education, and guiding youth, failing to give legitimacy to Islamic action, the deterioration of the school curriculum, and the attacks on al-Azhar as a religious institution, which undermined young people's confidence in its scholars. "We must always read these confessions in the context of societal self-criticism, not cheering the mistakes of these young people or others. We must seek out the true causes of this phenomenon. As to books that contain erroneous thinking, they are a symptom, not the disease itself, otherwise why did this thinking appear at this particular time, when those books have been around for years?" Dialogue With Youth Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin believes that "the repentant terrorist's confessions are proof of our failure, because we have ignored this phenomenon for 17 years. Then this youth comes along and redeems himself with his words. What strikes us is that we did not do enough talking with these young people before they got mixed up in these groups. Perhaps the methods that proved dialogue spurious illustrate their corruption now. How often we thought we were communicating with young people, when we were just fooling ourselves, and abandoning them to those people who would estrange them from the right path." Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin defends the role of the mosques, asserting that "there were always people there who were communicating with the young, but they accused scholars either of blasphemy or of being government clerics. What the repentant youth said about the lack of a clerical role was an incitement, slanderous and false, because the clerics existed, but the young people did not want to see them. As to what the youth said about the books he read, this confirms--says Dr. 'Abd-al-Sabur Shahin--that, "he did not know the contents of truly Islamic books; all he knew were these suspect books. I accuse him and others of not having understood Ibn-Taymiyah's books, and those of media leaders whom he called responsible for lies and ignorance, of having drawn them to where they ended up. This is a mistaken idea--dwarfs do not compete with imams for stature." Extending the Invitation Dr. Ahmad Shalabi, professor of Islamic Civilization, says that the events cited by the repentant terrorist in his confessions have nothing to do with Islam. They only show how far these terrorists have strayed from the right path--especially what he said about iddat [the waiting period prescribed by Islam before a widow or divorcee may remarry], even though there are clear and substantial texts that set it out. Also, in the procedure for declaring certain things to be licit--they set out their own rules for dealing with other people, despite the rules Islam has established to protect property, blood, and honor. Dr. Ahmad Shalabi emphasizes the need to invite these terrorists to return to rationality, and to repent, and to leave the wrong path they were following. "Their destructive ideas should be confronted with the publication of religious books by senior scholars known for their enlightened religious thinking." The Koran and the Sunnah Prominent writer Sa'd-al-Din Wahbah says that "the young man's confessions were not new--information had been leaked from terrorists themselves in the past, about the multiplicity of wives, without the legal iddat period, plus the legitimacy of non-Muslims' money. None of these matters are new. The books he talks about, they too are well-known, and everybody reads them. The error is that they were not discussed on television and the radio and the symposiums of the Ministry of Awqaf. There is actually a lack of discussion of the books of al-Mawdudi, Ibn-Taymiyah, and Sayyid Qutb. "But if this young man found in these books the one course for his Islam, then he must see the error in this, because the original and true sources are the Koran and the Sunnah. The strange thing is that this young man did not say, in his confessions, that he had read the Koran or the traditions of the Prophet. Even when he spoke of the legitimizing process, he mentioned that he had read a book by Shaykh al-Ghazali, despite the fact that the solution to that problem is found in the Koran and the Sunnah. Therefore, he is not innocent of deliberately misleading himself and others. When he was speaking of his return to decency, he said that he had read the story of the prophet leaving the money of the Quraysh [tribe] with 'Ali Ibn-Abi-Talib. This comes up in many books on the sayings of the Prophet, and the Koran--above all--speaks of the custody of trusts." "The useful lessons of these confessions," says Sa'd-al-Din Wahbah, "are that we should let young people interpret the Koran as they choose in schools. We must talk to them. There is also a shortcoming in the role of the media, the mosques, and public debates in resisting this erroneous ideas held by some young people; this young man says that he restored himself to the path of good sense." Not New Prominent broadcaster Amal Fahmi says that what the repentant terrorist said in his confessions was not new. She had heard it before from the families of young men who had broken away from society and left their homes for these groups. What was new, was that one of the actual members of these groups confirmed the extent of error and delusion in the world of these groups. Amal Fahmi adds that dialogue brought up many facts about their groupings, the books they used as references and primary sources for their religious information; so it was up to the Ministry of Awqaf to take control of the smaller mosques and religious establishments [the extremists] control, and motivate the imams and preachers who have a high degree of enlightened Islamic culture so that they can refute the extremists, confiscate the books filled with ruinous and destructive ideas upon which they rely, and stiffen the punishments for the printers that printed them."
