FR940418-2-00012 FR940418-2-00005 As we stated in our preliminary determination, the GOI identified a number of different sectors as having received benefits under Law 675/77. These sectors were: (1) Electronic technology; (2) the mechanical instruments industry; (3) the agro-food industry; (4) the chemical industry; (5) the steel industry; (6) the pulp and paper industry; (7) the fashion sector; (8) the automobile industry; and (9) the aviation sector. Law 675/77 also sought to promote optimal exploitation of energy resources, and ecological and environmental recovery. Despite the fact that Law 675/77 benefits were available to and used by numerous and varied industries, we preliminarily determined Law 675/77 benefits specific within the meaning of section 771(5)(A)(ii) of the Act, and therefore, countervailable because the steel industry was a dominant user pursuant to section 355.43(b)(2)(iii) of the Proposed Regulations. It received 34 percent of the benefits provided under the interest subsidy and capital grant components of the program. The GOI has argued that the steel and automobile industries did not receive a disproportionate share of benefits when the extent of investment in those industries is compared to the extent of investment in other industries. We did not consider the level of investment in the industries receiving benefits under Law 675/77. Instead, we followed the policy explained in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Brazil, 58 FR 37295, 37295 (July 9, 1993), of comparing the share of benefits received by the steel industry to the collective share of benefits provided to other users of the program. Consistent with our determination in Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain Steel Products from Italy (``Certain Steel from Italy''), 58 FR 37327 (July 9, 1993), we found that the steel industry accounted for 34 percent of the benefits and the auto industry accounted for 33 percent of the benefits. Thus, these two industries represented 77 percent of the assistance while the remainder was spread among the other seven industries. On this basis, we determine that the steel industry was a dominant user of programs under Law 675/77 and, therefore, that benefits received by ILVA under this law are being provided to a specific enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries. Therefore, we find Law 675/77 financing to be countervailable to the extent that it is provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations. 1. Grants to Pay Interest on Bank Loans Italian commercial banks provided long-term loans at market interest rates to industries designated under Law 675/77. The interest owed by the recipient companies on these loans was offset by contributions from the GOI. Terni received bank loans with Law 675/77 interest contributions which were outstanding in the POI. To determine whether this assistance conferred a benefit, we compared the effective interest rate paid on these loans to the benchmark interest rate, described above. Based on this comparison, we determine that the financing provided under this program is inconsistent with commercial considerations, i.e., on terms more favorable than the benchmark financing. Because Terni knew that it would receive the interest contributions when it obtained the loans, we consider the contributions to constitute reductions in the interest rates charged rather than grants (see Certain Steel from Italy at 37331). Therefore, to calculate the benefit, we used our standard long-term loan methodology as described in ยง355.49(c)(1) of the Proposed Regulations. We divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 0.03 percent ad valorem for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise. 2. Mortgage Loans from the Ministry of Industry Under Law 675/77, companies could obtain long-term low-interest mortgage loans from the Ministry of Industry. Terni received several loans which were still outstanding in the POI. To determine whether these loans were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations, we used the benchmark interest rates described above. Because the interest rates paid on the Law 675/77 loans were below the benchmark interest rates, we determine that loans provided under this program are countervailable.
