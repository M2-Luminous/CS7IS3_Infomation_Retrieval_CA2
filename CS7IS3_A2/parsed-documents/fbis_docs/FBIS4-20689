Ltd., 8-3 Kiba 2-chome, Koto-ku, Tokyo 135, Japan] [Text] Preface In urban districts, the existing municipal water supply and effluent facilities are almost saturated as the result of the concentrated population and raised level of living. In order to solve such a problem, miscellaneous water utilization systems to treat waste water for reuse have been introduced in newly constructed large-size buildings in large cities such as Tokyo. Among such various systems, an actual example of reusing building waste water with tubular UF membrane is shown and result of study on applications of a dynamic membrane filtration method using hollow fiber MF membrane is discussed below. Building Waste Water Reuse System Using Membrane Features The waste water recycle/reuse system using membrane is relatively free from influences coming from load fluctuation and as such can produce treated water of a stable quality because it is a physical treatment process using membrane as the main treatment medium. This system can be automatically operated, if one so desires, and therefore controlled easily. In addition, the equipment can be made compact in size. Under the present conditions, the waste water reuse methods using membrane are broadly classified into the RO method and UF method. When these two methods are compared, the UF method is more advantageous with respect to the quality of the treated water, while the UF method is better with respect to the economics such as investment cost and operating expense. Use of the recycled building waste water is in almost all cases limited to flushing of toilet stools. Such a high level of water quality as that of drinking water is not required. thus, the UF method is though to be more appropriate. Example of Implementation An example of implementation of the building waste water recycle/reuse system using UF membrane in a K building is shown below. The waste water is from the kitchens and miscellaneous waste water, mixed with part of sewerage. Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows a flow of the system. In this system, waste water is contact-aerated, then cross-flow filtrated with tubular type PAN membrane of 13,000 in molecular weight cut-off, and finally disinfected with chlorine to recycle water. Recovery ratio of the recycled water is about 70 percent. The membrane separation unit is periodically cleaned with a sponge ball and chemicals to maintain the flux. The role of the UF membrane here is to remove the turbidity substance and unresolved high molecular components in the raw water. An example of treatment with this system is shown in Table 1. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1.

With the membrane method, no fungi leak to the treated water. This is a very safe process in this respect. Study on Application of Dynamic Membrane Filtration Method In order to reduce the water recycling cost, feasibility to recycle and reuse waste water from buildings by the dynamic filtration method using the MF membrane which is cheaper than the UF membrane was studied particularly from the standpoint of quality of the treated water. Tests The above-described waste water from the K Building after contact aeration was filtrated with MF membrane and compared with water treated with the existing UF membrane facility. MF membrane of polyethylene hollow fiber of 0.2 ï¿½m in pore diameter was used. The same cross-flow filtration method as with the UF membrane was adopted. Back wash method with permeated water was applied for the MF membrane because of the different membrane forms. Filtration conditions were so set that the energies used for cross-flow are equivalent. Respective filtration conditions are shown in Table 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Filtration Conditions | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |MF |UF | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pressure difference [kgf/|0.5 |2.0 | |cm[.sup]2[/]] | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Linear velocity [m/s] |1.0 |2.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Results Examples of the qualities of water filtrated with the MF and UF membranes are shown in Table 3. The quality of treated water was on the same level for both membranes. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3. Examples of Qualities of Water Filtrated With Membranes | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Water supplied |Water filtrated w-|Water filtrated w-| | | |ith MF membrane |ith UF Membrane | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |BOD[.sub]5[/] [-|199 |13.9 |14.3 | |mg/l] | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |COD[.sub]Mn[/] |150 |13.7 |13.9 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |n-Hex [mg/l] |67.6 |4.6 |5.7 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The measurement of molecular weight distribution of water treated with membranes by the gel chromatography are shown in Figure 2 [not reproduced]. No component of molecular weight higher than several thousands was observed in water treated either with the MF or UF membrane. It seems that the characteristics of molecular weight cut-off depend on the dynamic membrane formed on the membrane surface more than on the membrane itself. Then, the COD[.sub]Mn[/] of water treated with the membrane was measured before back wash, and 1, 3, 10, and 20 minutes after it to examine changes in the quality of water against time. The results are shown in Table 4. Changes in the flux during this process are shown in Figure 3 [not reproduced]. The flux was changed from 0.8 to 1.0 m[.sup]3[/]/m[.sup]2[/]-day from before the back wash. Dynamic membrane form is supposed to have changed but difference was not observed in the membrane-treated water. This suggests dynamic membrane of self-rejection type was formed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4.

The following reasons have been cited so far: a. MF membrane is inferior with respect to the quality of treated water. b. MF membrane causes clogging of SS in the pore. Studies have been carried out on application of a building waste water reuse system using MF membrane. At least regarding the water quality, the same treatment result was obtained with the MF membrane as with the UF membrane. As a subject to be taken up in the future in order to put the MF membrane into practical use for the waste water reuse systems, maintenance of high flux for a long time and economic efficiency should be furthermore studied. Postface Among waste water reuse facilities, those of individual circulation type account for more than 80 percent. Their use was limited to washing toilet stools before. However, to recycle and reuse water more efficiently, an area circulation system is desirable to recycle and supply water covering an entire city or as a center for each district. With the increase of demand for water, wider district circulation systems will be employed. For the reclaimed water applications, their use will be increased not only to flushing toilet stools but also to supply water for sprinkling, hydrophile and other uses. It is an important subject of waste water reuse to develop treatment techniques suitable to objects, paying attention to the safety and economic efficiency.
