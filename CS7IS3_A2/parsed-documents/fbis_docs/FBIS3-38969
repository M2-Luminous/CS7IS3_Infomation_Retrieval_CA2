As government spokesman Dieter Vogel reported in Bonn, Kohl emphatically supported the U.S. position, which is largely identical with French ideas. After the NATO decision Clinton warned the Bosnian Serbs and others against continuing to shell Bosnia's capital. Everyone who violates the decision, which is also largely based on U.S. proposals, "must be prepared for the consequences," Clinton said. The conflict itself "must be solved by the parties involved at the negotiating table," whereby the United States will take over a more substantial role. According to Minister of the Chancellery Friedrich Bohl, the FRG has a "decisive share in the implementation of the ultimatum to Bosnia." On the ARD "Morgenmagazin" program, he explained that "behind the scenes and via diplomatic channels we made great efforts to come to this result." The minister of the chancellery does not see any parallels with the situation that led to World War I. In contrast with 1914, the international community this time is in complete agreement. The threat must be upheld at all costs, however. Germany must "provide moral and political support."
