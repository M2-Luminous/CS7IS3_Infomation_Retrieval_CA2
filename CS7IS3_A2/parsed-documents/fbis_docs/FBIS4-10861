Augusto Vargas Alzamora, the Lima archbishop and Peruvian primate, yesterday harshly criticized the lack of independence enjoyed by the judicial branch and urged magistrates to act according to their conscience and not yield to any form of alien pressure and not rule according to the circumstances. He also urged them to step up their investigations to determine whether those brought before the court are guilty or not. Vargas Alzamora gave a news conference after the Easter Sunday mass in the Lima Cathedral. He indirectly referred to the Goldman report disclosed last Thursday, 31 March, in Washington which criticizes the reform of the judicial branch following the self-styled coup staged by President Alberto Fujimori on 5 April 1992. Vargas Alzamora told LA REPUBLICA: "It would be fatal for the country if the judicial branch did not enjoy independence." He recalled that the commission of international jurists headed by U.S. law professor Robert Goldman referred to serious deficiencies in the administration of justice in Peru and recalled that it recommended the elimination of the faceless judges and a substantial amendment of the antiterrorist laws that had allowed the sentencing of innocent people. During his usual meeting with the media in the main hall of the Lima archbishopric, Vargas Alzamora said: "The only thing I can tell the judges is to be loyal to their conscience, do not yield to any pressure, and do not condemn those being tried for circumstantial reasons. I urge them, from the bottom of my heart, to exhaustively investigate cases and prove that the charges are legitimate. The contrary would be fatal to the country." [passage omitted]
