This was the assessment made by Senator Orlando Mercado, chairman of the Senate Committee on Defense, and Arturo Enrile, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. However, they expressed the hope that the prevailing tension would be solved by moves undertaken by the countries claiming the Spratlys. They added that the talks for a joint development of the Spratlys would help to prevent the dispute ending in violent confrontation. [Begin recording in progress, in English] [Mercado] ...and the world, really, as a consequence of the demise of the Cold War. But, it is also an accepted notion that Spratlys or Kalayaan Island Group is a potential problem. [Enrile] ...flashpoint is Spratlys which is (?unabated) because I think everybody has agreed anyway that you know diplomacy is still the best way to solve international disputes. There is really no conflict there right now, but just to anticipate any conflict. [end recording]
