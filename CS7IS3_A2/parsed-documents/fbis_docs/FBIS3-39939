The Germinal surveillance frigate, under the command of Captain Patrick Giaume, is staying in Cape Town from 14 to 21 February. Several meetings with South African Navy officials as well as a demonstration of the ship's capabilities are scheduled to take place during the visit, which bears witness to closer military relations between the two countries. France has just reopened its Military Attache Office in Pretoria, which had been "frozen" for several years as a result of sanctions. The arrival of the Germinal coincides with the visit in South Africa of a parliamentary delegation headed by Yvon Bourges, a former defense minister and the vice president of the Senate's Foreign Affairs and Defense Commission. The delegation met with South African Defense Minister Kobie Coetsee as well as several military officials. The Germinal -- the latest in a series of six frigates -- is armed with a 100-mm automatic cannon and sea-to-sea Exocet missiles. It carries a Dauphin helicopter and was designed for extended missions, including general-purpose sea surveillance, evacuation of nationals, and interventions. These are the features which motivated the ship's presence in Southern Africa in the first place. South Africa -- whose whole naval strategy used to be geared toward defending the Cape Town route in case of an East-West conflict -- must now redefine its objectives and equipment requirements. According to Vice-Admiral Bernard Moysan, the president of the Sea Trials Commission, who came to Cape Town on board of the Germinal, the frigate is perfectly suited to the country's new naval needs.
