To this end, the strains HB101 and S17.1 of Escherichia coli and the CXM 1 strain of Rhizobium meliloti as well as the pRK2013, pSUP2021, and pLAFR5 plasmids are used in the experiment. A leucine-auxotrophic mutant strain CXM1 which has lost its ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa is produced by nonspecific transposonic mutagenesis using the pSUP2021 plasmid (Tn5) as the donor. The study shows that the addition of leucine directly to the plants inoculated with the auxotrophic mutant does not restore its ability to develop normal symbiosis. Large-scale screening of four types of alfalfa under sterile microvegetation conditions reveals the absence of interstrain variability and the existence of individual variability based on the behavior of host plant response to leucine auxotrophic inoculation. A bank of CXM1 strains is constructed on the basis of the cosmid pLAFR5 vector and used in conjugation cross-breeding for the purpose of complementing leucine auxotrophe. The findings also indicate that the leucine biosynthesis genes are involved in regulating the development of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa. The results lay the groundwork for a more detailed study of the relationship between the leucine biosynthesis and the expression of symbiotic properties in these bacteria. The authors are grateful to T.V. Ivashina and N.A. Provorov for assisting with the gene bank and making valuable remarks. Figures 5; tables 2; references 21: 3 Russian, 18 Western.
