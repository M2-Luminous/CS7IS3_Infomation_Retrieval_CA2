This is what Aristide spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau said to explain to public opinion that Jean-Bertrand Aristide has nothing to do with the Mole Saint-Nicolas thing, or the (Portortuga) affair. The Haitian president is not involved in this matter -- not closely nor even remotely -- nor is any other member of the government involved in this matter. However, perhaps the main person accused, Commerce Minister Louis Dejoie, is. The matter is still just a rumor, but it will be looked into, says Jean-Claude Martineau. [Begin Martineau recording, in Creole] Something is being said discreetly throughout the country: The commerce minister has allegedly given a company a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas. The rumor says that no other part of the government knows about it. Since this is a rumor, we will try to obtain information about it. Meanwhile, however, President Aristide would like to inform the public that he has nothing to do with that matter. Should it be true, the minister alone must bear full responsibility for it. When one does not own land, one cannot sell that land. [end recording] Let us recall that during a news conference by the Group of Democratic Parliamentarians [Groupe des Parlementaires Democrates, GPD], Deputy Samuel Madistin accused the minister of commerce of having signed a contract with the company (Portortuga S.A.) granting it a portion of Mole Saint-Nicolas. This contract allegedly gives the company exclusive rights to build an entertainment and leisure facility on land located in Mole Saint-Nicolas.
