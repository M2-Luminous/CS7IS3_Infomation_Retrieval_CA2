I was impressed in my meetings by the interest and goodwill felt towards Hong Kong and China by leading figures in government, the U.S. Congress and business community. I came away encouraged by a belief there was a good deal of common ground on which to forge a closer understanding between the Chinese and American people. An item high on my agenda was the United States' annual renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status. It is a debate we in Hong Kong have watched with anxiety for five consecutive years. Some have become dismissive of the threat but it is probably more threatening now than previously. There are deep concerns in the United States about human rights. The choice President Bill Clinton now faces is a difficult one: how to avoid a destructive confrontation with China without appearing to compromise the human rights issue on which he has placed so much emphasis. Whatever he decides, concern in the U.S. and elsewhere about human rights in China is not going to disappear. It will be a recurring theme that requires a means of expression. But it would be in all our interests to find a means of doing so without a direct confrontation over economics and trade. If something good has come of this painful annual process, it is the way that it has encouraged discussion of human rights, a matter of great importance to us all as Hong Kong prepares for a change in sovereignty. It is not something we can sweep under the carpet. There may be different ways to approach it but constant effort to improve human rights is fundamental to the development of civilised society. The question is not whether to seek to promote respect for human rights but how best to do it. Those of us in the Hong Kong Government have consistently maintained threatening trade sanctions is not the best way. I made the point forcefully on many occasions during my U.S. trip and many agreed with me. Trade is one of the oldest and purest forms of international cooperation. It brings people together, creates wealth and progress and encourages changes. Its effects on southern China are a good example. Lifestyles for millions of people have improved for the better, with not only the comforts and convenience of consumer goods such as refrigerators and motorbikes, but also televisions and fax machines that bring the outside world closer. Freedom of movement, choice of occupation, readiness to speak out are all far greater than could have been imagined a decade ago. The economic growth which trade brought to southern China has not been without its drawbacks. The transition from an agrarian to an industrial economy has been a difficult one. Worker rights, worker safety and environmental protection, for example, require the discipline of regulatory standards that are only patchy at first and take education and resources to develop. Trade produces both, particularly trade with a country such as the U.S. which is concerned about these issues. Reduce that trade and the good influence diminishes. Expand the trade and the free flow of ideas will become a flood. Many people in the U.S. are persuaded by these arguments. They want to keep doing business with China, both because they believe it is in the economic interests of the U.S. but also because they see a trade conflict with China would actually undermine human rights there. They believe developing trading links would increase opportunities for dialogue and change. The "Hong Kong argument" also carries weight in Washington. Of course there are public misconceptions about Hong Kong in the U.S. and we are doing our best to correct them. But among political leaders and opinion formers there is a remarkably good understanding of Hong Kong's significance in this region as a gateway to China. It is also a model of free trade, business enterprise and good administration, a platform for U.S. business in Asia and an economic dynamo for the region. There is great reluctance to do anything which would penalise Hong Kong or make life more difficult for us at such a challenging time in our history. Some I met knew something of the importance of Hong Kong to China and the region but had not appreciated just how damaging withdrawal of China's MFN trading status would be to Hong Kong's economy. The fact two-thirds of foreign investment in China originated from Hong Kong surprised them as did the two-thirds of China's exports to the U.S. and one-third of American goods going to China which passed through Hong Kong. I took the opportunity to provide our latest analysis of the economic impact of MFN withdrawal on Hong Kong -- up to 75,000 jobs lost and GDP growth cut by between 2.2 and 3.1 per cent. There is no doubt the immediate impact of MFN withdrawal would be severe. I went on to point out Hong Kong managed to sustain impressive confidence about its future, thanks largely to its healthy economy. The success of closer economic co-operation between Hong Kong and China helped win acceptance in Hong Kong that its future was inextricably linked with China's. Diminish that economic success and it would be a great deal more difficult to sustain confidence in Hong Kong as we approach 1997. It is a depressing argument to use but it carried weight with those in the U.S. concerned about this region and American interests here. Of course it is possible, or even likely, MFN will not be withdrawn totally this year and instead some form of selective sanction imposed. I made it clear I thought quite apart from the practical difficulties of, for example, attempting to distinguish between goods produced by state and non-state enterprises, there were considerable risks. In addition, the introduction of any form of trade sanctions created uncertainty for Hong Kong because it was impossible to insulate the territory from the effect of sanctions against China and the almost inevitable retaliation. Each of these arguments is a case for renewing MFN without conditions. Taken together, they make a strong case for pursuing concerns about human rights in a way that does not threaten trade and economic ties. This was the first time a chief secretary of Hong Kong has been received at the White House by an American vice-president. It was a public recognition of how important Hong Kong has become to the U.S. and an important demonstration of goodwill and support. It was also, I believe, a recognition the Hong Kong Government's position on the MFN issue is being taken seriously. It is certainly a position we intend to stick to.
