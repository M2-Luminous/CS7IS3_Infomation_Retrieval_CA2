[Istanbuli] When we discuss relations between Iran and Jordan, we imply long, historic, and continuing bilateral relations. Two years ago, it was decided that relations should be improved. There are various issues and circumstances necessitating better and broader relations. The issue of normalizing, establishing, and continuing relations with Iran is an important one, which is being seriously pursued in Jordan in word and deed. Recently, King Husayn told a news conference that Iran has no role in fomenting tension in Arab countries and this indicates Jordan's stance on the importance of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Prince Hasan also stresses the role and importance of Iran in the Middle East. In letters to Iranian officials, King Husayn has stressed Jordan's wish for better and improved relations with Iran. The visits by various political, economic, and cultural delegations to the Islamic Republic of Iran indicate Jordan's desire to broaden ties with Iran. [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] To what do you attribute the problems that cropped up in Iranian-Jordanian relations? [Istanbuli] The current relations between Iran and Jordan are based on the two countries and peoples being Muslim, having a fundamental role in the Islamic world, and being part of the great Islamic ummah. You should not ignore the role of the mass media. The West has adopted two policies with regard to the Islamic world: One concerns principled leanings [osul-gera'i--euphemism for fundamentalism] and the dangers and the second is the issue of human rights regarding which the Western countries have concentrated their propaganda on particular Islamic countries. In this manner, they claim that these countries do not adhere to democratic principles and violate human rights. They cover up human rights violations in other countries. The victims in both cases are Muslims. The mass media in Islamic countries should defend the Islamic culture and civilization more than ever so that they can combat the Western media's propaganda. You should strive to eliminate obstacles and replace them with common denominators and muster every resource against such onslaughts. This should be a common strategy for all Muslim countries. On the effective role played by the mass media in raising the level of bilateral relations, he said: Much material is published in Jordanian newspapers regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran. A few weeks ago, the Iranian ambassador in Jordan was interviewed in the press. Similarly, articles and reports on elections and other important issues in Iran are published in Jordanian newspapers, all of which are geared toward broadening bilateral relations. The Jordanian ambassador then referred to the publication of articles in Iranian newspapers that tend to project Jordan's stance as servile to the United States, opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and anti-Islamic and added: This is not true. Jordan wants to have cordial relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Referring to the past record of historic, cultural, and Islamic relations between Iran and Jordan, the ambassador called for greater contacts between the two countries and the two nations and said that despite the problems, bilateral relations are on a favorable level. He added: We are living in a region in which we should bring our stances and ideas closer together and eschew discord. [KEYHAN] The Islamic al-Tahrir party was formed many years ago in Jordan but why has it never participated in the political process with other factions and adopted the path of opposition? [Istanbuli] This is linked with the thinking and leanings of the party. You can ask them this question. The newspaper AL-LULWA recently published the party's manifesto, its stance, and its strategies, to which you can refer. There is no law in Jordan that bans any party on the basis of its thinking. Every party is free to state its beliefs and the law on parties clarifies that the Islamic al-Tahrir party can carry out its activities on the basis of the Constitution. [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the Gaza-Jericho Accord as a peace agreement? [Istanbuli] Naturally, if the objective of the Palestinian leadership is to create a Palestinian government by means of this accord, we cannot say that the Palestinians are wrong. If it does not culminate in the establishment of a Palestinian government, we can say that they should not do such things. [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of Jordan's West Bank? Will you set up a confederation to administer these Palestinian territories? [Istanbuli] The West Bank is part of Jordan and this has been clarified in the Constitution. If the Palestinian leadership talks of a confederation, we believe that we are one nation, that Jordan is one big nation. We don't even mention the Syrians or Lebanese, with whom we have very deep relations, which surpass all talk of a confederation. [KEYHAN] How do you view the future of the Middle East, especially after the Gaza-Jericho Accord? [Istanbuli] The interests of the Arab and Islamic countries are the main basis, the principles that should be incorporated in such accords. And there should be provision for the conditions of unity of Islamic countries. Jordan stresses the need for an Islamic common market that should include every Arab and Islamic country. Jordanian Prime Minister Amir Hasan also stressed the role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in an Islamic common market. These are the countries that should resist the enemies' economic and cultural onslaughts. We are the first country to stress these Islamic-Arab slogans. [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] How do you view Jordan's relations with the Persian Gulf countries with regard to the oil war, now that some years have passed since then? [Istanbuli] Jordan has always attached much importance to its relations with the Persian Gulf countries and it does not benefit Jordan on principle to adopt a stance against these countries. Jordan's policy was to amicably settle the issue of the occupation of Kuwait by Iraq. In this regard, Jordan concurs with the Islamic Republic of Iran and believes that foreign forces should not be present in the region. We do not want to be opposed to an Arab country and we have cordial relations with the Persian Gulf countries. [KEYHAN] In view of the current international conditions and the changes in the international structure, how do you view the future world order and Jordan's place therein? [Istanbuli] You know that Jordan is a small country in terms of its area but has the longest border with Israel. Therefore, it has the greatest responsibility of all the Arab and Islamic countries. The issue is that Jordan has always tried to have a strong army in terms of its resources and capability. It is Jordan's strategy to be a country strong in its unity and solidarity with its friends. Jordan does not favor differences between Arab and Islamic countries, as differences in the Arab and Islamic world will be detrimental and harmful. You can see this in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Iraq, and Libya and the Islamic and Arab world are cooperating on this. We see that two Arab and Islamic countries are under an economic embargo. As an Arab and a Muslim, I believe there are children, women, and aged people who are affected by it and we have a duty to them as Muslims. As for Bosnia-Herzegovina, it is the same. In Somalia and Afghanistan, the real victims are Muslims again and this indicates foreign intervention and losses to Muslims. The potential resources of Islamic countries are a strong cultural force against Western civilization, indicating a strong and basic international culture. Jordan's strategy right from the outset has been that this culture and civilization should remain strong and firmly in place and that that requires the cooperation of Arab and Islamic countries.
