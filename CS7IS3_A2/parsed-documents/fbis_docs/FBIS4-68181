An anarchist group calling itself the "Revolutionary Cell" claimed responsibility Tuesday for an explosives attack on Selectours, in southern Paris, saying the blast was to express solidarity with a prisoner in Denmark. The typewritten claim sent to AFP said the attack was carried out "on a travel agency specialising in Denmark and recommended by the embassy" out of solidarity with Marc Rudin, held in Denmark "in very tough conditions." The agency was slightly damaged by Monday's blast. Besides the embassy, there are several Danish companies in Paris as well as a complex on the Champs Elysees including restaurants and a cultural centre. "We shall attack Danish interests as long as the claims of our comrades in Denmark are not satisfied," the text said without elaborating. Rudin, a 48-year-old Swiss national, was sentenced to eight years in jail in 1993 by a Danish court for belonging to an extremist leftwing group that staged several armed hold-ups in a crusade to finance international liberation movements. A policeman was killed in one of the attacks blamed on the group. He has also been accused of taking part in attacks in Switzerland against the International Monetary Fund and the Spanish embassy. He was believed to have fled to Syria and was arrested on the border between Turkey and Syria in 1991.
