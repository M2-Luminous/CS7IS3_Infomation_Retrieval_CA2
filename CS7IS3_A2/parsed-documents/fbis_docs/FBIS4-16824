At a news conference, he summed up the results of the talks which have taken place with the Palestinian side at the Foreign Ministry's residence. These talks covered a wide range of issues connected with a Near East settlement and bilateral relations. The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that at the talks in Moscow the sides continued the Palestinian-Russian dialogue which has been going on for several years now and which was given powerful impetus as a result of President Boris Yeltsin's initiative. This initiative was discussed by the sides in Tunis, where a "bold and fundamental" political decision was made to return to the negotiating table in spite of existing difficulties. "Today we discussed those difficulties, we know about them, and we are determined to eliminate all obstacles to a comprehensive settlement," the minister stressed. He assured Y. 'Arafat of Russian support for the PLO's policy of opposing extremists, and noted that the heads of state of Palestine and Russia are in constant contact through the Russian president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk via a regular exchange of messages. Y. 'Arafat described his visit to Moscow as especially important given the difficult circumstances under which it is taking place. He said: "A double historical, political, and moral responsibility for the situation in the region rests on Mr. Kozyrev, since it was he and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher who countersigned the Palestinian-Israeli agreement." Y. 'Arafat said that today he discussed with the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry ways of overcoming those obstacles which are preventing the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho, First" agreement, and namely those "delays and maneuvers" to which the Israeli side is resorting. "I reminded the minister that the deadline under the agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territories coming under Palestinian autonomy expired on 13 April. In spite of this, nothing has changed on the ground," the PLO leader said. "All of this will lead to time being lost and will allow those forces which oppose the agreement to close ranks and mobilize their actions against the establishment of peace in the region." He warned that the only alternative to peace is anarchy and "Balkanization" of the region. [passage omitted] After the talks, the sides signed a Russo-Palestinian agreement on the prospects for bilateral cooperation in politics, economics, and culture. Earlier today, the Palestinian head of the state laid a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and held talks with Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and Russian Interior Minister Viktor Yerin.
