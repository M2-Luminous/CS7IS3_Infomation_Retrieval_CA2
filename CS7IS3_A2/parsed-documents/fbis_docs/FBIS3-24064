By the end of the year there were positive tendencies in industry (the rates of reduction of production volumes slowed up) and trade (the growth rate of retail commodity turnover in the oblast during the half year surpassed the preceding year's level). But toward the end of the year the situation became more difficult. The results of the year are characterized by a considerable reduction of production volumes and investment activity, a crisis of mutual nonpayments of enterprises, high rates of inflation, and an appreciable decline of the standard of living of the population. The basic indicators characterizing the oblast's socioeconomic situation in 1993: 1993 (in actual 1993 in % of 1992 (in prices) comparable prices) 1 2 3 Industrial output 73 Production of consumer goods, 636.5 91 billions of rubles including: foodstuffs 174.2 86 alcoholic beverages 94.8 118 nonfoodstuffs 367.5 89 Capital investments from all 518 80 sources of financing, billions of rubles Startup of residential 979.9 85 buildings from all sources of financing, thousands of square meters of overall area Average daily dispatch of 246.9 80 freight by rail transportation (on railroad divisions of Chelyabinsk Oblast), thousands of tonnes Shipment of freight by general 76 53 purpose automotive transportation, millions of tonnes Procurements of animal husbandry products from all categories of farms: cattle and poultry, thousands 98.4 94 of tonnes milk, thousands of tonnes 416 99.5 eggs, millions 573.8 101 Retail commodity turnover of 779.6 81 officially registered public catering enterprises, billions of rubles Paid services, billions of 91.5 71 rubles Exports, millions of dollars 286.3 Imports, millions of dollars 197.9 Profit (January-November), 1,118.8 8.7-fold* billions of rubles Emission, billions of rubles 551.7 10.7-fold* Per capita monetary incomes 38,155 9.2-fold* (average for month), rubles Consolidated consumer price 1,024.6** index, percent *--in actual prices **--December 1993 compared to December 1992 FINANCES Over 11 months enterprises and organizations of the oblast received 1.1188 trillion rubles [R] in profit. As compared to the corresponding period of last year there was an 8.7-fold increase in profit. As of 1 December all branches of the national economy had achieved a positive financial result. According to the results of their operation, every eleventh enterprise sustained losses. The proportion of enterprises operating at a loss was great. In computer service--33.3 percent, housing and municipal services--30.8 percent, and publishing houses--50 percent. As of 1 December 1993 monetary funds in the working accounts of the enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture amounted to R77.1 billion. Of this amount, 82 percent of the money was in industry. On the whole the monetary funds available to the enterprises cover the volume of their defaulted indebtedness to suppliers by only 16 percent. As usual, the problem of mutual settlements among enterprises remains critical. Credit indebtedness among these branches amounted to R1.717 trillion, of which about 40 percent was defaulted indebtedness. The share of industrial enterprises in the overall volume of defaulted indebtedness by suppliers amounted to 90 percent. Considerable amounts of defaulted credit indebtedness were related to the existence of debit indebtedness. As of 1 December 1993 debit indebtedness amounted to R1.7907 trillion, of which R758.9 billion (42.4 percent) was defaulted. A large part of it was defaulted indebtedness of buyers--R689.5 billion. The shortage of financial resources of the enterprises is covered to a considerable degree by bank credit. The overall amount of indebtedness on bank credit in the branches that were examined amounted to R254 billion, including in industry--R143.2 billion (56.4 percent). Indebtedness on loans that were received amounted to R31.2 billion, of which 86.8 percent was in industry. As a result of the lack of money in the working accounts there continues to be growth of defaulted indebtedness on funds granted for consumption. As of 1 January 1994 this sum in industry, construction, and agriculture amounted to R31.7 million, which is 1.3 times more than during the entire 11 months. PRIVATIZATION Over the year documents were filled out for the privatization of 1,023 facilities, including 703 municipally owned enterprises (68.7 percent of the overall number of enterprises, 90 owned by the oblast (8.8 percent), and 230 federally owned (22.5 percent). The overall value of the property of privatized enterprises exceeds R172.1 billion. Privatization is proceeding most actively with municipally owned enterprises. A total of 255 enterprises are being converted into joint-stock companies--this is one-fourth of the enterprises that submitted documents for privatization. Of the three versions of benefits offered to the labor collectives, preference is given to the second version which enables the labor collective to have a controlling block of shares. This version of benefits was chosen by 70 percent of the enterprises that became joint-stock companies. About R18 billion in capital was received from privatization, which is 3.4 times more than during the first half of 1993. Most of the capital (about 60 percent) remains on the territory of the oblast. Last year 183,800 apartments were privatized in the oblast. As compared to 1992 their number increased 1.6-fold. Since the beginning of privatization (1989-1993) 299,000 apartments have been privatized, which is 35.8 percent of the overall number of apartments subject to privatization. LEVEL AND INDEXES OF PRICES AND RATES The consolidated consumer price index for the full range of goods and services in December 1993 as compared to December 1992 amounted to 1,024.6 percent. During the course of the year consumer prices and rates rose most rapidly for paid services rendered to the population. In December 1993 as compared to December 1992 they increased 48.1-fold, including services of a legal nature--664.3-fold, of cultural institutions--170.4-fold, and housing and municipal services--60.2-fold. A decisive impact on the growth of overall consumer prices was made by the change in prices of foodstuffs, which make up a large proportion of them. In December 1993 as compared to December 1992 consumer prices for food products increased 9.1-fold, including vegetables--22.2-fold, potatoes--19.2-fold, eggs--18.3-fold, fruits and vegetables--12.3-fold, bread and bakery items--12.1-fold, and milk and dairy products--11.9-fold. Consumer prices for nonfood commodities increased less than those of food commodities. With respect to this type of goods there were sharp price increases for medications (54.3-fold), household chemical items (20.5-fold), children's footwear (12.4-fold), hosiery items (12.2-fold), rubber footwear (11.7-fold), construction materials (11.5-fold), and knitted underwear (10.9-fold). The consolidated retail price index for consumer goods of the trade network in 1993 as compared to 1992 amounted to 1,085.6 percent. Prices increased most for nonfood commodities--11.6-fold, including for medications and chemical products--23-fold, glass dishware--19-fold, paper and office supplies--16-fold, rubber footwear and toys--15-fold, passenger cars and leather and textile-combined footwear--14-fold, and headgear, haberdashery, and household chemicals--13-fold. On the whole in 1993 as compared to 1992 prices of foodstuffs increased 10.4-fold, including for herring--16-fold, meat and poultry--15-fold, canned fish and vegetables--14-fold, sausage items, fish, lard, potatoes, and vegetables--13-fold, margarine and margarine products, milk and dairy products, cheese, tea, salt, and nonalcoholic beverages--12-fold, and canned meats, fruits, and ice cream--11-fold. The level of prices and rates of services in the sphere of consumer services increased 18.3-fold on average for the oblast during the year. There was a sharp increase in the rates for services of notary institutions (692-fold). The higher prices of food products and municipal, transportation, and health services gave a powerful impetus to the growth of prices for tourist-excursion (18.5-fold) and sanatorium-health resort services (17-fold). During the past year prices and rates of consumer services increased 16.7-fold, of which the cost of dry cleaning services increased 27.4-fold, shoe repair--26.3-fold, ceremonial services--24.7-fold, tailoring of clothing--20.6-fold, and bath services--17-fold. There was a sharp increase in prices for services of institutions of culture (30.8-fold) and public health (13.8-fold). The cost of passenger transportation services increased 27.9-fold. As compared to last year there was an increase in the cost of airline tickets (45.9-fold) and railroad tickets (19.6-fold), and the cost of passenger travel on urban commuter transportation increased 11-fold. There were appreciable increases in prices of communications services (10.8-fold) and housing and municipal services (9.6-fold). The consolidated wholesale price index for industrial products for the set of representative commodities in December 1993 as compared to the preceding month was 107.8 percent, and compared to December 1992--1,034.5 percent. Throughout the entire year there was a growth of wholesale prices in the food, meat, and dairy industry. In October the maximum growth of prices was observed in the bread baking industry (the index as compared to last month was 201.5 percent), and in December there was a considerable increase in the butter and fat industry (146.7 percent). The increase in wholesale prices in all branches of industry brought about an inevitable increase in retail prices, which, in turn, raised the cost of the consumer basket. THE SOCIAL SPHERE Labor placement and employment of the population. In 1993, 54,200 citizens looking for work applied to the employment service regarding placement, 89.6 percent of which were not engaged in labor activity, 4.1 percent--pensioners, 5.2 percent--students wanting to work during their free time, and 1.1 percent--employed population. As of 1 January 1994 there were 17,900 registered as unemployed in the oblast, 63.4 percent of whom are receiving unemployment compensation. In terms of length of unemployment, 36.2 percent of the unemployed have not been working for from one to four months, and 69.4 percent of them are receiving unemployment compensation. During the year 2,900 unemployed citizens received occupational training through the employment service, and 1,600 of them (55.2 percent) were placed in jobs upon completion of training. As of the beginning of 1994, 1,066 enterprises reported the layoff of 15,300 workers, while 773 enterprises reported a need for workers to fill vacancies (vacant positions)--3,800. The number of workers laid off exceeded the need for work force fourfold. Certain branches of the economy have part-time employment. During January-September in industry, construction, transportation, scientific institutions, and consumer services additional leave on the initiative of the administration was assigned to 127,700 workers. As of 1 October 1993 the number of people working part time in production was 45,100. The number of workers. During November the average registered number of workers in all branches of the economy was 1,388,200, which is 45,300 less than during the corresponding period of last year. Monetary incomes and expenditures of the population. In 1993 the monetary circulation under the conditions of the further deepening of inflation processes and the decline of public production did not improve. According to working figures, monetary incomes increased in 1993 by R1.4796 trillion or 9.2-fold as compared to 1992, and reached R1.6603 trillion. Consumer expenditures rose by R767.6 or 8.1-fold and amounted to R867.4. According to figures from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation for Chelyabinsk Oblast, issuance (the transfer of monetary funds from reserve to circulating) increased 10.7-fold as compared to 1992 and reached R551.7 billion in 1993. During the year payments of wages increased 9.3-fold and amounted to R836.6 billion, the issuance of incentive payments, monetary and other payments--10.5-fold, and stipends--7.2-fold. The average monthly wages during January-September increased each month by an average of 20 percent, in October as compared to the preceding month--by 17 percent, and in November--by 8.8 percent. During nine months of last year the growth rate of wages was higher than the growth rate of prices and in the fourth quarter the growth rate of prices outstripped the growth rate of wages. In November the average monthly wages in the economy of Chelyabinsk Oblast amounted to R109,865 and wages at agricultural enterprises, forestry enterprises, and institutions of science and public education were almost 50 percent less. The highest growth rates of average monthly wages in November as compared to an analogous period of 1992 were in institutions of public education--13.1-fold, although the average monthly wages were not high--R64,609, and in computer service organizations--12.7-fold. The proportion of consumer expenditures in the overall sum of expenditures decreased from 83.5 percent in 1992 to 78.1 percent in 1993. As compared to 1992 there was a considerable increase in mandatory payments and voluntary contributions (11.3-fold) and an increase in the savings of the population in deposits and securities (12-fold) and expenditures of the population on paid services (10.3-fold). In terms of average per capita monetary income the process of stratification of the population is continuing. While in the third quarter of 1993 most of the families (71.7 percent) were in 10 groups with incomes from R20,000 to R70,000, in the fourth quarter 43.2 percent of the families were in these groups. The proportion of families with incomes from R70,000 to R100,000 increased from 12.5 to 25.4 percent, and over R100,000--from 8.2 to 30.2 percent. The consumer goods and services market. The oblast produced consumer goods (including alcoholic beverages) valued at a total of R636.5 in current prices. As compared to 1992 their output decreased by R59.7 billion or 8.6 percent. The output of food products decreased by R28.6 billion or 14.1 percent. Meat production decreased by 11,500 tonnes, sausage items--by 5,763 tonnes, semimanufactured meat products--by 1,821 tonnes, butter--by 154 tonnes, whole milk products--by 4,738 tonnes, canned goods--by 5,344,000 standard cans, cereals--by 4,712 tonnes, bread and bakery items--by 42,900 tonnes, confectionery items--by 1,929 tonnes, macaroni items--by 8,713 tonnes, and margarine products--by 10,800 tonnes. There was an increase in the output of fatty cheeses, mayonnaise, and nonalcoholic beverages. The production of alcoholic beverages increased by 18.2 percent measured in monetary value. The output of vodka and liquor items increased by 140,000 decaliters or 2.8 percent. During the past year a total of R367.5 billion worth of nonfoodstuffs, including light industry goods, were produced, which is 11.1 percent less than during the preceding year. The population of the oblast acquired 19 percent less goods (in comparable prices) than in 1992. Education. As of the beginning of the 1993-94 school year in the oblast there were 11 higher educational institutions, one branch of the Moscow Commercial University, and 71 secondary specialized educational institutions. In 1993 two tekhnikums were closed. The Magnitogorsk Higher Music School was transformed into a music pedagogical institute. Among the secondary specialized educational institutions there are 15 colleges, nine of which acquired the status of a college in 1993. Some 9,000 specialists with higher education and 14,900 with secondary specialized qualifications were sent to the branches of the oblast economy in 1993. Of the overall number of graduates, 32 percent of the VUZ [higher educational institution] specialists and 50 percent of the tekhnikum graduates were not placed in jobs. The list of unemployed was increased by 499 specialists with higher and secondary specialized qualifications. The admission of students into VUZ's during the year decreased by 100 and amounted to 10,600 students while admissions to tekhnikums increased by 300 (18,700 students). The competition amounted to 1.7 and 1.6 people per space, respectively. During 1993, 54 children's preschool institutions were closed. The main reasons for the closure of kindergartens and day nurseries were the inadequate number of children, the dilapidated conditions of the buildings, and the high parental payments. The buildings of the closed preschool institutions were made into hotels, residences, dormitories, warehouses, offices, and banks. More than 10 percent of these premises are empty. Health protection. The number of hospital beds in medical institutions as of the end of the year was 48,100, which was 134 beds for every 10,000 residents. For every 10,000 residents of the oblast there is an average of 36 physicians and 101 people working as intermediate medical personnel. MATERIAL PRODUCTION Industry. The production volume (in comparable prices) decreased by 20.6 percent as compared to the preceding year. The tendency toward retardation of the decline of production that was observed toward the beginning of last year continued until November. During the last two months of the year there was a significant reduction of production, in November--by 24 percent and December--by 26.9 percent. Each month during the year at an average of 35 enterprises there were lengthy production shutdowns (in November and December at 53 and 63 enterprises, respectively). During the year the losses of working time for this reason amounted to 2.5 million man-days or 12.5 percent of the scheduled working time. More than half of the shutdowns of enterprises last year were related to difficulties in selling products and about one-third to lack of provision of material resources. As a result of the lengthy shutdowns of enterprises and productions during the year, R65.2 billion worth of products were not produced. Labor productivity in industry decreased by 15.8 percent. The number of industrial production personnel amounted to 559,000 and decreased by 32,000 or 5.4 percent. The average monthly wages of workers in basic production in industry were R84,800, including in December--R146,200. Industrial enterprises of the oblast failed to deliver to consumers R134.7 billion worth of products under agreements that were concluded. The greatest arrears in product deliveries were found in enterprises of the metallurgical complex--97.9 percent of all the indebtedness. In the fuel and energy complex with an overall reduction in production volume of 2 percent, the output of electric energy decreased by 7.8 percent and coal extraction--by 1 percent. The agro-industrial complex. The volume of gross agricultural output (in comparable prices) on all categories of farms, according to preliminary calculations, decreased by 6.6 percent during the year. The reduction of volumes occurred mainly on public farms. On private subsidiary farms of the population the volume of products produced exceeded last year's level by 3.6 percent, and on peasant farms--by 1.6-fold. Labor productivity dropped by 8.6 percent and 210 agricultural enterprises ended the year with a profit, while 65 ended it with losses. During the year the farms received R15.4 billion in profit. The profitability level was 14.8 percent. As a result of the reduction of the planted areas and the reduction of productivity in 1993 as compared to 1992 there was a reduction of the gross yield of grain crops from 2,781,300 tonnes to 1,817,700 tonnes (65.4 percent), potatoes--from 634,900 to 503,700 (79.3 percent), and vegetables--from 131,200 to 111,800 tonnes (85.2 percent). The farms of the oblast stored up 16,500 tonnes of potatoes (39.5 percent of the 1992 level) and 36,500 tonnes of vegetables (63.1 percent). The annual volumes of mandatory deliveries of potatoes were fulfilled by 30.1 percent, of vegetables--by 66.4 percent. In 1993 there was a certain slowing up of the decline of the production of animal husbandry products at agricultural enterprises: During the report year they produced (sold for slaughter) 128,500 tonnes of cattle and poultry in live weight (95.5 percent of the 1992 level), 512,000 tonnes of milk (99.4 percent), 639 million eggs (94.5 percent), and 1,504 tonnes of wool (105.6 percent). On average from one cow the farms of the oblast obtained 165 kilograms (8.1 percent) of milk more than in 1992. The average yield of wool from one sheep increased by 0.7 kilograms (21.9 percent). The average daily weight gain of cattle being fattened increased by 80 grams (24 percent), for hogs it dropped by 35 grams (11.5 percent), and the egg production of laying hens decreased by five eggs (2 percent). The number of head of the main kinds of livestock continues to decrease. During last year the number of cattle decreased by 8.2 percent and amounted to 640,800 head, including cows--by 6.4 percent (221,500 head). The number of hogs decreased by 12.5 percent (262,500 head), and sheep--by 12.6 percent (330,600 head). The number of head of poultry increased by 4.5 percent and amounted to 7,772,600. A smaller number of calves and piglets were born. The maintenance of the main kinds of livestock improved. During the past year state resources have acquired 98,400 tonnes of cattle and poultry (94.2 percent of the 1992 level), 416,000 tonnes of milk (99.5 percent), 573.8 million eggs (101 percent), and 813 tonnes of wool (94.4 percent). The annual volumes of mandatory deliveries of cattle and poultry were fulfilled by 108.1 percent, milk--by 104 percent, and eggs--by 140 percent. State procurements of cattle and poultry increased in seven rayons and cities of the oblast, and milk--in 12. By 1 January 1994 in the oblast there were 7,022 peasant (farmer-run) farms with an overall area of land granted to them of 409,600 hectares (an average of 58.3 hectares per farm). The re-registration of the sovkhozes and kolkhozes is continuing. During the year 259 farms were re-registered, of which only 29 (11.2 percent) retained their status. The scale of rural construction continued to decrease in 1993. The volume of capital investments in the development of the agro-industrial complex was R72 billion and decreased as compared to 1992 by 27 percent. During the year facilities were introduced to accommodate 1,050 cattle, 140 hogs, and 400 sheep, and 79 kilometers of roads were built. The introduction of animal husbandry facilities, silage and haylage structures grain storage facilities, and roads decreased three- to fourfold as compared to last year. Capital construction. Only one-fourth of all the startup facilities and capacities were introduced. Facilities were not introduced at plants of the processing branches, nor were capacities for producing consumer goods, machine-building and metallurgy facilities, or water and air purification facilities at many industrial enterprises. The startup of fixed capital amounted to R200 billion. During the year R518 billion was invested in the economy. This is 20 percent less than in 1992 and almost 50 percent less as compared to 1989 or 1990. Expenditures of state enterprises and organizations in the overall volume of capital investments amounted to R205 billion (40 percent) and R303 billion (58 percent) came from joint-stock companies and limited liability partnerships. Internal capital of enterprises and organizations made up 70 percent of the overall volume of capital investments. Enterprises and organizations with all forms of ownership assimilated R154 billion in centralized capital investments during the year (30 percent of all the funds), including from the republic budget--R52 billion and the local budget--R79 billion. The proportion of capital investments in production construction amounted to 58 percent and nonproduction construction--42 percent. The process of destatization accelerated in the construction complex. The greatest development was in mixed and private forms of ownership. Of the overall volume of contracting work performed, 57 percent was performed by organizations with the mixed form of ownership, 29 percent--by organizations with a private form of ownership, and only 14 percent--by state organizations. During the year construction organizations with all forms of ownership performed contracting work for a total of R350 billion. A total of R216 billion in capital investments or 42 percent of the overall volume went for the construction of facilities in the social sphere. Almost two-thirds of these funds was used for housing construction. Residential buildings with an overall area of 980,000 square meters were put into operation. New apartments were assigned to 16,600 families. As compared to 1992 the startup of housing decreased by 15 percent and as compared to the average annual startup during the period of 1986-1990--by 40 percent. The scale of housing construction in the oblast dropped to the level of the beginning of the 1950's. Funds belonging to the population of the oblast were used for the introduction of 66,000 square meters of residential space, or 7 percent of the overall amount introduced. Of this area 26,000 square meters were constructed by housing construction cooperatives and 502 buildings with 40,000 square meters--by individual builders. For military servicemen in the oblast, 529 new apartments with 29,000 square meters were introduced. For rural residents, 152,000 square meters of dwelling space was introduced, which was 31,000 less than during the previous year. The following were introduced in the oblast during the year: 20 general educational schools to accommodate 9,836 children, 10 preschool institutions to accommodate 1,370, and 4 polyclinics capable of handling 590 visits [per shift], 36.7 km of running water lines, 6.6 km of sewage lines, 186.4 km of gas lines, and 20 km of heating networks. Of these, the following were introduced in rural areas: 20 schools to accommodate 2,340 children, 5 preschool institutions to accommodate 470, and 2 polyclinics capable of handling 140 visits, 26.5 km of running water lines, 170 km of gas lines, and 15.5 km of heating networks. A total of R16 billion was used for measures to clean up after radioactive pollution in the oblast. These funds were used to introduce for the population of the regions that suffered from this residential buildings with an overall area of 42,000 square meters, schools to accommodate 120 children, a kindergarten to accommodate 140, and a polyclinic capable of handling 100 visits. In 1993, R4.2 billion in capital investments was used for building the Chelyabinsk subway and construction and installation work valued at a total of R2.5 billion was performed. Transportation and communications. The volumes of freight shipments decreased on all kinds of transportation. In 1993 as compared to 1992 shipment of freight by rail transportation decreased by 20 percent, and by automotive and air transportation, by 47 and 45 percent, respectively. Most of the passenger transportation was conducted by municipal automotive transportation enterprises. In 1993 buses transported 508 million passengers, or 90 percent of the number in 1992. Transportation service for the population is not improving. During 1993 in Chelyabinsk alone up to 12 percent of the bus trips on city routes and 6 percent of the trolley trips were not made. On rail transportation during the year 735 passenger trains (3.3 percent) arrived late and the average time of delay was 1.6 hours. On domestic airlines the arrival time of every fourth flight into the Chelyabinsk airport was in violation of the schedule. During 1993 communications enterprises rendered the national economy and the population services in a volume of R27 billion, which is more than 10 times more than last year. The rates for communications services increased 10.8-fold as compared to 1992. There was a considerable reduction of the delivery of newspapers and magazines--by 52.7 percent, letters, cards, and printed material--34.2 percent, and money transfers--39.1 percent. More than 4 percent of letters arrive late. Postal dispatches are lost and stolen. During 1993, 35 cases of loss and theft valued at R25,300 were registered. The quality of the work of telephone communications remains poor. FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS During the year R487 billion worth of products were delivered for export, of which R211 billion (43 percent) were delivered for freely convertible currency. The greatest volume of exports was from ferrous metallurgy enterprises--76 percent or R369 billion, and machine building--11.5 percent or R56 billion. The proportion of exports of raw and processed materials was 91.8 percent, and machines and equipment--3.9 percent. We exported 4.1 million tonnes of ferrous metals, 5,276 tonnes of nickel, 10,000 tonnes of zinc, 421 bulldozers, 962 motor vehicles, and other products. Enterprise accounts received from exporting products and services $392 million or 92 percent of the overall foreign currency revenues.
