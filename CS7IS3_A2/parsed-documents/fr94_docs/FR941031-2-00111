For the primary airports, the main sources of the discretionary funds are the ``capacity, safety, security, noise (CSSN)'' set aside and the remaining discretionary. For reliever airports, the source is the 5 percent ``reliever'' set aside. In the first 5 years of administering the LOI component of the AIP, the overall level of the AIP increased from $1.2687 billion in FY 1988 to $1.9 billion in FY 1992, and then decreased to $1.8 billion in FY 1993, $1.69 billion in FY 1994, and $1.45 billion in FY 1995. The amount of CSSN and remaining discretionary likewise increased from $205.1 million to $524.8 million in FY 1992, and decreased to $299.9 million in FY 1993 but has now stabilized at $325 million annually in current legislation. During these years, the FAA initially established an administrative policy that no more than 50 percent of the available CSSN discretionary would be committed to LOI's. In FY 1992, this policy was amended to include both CSSN and remaining discretionary. The FAA worked closely with airport sponsors to develop work programs and LOI payout schedules which maintained the 50 percent rule. We expect to maintain this policy. Reliever LOI's were not routinely used as a funding vehicle since most reliever sponsors cannot ``up front'' the construction costs. The convergence of growing demand and reduced availability of AIP discretionary funds dictates a new strategy for approval of LOI's. For the foreseeable future, the overall level of the AIP may not increase. This is primarily the result of budgetary pressures. Secondly, the amount of available discretionary funds has diminished from the level available in FY 1992 to the current level of no less than $325 million annually. Against this discretionary level, numerous airport sponsors are requesting LOI's for many important projects. The FAA, therefore, has developed this policy to consider competing LOI requests.
