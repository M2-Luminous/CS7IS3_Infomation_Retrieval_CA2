FR940826-0-00025 FR940826-0-00010 There are an estimated 10,000 importers who are presently subject to rules and regulations issued pursuant to the Cotton Research and Promotion Order 7 U.S.C. 2101&hyph;2118. This rule will affect importers of cotton and products containing cotton. The majority of these importers are small businesses under the criteria established by the Small Business Administration. This rule will help ensure the uninterrupted collection of assessments on products already subject to assessment. Economic Impact The AMS Administrator has determined that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). Paperwork Reduction Act In compliance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations (5 CFR part 1320) which implement the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) the information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in this subpart have been previously approved by OMB and assigned control number 0581&hyph;0093. Background In July of 1992, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) finalized rules and regulations for the authority to collect assessments on cotton and cotton-containing products as authorized in the 1990 Farm Bill. In order to designate specific imported products subject to assessment, AMS published, within the implementing regulations, a table of approximately 700 HTS numbers and individual assessment rates for each. Collections began on August 1, 1992. Soon after, the Department of Commerce changed certain HTS numbers that USDA had identified as subject to the assessment. During the first 17 months of import assessments, AMS has found that the Department of Commerce may revise HTS numbers as a result of presidential proclamation, congressional actions, statistical tracking requirements, etc. Often, these changed numbers are merely replacements of previous numbers and have no impact on the physical properties, description or cotton content of the product it represents. The U.S. Customs Service informed USDA prior to the publishing of this rule that several HTS numbers listed in the Import Assessment Table contained in 7 CFR 1205.510 would no longer be valid as of January 1, 1994, because of recent statistical changes made by the Department of Commerce. These statistical changes to the HTS numbers were made for reasons associated with the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In order to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported products containing cotton, HTS numbers listed in the Assessment Table in 7 CFR 1205.510 must correspond to numbers listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. USDA has found that frequent rulemaking is necessary in order to maintain an up-to-date list of HTS numbers in the regulations which provide the U.S. Customs Service the authority to collect cotton research and promotion assessments on imported cotton and products containing cotton. Changes made to HTS numbers during calendar year 1993 have resulted in reduced collections by U.S. Customs under the import assessment program averaging over $30,000 per month. USDA has reason to believe that changes in HTS numbering and the resulting impact on the Cotton Research and Promotion Program will continue. U.S. international trade agreements such as NAFTA, GATT, and changes in most favored nation trading status for certain textile producing countries will, according to the U.S. Customs Service, generate changes in HTS headings on a continuing basis. The Cotton Research and Promotion Program would in this environment experience an unpredictable loss of revenue. With the number and frequency of HTS number changes USDA expects, updating the list of HTS numbers through rulemaking is an impractical solution to minimizing interruptions in assessment collections. Therefore, this rule provides for the continued collection of assessments when HTS numbers are changed so long as such changes have no impact on the physical properties, description, or cotton content of the products involved. It is important to note that Commerce does renumber HTS headings where an actual change in the product occurs. This rule would not address this type of renumbering. USDA will continue to suspend assessments in these situations until the cotton content and a revised assessment rate could be determined and the assessment table revised. Based on discussions with importers and U.S. Customs Service officials, USDA has determined that the import community supports continuing to pay assessments on products when numbers have changed but the product remains the same. In fact, suspending collections on HTS headings that undergo mere renumbering is causing confusion for importers and Customs. Customs officials have informed USDA that they can program their automated computer collection system to continue collecting assessments when HTS headings undergo renumbering. On July 1, 1994, at 59 FR 33901, AMS published an interim final rule amending 7 CFR Part 1205 to allow for the continuation of collections on renumbered imported cotton-containing products as long as no change in the product's Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) description occurs. The rule was published with a request for comments to be submitted by August 1, 1994. AMS received no comments pertaining to the interim final during the specified comment period. Therefore, this rule adopts the interim final rule without change.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 1205 is amended as follows: PART 1205_COTTON RESEARCH AND PROMOTION Accordingly, the interim final rule amending 7 CFR part 1205 which was published at 59 FR 33901 on July 1, 1994, is adopted without change.
