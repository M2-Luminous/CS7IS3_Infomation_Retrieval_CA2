He described Egyptian-Algerian relations as solid, adding that an extensive program for joint bilateral cooperation has been in force for years, the most prominent result of which was the official visit to Cairo by Ali Kafi, then head of the Higher State Council, and his meeting with President Mubarak. In an exclusive interview with a MENA correspondent in Tunis, Dembri noted a constant political dialogue between Egypt and Algeria to outline the main features of the two countries' common fate and the difficulties facing each country, adding that the circumstances each country is going through require constant rapprochement and closeness. In the interview with MENA on the sidelines of the recent meeting of the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] foreign ministers in Tunis, Dembri stressed that there is constant coordination and information exchange between the Egyptian and Algerian security authorities to determine ways to confront terrorism and extremism. He emphasized facing the conspiracies to which the two states are subjected as model states in the Arab world. He noted that the two must coordinate to protect their political position in the Arab world, since the stability of each country means the stability of the other Arab countries. On the identity of the forces that are trying to shake up security and stability in Egypt and Algeria, Dembri said: Particular foreign quarters are plotting together against Egypt and Algeria and the responsible authorities in both countries have accurate information about them. Dembri stressed that the policy of new Algerian President Liamine Zeroual seeks to achieve national accord among all Algerian forces and parties and to bring together all Algerians within a unified and prosperous community. He added that the dialogue the Algerian authority is holding with various Algerian forces is open to all sincere citizens without exception, representing the political structure of the dialogue and the building of an Algerian society that combines all its sons. The only exception, he added, is the exclusion of all signs of violence and armed extremism. He emphasized that the dialogue is open to all political forces in Algeria that reject violence as a means to achieve or stay in power. Dembri noted that he agreed with his Moroccan counterpart and the secretary of the Libyan Committee for Unity during the recent AMU meetings in Tunis to hold meetings on a ministerial level to resolve the existing differences between Algeria and Morocco over the Sahara and those between Algeria and Libya. He said a working plan was established to overcome the difficulties. Dembri noted that Algeria is now holding negotiations with the international financial and monetary institutions to implement a plan to build a new Algerian economy, an open, market economy, that could help to overcome the current and the expected difficulties.
