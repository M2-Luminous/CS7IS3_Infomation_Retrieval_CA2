The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, "Japan cannot agree to such an idea while they neglect to do what they should do and are trying to wrench something from Japan." U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and EU Commissioner in charge of External Economic Affairs Leon Brittan have called for the opening of negotiations with their counterparts in Japan and Canada on market access issues. The official, however, said, "it is another thing if they are willing to really seriously discuss trade rules."
