The Lisac elevation had been under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] control until yesterday. In contrast to the Croatian fighters, who tried to carry out yet another attack in the zone under the UN protection -- which was thwarted -- the members of the Serbian army of Krajina did not suffer any casualties in the counterattack. The violation of the cease-fire agreement by the Croatian Army is again taking place in Lika, mainly around Teslingrad and Plasko, where they used infantry weapons. Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina, sent greetings to the wounded on 5 March, the day of the wounded of the latest war. Our care for the wounded is permanent. No one should forget you, the Krajina president said. The meeting with the wounded was organized by the people working for the Captain Dragan Fund.
