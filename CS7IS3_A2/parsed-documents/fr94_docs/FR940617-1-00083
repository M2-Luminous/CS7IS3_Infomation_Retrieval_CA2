FR940617-1-00083 FR940617-1-00012 In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency concluded that cloflucarban and triclocarban are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, surgical hand scrub, and health-care personnel handwash. The Panel reviewed safety and effectiveness data on these ingredients formulated as a bar soap and classified them in Category III as a health-care personnel handwash when formulated as a bar soap (39 FR 33103 at 33124 and 33126). No safety and effectiveness data for the use of clofucarban in the other health-care antiseptic drug product classes were submitted to the OTC drug review; no data were reviewed by the Panel; and no data were received by the agency. Cloflucarban is therefore considered to be outside this monograph except as a health-care personnel handwash (formulated as a bar soap). Accordingly, cloflucarban remains Category II as a health-care antiseptic for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation and surgical scrub and Category III as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash. Additional safety data and information were submitted to the agency on triclocarban formulated as a soap. As discussed in the segment of this rulemaking covering first aid antiseptics (56 FR 33644 at 33664), the agency has reviewed a chronic toxicity study and other information and determined that triclocarban can be recognized as safe for OTC daily topical use in a concentration of 1.5 percent. However, no effectiveness data were submitted for any health-care antiseptic uses of this ingredient and the agency is classifying triclocarban in Category III as an antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub. In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency placed the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban in Category III (43 FR 1210 at 1230) to be ``used in antimicrobial soap *␣*␣*''. No additional data were submitted on this combination. Therefore, the combination of cloflucarban and triclocarban remains in Category III for antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash uses. Based upon the Panel's recommendations on phenol, in the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified phenol less than 1.5 percent as Category III and phenol greater than 1.5 percent as Category II for use as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub (43 FR 1227 and 1229). Hexylresorcinol was also classified in Category III for these uses in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1229). No additional data were submitted on health-care antiseptic uses of phenol and hexylresorcinol and their classifications are unchanged in this amended tentative final monograph. In the previous tentative final monograph, the agency classified triple dye (a combination of gentian violet, brilliant green, and proflavine hemisulfate) in Category II as a health-care personnel handwash, patient preoperative skin preparation, and surgical hand scrub based on a lack of safety data (43 FR 1239). No additional data have been submitted and the ingredient remains in Category II for health-care antiseptic uses. In comment 85 of the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1223), the agency deferred classification of several ingredients to the Miscellaneous External Panel. All of the ingredients have been classified with the exception of methyl alcohol and gentian violet 1 and 2 percent solutions. The Miscellaneous External Panel at its 38th meeting placed methyl alcohol in Category II as an OTC topical antimicrobial ingredient for both safety and effectiveness (Ref. 1). However, this classification was not included in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for OTC alcohol drug products. The agency agrees with this classification. Further, the agency is not aware of any use of methyl alcohol in OTC drug products, except as a denaturant. Gentian violet was reviewed by the Advisory Review Panel on OTC Oral Cavity Drug Products and placed in Category III based on the lack of effectiveness data for use as a topical antimicrobial on the mucous membranes of the mouth. The agency is not aware of any data on the use of gentian violet as a health-care antiseptic and places this ingredient in Category III for this use.
