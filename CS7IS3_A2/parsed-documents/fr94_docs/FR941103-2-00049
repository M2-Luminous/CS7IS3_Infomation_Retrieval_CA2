The application period for crude oil overcharge refunds ended on June 30, 1994. As we discussed in King Petroleum, Inc. , Case No. LEF&hyph;0125, August 8, 1994 (Proposed Decision and Order), we will not hold a separate refund proceeding for monies that become available for direct restitution after the June 30, 1994 closing date. 59 Fed. Reg. 41755 (August 15, 1994). Therefore, the funds in this case ($1,196) will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool for direct restitution to those applicants who applied by the June 30, 1994 deadline.
