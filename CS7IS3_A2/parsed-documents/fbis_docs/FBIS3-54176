He added that this outcome will reflect on the overall Middle East peace process as well as on Syrian-U.S. ties. Kuriyah went on to say that the outcome of the summit will also pave the way for the resumption of the peace talks on the basis of the land for peace principle and UN Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. High-level Syrian sources have informed AL-ITTIHAD that the next few days will witness intensive meetings in Damascus. The meeting due to be held between Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi today is expected to be followed by a visit to the Syrian capital by King Husayn of Jordan, the sources added. In response to a question by AL-ITTIHAD on the Syrian position regarding the U.S. proposal to deploy U.S. troops on the Golan, the sources said that this position is contingent on Israeli's acceptance to withdraw from all occupied Syrian territory.
