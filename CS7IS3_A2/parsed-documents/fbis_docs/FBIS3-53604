Contrary to some analysts, we wrote that this visit would exert a positive effect on the trend of Middle East talks, similar to the previous visits. The previous visit by Christopher culminated in the signing of the accord between Rabin and 'Arafat on autonomy for Gaza and Jericho. The latest visit resulted in setting up a meeting between the presidents of the United States and Syria, Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad, in Geneva. The two presidents are expected to meet in Geneva at the end of January to exchange views on the Middle East peace talks, which have been described as a turning point in the Middle East. This meeting comes at a time of stalemate in the Middle East talks. 'Arafat's opponents -- who are being supported by Syria and by the Government of Lebanon and Hizballah who are involved in this conflict -- have not yet shown any inclination to compromise. In view of the current situation, if the meeting between the heads of the United States and Syria takes place and is successful, it could be considered a turning point in the Middle East, because we would then witness some changes in the region. Syria and its President wish to be considered the leaders of the Arab world and to have the key to peace or opposition to Israel in their hands. One of the reasons for Damascus' opposition to the Rabin-'Arafat accord is the fact that Syria was forestalled by 'Arafat, who shook hands with Rabin before Syria could. If the covert talks between Syria and Israel that have been going on bear fruit, Damascus will have taken the control of the key to peace and Lebanon may follow their lead. If the United States now grants some privileges to Syria and remove it from its list of supporters of terrorism, it will be merely because Washington and Tel Aviv are seeking to attract Damascus into the coterie of the peace proponents along with other opponents of 'Arafat, including Lebanon. That is why the 'Arafat-Rabin talks are taking place. At present Syria is the most important supporter of the opponents of 'Arafat and the PLO-Israel accord. The convocation of the 10-member Palestinian group in Damascus marks the resumption of the opponents' activities. Similarly, the Lebanese Government, which has problems with Israel over its southern border, is following Syria's policy. In the event Syria joins the peace trend, the groups opposing 'Arafat as well as Lebanon will be forced to resolve their problems with the Zionists and to halt their opposition. Syria wants the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which have been occupied by the Zionists since the 1967 six-day Arab-Israel war, after which they were annexed by the Zionist regime with the endorsement of their parliament. Israel has given some guarantees to Syria in this regard, but Syria needs the United States to intervene and endorse these guarantees; that is why Hafiz al-Asad and Clinton are going to meet and exchange views. If Hafiz al-Asad can obtain sufficient guarantees from Clinton in Geneva, he will certainly join the peace trend without doubt. In that case, the old Camp David scenario will be implemented in full, and the problem of the Middle East and Palestine will be completely resolved, in the opinion of the United States. Of course, suppression of the Hizballah and the Islamic movements will be the next stage; and at that juncture, the governments of Syria and Lebanon will have conflicting stances.
