In this speech, the President referred to the past and also spoke about the future. He did not bother about the present. Perhaps, Clinton did so because the present is very temporary while the future is everlasting. According to the provisions of the U.S. Constitution, the president must give the State of the Union speech every year. George Washington and John Adams used to come personally to the Congress to deliver their speech. Their successors used to send their written speech to the Congress and these were read out. This practice continued for almost 100 years. Later, during the rule of President Wilson and President Franklin, the previous practice of the president coming to the Congress to deliver his State of the Union speech started again. This system is continuing till today. The State of the Union speech is very important as it focuses on issues relating to the domestic and foreign policies of the United States. President Clinton has also referred to both domestic issues and foreign policy matters in his speech. He dwelt at length on the steps taken by his administration during the past year and also elaborated on the plans of his government for the current year. The President did not make any attempts to hide his failures. This distinguishes a leader of a developed country from those of the developing countries. Referring to his election pledges, the President said that a pragmatic budget was formulated last year with a view to bringing economic discipline to the country. He also referred to the signing of the NAFTA and GATT accords. President Clinton categorically stated that no compromise with national interests have been made in any sector. He claimed that the number of job opportunities created by his government over the past year exceeded those created in the previous four years. The President also gave an outline of the programs taken up by his government for the year 1994. He said the new programs are aimed at creating more job opportunities, improving health care facilities, curbing the crime rate, and preventing drug abuse. The President further stated that expenditures in over 300 programs will be curtailed and 100 domestic projects will be ended in order to develop the economy. He, however, stated that there will be no reduction in the military budget and added that the efficiency of the armed forces will remain unchanged so that they can face any situation. Dwelling on foreign policy, the President said that the United States would continue to extend its assistance for the cause of democracy and the protection of human rights. He also stated that U.S. support for economic reforms in Russia will continue. But he did not elaborate on whether any emergency assistance will be provided to Russia. It may be mentioned that the Second World War did not only lead to the downfall of German fascism, but also shattered the economy of several European countries. According to some historians, the Second World War was won by Britain, but it lost its colonies. Similar was the fate suffered by the Dutch, the Portuguese, and the French, who also lost their empires. After the war, the Indian subcontinent also became independent. Mandatory Western rule came to an end in several countries of the Middle East and an armed struggle was launched in Africa to overthrow the white rule. After the Second World War, the Europeans did not have the power to hold on to their colonies. Their condition was precarious. As a result, Churchill lost the elections held in his country. At that time only the United States was unaffected by the war and it earned a lot of money by selling arms. After the war, the United States under the "Marshall Aid" program funneled huge assistance to Europe and helped the war ravaged countries rebuild themselves. Though the former Soviet Union was the worst affected by the war, it did not receive any assistance. During the war it had to fight to protect every inch of land in Leningrad and Stalingrad. At the end Stalin himself took over the command of the army and was able to change the course of the war by his wisdom, farsightedness, and military strategy. Later, some scholars opined that Stalin committed some blunders and said that the present day Russia is the outcome. Massive assistance is needed for the development of the Russia. President Clinton has admitted this, but he has not given any hint regarding "Marshall Aid" to Russia. We should not emulate everything which takes place in the United States. But the modern world is so small that it is very difficult to keep our eyes shut. We have to import everything -- not only the design of bridges and roads, but also fashion. If we look closely it could be observed that we import more bad things in comparison to the good ones. It is difficult to say whether we will be able to learn some good lessons from the State of the Union speech made by President Clinton. While dwelling on the programs of his government, President Clinton did not criticize former governments. He has only stated what he has done and what he intends to do. His speech also reflected the priority given by him to the interests of his nation. He has given emphasis on the creation of more job opportunities, curtailing expenditure, and preventing misuse of funds. The President also did not hesitate to tell his countrymen that there is no alternative to hard work for the development of the country. There is nothing new in what he has said. Everybody knows that hard work is the key to progress. The leaders of the Third World countries are also aware of it. We have seen that the GATT talks were about to fail due to the conflicting interests of different countries, including the United States, France, and Italy. In spite of this, however, none of the negotiators sacrificed the interests of their respective countries. They did so because employment opportunities will shrink if they fail to develop trade and industry. It may be said that creation of employment opportunities is the most important yardstick for measuring the success or failure of a government. The full text of the State of the Union speech by President Clinton has not been published in any newspaper of our country. There is a lot to learn from portion of his speech which has been published. But, will we learn any lessons from his speech?
