"Peace is in contradiction with the very nature of this usurper regime," he added. Referring to the massacre of the palestinian worshippers in al-Khalil [Hebron], Ruhani regretted that some elements who consider themselves as the representatives of the Palestinian nation fell into humiliation by signing compromising deals, and in fact committed treason against the holy Palestinian ideal.

He noted that Iran and Syria are targets of the propaganda attacks by the global arrogance led by the U.S. due to their independent and anti-Zionist stances.

Expressing pleasure with the level of Tehran-Damascus cooperation, President al-Asad expressed hope that he would visit Iran in a near future.
