Addressing the '94 China Summit, the state councillor said 15 years of reform and opening to the outside world have anchored the national economy on a fast-expansion track. As the world's last big market, China now holds great appeal for foreign investors. From 1979 to 1993 China approved 174,000 joint ventures, which absorbed actual foreign capital totaling 63.9 billion U.S. dollars. In 1993 alone, foreign funds utilized by China amounted to 25.7 billion U.S. dollars. Li said that China has in recent years put more stress on exchanges and co-operation in the opening-up drive, and encouraged competent domestic enterprises to invest overseas. By 1993 China had launched 4,497 firms in 120 countries and regions, with 5.16 billion U.S. dollars in investment. Li said that reform and opening conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and contribute to world peace, stability and development as well. "China will continue the reform and opening up process in the years to come," said Li. Li, who is also the minister in charge of the State Commission on Restructuring the Economy, said that since 1992 China's reform has centered around building up a socialist market economy in unprecedentedly big strides in the reform and opening-up policies. He briefed the participants at the summit on China's reform blueprint and economic development strategy. He said China will open up further to merge with the world economy. It will establish a transparent foreign trade system and actively participate in international competition and co-operation. In pushing ahead with foreign trade reform, Li said, China will give more autonomy to foreign trade companies and set up a new import mechanism which will gradually allow the auctioning of and public bidding for import quotas and permits.
