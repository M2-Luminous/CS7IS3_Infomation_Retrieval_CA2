[Zherebenkov] The State Duma has passed at a second reading the draft law on the federal budget for the current year, submitted by the government, with account taken of amendments added by the Duma's budget committee and the creation of special extrabudgetary funds for defense. The draft law was passed by a very narrow margin. A number of factions, including Russia's Choice and Yabloko, abstained from the vote. This is how Russia's Choice leader Yegor Gaydar explained his faction's position. [Begin Gaydar recording] Russia's Choice believes that many of the budget committee's amendments make sense. Happily they included a number of Russia's Choice amendments. At the same time, the version submitted still contains a number of items that we find categorically unacceptable. We draw attention to the very idea of creating an extrabudgetary fund to finance defense at the expense of privatization, which is obviously a fraud, because any person with common sense knows very well that Russia will not be able to obtain this money earmarked for defense out of privatization in 1994. We are categorically opposed to the fact that a system of transfers that continues to subsidize the south at the expense of the north has been retained in the budget. We believe that the agreement on managerial expenditure was inadequate. We draw attention to the fact that our amendments to cut outlay on agriculture, in particular on subsidies and central investments and to redistribute expenditure on the needs of education, science, and culture were not accepted. That is why the faction decided to abstain. [end recording]
