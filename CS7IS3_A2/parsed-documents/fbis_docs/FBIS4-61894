This kind of statement by the Russian Defense Minister can be classified as a direct threat to Estonian independence and sovereignty. Within the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations, Russia has made a commitment to withdraw its troops from Estonia, without any connection to any other issue. The August 31, 1994 date was offered by Russia itself. Likewise, Russia has no basis for tying the withdrawal of troops from Estonia to the withdrawal of troops from Latvia and Lithuania. I hope that this statement by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev represents his personal opinion and not Russia's official position. In this connection, I have directed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request an explanation from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the hopes that Russia's Foreign Ministry will refute Defense Minister Pavel Grachev's irresponsible and tension producing statement.
