Arriving in Miami, an immigration department agent--after looking through the passenger's passport and consulting the computer--asked him to wait, ordered a [member of] customs personnel to bring his suitcases and invited him to a nearby office. The visitor, somewhat alarmed, asked: "What is wrong?" The customs official explained: "Your name coincides with that of another person who appears on the screen. Moreover, he is your age--the customs official complicated matters even more so--and he is registered as a drug trafficker." The foreign visitor indignant, surprised, and desperate protested: "That cannot be." He complained: "I was president of the republic and fought drug trafficking with the U.S. Government's cooperation. Let me phone the U.S. ambassador in my country." The former president managed to get through: "Ambassador, I am being delayed here in Miami because the computer registers a drug trafficker with my name." He explained his problem sounding rather terrified. The ambassador confirms: "Yes, they have informed me that your name appears in the computer. It is a computer problem." The ambassador promises to do his best, saying: "We will resolve the problem." It is said that finally after 40 minutes, or after some 90 minutes according to more exaggerated witness reports, the former president was able to comply with the immigration red tape and visit the United States under the uneasy impression that the incident, caused by who knows what, was a warning. This anecdote is an example of the political language of "demonstrations," like military maneuvers, street demonstrations, cabinet changes, retirements, etc., whose goals--which exceed their disclosed purposes--are uncovered, sometimes correctly and others erroneously, through analysis or speculation. The case of the former president delayed by an immigration agent reminds us of the unfulfilled promises General Andres Rodriguez--who perfectly fits the anti-hero in the anecdote--made to the U.S. Government about handing over the protectors of drug trafficking and dismantling their infrastructure. If for the political process the transition meant building the legal framework of democracy to assure the free action of the political institutions and elect--based on these conditions--the first civilian president, for the U.S. Government it also meant eliminating the protection system for drug traffickers. The United States was especially concerned about this because the transition process was begun by a totally corrupt Armed Forces whose rebellious commander presided over the executive branch. The proposal to "dignify" the Armed Forces by the rebels was not restricted merely, under the terms of the U.S. aid for the new government, to prohibiting military men from engaging in partisan activities, eradicating illegal activities in general, and controlling the misuse and draining of state resources, but specifically to the handing over of those who protect traffickers. The concern was and is very logical. U.S. experts wonder if military men are capable of dignifying the Armed Forces. Who will cast the first stone? Who is clean enough of any charges, of any links, or of protecting anyone to cast the first stone? More than four years of transition government have elapsed and the strategists received the expected answer: The process to dignify the Armed Forces failed--we have the disastrous example of Colonel Gonzalez Rojas, or the replacement of General Bernal who at the time was defense minister, or the dismantling of the Antinarcotics Secretariat's leadership which greatly upset the United States; Rodriguez was supposed to have cast the first stone, but did not, he never did; and, finally, most of the members of the high command were and are trapped by links related to commitments and protection. The responsibility for throwing the great quantity of stones that should have been cast was transferred to [President Juan Carlos] Wasmosy. Yes, to a civilian government, but under the vertical domain regarding military issues of a very ambitious general. The situation remains unchanged: The process to dignify the Armed Forces continues in the hands of the Armed Forces, but the difference is that it now has the ludicrous facade of a civilian government. So, in view of the careful protection granted from high spheres to traffickers--detected and monitored by U.S. intelligence--it was decided to materialize a plan under which U.S. Southern Command servicemen based in Panama would build schools, water wells, health posts, and repair roads in San Pedro Department as "training for the shipment of construction material for future actions similar to the Persian Gulf War," as Ambassador Glassman explained on one occasion. Who says this project has concealed objectives? The message is clear and direct: One typical "demonstration" that the U.S. troops sometime use, when justified, is to carry out a "Persian Gulf-type" intervention in Paraguayan territory. Everyone understood the message of the "demonstration" of the military social actions. The less discreet commented that "there are concealed purposes," without understanding the opportuneness of the maneuver. "There are no concealed purposes and it will benefit the country," commented others with a sense of opportuneness, thus supporting the opportunity to pressure the protectors and allowing the Armed Forces to become dignified and overcome the dispute the opposition maintains with the ambitious general. For the first time most opposition legislators applauded the arrival of U.S. troops and were willing to grant them all the privileges and immunity requested, because they have interpreted the "demonstration." Undoubtedly some ambitious general assumed the role of protector, took it personally, and overcame Wasmosy's first impression that the South Command's offer was beneficial. So, on Wednesday, 2 February, a letter of conditions was sent to Ambassador Glassman, which he was made to sign. According to the letter, the Paraguayan Army was to participate in the joint actions, that the cost of the project had to be clearly established--Congress having approved the project it should be noted that this plan affects the nation's sovereign rights--the operation zones must be restricted, the importation of weapons restricted, detailed information of the U.S. personnel to enter the country should be disclosed, and that it should be clearly established whom will be granted privileges and immunity. Wasmosy and his subordinates have again picked up the old yankee anti-imperialist wave. This never crossed Southern Command's mind. Glassman, taken aback by the offense, commented that "similar offers to other Latin American countries were never rejected." General Oviedo, as a champion of the national liberation, on Thursday, 3 February, asked journalists: "Do you think we would reject something that benefits the Armed Forces?" Military strategists read between lines: "The interests of the protectors?" The almost dramatic answer was: "We have withdrawn the draft bill, but beware the consequences." Watch out. That same evening a cable television channel showed a documentary on U.S. military operations in Panama when Noriega was arrested. Was that mere coincidence or another "demonstration?" One can expect anything if this relationship between the United States and the military leadership continues to be simply horrible. What other names and prospects will appear on the computer screens in the future?
