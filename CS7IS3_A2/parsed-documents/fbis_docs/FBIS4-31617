Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for the war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, assessed an overall one-month truce in Bosnia, which took effect on Friday noon (1000 GMT), as `the beginning of the end of the war.' Gen. Rose told the press in Sarajevo that thousands of peacekeepers would be deployed throughout Bosnia to monitor the four-week truce signed by representatives of warring sides in Geneva on Wednesday. Gen. Rose warned that a U.S. Congressional vote to unilaterally lift an arms embargo on Bosnian moslems, passed on Thursday, could undermine peace efforts. `I hope it does not raise false hope in people's minds. You know it has been an aspiration of the Bosnian Government. Their view that "give us the weapons and we'll finish the job" is fairly widespread, but my own view is that it takes a lot more than just being given equipment to win a war.' The U.N. Security Council in the Autumn of 1991 introduced an arms embargo for Bosnia-Herzegovina, in an effort to contribute to settling ethnic conflicts there. The Bosnian Moslems, strongly supported by Islamic countries, have for months called for their exemption from the arms embargo. UNPROFOR spokesman Eric Chaperon also on Friday in Sarajevo said that the intensity of fighting in Bosnia has not been on such a low level for over a year, as it was a few hours before the ceasefire took effect. Sporadic artillery fire was reported in northern and central Bosnia, but the intensity was half as strong as the previous day, Chaperon said. According to U.N. monitors reporting, there were only 80 artillery shells fired on Friday on the frontline between Gradacac and Ribnica in northern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, while the previous day 389 shells were fired in the same area.
