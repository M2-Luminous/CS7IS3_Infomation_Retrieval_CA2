Lawrence Clarkson, vice president of Boeing, made these remarks at a symposium on U.S.-China relations held by the Council on Foreign Relations. Clarkson said that "the American people would be better served if the divisive annual debate on MFN was avoided." "Bilateral issues between our countries should be addressed as they would be normally between two countries who share significant mutual interests," he noted. China is now the United States' 8th largest trading partner, and U.S. exports to China grew 17.36 percent in 1993 to 8.7 billion U.S. dollars. "U.S. exports to China in 1993 supported more than 167,000 U.S. jobs," Clarkson said. "China trade also creates thousands of jobs for U.S. retailers, wholesalers, and importers." He also said that during the next 15 years, China will need 800 commercial planes worth 40 billion dollars, making it the world's third largest aviation market. "Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are currently well positioned in the Chinese market," he pointed out. "But Airbus, Fokker and the Russians are waiting to quickly take advantage if the relationship between the United States and China deteriorates." Clarkson said the Boeing Company believes strongly that U.S. President Bill Clinton should extend MFN status for China and that Congress should support such a decision.
