FR940203-1-00005 FR940203-1-00002 In the second case, the individual's activities, i.e., performing repairs or cleaning, are performed during the course of employment with the licensee or a contractor to the licensee and the individuals' assigned duties do involve the potential for exposure to radiation. Although the individual may not enter a restricted area and, whether this worker's dose exceeds 100 mrem in a year or not, if the worker has the potential to receive some occupational exposure, training ``commensurate with potential radiological health protection problems present in the workplace'' is required to ensure informed consent and control of exposure. This training does not have to be extensive. The Commission believes that doses received by individual workers at a rate greater than the 1mSv (100 mrem) in a year public dose limit constitute a level of risk which requires training at least to a level which provides information on the risks of exposure and methods for reducing exposure in keeping with the ALARA principle. Prior to the promulgation of the revised standards, paragraph 20.409(b) of part 20 provided that whenever a licensee is required to report to the Commission any exposure of an identified individual worker or member of the public to radiation and/or radioactive material, the licensee must also notify that individual. 2 Although it was the intent of the Commission that this provision remain in 10 CFR part 20, the requirement was inadvertently omitted from the revised standards. Accordingly, §20.2205 is added to clearly restore to 10 CFR part 20 the intention that individual workers and individual members of the public are to be notified of exposures in excess of the dose limits that would require notifying the NRC. Under §20.2205, the licensees' obligation to notify an individual will be triggered if (and only if) the licensee's required report to NRC identifies that individual by name as having received an exposure to radiation and/or to radioactive material. The licensee's obligation to identify individuals in a required report to the NRC is as provided for in 10 CFR 20.2203. 2 See also 10 CFR 19.13(d) (When a licensee is required to report to the Commission any exposure of an individual to radiation or radioactive material, the licensee must also provide the individual a report on their exposure data.) Agreement States The proposed amendments would apply to all NRC licensees and Agreement States (Definitions in 10 CFR part 20 are Division I matters and are thus matters of compatibility). The proposed changes, with the exception of the addition of §20.2205 and the revision of the definition of unrestricted area, were discussed in June 1993 with Agreement State representatives and the changes discussed were strongly supported. Agreement States have the opportunity to comment further on all of the proposed changes during the public comment period. The Agreement States cannot be expected to modify their regulations before the January 1, 1994, date. Some States will need as much as 3 years to conform to the changes. In the interim, States may wish to consider alternative methods to address the issues presented in this rulemaking. A draft of the proposed amendments, with the exception of the addition of §20.2205 and the revision of the definition of unrestricted area, was provided to the Agreement States prior to submitting the amendments for publication in the Federal Register . Several States submitted comments. One State suggested limiting public doses to ``licensed'' sources of radiation while another observed that keeping this provision general permitted the States to control exposure from Naturally Occurring and Accelerator Produced Radioactive Material (NARM) as well as byproduct material. The proposed rule is general and does not specify licensed sources. This approach is consistent with the rule, as expressed in §20.1001 to control doses from all sources of radiation that are under the control of the licensee. Another State provided a revised definition of ``Member of the Public'' which would not rely on the definition of ``Occupational dose'' and would make clear that workers exposed to NARM are not members of the public. The intent here was to minimize the change to the definitions and still accomplish the needed clarifications of these issues. For that reason and because ``Occupational dose'' is defined as from ``licensed or unlicensed'' sources, this change is not made in the proposed rule. Two States argued that the draft language restricting the training requirements in 10 CFR 19.12 to individuals involved ``in licensed activities'' and ``in the licensee's facility'' was too restrictive, and might prevent workers such as housekeeping staff and security staff from receiving minimal, but needed training. The language of the training requirement is more inclusive in this proposed rule.
