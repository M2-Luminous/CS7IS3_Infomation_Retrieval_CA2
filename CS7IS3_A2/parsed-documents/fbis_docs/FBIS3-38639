Mr Rifkind -- who is in Sarajevo today for discussions with the United Nations' new hard-line commander, Britain's Lt-Gen Sir Michael Rose -- warned that use of airpower would send a powerful message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor. But Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC radio, was more cautious and said that more was involved than the "one day of satisfaction" that an air strike would create. He warned such action could intensify the siege of Sarajevo and halt aid convoys to the embattled Bosnian capital. However, he said events appeared to be moving toward a meeting of NATO to discuss the atrocities and decide how to react. Today, as the grim death toll from the mortar attack on a market place rose to 68, with hundreds wounded, Britain offered hospital beds for casualties. The Foreign Office said up to 10 wounded could be brought to Britain for treatment. In addition, a doctor and medical team are being sent to Kosevo Hospital in the Bosnian capital to help staff overwhelmed by the carnage there. The offer, made via the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, came as Mr Rifkind warned that "some response" to the outrage would be seriously considered by allied governments. Overseas Development Administration [ODA] surgeon Tony Redmond of Stoke-on-Trent Hospital, was flying out to Bosnia today with a team of paramedics. An ODA spokesman said Mr Redmond's team would not be involved in the medical evacuation but would be helping doctors at the hospital. Mr Rifkind, who spoke while en route to Sarajevo aboard an RAF Hercules, said the 16 NATO governments would discuss specific action but refused to say what form that might take. Any military response would have to involve punitive air strikes and would require the full support of the UN Security Council, where Russia is certain to put up strong objections. Another problem for the allies is in identifying which artillery unit was responsible for the slaughter. Failure to do so inhibits any direct retaliatory strike. In addition, the UN does not believe the marketplace was deliberately targeted and stresses that any of the numerous rounds fired at the city in recent weeks could have exacted an equally horrific price in human life. It has now emerged that the mortar round which caused the carnage had landed on a roof before spraying the marketplace with shrapnel. It has therefore proven difficult to calculate the trajectory and point of origin of the shell, although there is little doubt it came from a Bosnian Serb position. Mr Rifkind said the use of airpower would send a powerful message to the Serbs and create a "feel-good" factor but he also noted the possible impact on the UN's humanitarian efforts on the ground. Mr Hurd said mounting an air strike was not too difficult. What was more difficult was to work out what happens next. He said an air strike could actually prompt the Serbs to tighten their grip on Sarajevo but added: "There may well be ways in which force could be used in the area which would avoid these dangers." Mr Hurd said there were three British aims in Bosnia: to stop the war from spreading; to help the politicians negotiate a peace; and to help Bosnians of all three communities to stay alive by getting them food and fuel. "If the use of force can help with these aims, we should certainly be ready to consider it. I have been doing a lot of telephoning in the last 24 hours. There has been a great deal of discussion between the allies." Mr Rifkind's two-day fact-finding mission to Bosnia is part of the Government's detailed review of the UN operation. Britain and other countries contributing to the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) -- primarily France, Canada and Holland -- will decide next month whether these efforts should continue. While Washington has pressed hard for punitive air strikes, the Clinton administration accepts that Britain and other allies with troops on the ground must have a clear say in this. Britain believes it is crucial any military move should not obstruct the drive for peace by giving hope to any one of the three warring factions, primarily the Muslims. Elsewhere, Lord Owen, the EU peace negotiator, said that politicians must now be prepared to accept an imperfect peace in the former Yugoslavia. He told the BBC TV Breakfast with Frost programme it would be quite wrong to take UN forces out while winter continued. And the Labour leader John Smith demanded the creation of safe havens, backed by the implicit threat of force, as the only way to stop the "wanton slaughter." Sarajevo should be the first of these, he told Labour's Euro and local government conference in Glasgow.
