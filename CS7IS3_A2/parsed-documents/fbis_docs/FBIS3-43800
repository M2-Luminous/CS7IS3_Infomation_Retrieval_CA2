Troops are preventing the High Council of the Republic [HCR] from meeting. The HCR was to have started expanding itself, thereby turning itself into the transitional parliament. This goes against the views of President Mobutu, who announced on Friday evening that he was dissolving his government and fusing together the HCR and the National Assembly. Etienne Tshisekedi has come out against what he is calling a takeover by force. Etienne Tshisekedi is one of the main opponents of President Mobutu, and he is still prime minister of one of the two governments disputing the running of Zaire. These decisions are anti-constitutional, he says, and go against all the agreements that have been made. He has called on the international community not to allow itself to be misled.
