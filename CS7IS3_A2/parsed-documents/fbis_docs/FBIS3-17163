He said that experts on both sides would meet in Vilnius and Moscow next month to draw up agreements on travelling and customs procedures and on the transit of Russian vehicles and trains via Lithuania to Kaliningrad. However, no agreement on military transit is envisaged following Lithuania's plans to adopt a special government resolution or law on the transit of military or dangerous cargoes through the country's territory. It was agreed that Russian and Lithuanian experts would meet in May to discuss the issue. Agreement was also reached that the question of payment of foreign cash to Lithuanians holding accounts with the former USSR Vneshekonombank would be discussed at the level of experts. The Russian diplomat said that last November's trade and economic agreement easing trade barriers against Lithuania would be effective only after the package on Kaliningrad was signed. The next round of talks will be held in Vilnius late in April or early in May.
