However, Russia was not successful in its efforts to sell us artillery technology and armored vehicles. As far as armored vehicles are concerned, General Grachev was taken to witness a military drill of an armored unit to shatter any illusions he nurtured in this area. Nevertheless, Romania shows interest in purchasing air force equipment. Romania is counting on the McConnel Amendment to the draft federal budget of the United States for 1995, which represents the legal basis for loans and military assistance promised to our country by the United States when Romania joined the Partnership for Peace.
