Yesterday Foreign Minister Kooijmans spoke of a certain form of ultimatum after the success in Sarajevo. He was in favor of action in Mostar, a town where the population is being hard pressed by the Croats. This morning the Foreign Ministry spokesman said an ultimatum could be an instrument and the same strategy could be considered as in Sarajevo, but added that "the momentum of this moment" could be maintained by other measures as well, including the request for air support if the UN troops in Bosnia were unable to carry out their duties. This was approved by the Security Council last summer, and the NATO fighter aircraft have practised these duties. At the Defense Ministry there are quite strong objections to applying the Sarajevo model elsewhere in Bosnia. In every new action from the air, the danger air actions pose for the ground troops must be considered carefully, according to military experts at the ministry. Moreover the heavy means of air support undoubtedly would lead to an escalation in the violence, and the UN troops on the ground would in fact have to go into action out of self-defense. The United Nations wants 3,000 extra UN troops in Sarajevo to monitor the ultimatum. British troops have had to be partially withdrawn from Vitez for these duties. The British duties also include protecting the Belgian-Netherlands transport battalion and taking the lead in a possible evacuation.
