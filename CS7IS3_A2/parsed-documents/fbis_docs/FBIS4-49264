The press and publication sector plays the role of organizing spiritual production, synthesizing it into products, directing the products into circulation, and making sure they achieve the proper social and economic effects through the market and exchange. One key trait of press and publication work is the close and inseparable integration of spiritual and material production and social and economic effects, the process itself being subject to the laws of spiritual, as well as material, production. This fundamentally determines that the development of press and publication corresponds with reforms in economic structures and stages of economic development, and that it is identical with the requirements and progress of socialist spiritual civilization. Development and changes in press and publication are inevitably tied with development and changes in the socialist cause as a whole. 1. The Press and Publication Sector Faces Phased Changes. Our country's press and publication sector has developed rapidly over the last 10 years or so, along with the progress of reform and opening up. Statistics compiled by UNESCO show that China's publication has leaped to the world's forefront in scale and variety. Unprecedented development in the press and publication sector has profoundly influenced the spiritual state of our country and played an important role in promoting reform and opening up and economic construction. At the same time, the press and publication sector, and especially publication, is facing significant changes after decades of rapid development. In terms of stages of development, the press and publication sector is moving from a stage distinguished by actual increases in total volume to that distinguished by high quality and efficiency. In terms of means of management, the press and publication sector is moving away from detailed administrative-style management to law-guided and macroscopic management. In terms of structural reforms, the press and publication sector is changing from traditional nonprofit-making management into industrial management on its way toward a modern corporate system. Changes in these three directions are all difficult and complicated processes moving at different paces and with different focuses, while being all interconnected and mutually constrained and interacting. At the center of these three changes is the shift of the press and publication sector away from gross growth in volume to high quality and efficiency. Such a phased change is determined by the following two factors: First, the pursuit of the two civilizations is making higher demands on the press and publication sector, which cannot strengthen its power and intensity in serving the two civilizations without improving its quality and economic efficiency. Second, the press and publication industry would not be competitive enough to survive and develop if, now that they are facing the market, they did not improve quality and economic efficiency and rationalize their internal resources. This phased change in the press and publication sector, which has already happened and will continue in the future, has been basically in step with the entire reform and opening up and with the change in economic construction from total volume growth to rising economic returns in our country. The development of the press and publication sector has its own peculiarity and complications and is not identical with similar situations experienced in economic construction. But it is true that the two are, on the whole, similar to the extent that both are moving away from total volume growth toward high quality and efficiency. Strategically speaking, this phased change is further adjusting and strengthening the power of the press and publication sector in preparation for greater breakthroughs to come. We must be clearly aware of and value this ongoing change in the press and publication sector, and create conditions to promote it. There are wide-ranging problems and possibilities in the press and publication sector, and there are many things requiring our energy and attention. Overall and from a macroscopic point of view, this is a strategically significant matter. To achieve an even greater change from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency, the press and publication sector must, subjectively, make great effort and acquire the necessary objective conditions. The objective conditions we currently possess are: First, the general background for such an important change is there. In their "Decisions on Certain Problems Concerning the Creation of a Socialist Market Economic System," the central authorities specifically brought up the problems of overall balance, structural optimization, and healthy development; and in particular the fact that rural economic development should be characterized by "structural adjustment and raising economic returns." An increasingly popular economic concept over the last two years has been the "awareness of the quality of the national economy." There has been some change in the tendency to pay too much attention to economic rates at the expense of economic quality, to habitually expand the external scale instead of tapping into internal resources, and to neglect quality efficiency. The people, party, and state are all demanding quality, and they have designated a year as "quality year" and organized events such as a "long distance walk for quality." All these indicate that the general background for the change in economic construction from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency is in place, providing an excellent opportunity for promoting phased changes in the press and publication sector. Second, there is a general appreciation of the importance and urgency of improving the quality and efficiency of the press and publication sector. Society is calling for improvement in quality and an effort to overcome ordinariness and shoddiness and sweep away junk culture. The press and publication sector has realized the seriousness of the problem and is working to solve it. One key Marxist viewpoint is that when there is a general awareness of a problem, there are already a popular forum and objective conditions for solving this problem. Third, some units and localities have made some fruitful explorations in moving toward and adapting to the market, forming their own methods of operation and operating mechanisms, and have accumulated some experiences in raising quality and efficiency. Thanks to the effort of leading departments to champion the idea and the work of all the news workers and publishers, the change in the press and publication sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency is now underway. The only problem is that we have not explicitly characterized the change, much less declared and promoted it. However, the conditions described above are far from enough to effect a greater scope of change in the press and publication sector from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency. We need to make a greater and varied effort. Here we need directional guidance, the assurance of law, and a deepening of reform to find a way out; we need to employ more party and state power and coordinate it with market forces to put in place a management system and operating mechanism capable of being adjusted to socialist economic development, meeting the demands of the pursuit of spiritual civilization, and in line with the law of development in the press and publication sector. 2. Adhere to the Set Direction, Guide the Change, and Serve the People and Socialism With Higher Quality and Efficiency. There is a problem of direction as well a problem of ideological levels and cultural cultivation in trying to raise quality and efficiency. On the problem of political direction, the major thing in the current stage of politics in our country is upholding Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guiding thought, enforcing and carrying out the party's basic line, and pursuing socialism with Chinese characteristics. The most fundamental and important missions for the press and publication sector are to provide spiritual force, intellectual support, ideological guarantees, and a good climate of public opinion for achieving the party's general task and objectives. Convictions must not be shaken, the political line must not be disrupted, and stability and unity must not be undermined. There are many widely different tasks in serving the people and socialism, but upholding a correct political direction serves the people and socialism best. Only by sticking to a correct political direction from beginning to end can we raise the quality and efficiency of press and publication work in a better manner. If things go wrong in the political sphere, the resulting damage will be far greater than can be calculated in terms of losses in quality and efficiency. This year has seen the unveiling of the greatest number of reformist measures and reforms of the greatest intensity. Press and publication work must remain united, stable, and energetic, and maintain the policy of positive propaganda in order create a relaxed and harmonious environment for reform and opening up. On the problem of ideological uprightness and integrity, since the socialist press and publication sector is entrusted with the important task of training and fostering a new generation of idealistic, moral, and cultured socialists, it must offer the most advanced, beautiful, and healthiest ideological and cultural fruits. The development of reform and opening up and a market economy has brought us opportunity and vitality, but overseas influence and greed have also exposed some people to epicureanism, the cult of money, and extreme individualism. To further promote reform and opening up and resist erosion toward an unhealthy climate, the press and publication sector should provide more and better spiritual products and a much stronger spiritual force goading people to carry on the struggle. The broad mass of news and publishing workers have contributed much in this respect. However, a small number of units and individuals have put out publications advocating money worship, epicureanism, and extreme individualism for the sake of money. The lesson was profound. Regarding cultural cultivation, we link cultural cultivation with the problem of direction because without certain cultural cultivation, it is simply not possible to achieve either political or ideological orientation. The standards of published cultural products impact directly the attempt by the press and publication sector to raise its own status and dimension and improve the quality of our people. In this respect, it is extremely necessary to link standards of cultural cultivation with the problem of direction. In sum, the problem of direction for the press and publication sector is not a simple political slogan, but a synthesis of politics, ideology, integrity, and cultivation. And solving the problem of direction relies not only on the stance taken and becoming aware of it; an ability to combine different qualities and operations is needed. Solving the problem of direction requires us to handle well the relations between economic effects and social effects, between the main theme and its variations, between Marxist guidance and the absorption of as much of mankind's advanced ideological achievements as possible, and inheriting and developing the positive cultural elements in the national tradition, and between handling high-plane and sophisticated elitist things and popularization. Only when political direction, ideological orientation, and cultural cultivation are all upheld in dealing with all the above relations can we say the direction has genuinely been upheld. 3. Manage According to Law, Protect the Change, and Create an Environment of Fair Competition and Healthy Order for Achieving High Quality and Efficiency The effort to achieve phased changes in the press and publication sector under a new historical condition depends to a very large extent on a strengthened legal system and a law-guided management system. Through law-guided management, the protection of healthy forces, and curbing and cracking down on illegal behavior, conditions will be created for fair competition leading to the survival of the fittest, which will in turn create a healthy and orderly environment in which the press and publication sector can develop in a high-quality and efficient manner. Through law-guided management, concerned departments will be gradually relieved of microscopic management to concentrate on macromanagement. In a certain sense, a market economy is a law-guided economy. Under a planned economy, management on the press and publication sector is realized through direct management by leading party and government departments. As the socialist market economy unfolds, press and publication will evolve into common social activities, with the value of law facilitating or constraining ever more greatly their development, rendering pure party discipline and specific administrative-style management increasingly inadequate. Under a market economy, law-guided management will play an increasingly larger role. While there has been significant progress over these last few years in national and local legislation for press and publication, work in this area remains lagging far behind the real situation. This is because we do not have much experience to start with, and on the other hand, we need practice in legislation. From practice we can identify and shape our legislation work. We cannot impose in advance a legal framework on a developing and changing reality. At any rate, legislation lagging behind the objective reality has created much trouble and difficulty for us. The situation in the press and publication sector has showed time and time again the lack of law enforcement, a situation awaiting urgent rectification. 4. Deepen Reforms, Speed Up the Change, Move Closer To Creating an Operating Mechanism of High Quality and Efficiency. The main thrust of reforms in the press and publication sector over the last decade or so has been removing the sector from the dictates of the planned economy in advancing toward a socialist market economic system. Reforms in press and publication have unfolded along with the gestation, formation, and development of a socialist market economic system. In switching from the old to a new system, press and publication work will run into many new situations, problems, and contradictions. (1) Change further the operating mechanisms of publication units; nonprofitmaking units will be managed as an enterprise, moreover such enterprise-style management will be given a greater role later; operating mechanisms suited to the development of the socialist market economic system will be created in order to increase the adaptability, competitiveness, the self-development ability, and scientific management of the publication sector in a market economy. This is an important task for the publication sector in deepening reforms. Reforms in the publication sector must slowly put in place a corporate publication system. Units in need of state subsidies will be run as nonprofitmaking units, while the majority will be managed as enterprises, but both will need a corporate system, in which their responsibility will be strictly defined so that they will have powers as well as official duties; and discipline and law breakers will be severely punished and observers of law and duties vigorously supported. The switch of operating mechanisms in the publication sector should start with personnel, labor, and distribution as the points of breakthrough ushering in other reformist measures. Through reform in these three systems, an incentive mechanism will be formed in the publication sector prodding workers to explore and create. The establishment of press and publication groups is another exploration by some provinces and cities in press and publication reforms. Such groups help consolidate and expand the scale of production, concentrate all the energy on big projects, and go into market competition as a group. As such they will strengthen management and guide opinion. The experiment in such groups should take account of practical situations, work on the basis of voluntary participation by press and publication units and the management- ownership relationship, which will be one of mutual interests instead of administrative subordination. As conditions in localities vary, there cannot be uniformity. But as reforms in the press and publication sector deepen, there will emerge a number of various press and publication groups based on a management-ownership relation playing a greater role in promoting production structural adjustment and raising efficiency and quality. (2) On fostering and developing the book market system: At present, a great many contradictions in the publication sector are found in the distribution area, so reforms in the distribution system are the key to deepening publication reforms. Right now the most important thing is to enliven further distribution and create a market environment with fair competition so as to form a unified, open, orderly, and competitive national book market. The focus of reforms in the distribution system is on enlivening the operating mechanisms of XINHUA Bookstores. XINHUA Bookstores are the main channels of book distribution in our country and have made significant contributions over the last several decades. However, as reform and opening up deepened and the socialist market economic system developed, XINHUA Bookstores began to run into difficulties and face new problems, which they need to solve urgently through deepening reforms. Reforms in XINHUA Bookstores must proceed in three directions. One, the distribution agent experiment should be pursued to enliven the wholesale area and widen wholesale channels so that the main channels can play a real role in book circulation. Two, reforms are needed in the forms of purchases and sales, which allow different types of sales agents such as distributors, sales on consignment, and sales agents. Three, we should promote reforms in the management-ownership system of XINHUA Bookstores in order to enliven their operating mechanisms. Experiments in contracting, franchising, the joint-stock system, and nongovernmental management of government-owned units conducted by localities in recent years are all good pursuits to enliven grass- roots bookstores. We should actively promote cross-regional wholesale book markets and pay great attention to establishing wholesale markets in underdeveloped regions. At the same time, we must vigorously develop book sales networks. The distribution of newspapers and magazines, while supporting and perfecting this above-described main channel, should be allowed to pursue alternative channels of distribution. Management and guidance on individual-run distribution must be strengthened with the purpose of encouraging these individuals to maintain self-discipline through industrial associations and urging them to play an active role in enlivening book markets. (3) Strengthen and improve macromanagement. Strengthening and improving the macromanagement on press and publication administrations is an important issue in press and publication reforms. Under the new situation, press and publication administrations urgently need to change their management functions so that they may be relieved from busy and minor administrative affairs to concentrate their energy on macroregulation and control, and study intensively to deal with the new situation and solve new problems cropping up in the transition from the old to a new system. That way they can take new steps in theory, policies, rules and regulations, and systems, and ensure that press and publication reform progresses smoothly from the stage of total volume growth to that of high quality and efficiency. Strengthening theoretical study and exploring the law of development in the press and publication sector are an important link in the pursuit of strengthening management. With such important spiritual production as the press and publication sector and the complicated situation in the press and publication sector brought about by economic change, it will be very difficult to work without theoretical guidance, an strategic insight into the overall situation, and an ability to keep the overall situation under control. However, it is precisely in these aspects that we lack theoretical preparation. The absence of theoretical study in the management of the press and publication sector and its development, especially the law of development in the publication sector, and in the "opportunities" and "problems" brought to the press and publication sector by "development" and "reforms," has in fact affected and impeded our work. We must pay greater attention to investigations, studies, and theoretical work in order to improve our ability to analyze the situation and solve problems. We must step up investigations and studies on practical problems related to press and publication reforms. This can be done by making explorations and experiments under the guidance of theory, and continuously abstracting and elevating what we gained in exploration and practice to a theoretical level. The focus for macroregulation and control over press and publication work is coming to grips with: Orientation, total volume, structure, and economic returns. Under longstanding administrative management we have accumulated a lot of experience, but it will not be nearly enough under a socialist market economy. We need to learn to use economic and legal means and public opinion, especially legal means, in management in our effort to open a new dimension in macromanagement. (4) Rely on scientific and technological progress in promoting the development of the press and publication sector. As an key component in information industry, the press and publication sector must make a great effort to modernize the means of publication and business management. It must conduct technological transformation, speed up editing, type-setting, printing, and binding, and modernize management in order to raise the status of its products, labor productivity, management levels, quality, and economic returns. There should be different priorities in technological transformation. Emphasis must be placed on starting at high technological levels, and there must be determined efforts at combining technological development, imports, and transformation, with special emphasis on electronic technology, in order to solve key technological problems in the development of the press and publication sector. 5. Promote Prosperity, Realize the Change, and Provide Society With Rich, Varied, High-Quality, and High-Class Spiritual Products The effort to achieve the change from total volume growth to high quality and efficiency in the press and publication sector is ultimately aimed at prosperity, which is chiefly marked by a rough equilibrium between total supply by the press and publication sector and total demand by the people and social development, and an overall rationalized book and magazine structure. Prosperity means more than growth in volume; it requires also quality on a certain scale and at a certain level of volume. In promoting prosperity, we must focus on construction. Both administrative departments and news units must take construction as the point of departure and the basis. This is a long-term and arduous mission and must be pursued systematically. A long-term and general plan and a practical current work program are both needed, and we will pursue both of them in a down-to-earth fashion. Guiding thought on specific operations must be clear, with focuses highlighted and work objectives clearly defined, and there must be strong operability and clear effect forecasts. The Press the Publication Administration is implementing the Eighth Five-Year Plan and will begin drafting the Ninth Five-Year Plan. They are great events for spiritual production in our country and require all the nation's energy; not only that from the press and publication sector, but from the entire editors' and writers' force, or even the whole array of spiritual production. The working force remains the core problem in promoting prosperity. The key to prosperity and progress toward high quality and efficiency for the press and publication sector lies in its working force. The sector has its special requirements on its working force. They must all have special academic training and, moreover, integrity and a sophisticated state of mind. They must have the capability to work on spiritual production and to organize spiritual production, appreciate the fruits of domestic and foreign civilizations, and understand domestic and overseas markets. The key to building up a working force lies in the establishment of leadership groups, and one important problem in establishing leadership groups is clean government. On this we must work strictly according to relevant central decrees. The press and publication sector is an important sector in our country's spiritual civilization. Central leading comrades repeatedly stressed that work in this sector can only become increasingly important and play an increasingly greater role, and the sector can only be strengthened, not weakened. Given the situation, it is all the more necessary for us to heighten our sense of responsibility and mission and work cautiously and in a down-to-earth manner. We are at a historical juncture between the planned economy and socialist market economic system reforms, and our news and publishing workers are at an important link of spiritual civilization; they are at center stage now. Faced with the phased change from the stage distinguished by total volume growth to that by high quality and efficiency in the press and publication sector, we feel, on the one hand, hard pressed, and on the other hand, proud. We must treasure this historic opportunity, value the trust and expectations of party and people, emancipate our minds, seek truth from facts, do our best, and pursue creative work, and with it bring a new stage of development to the press and publication sector.
