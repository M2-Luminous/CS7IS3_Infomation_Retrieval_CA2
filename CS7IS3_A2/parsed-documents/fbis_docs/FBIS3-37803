Soon after the talks, the Ukrainian official flew out to Kiev to continue work as usual. No word was given of the details of the meeting. However, a senior Russian diplomat linked Zvyahilskyy's surprise visit to a recent stay in Moscow by pro-Moscow Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov. Meshkov had held negotiations with top government and parliamentary officials in the Russian capital inviting leading economist Yevgeniy Saburov to head the Crimean cabinet of ministers. The two sides may have also discussed the Rbl[Rubles] 1 Tn[trillion] debt Kiev has run for gas imports from Russia by the end of January, the diplomat said. Although Russia's chief gas exporter, Gazprom, threatened to cut off gas supply to Ukraine, it has so far suspended the measure. The diplomat believes the two prime ministers may have reached agreement by telephone on how to settle the debt and discussed the details on Friday.
