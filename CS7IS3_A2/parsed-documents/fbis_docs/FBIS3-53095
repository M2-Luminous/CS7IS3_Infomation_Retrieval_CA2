The plan includes the right to self-determination for southern Sudan and a referendum in this connection after the announcement of a cease-fire among the Sudanese parties to the conflict. An official Sudanese source told AL-HAYAH in Nairobi yesterday that the Sudanese Government delegation to the negotiations is authorized to discuss any issue the SPLM may raise, except the self-determination issue -- which means that no progress is likely to occur in the negotiations if they actually take place between the two sides. [passage omitted] AL-HAYAH yesterday obtained a copy of the Garang-Mashar plan for the negotiations, which is entitled "Agenda for the Peace Talks in Sudan." The plan says: "We met on 5 and 6 January in separate meetings in Nairobi with the ministerial committee regarding the peace talks in Sudan. And we agreed on a joint agenda" for negotiation with the Sudanese Government. The plan includes three points: 1. To negotiate a cease-fire among all parties to the conflict in order to halt all military actions under the supervision of a neutral team of international observers and to secure favorable conditions to facilitate humanitarian relief operations in southern Sudan. 2. The right to self-determination for the people of southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and other marginalized areas. This can be done through a referendum in these areas to enable the people there to determine their political future by themselves. 3. To make a temporary arrangement to implement these measures during the transitional phase that follows the halt to military actions, until a permanent arrangement is made. The plan was signed by John Garang and Riak Mashar. It is the first joint plan between the two men to be presented in the peace negotiations with the government since the split inside the movement in 1991. [passage omitted]
