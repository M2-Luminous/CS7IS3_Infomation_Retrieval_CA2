Hisham Nazir, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, suggested joint development of China's oil. Nazir, on his first trip to China, discussed petroleum exploration, development and processing with high-ranking Chinese officials. According to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), which arranged the visit, Nazir made the proposals to President Jiang Zemin, CNPC president Wang Tao and Sheng Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical Corp. An oil delegation from Saudi Arabia is expected to visit China later to explore further possibilities. The delegates are expected to visit petroleum processing projects in Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province and Dagang in Tianjin, at which time specific details will be discussed, a CNPC official said. Nazir said Saudi Arabia hopes to set up refineries in China to help meet China's domestic needs. With the refineries, Saudi Arabia would ensure China a stable, long-term supply of crude oil, he said. Saudi Arabia expects to set up the same type of joint-venture refineries it has in the United States, South Korea and the Philippines, Nazir said. Economic and trade ties between the two nations can be developed, since their economies are complementary, he said, adding that Saudi Arabia wants to tap the China market. Saudi Arabia, a leading oil producer, would also be able to help supply the crude needed for China's development, Nazir said. He said he hopes Jiang Zemin will support his proposals and help forge agreements as soon as possible. Jiang said China will carefully consider the Saudi oil minister's proposals and support any deals that promote bilateral co-operation. China has considerable undeveloped oil reserves. Despite its large output, domestic supply cannot meet the country's soaring demand. China produced 142 million tons of crude oil last year. It also imported, officially, 15 million tons of crude oil and 20 million tons of oil products, although sources say the figures are probably low. Experts say that imports will probably increase since the country is planning for 9 per cent economic growth over the next seven years.
