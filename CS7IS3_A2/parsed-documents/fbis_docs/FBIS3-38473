As was the case in January, there was an improvement of 0.3 percent compared to the previous month. Now, at -0.2 percent, it is just below zero. Thus, the figure for February of last year, -1 percent, has been markedly exceeded. Since September, the barometer reading has been improving from month to month. The latest developments indicate that the economy was at its lowest point in the final quarter of 1993. The upturn is also in no small way due to a shift toward a more positive mood in the west German economy. The Ifo economics institute business climate index for manufacturing industry has been on a course pointing to recovery for the past eight months. What is also important from the point of view of the economic climate is that business expectations for the coming six months have also improved once again. There was a sharp rise in demand for construction industry services in October, and such demand rose highest in the non-housing construction sector. By contrast, demand for manufacturing, which is sensitive to price and seasonal factors, was slack in November. Both domestic and foreign orders were somewhat lower than in October. Nevertheless, demand from abroad is continuing on an upward trend. The retail sector remained on its low October level in November. Thus, in real terms, sales were significantly lower than a year ago. This trend was to some extent offset by the gap between short and long-term interest rates closing to -0.51 percent in December. However, the structure of interest rates was still inverse at the end of 1993. So, positive and negative tendencies exist side by side in the current economic situation -- that is, if one concentrates solely on the latest data. However, in the medium term, positive factors prevail in the overall picture. The shift toward a feeling of greater optimism, which has been apparent for some months, has exercised a strong influence in this respect. Ultimately, how investors and consumers view the future can, above all, lead the economy out of the recession. Currently, export orders appear to be providing the greatest anti-recessionary stimulus, but with low interest rates and declining inflation, the economy also seems set on a positive course in domestic terms. Thus, the increase in optimism in the economy is not only a matter of psychology but also has a very real basis.
