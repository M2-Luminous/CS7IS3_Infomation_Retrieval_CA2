After reaching his conclusions Lieutenant General Baraq convened a news conference, which was attended by our correspondent Karmela Menashe: [Begin recording] [Baraq] Early yesterday morning a shocking murder was carried out by a lunatic in this place. He murdered innocent people on a holy day in a place of worship which is holy to both religions. We are deeply grieved by this terrible and unnecessary loss of life and share the sorrow of the families, the residents of Hebron and the entire Palestinian people and its leadership. We will do everything possible to determine as best we can the circumstances of the incident itself and the ensuing events and will do everything possible to minimize the chances of the recurrence of such events. [Unidentified correspondent] Do you have any picture of what happened inside these halls? [Baraq] Dr. Goldstein entered early morning and apparently opened fire from one of the passages connecting the two prayer areas -- it is still unclear which passage. He opened fire at the group of worshipers who were praying in the Muslim hall. I cannot determine the facts beyond this yet. The entire issue is under a thorough investigation. I have no doubts that in the wake of this investigation the entire picture will become clear. This is the situation. To the best of my knowledge Dr. Goldstein was the only one who fired shots inside this hall. [Menashe] The chief of staff was also asked whether steps will be implemented against the settlers in Qiryat Arba' and Hebron. [Baraq] At this point I am not qualified to say whether any steps will be implemented. Right now there is a curfew in Hebron and a closure on the Jewish settlement. This situation will continue for the time being. [Menashe] Will you change the procedures and the soldiers' operation in this area? [Baraq] We will implement whatever recommendations will surface in light of the investigation. An investigation is being carried at the division level and a debriefing by Brigadier General Agmon on behalf of the General Staff. I have no doubts that the events which occurred here and the incident which happened near the hospital [not further specified] will be thoroughly investigated. I am convinced that we will do whatever is necessary after the investigation is completed. For years hundreds of Muslims and Israelis have been praying side by side -- at times simultaneously-- and there are quite a few passages connecting the two areas in this intricate structure. [Menashe] The chief of staff was asked for his opinion regarding the demand for an inquiry commission, as demanded by some ministers. [Baraq] The Police are conducting a criminal investigation of this incident, and I have no doubts it will exhaust all the criminal responsibility in this incident. The Central Command and the General Staff have also appointed officers to investigate the incident. We have no reservations or opposition to any other investigations. We have no position regarding this question. [Menashe] Lt. Gen. Baraq also met the leaders and dignitaries of Hebron. [Baraq] I met Hebron's mayor and a group of dignitaries and expressed our deep shock at this despicable crime, as well as the IDF's and the entire Israeli people's denunciation of this incident, and our determination to do whatever we can to ascertain exactly what happened and to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. [Menashe] Chief of Staff Baraq, who held the news conference near the Cave of the Patriarchs, emphasized that apparently there should have been border policemen stationed near the Cave of the Patriarchs yesterday, but they were not there.
