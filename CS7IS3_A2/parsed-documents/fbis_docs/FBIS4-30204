Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak says that at present the country's export sector has extended significantly. During the first five months of this year, Thai export increased by 20 percent against 14 percent as predicted earlier. The deputy prime minister attributes the expansion in export sector to more agricultural exports during the period, especially rice and frozen shrimps. Some high-tech products such as computer parts and electronics have also enjoyed high export growth, especially to ASEAN market. Mr. Suphachai says the government will be cautious about credit extension for the real estate sector and about the stock market. It will ensure that private investment will be diversified into all regions of the country. He says the government has set a balanced national budget so that the country's economy will not expand at an excessive rate.
