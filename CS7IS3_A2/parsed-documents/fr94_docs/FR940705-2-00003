FR940705-2-00003 FR940705-2-00002 Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Survey of Income and Program Participation &hyph; 1993 Panel Wave 7. Form Number(s): SIPP&hyph;13700. Agency Approval Number: 0607&hyph;0759. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Burden: 63,000 hours. Number of Respondents: 42,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 30 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal, demographic, survey in which the Census Bureau interviews sample households in waves occurring every 4 months over about a 3 year period. The survey is molded around a central ``core'' of labor force and income questions that remain fixed during each wave of a panel. The core is periodically supplemented with questions designed to answer specific needs. These supplemental questions are referred to as ``topical modules.'' The topical modules for the 1993 Panel Wave 7 are the following: 1) Assets and liabilities, 2) Medical Expenses and Work Disability, and 3) Real Estate, Shelter Costs, Dependent Care, and Vehicles. Also, topical module items on Earnings and Employment, Stocks and Mutual Fund Shares, Rental Income, Mortgages, Royalties, and Other Financial Investments have been added in Sections 2 and 3 of the core. Wave 7 interviews will be conducted from February through May 1995. SIPP data on income distribution and changes over time in status and participation in welfare and transfer programs are used by economic policymakers, the Congress, state and local governments, and Federal agencies that administer these programs to support policy and program planning. Affected Public: Individuals or households. Frequency: Once during the panel. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230.
