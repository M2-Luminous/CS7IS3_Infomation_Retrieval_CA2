The agreement is being sealed by Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, who left for Tokyo Tuesday morning as the first South Korean defense minister to visit Japan, when he meets his Japanese counterpart for one and a half hours later in the afternoon, a Defense Ministry official said. Under the pact, South Korean Naval vessels will call at a Japanese port in the fall and a Japanese fleet will make a return call sometime thereafter. Yi and his Japanese counterpart will also discuss regional security in Northeast Asia, including the international row over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program, and ways to increase bilateral military exchanges, the official added. During his stay in Tokyo, Yi will pay a courtesy call on new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and his foreign minister. He will fly to Moscow on Thursday -- also becoming the first South Korean defense minister to visit Russia -- and remain there until next Tuesday. He is scheduled to meet with Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to discuss increasing personnel and other military exchanges and sign the Korea-Russia 1994-95 memorandum of understanding on military exchanges. From Russia he will proceed to Germany to meet with his German counterpart on expansion of the Korea-Germany military technology exchange program and to visit major military installations. Yi will return home on Thursday next week, winding up his 11-day tour of the three countries.
