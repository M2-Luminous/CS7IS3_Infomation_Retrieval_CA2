Moreover, in the past few weeks U.S. interest rates increased strongly, which generally favors a country's currency. Yet neither this nor a concerted action by the central banks could stop the downward trend of the greenback. If one tries to find reasonably plausible reasons for it one will meet with the somewhat dubious role of the American Government. Robert Rubin, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, has just emphasized that Washington was not at all interested in a falling dollar rate. Yet, in the recent past there were also differing statements that could not or would not blur the impression that a lower dollar rate could very well be used as a weapon in the trade war with the Japanese, who obstinately refuse to comply with the American desire for a reduction of their enormous export surplus. Regardless of how much Washington may deny all this, it shows how important confidence in a country's constant monetary policy is and to what extent the loss of such confidence will affect the foreign currency markets. One critical point regarding the economic figures of the leading economic power is its chronic deficit in the balance of goods and services, which will climb to $140 billion this year -- with trends pointing even further upwards. The rising economy has created a virtual boom for imports, which is having an increasingly negative effect on the trade balance and, consequently also the balance of goods and services. The result is that the trading partners are piling up dollars, which increase the dollar offer when exchanged into the individual national currencies. The role of speculation is unclear, even though one can assume that it supports the trend. If people on the other side of the Atlantic are now toying with the idea of stabilizing the exchange rate through increasing interest rates, one can only warn them. The only effect would be an increase in the price of money in Europe, too. Yet, for economic reasons this is absolutely not wanted. Only a confidence-building economic and monetary policy in Washington will, in the long term, lead to exchange rates that are guided by purchasing power. Until then, one will have to live with the unstable situation at the foreign currency markets and their negative impact on the financial markets.
