It could, of course, be different from that of the US Administration, but it does reflect the views of the most powerful group of US legislators who are likely to fashion the future course of American policy in the Sub-Continent. That this group has for long been subjected to pressure of the Indian lobby in Congress is clear from two specific statements that Mr. Hamilton made. One, that the Kashmir plebiscite proposal had been overtaken by history and two, that the present Line of Control should be made into an international border. The first is obviously the repeat of the Indian line which says that since local elections have been held in the Valley and since Sheikh Abdullah, the then pro-India Kashmiri leader, authenticated the State's accession to India, the promise of plebiscite given to the people of Kashmir has been overtaken by history. The argument suffers from two serious flaws. First, that the elections were held under Indian supervision and not that of the UN. And second, that Sheikh Abdullah soon realised that he had been tricked into accepting the accession of Kashmir and wanted its reversal. He was jailed for 14 years. This is the history that is supposed to have overtaken the UN resolutions. It was clearly contrived with a lot of deceit and chicanery. To accept such a history to legitimise an immoral act and then fashion the future on that basis, is to repudiate the very principles the US stands for. When Hitler occupied Poland, why did America decide to stand up and fight? Why was not that piece of history accepted as a fait accompli? The answer lies in the fact that the circumstances which lead to a historical event too have to be judged. If the Indian occupation of Kashmir has now to be legitimised by the US, then the American people should ask whether India had promised to hold a plebiscite or not, under the UN supervision? Or whether the people of Kashmir ever surrendered that right? Or whether India ever stopped manipulating the local governments of the Valley? Or whether it dares to hold and election there? These are moral questions that need to be addressed before accepting the fait accompli. Mr. Hamilton's second proposal that the Line of Control be converted into a permanent border, also echoes the Indian line. But in this case he began contradicting it himself when he said in the same speech that any negotiated settlement must take into account the wishes of the people of Kashmir. How does one ascertain those wishes? And what if the people of Kashmir do not want Indian rule? Hitler too could have said that he would address the economic grievances of the Polish people, provided he was allowed to rule there. The faces of land-grabbers change but moral principles do not.
