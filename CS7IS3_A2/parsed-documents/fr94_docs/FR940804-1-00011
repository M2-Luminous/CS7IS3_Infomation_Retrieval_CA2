FR940804-1-00011 FR940804-1-00004 Most Indian leases were entered into under the authority of earlier statutes, and these leases reserve to the Secretary considerable discretion in determining value for royalty purposes. This Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is intended to solicit comments on new methodologies being considered to establish value for these leases. Comments that are received in response to this Advance Notice will be considered in the development of a proposed rulemaking that will be published in the Federal Register at a future date. Most Indian leases also provide that royalty obligations be based on the value of hydrocarbon substances produced and saved. A royalty obligation is incurred when hydrocarbon substances are produced and saved and not solely as the result of a sale. Section 3(c) of a standard Indian lease covers leasee rental and royalty payment requirements and states: (c) Rental and royalty. To pay, beginning with the date of approval of the lease by the Secretary of the Interior or his duly authorized representative, a rental of $1.25 per acre per annum in advance during the continuance hereof, the rental so paid for any one year to be credited on the royalty for that year, together with a royalty of 162/3 percent of the value or amount of all oil, gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and saved from the land leased herein, save and except oil, and/or gas used by the lessee for development and operation purposes on said lease, which oil or gas shall be royalty free. During the period of supervision, ``value'' for the purposes hereof may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be calculated on the basis of the highest price paid or offered (whether calculated on the basis of short or actual volume) at the time of production for the major portion of the oil of the same gravity, and gas, and/or natural gasoline, and/or all other hydrocarbon substances produced and sold from the field where the leased lands are situated, and the actual volume of the marketable product less the content of foreign substances as determined by the oil and gas supervisor. The actual amount realized by the lessee from the sale of said products may, in the discretion of the Secretary, be deemed mere evidence of or conclusive evidence of such value. When paid in value, such royalties shall be due and payable monthly on the last day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which produced; when royalty on oil produced is paid in kind, such royalty oil shall be delivered in tanks provided by the lessee on the premises where produced without cost to the lessor unless otherwise agreed to by the parties thereto, at such time as may be required by the lessor: Provided , that the lessee shall not be required to hold such royalty oil in storage longer than 30 days after the end of the calendar month in which said oil is produced: And provided further , that the lessee shall be in no manner responsible or held liable for loss or destruction of such oil in storage caused by acts of God. All rental and royalty payments, except as provided in section 4(c) shall be made by check or draft drawn on a solvent bank, open for the transaction of business on the day the check or draft is issued, to the payee designated by the Area Director. All such rental and royalty payments shall be mailed to the oil and gas supervisor for transmittal to the payee designated by the Area Director. It is understood that in determining the value for royalty purposes of products, such as natural gasoline, that are derived from treatment of gas, a reasonable allowance for the cost of manufacture shall be made, such allowance to be two-thirds of the value of the marketable product unless otherwise determined by the Secretary of the Interior on application of the lessee or on his own initiative, and that royalty will be computed on the value of gas or casinghead gas, or on the products thereof (such as residue gas, natural gasoline, propane, butane, etc.), whichever is the greater. In conjunction with the lease terms, the valuation of gas production from Indian leases is subject to the regulations at 30 CFR Part 206. The present regulations govern the valuation of production from both Federal and Indian (Tribal and allotted) leases (except leases on the Osage Indian Reservation, Oklahoma) (Revision of Gas Royalty Valuation Regulations and Related Topics; Final Rule, published in the Federal Register on January 15, 1988 (53 FR 1230). MMS now believes that it may be able to better perform the trust responsibilities of the United States with respect to the administration of Indian oil and gas leases by issuing separate regulations for the valuation of gas from these leases. Also, MMS believes that it could provide an improved regulatory framework in which these lease terms can be strictly enforced while economizing on the information needed by a lessee. MMS is seeking to adopt valuation procedures that could be compiled with by the lessee in a timely manner. The Secretary is obligated to act as a fiduciary in the administration of Indian oil and gas leases. As a fiduciary, charged with supervising the disposition of nonrenewable resources from Indian lands, the Secretary must ensure that Indians receive the maximum revenues from mineral resources on their lands. To ensure maximum revenues, the value of production for royalty purposes from an Indian lease should be determined considering the highest values provided by the terms of the standard lease, quoted above. MMS believes this is consistent with the terms of these Indian oil and gas leases, with statutes delegating to the Secretary the administration of Indian affairs, with the statutes governing Indian oil and gas leases, with the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty Management Act of 1982 (FOGRMA), with court decisions providing judicial guidance in the interpretation and administration of Indian oil and gas leases, and with the law of trusts and fiduciary operations. MMS has considered that maximizing royalty revenues from Indian leases might affect the economics of mineral resource development and believes that this should not result in the reduction of the value of production for royalty purposes. This issue should be examined in the context of an adjustment of lease terms by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian lessor. II. Current Regulations The current valuation regulations incorporate the terms of the standard Indian leases in the ways listed below. (a) The value of production is never less than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee. This provision is contained in valuation regulations at 30 CFR 206.102(h), 206.152(h), and 206.153(h), which state:
