The question of Swiss participation in the Partnership for Peace was raised as it had been in Washington on Monday. According to Mr. Cotti, the contacts established during the trip confirm that Switzerland's neutrality is a key element of its credibility on the international scene. Following the example of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Mr. Ouellet also asked Switzerland to consider a possible "a la carte" participation in the Partnership for Peace. Mr. Cotti said that Canada is willing to enhance cooperation with countries that are not members of the Atlantic Alliance. The head of the federal department of foreign affairs reaffirmed that Switzerland would examine the offer made by NATO. The federal counselor will have to make a decision on the principle and methods of the Partnership for Peace in the coming months, he said. Mr. Cotti also stressed that any cooperation with Switzerland should respect its neutrality status. Cooperation With Russia Regarding international relations, the federal counselor highlighted the agreement between the Swiss and the Canadian Governments on the need to intensify cooperation between the West and the Russian Federation. Switzerland also has a role to play in the rapprochement process, even if only a modest one. For Flavio Cotti, the assignment of Ambassador Edouard Brunner as the UN mediator in Georgia is an example of this role. This type of cooperation can be strenghtened in the future. Blue Helmets The UN peacekeeping operations were also mentioned during the talks. The Canadian Government, with its long-standing experience in this field, expressed interest in the campaign in Switzerland for the creation of a contingent of blue helmets. Mr. Cotti, for his part, acquainted himself with the experience of the Canadian troops. A contingent of Canadian blue helmets is now serving with the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in former Yugoslavia. Turning to bilateral issues, both ministers welcomed the quality of their relations. Mr. Cotti said bilateral ties are strong and said they would be expanded in the future. In this respect, the head of the Canadian diplomatic corps has been invited to visit Switzerland at a time to be specified.
