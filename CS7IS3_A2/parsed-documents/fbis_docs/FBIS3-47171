The Transport Ministry has so far called for a revision of the agreement on grounds that it is unfair to Japan. In the negotiations on flights into Kansai so far, the United States has said that seven companies, including United Airlines and Northwest Airlines, want to launch services, bringing the number of flights requested by the U.S. airlines to more than 200 a week -- a number much higher than expected. The United States has insisted that "based on the aviation agreement, the United States has unlimited rights to fly into Japan. Nor are there any limitations on the right to fly from Japan to other Asian countries or Australia." In turn, Japan has pointed out that U.S. companies at present hold a 70-percent market share for flights between Japan and the United States. Japan has said that it cannot accept additional U.S. flights without limit, which would raise the percentage of U.S. services further, and has insisted that a limitation be put on the right to fly beyond Japan as well. In addition, Japan has called for a revision of the aviation agreement, noting, for instance, that U.S. companies can use almost twice the number of airports in Japan and the United States that Japanese companies can. More recently, however, U.S. demands have become more realistic, and companies like United and Northwest have more than halved the number of flights they requested for Kansai. As a result, now that the time for opening Kansai is nearing, the Transport Ministry has decided that it should be able to gain more by concentrating its efforts on the question of flights into the new airport rather than by seeking a revision of the agreement. Michihiko Matsuo, administrative vice minister of transport, said: "We will reiterate our position on the question of the right to fly beyond Japan, but in the forthcoming talks, we would like to concentrate more on the question of flights into Kansai rather than on such a grandiose subject as revising the agreement."
