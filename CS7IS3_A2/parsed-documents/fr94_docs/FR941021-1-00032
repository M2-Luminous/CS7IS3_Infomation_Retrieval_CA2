FR941021-1-00032 FR941021-1-00009 In 1982, the FAA amended part 67 in several areas (47 FR 16298; April 15, 1982). First, any disqualifying condition which previously required a formal petition for exemption was permitted to be considered for certification through special issuance procedures. Second, the prerequisite agency administrative review and decision process leading to eligibility for NTSB review of denial actions was streamlined. Third, authority was delegated to the Federal Air Surgeon to place functional limitations on medical certificates. Fourth, §67.19 was amended to state that the Federal Air Surgeon, in granting special issuances to applicants for private pilot certificates, considers the freedom of these applicants to accept reasonable risks to their person or property that are not acceptable in the exercise of commercial or airline transport privileges, and at the same time, considers the need to protect the safety of persons and property in other aircraft and on the ground. Fifth, clarifying interim cardiovascular standards were issued. Sixth, the alcoholism standard was revised to conform to the Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Act of 1970. In addition to the amendments to part 67, the preamble to the 1982 final rule announced that in accordance with Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulations, the FAA would undertake an overall review of the medical standards in part 67. This total and comprehensive review was described as a major rulemaking effort that would involve obtaining the views of the medical profession and all other interested parties and result in significant revision of part 67.

Current Requirements_Medical Certification of Airmen Part 67 of the FAR provides for the issuance of three classes of medical certificates. A first-class medical certificate is required to exercise the privileges of an airline transport pilot certificate. Second- and third-class medical certificates are needed to exercise the privileges of commercial and private pilot certificates, respectively. An applicant who is found to meet the appropriate medical standards, based on a medical examination and an evaluation of the applicant's history and condition, is entitled to a medical certificate without restrictions or limitations other than the prescribed limitation as to its duration. These medical standards are currently set forth in §§67.13, 67.15, and 67.17 (14 CFR part 67). An applicant for a medical certificate who is unable to meet the standards in §§67.13, 67.15, or 67.17 may, nevertheless, be issued a medical certificate. Procedures for granting special issuances or exemptions have always been available, and, thus, the standards have never been ``absolutely disqualifying,'' in the sense that certification is permanently denied all who do not meet the standards. Under §67.19, ``Special issue of medical certificates,'' at the discretion of the Federal Air Surgeon, acting on behalf of the Administrator under §67.25 of the FAR, a special flight test, practical test, or medical evaluation may be conducted to determine that, notwithstanding the applicant's inability to meet the applicable medical standard, airman duties can be performed, with appropriate limitations or conditions, without endangering public safety. If this determination can be made, a medical certificate may be issued with appropriate limitations to ensure safety.
