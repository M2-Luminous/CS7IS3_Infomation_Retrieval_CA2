Simovic: "Motor Vehicle Industry: The Process of Disintegration Is Continuing"] [Text] More than 1,700 items for Zastava motor vehicles, which before the disintegration of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] were produced by the industry of the seceded republics (some were imported from the West European countries), have been put into production either in Zastava factories or in firms in Serbia and Montenegro which have joined the motor vehicle program. So far, according to Eng. Miodrag Bogdanovic, director of the motor vehicle factory in Kragujevac, more than 19 million German marks [DM] have been spent to organize that production, "mainly at the expense of the earnings of workers of the firms that have joined this production program." You might think that at Zastava they would look on substitution of production from its former industrial cooperation outside Serbia and Montenegro as a kind of victory in the economic war which, along with its other forms, has broken out on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. That is not the case. Even in the initial phase of heightened tensions in the business sphere between Serbia and Slovenia, they were saying at Zastava that the disintegration of the state and the accentuation of animosities would impose too heavy a price on all large business systems, from the producer of the end product to his partners in industrial cooperation. Perhaps that price is best reflected in the drop of production from nearly 200,000 to only about 6,000 last year and about 11,000 vehicles this year. Although the situation in production is dramatic, as confirmed by the frequent visits made to Zastava by republic and federal officials in order to find the key to "faster startup of the installed capacity," the question is whether this substitution makes sense, that is, whether even that much production would have occurred if they had not been "timely in undertaking to eliminate dependence on auto parts producers in the seceded republics," Bogdanovic says. It is certain that without having organized production of those 1,700 items, production would not be possible, especially because the sanctions and blockades have prevented imports from the West European countries, specifically from industrial cooperation with FIAT in Italy. The process of organizing the production of the new items has not been completed, and certain parts and assemblies are now being put into production, especially for the Florida and the restyled Yugo, the convertible.... A recent visit to the vehicle factory in Kragujevac by representatives of the republic government, led by Dragan Tomic, minister without portfolio, who is also a member of the team for "rapid intervention" in the economy and who is working to guide the decisions of the government to more effective invigoration of the economy, had the objective of "examining in the most specific terms what is interfering with the growth of production, especially because the present market--such as it is--is showing a greater demand than the supply Zastava is now presenting." It was, of course, observed that money was necessary and credits to finance production, and then there is the need for the state to take specific steps in the area of tax policy to benefit motor vehicle producers, as well as in the area of tariff policy, whether it is a case of benefits in the importation of production supplies or importation of vehicles which because of their comfort, capacity, and other features should carry the burden of filling the state treasury with the charges that would be collected on them. Because the government representatives then talked separately to the managers of the vehicle factory and the management of the truck and special-purpose factories, and then in a broader meeting attended by the journalists as well, about the "main direction of the effort to invigorate production," it is not possible to talk with much confidence about the details that were dealt with and agreed on at that time. It was only a few days later that Miodrag Bogdanovic announced in a news conference that he was going to Belgrade, where he would talk to representatives of the government about "three scenarios to invigorate the production of motor vehicles." The contents of each of those scenarios and which will be adopted are a bit of a secret at the moment, but it is known that each one defines the growth of production this year and preparation for the period after the sanctions are removed. Will the growth of production be based solely on substituted production of parts, or will an attempt be made even by renewing ties with the earlier parts producers all over the former SFRY to make motor vehicle production cheaper and more concrete? The answer to this question does not lie solely in the power of Zastava or Serbia or of its subcontractors in Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. It is certain that those former republics of Yugoslavia, now independent states which are members of the United Nations, must respect the sanctions that have been introduced and the economic blockade. To whose detriment: Is it only to the detriment of Serbia? As far as the author of these lines is aware, many former subcontractors of Zastava in the seceded republics have complained that the business ties were severed, least of all, of course, out of any sentimental reasons, but purely on the basis of business and profit. At Zastava, they make no secret of the fact that the economic logic of all the former participants in motor vehicle production on the soil of the former state of the SFRY, which is to say, its own economic logic, is on the side of renewing the business ties, because with every passing day, with every new auto part put into production, when it comes to this kind of production, the process of disintegration of the economy on the territory of the old Yugoslavia intensifies, and this is occurring under the pressure of the need to somehow survive. Economic interest is now emerging as a factor tending to weaken ties further, a factor that has been forcibly yoked to the logic of actual war and economic war, the sanctions of the United Nations, but also mutual penalization for having lived in the same state for decades. All unused capacity previously employed to make motor vehicles gives rise to reflections about whether it is better for us now or better earlier. The present course of disintegration of economic entities attached to the motor vehicle program in the former SFRY will indisputably have an impact on the speed of renewal of the marketing of Zastava vehicles in the parts that have become separate from Yugoslavia. Along with all the negative consequences of disintegration, we must not forget that almost 60 percent of the total sales of Zastava vehicles on the territory of the former SFRY were marketed in republics which are no longer in Yugoslavia. It is indisputable that economic interest will decide whether and at what speed sales will be renewed in the newly born states on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but it is equally indisputable that the decisionmaking will also be influenced by the fact of whether and to what extent Slovenia, say, is involved in the production of that vehicle that comes from Kragujevac, when it defines its policy to encourage or to block that import. Certain signs at present indicate incontestably that the UN sanctions and the blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia do most to favor disintegration of the former Yugoslav economic space to the detriment both of the "state being punished" and also to the detriment of those the sanctions are supposed to protect. Disintegration is deepening superfluous emotions and favoring those forces, regardless of where they may be located, which do not want peace to return to this region, which would be favored best and most reliably by economic cooperation and respect for mutual interest. Viewed in this light, substitution can be seen as something imposed by necessity for survival at any price, as a superfluous effort, as a factor for further impoverishment of an already exhausted economy, but also as a factor that leads toward a definitive parting of the ways of even those business entities which until yesterday relied on one another, figuring as factors in each other's rate of development and progress.
