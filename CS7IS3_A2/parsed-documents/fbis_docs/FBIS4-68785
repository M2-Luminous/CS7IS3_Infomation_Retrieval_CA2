Vasetskiy, doctor of historical sciences: "Russia Above the Abyss"] [Excerpt] The book by G.A. Zyuganov, deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and chairman of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Central Executive Committee, analyzes topical problems of the constitutional and sovereign-state building of the new Russia and its domestic and foreign policy and spirituality and patriotism. The author has proposed a constructive program for the extrication of the country from the most profound crisis, a strengthening of the shaken authority of the managerial structures, and a surmounting of the growing lack of trust in the institution of power as a whole. The book is intended for a wide range of readers, primarily those to whom the fate of their fatherland and its present and future is not a matter of indifference. [passage omitted] Russia Above the Abyss IF WE THINK ABOUT IT, IT IS CLEAR THAT NOTHING WAS CONCLUDED BY THE EVENTS IN MOSCOW THAT FOLLOWED THE PRESIDENT'S EDICT ON THE DISSOLUTION OF PARLIAMENT. ON THE CONTRARY, EVERYTHING IS ONLY JUST BEGINNING.... IT IS NOT FORTUITOUS THAT THIS REGIME: CAME TO REAL POWER IN AUGUST 1991 UNDER THE COVER OF DEAFENING POPULIST DEMAGOGY ON THE WAVE OF A POWERFUL POLITICAL CATACLYSM: REMAINED AFLOAT FOR TWO YEARS AFTER THIS BY INFLAMING AN ATMOSPHERE OF CONFRONTATION AND POLITICAL HYSTERIA AND REPEATEDLY PROVOKING THE OPPOSITION INTO COLLISIONS; MANAGED IN THE FALL OF 1993 TO AVOID A CRUSHING POLITICAL DEFEAT MERELY AT THE PRICE OF THE ORGANIZATION IN MOSCOW OF BLOODY CLASHES, IN WHICH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DIED. "The revolution devours its children...." This dire aphorism has today once again been confirmed before our eyes. The slick and smooth-tongued democratic revolution, which two years ago managed by treachery and lies to destroy a country that had grown weary and had lost its faith in the perestroyka experiments, has logically brought society to the brink of civil war. But its first volleys were aimed against the most furious "democrats" of the recent past. Another circle of Russian history inevitably closed, having for the umpteenth time exploded at its end point in abundant splashes of innocent blood. This is why it is essential that all of us--patriots and democrats, monarchists and nationalists--regardless of political "rightness" or "leftness," urgently think through the results of the Moscow tragedy in its organic connection with the events of recent years and draw for ourselves serious, high-minded, and profound conclusions. The situation is, alas, developing according to the worst possible scenario, in which there can be no winners, for those benefiting will be only the destructive, extremist forces that are aiming at the conclusive extermination of the remnants of sovereign Russian statehood and the suffocation of the very rich Russian spirituality and culture. The inexorable logic of political history has already begun to uncoil the latest spiral of opposition, at the end of which, unless we come to our senses, an explosion of violence far more terrible and ferocious than that which shook Moscow 3-5 October of 1993 awaits the country.... "God preserve me from seeing a Russian rebellion--senseless and pitiless"--we would all do well to keep this firmly in mind. Pushkin knew what he was writing about--the bloody experience of the 20th century confirms all too clearly and convincingly how right he was. Fateful Questions What has been happening to the country in the last eight years (since the start of perestroyka)? What are the real, genuine reasons for the latest Russian troubles and their principal driving forces, ends and means, and executants and leaders? What are our real prospects? What needs to be done for the situation, finally, to be brought under control? Where is the way out of the political, economic, and ideological impasse in which we have found ourselves as a result of the universal "triumph of democracy"? This is just a small part of the questions that arise at a first attempt to comprehend in calm and considered fashion the recent Moscow carnage. It concentrates and fully reflects, as in a drop of water, all the present troubles, pains, and adversities of our life. It is for this reason that it is so important to understand how what happened with us since the fateful Presidential Edict No. 1400 of 21 September could have happened!... The explanation so importunately and high-handedly imposed on public opinion today by the reptilian news media--"a red-brown putsch"--is patently false and baseless. All these hysterical cries about the "communo-fascists" altogether come, rather, from the complete ideological impotence of the authorities, which are simply incapable of offering society if only some in the least bit intelligible explanation of what happened. Nonetheless, there is one--merely a little clear thinking is required. From the very start of the present troubles--from the moment when a political grouping of extreme, radical "Westerners" managed with the support of the world oligarchy at the price of the collapse of the USSR to seize political power in Russia--it was perfectly obvious that a substantial number of Russians would not for the world accept the path of "development" onto which the zealous devotees of "values common to all mankind" were endeavoring to drive them at any price. It was just as obvious that the number of malcontents would grow in line with the impoverishment of the masses and the intensification of the general chaos--the inevitable consequences of the political and economic course of the new Russian leadership. At some moment the discontent would reach a critical point, and then the fruit of the long painstaking activity of powerful international forces endeavoring, on their way to world domination, to remove Russia from the geopolitical arena by any means would be imperiled. Keeping a vast country under control under such conditions without the use of force is practically impossible. For this reason the backstage scriptwriters of our modern drama were from the outset given the assignment of devising and realizing in practice in Russia a set of methods of the country's controlled transfer to a new political regime with elements of dictatorship. The program-maximum here provides for the achievement of secret, but complete and strict, international control over the domestic political situation. The program-minimum, nonadmission to the levers of state power of national-patriotic forces. Many puzzles of our contemporary history are easily explained upon an analysis of the political collisions in Russia within the framework of this set of methods. The tragi-comic Emergency Committee "putsch" appears in a new light. The striking coincidence of the offices of the "putschists" in August 1991 and of the "rebels" in October 1993 is clear also. In addition, even quite a confident forecast of the political situation in the immediate future is possible from this viewpoint. But everything in its turn. August of '91... Before embarking on an examination of the August events, which dramatically determined Russian and, to a considerable extent, world history of recent years and served as the point of departure for processes that culminated in the recent tragedy in Moscow, it is essential to provide certain explanations. First, our thoughts may be of at least some analytical value only in the event of us abandoning emotional value judgments and trying to impartially trace the techniques and backstage political mechanics of the phenomena. Whether the state and political system of the USSR was good or bad--we will leave this question outside of the framework of the article lest we complicate matters by personal predilections. Second, while possessing the undoubted benefit of simplicity and graphic depiction, the sketchiness inevitable with such an analysis has simultaneously a number of shortcomings also. One such is a certain consolidation of events preventing us conveying all of the practical diversity and actual complexity. It is essential that this be borne in mind to avoid being, as a result, an uncritical captive of particular theories to the detriment of the actual political practice. Third, a retrospective (backdated) reconstruction of the operating methods of this political force or the other cannot, by virtue of a natural lack of information, lay claim to exhaustive fullness. While reconstituting its main, principal features with a high degree of probability, it is in no way possible to guarantee 100 percent accuracy and the full correspondence of detail. Nor is this necessary, for such shortcomings do not prevent the achievement of the main goal--a qualified evaluation of the leading trends of our political life. Bearing in mind all these amendments, the situation preceding the Emergency Committee "putsch" may be described as follows. Quite a curious and distinctive picture of political forces had taken shape in the country by mid-1991. Formally, the old party nomenklatura continued to keep a firm hold of the most important levers of state administration. Under its strict control were the power structures: the national armed forces--combat-ready and easily controllable and barely touched in practice by the trends of "perestroyka"; the ramified and universal machinery of the Committee for State Security--efficient, suitable for the accomplishment of the most complex and delicate assignments, and possessing immense information and analytical potential; the Ministry of Internal Affairs with its most extensive opportunities for controlling the situation in the country. For these structures the "flash points" and centers of conflict that existed at that time on the territory of the USSR represented no in any way serious threat and could, from the purely technical viewpoint, have been "extinguished" at any moment. The party and state vertical line, thoroughly battered and shaken in the six perestroyka years, nonetheless continued still to be a relatively dependable executive framework which was experienced and professional in matters of administrative and economic management. Relying on it, any measures of state stabilization could have been implemented perfectly well--especially as an understanding that the reform race, which had began so clamorously, was becoming by degrees a campaign for the dismantling of all the most important state institutions had matured among party functionaries. The legislative authority--the USSR Supreme Soviet--could easily, if necessary, have mustered the majority needed to pass stabilization decisions. The CPSU Central Committee bureaucracy, with its numerous and highly qualified specialists, was, as before, a sufficiently efficient center of control. Central Television and the majority of oblast studios and a substantial part of the central and local press remained in the party's hands. The financial possibilities of the CPSU were enormous also. It had almost undivided operational leadership of the economy. More simply put--the party had everything. Except for one thing, the most important. ITS CENTRAL ORGANISM WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF A VIGOROUS AND SINGLE-MINDED POLITICAL WILL. Being led to the slaughter by its own leaders, the fatigued and decrepit CPSU could not find within itself the powers--obeying its own political self-preservation instinct--even to adopt elementary measures of precaution and self-defense. Nonetheless, continuing "by force of inertia" to control all the commanding political heights, the party was, seemingly, an insuperable obstacle in the way of the new, energetic, and grasping political predators aspiring to take its place on the Olympus of state power. In addition, there continued to be the "danger" (slight, but real, nonetheless!) that healthy intra-party reform could breathe into its enormous body the beneficial spark of new life.... The "democratic" elite was, therefore, confronted with all seriousness and urgency with the question of the need to ensure the drastic, instantaneous "dumping" of its party opponents and the destruction of the mechanisms of the political domination of the CPSU. This quasi-democratic elite, which had taken shape rapidly in the years of perestroyka from party renegades, opportunist government officials sensitive to the least change in the political climate, "agents of influence," "civil libertarian"-dissidents, part of the denationalized "artistic" intelligentsia, and other fragments, outwardly represented a shapeless and patchwork phenomenon. It would have had no chance of victory had it not been for three factors which played a decisive part in this confrontation. First, the vigorous, outright maniacal will to power which united the friable, diverse multitude of "democrats" into a single herd (I am referring, of course, merely to those who acted consciously, and I by no means wish to offend the vast majority of well-intentioned people who succumbed to the fascination of eye-catching slogans and populist appeals). Second, the "liberal democratic" ideology, which was attractive following decades of exalted praise for the status quo and ideological stagnation and behind whose generously daubed facade it was impossible for the unsophisticated gaze of the naive Russian public almost to discern the hypocrisy and cynicism of its vociferous proponents. It was this ideology that secured for the "democrats" the unconditional support of the West with all the ensuing material and organizational consequences. It was its interior that contained the grain of destruction for whose sake, in fact, it was foisted so vigorously and clamorously on public opinion and whose shoots coincided with the collapse of the USSR, and whose first fruits coincided with the October tragedy in Moscow. Third--and this is the main factor, perhaps--the "democrats" had influential allies in the other camp. The "monolithic unity" of the CPSU was a bluff, and a substantial part of the unscrupulous nomenklatura, attracted by promises that they would "live as in Europe," constituted an impressive fifth column in the party's rear ready at any moment to surrender it to whoever would pay more. IT IS PARADOXICAL, BUT A FACT: THE HEAD OF THIS ARMY OF TRAITORS AND DESERTERS WAS THE GENERAL SECRETARY HIMSELF WITH HIS IMMEDIATE ENTOURAGE.... There was on the political stage at that time one further force--regional. It was represented by the political elites of the Union republics. As ill luck would have it, with the majority of them the rudiments of state wisdom were confined--alas!--to an aspiration to rake in for themselves as much in the way of power and various benefits as possible and to snatch as many rights and privileges as they could. In the race for these cherished aims they were always prepared to support whoever would promise them more. It is clear that with this alignment of forces the party elite was doomed. It was merely a question of the path by which the change of power would occur--evolution or revolution. The first left open the possibility of the existence of a unified state and the continued healthy reform of society, the second presupposed the collapse of the country and a sharp weakening of Russia and, consequently, a powerful geopolitical shift in favor of the West. The Algebra of Politics The art of the imperceptible manipulation of large-scale political processes by no means consists, as some people believe, of a backstage conductor (conductors) controlling their progress from start to finish, predetermining the set goal. This understanding of "conspiracies"--from the simplest petty intrigue through the "world Yid-Masonic" conspiracy--is incomplete and primitive. In reality, the political environment is too complex, diverse, and unpredictable for it to be so strictly controlled. No, the real "art of power" consists of the ability to make virtuoso use of the results of the natural flow of events, only occasionally, at most important moments, imparting to them the essential direction by almost intangible, but precise and calibrated influences. It is thus, I believe, that the political history of Russia of recent years has been programmed. The set of methods of this programming may conditionally be called the methods of "controlled explosions" or "managed catastrophe." Their main purpose is the consistent removal from the Russian political arena of all forces capable of impeding the country's integration in the single supra-state system of the "new world order." The principle of their action is based on the use of the political and social antagonisms that naturally exist in any state, especially a state in the grip, like Russia, of a profound systemic crisis. The starting point of the process is the political reality that has taken shape as of a certain moment of time, and its end result, the transfer of the entire social and political system to a fundamentally new condition with certain predetermined characteristics. For simplicity and convenience of schematic description let us establish that there participate in the process "players" pursuing independent political goals, and a "conductor," whose mission it is with the aid of the set of methods described to ensure certain rules of the game guaranteeing the predetermined result. Essentially, the "conductor" is a player just like the others, only of a higher order and the highest qualifications. He also pursues an independent goal, the difference being merely that he is hidden from the majority of "players," and this is an essential condition of its realization. For convenience of analysis the entire process may be divided into five consecutive phases. The FIRST phase is the focusing or initial phase. It provides for the "conductor's" determination of his attitude toward the "players." The "players" are divided into one's own and others', friends and foes, allies and opponents. The main criterion making it possible to conduct such an operation with sufficient precision is the attitude of the "players" toward some fundamental, model concepts and requirements reflecting the true purposes of the "conductor" in this game. The ascertainment of such "models" in all walks of life is extraordinarily important for the observer-analyst, for it is they that make it possible to compile the most realistic idea of the real, not sham, goals and driving forces of the game. Assuming that some outside force interested in the elimination of a strong rival attempts to assume the role of "conductor" in the current Russian troubles, as has repeatedly been the case throughout our tumultuous 1,000-year history, we obtain (with reference to the pre-putsch situation of 1991): 1. Serving for the "conductor" as the "model" for choice of friends should be the "players'" readiness for the sake of the achievement of their individual political and material goals (power, wealth, and so forth) to sacrifice the interests of the USSR (Russia) as a geopolitical subject: the country's territorial integrity, its military and economic power, political sovereignty, spiritual and cultural distinctiveness, and so forth.... 2. In the confrontation of "democrats" and "communists" the "conductor's" natural allies are the denationalized "democrats" with their aspiration to "integration in the world economic system," "entry into the market," "primacy of values common to all mankind," and such-like ideological fetishes concealing an absence of any national purpose whatever and the rudiments of a state instinct. The "communists" (who were earlier, at the dawn of their existence, the loyal allies of the "conductor") automatically find themselves in the role of "enemies," for the elementary self-preservation instinct dictates to them concern for the utmost strengthening of the social and political and state-administrative system which ensures their dominating position. The propaganda formalization of this opposition--"freedom-loving democrats against the totalitarian monster of barracks socialism"--bears no relation here to the heart of the matter and is intended merely to ensure that public opinion accept the coming changes as unquestioningly as possible.... The SECOND PHASE is the cumulative or polarization phase. The friends and enemies have been determined, so now it is necessary to polarize these two forces as much as possible and to exclude any possibility of compromise between them. Concentrated around one pole are all those who are intended by the "conductor" to walk out onto the stage and seize power at the end of the game, around the other, those who have to be removed from the political arena. The personal question is of particular importance here. Russia, as we all know, does not tolerate impersonal truths, and every idea in it laying claim to realization must necessarily be personified. It is hard to exaggerate the role of individuality, the personality, and a striking and vigorous leader under our conditions. This is why at this stage the experienced "conductor" endeavors in every way possible to ensure that all the "players" of the other side and all political leaders of the opposition have a chance to show clearly enough what they can do and end up here in one general political bunch. The opposite pole, which is to be removed, should have time to attract to itself all the forces destined to be "cut" and all leaders whose removal guarantees the "players" who are the "conductor's" allies maximum freedom of action. Projecting this format onto the era of perestroyka, we find that the period 1985 through 1989 corresponds, roughly, to the first phase of the game, the years 1989-1990, to the second. It was at this time that the attack on communism in the news media came to be tied in distinctly with the assaults on statehood as such. Full voice was given to the provocative slogans "The USSR is the evil empire," "Patriotism is the attribute of scoundrels," "Russian history is the history of slavery," and such like. The propaganda of outright Russophobia and the furious hounding of Russian writers assumed unprecedented proportions, and the "chained curs of perestroyka" were at the same time choking from fury apropos "Russian anti-Semitism" and vituperated demagogically in an expectation of mythical Jewish pogroms. This entire barrage of hatred and cynicism pursued as a principal purpose the ascertainment of the patriotic forces and an evaluation of the possibilities of their influence on the mass consciousness, a "battle reconnaissance," so to speak. In addition, it was anticipated, not without reason, that the dirty and insulting tone of the polemic would force the patriots, in turn, to lapse into shrill vituperation and extremism, in this way discrediting the very idea of patriotism and nationally conceptualized statehood. The alliance of populists and patriots and communists and statists, which was highly likely under these conditions, also blended splendidly into the script of the game. The THIRD PHASE is the crisis phase. It is, perhaps, the key phase, the most important of all. Its realization requires of the "conductor" particularly careful, comprehensive preparation and the meticulous, refined craftsmanship of political intrigue. The main content of this phase of the game is the clever incitement of opponents against one another and the spurring of subjective contradictions excluding the possibility of accords geared to an escape from the crisis. The situation is converted here into a stalemated, deadlocked condition, when turning for help to normal, legal, and evolutionary political means becomes impossible. A clash of the "players" under conditions that are patently disadvantageous to the opponents of the "conductor" and favorable for its allies is simultaneously provoked in every possible way here. It was thus that events developed at the end of 1990 through the first half of 1991. The collapse of the world socialist system, the progressive disintegration of the USSR, the aggressive nationalism of the outlying areas, the January events in Lithuania, the inexplicable inaction of a general secretary-president invested with boundless authority, the unrest in the party masses, the hysteria of the "democratic" news media, the defamation of the army and the loss of all strategic allies, the disregard for the results of the March referendum, which confirmed the country's unity--the result of all this was that the party, more precisely, its conservative-state wing, was left with practically no choice. It was necessary either to unconditionally surrender in the face of the new realities or take decisive action to stabilize the internal and external position of the USSR. Thus was the August "putsch" incited. The FOURTH PHASE of the process is the power or revolutionary phase. It is in terms of time the shortest, but in terms of significance, the most decisive. Its course is almost wholly dependent on how carefully the preparation at the preceding stage of the game has been. Of course, there is always the element of risk, but with the competent actions of the "conductor" it is quite small. This phase presupposes the "players'" move beyond the framework of the legal field and the settled political stereotypes. This explosion creates the ideal preliminary conditions for a decisive change in the political landscape. Public opinion, which is in a state of shock, subsequently allows the victorious "player" to carry out any revolutionary manipulations in no fear of responsibility or organized counteraction. In the case of the Emergency Committee the deplorable result for its sponsors and participants had been predetermined from the outset, and the possibility of the uncontrollable development of the "putsch" had been reduced to a minimum. The following factors contributed to this: 1. The predictability of the event itself. The putsch had been "in the air," so to speak, long prior to the attempt at its practical realization. That something of the sort had to be about to occur was obvious to the main "players" in advance so the "initiated" had every opportunity to prepare for the denouement. 2. The nature of the "putsch," which was phony, timid, and indecisive from the outset. It had never been planned in earnest even by the organizers themselves. The tacit assumption was that a show of decisiveness and strength would in itself sort everything out, having then become a decoration and effective background against which stabilization measures would be implemented easily and without hindrance. 3. The strange (to put it mildly) behavior of the head of the party and the state. The double game of the president-general secretary at this stage is obvious. Having by his inaction given the Emergency Committee the "green light," he instantly "turned in" all his party associates as soon as the situation became irreversible. And his personal political aims were straightforward and comprehensible, what is more: ridding himself of the inconvenient tutelage of the "conservatives," untying his hands for further political and personnel maneuvers, and so on and so forth. The aims of the "conductor," however, were different. And it was they that predetermined the content of the final, fifth, stage of this game. The FIFTH PHASE may be defined as that of collapse. As a result of the incited political explosion the hostile power pole finds itself "outlawed" and is ruthlessly liquidated. The rupture of the legal space and the paralysis of the enemy, shaken by the unexpected turn of affairs, enable the victorious "players" to promptly smash their opponents, rapidly occupy all the commanding heights, and emphatically transfer the situation to a new quality beneficial to themselves--which was anticipated by the set of methods within whose framework the "conductor" operated. In the case of the August "putsch" this collapse phase lasted right up until December 1991, when, as a result of the Belovezha conspiracy, which logically crowned the "perestroyka process," the USSR--the historical and geopolitical successor of the Russian Empire--was legally liquidated. The sought-for "new quality" of both the intra-Russian and global, world balance of forces was achieved.... We have tried in the example of the Emergency Committee to describe in the most general outlines the set of methods of "managed catastrophe" applied for the manipulation of political processes in Russia. Let us sum up. IN BRIEF, THIS SET OF METHODS COULD BE FORMULATED AS FOLLOWS: "DIVISION--CONFLICT--DEADLOCK--EXPLOSION--COLLAPSE." The seed of division is introduced into the ruling political grouping (or one that already exists is stimulated). The rival factions are artificially polarized in respect to a predetermined ideological pair (communism--democracy; cosmopolitanism--nationalism; capitalism--socialism; market--plan; and so forth). Contradictions are single-mindedly inflamed, the opposition being turned into an open conflict. This is followed by political deadlock and then a severe crisis, in the course of the power solution of which the "enemy" political grouping is liquidated. If necessary, everything is repeated all over again as the team of victors loses its monolithic character and "undesirable" trends begin to grow within it once again. The successive series of such explosions time after time "filters" the political spectrum of the ruling elite, gradually dislodging the objectionable forces from all the structures of power and state administration, fragmenting and destroying their social base, and disorganizing and impeding ideological and practical consolidation. And Once More October... By the fall of 1993 the alignment of political forces in the country was in some of its features painfully reminiscent of the pre-putsch situation of August '91. There were also, however, fundamentally new features that lent the situation an undoubted distinctiveness. The game that had been successfully staged by the "conductor," having culminated in the collapse of the USSR and the breakup of the party and state nomenklatura, represented strategically merely act one of a wide-ranging scenario entitled "The Taming of the Russian Bear." The essence of the scenario consists, as we have already said, of the destruction of the historically evolved geopolitical Russian "power center" and the subsequent integration of its fragments in transnational structures of the "single world community." The old party elite was far from the sole obstacle on this path. There were in the vast country many forces, different in terms of their primary political persuasion, but equally opposed to the "democratic" prospect of Russia's conversion into a raw material appendage and a beachhead of the "new world order." The "conductor" had to lure these forces--deprived to a considerable extent of clear ideological and political self-awareness, eroded, and unorganized--to the surface of political life and smash them one by one, preventing their unification and formation. This need predetermined a repetition--at a new level--of that same "game cycle" we considered in the previous chapter. The power picture of the Russian political field that had taken shape following the liquidation of the USSR and the start of the shock market reforms afforded every opportunity for this. Real authority--the power structures, the news media, operational control of the country's economic mechanism, foreign policy, and other key spheres--was almost entirely under the control of the president's team. On the other hand, considerable opportunities for influencing the situation were retained by the Supreme Soviet, which had, according to the logic of events, to have occupied a critical position in relation to the president and the government. Emerging from the same "democratic egg," these rival twins inevitably moved further apart from one another. Things were too cramped for them together on the upper platform of the political Olympus, and the opportunist need to constantly declare an "independent political position" predetermined the parallel search for their own ideology and social base. The first, focusing, phase of the "game" in this situation presented the "conductor" with no great difficulty. The majority of the old, tried-and-tested personnel was concentrated in the radical-democratic camp of the president, which, however, did not rule out the possibility of their reinforcement with gifted recruits from outside and the use of supplementary strong points. These "players" had to be enshrined in the public consciousness as "reformers." In accordance with the set of methods already known to us, a negative pole, intended for liquidation, must necessarily be counterposed to this "positive" pole. Appointed for this role was the Supreme Soviet, which had originally not even conceived of any conflicts but had contemplated "honorably" and "legally" sharing power with the executive structures on the basis of the customary backstage agreements and compromises. But its "players" had already been assigned the role of "conservatives" and "revanchists" in advance. Need it be said that the hysterics, on account of the "conservative attacks" on the "reform forces" or the "red-brown danger" allegedly threatening the young Russian democracy, which were incited in society by degrees, had nothing in common with reality and reflected merely the propaganda myth within whose framework it was contemplated preparing society for the coming events. The situation was complicated somewhat by the presence of increasingly independent regions, whose position it was difficult to anticipate in advance, but it was perfectly suitable for the game as a whole. The intensifying economic crisis even created a particularly favorable background for it, polarizing public opinion in natural fashion in respect to all that was happening. In short, the first phase of the process did not take much time, and by the start of 1992 the game had even entered the second--cumulative--phase. No difficulties were encountered here either. The uncompromising and strict policy of the "reformers" and the categorical refusal to admit to the levers of real power the leadership of the "conservative" Supreme Soviet rapidly did its job. The mutual insults and personal character traits of the leaders of the opposed forces contributed to this to a considerable extent, which showed once again that an ability to play on human frailties and passions is an indispensable condition of political success in a "democratic" society. The situation developed in line of ascent throughout 1992 until it finally, in December, entered the next, conflict, phase. Open conflict was initiated at the congress of people's deputies by the sharply worded, provocative speech of the president, who declared to the whole country that "it is impossible to work with this congress." All attempts at a compromise between the executive and the legislature were then deliberately, it has to be assumed, stymied. The statements of their leaders became increasingly harsh, ultimately becoming avowedly confrontational. The president's March attempt to impose the "special order of rule of the country" "won" by the April Referendum, the Supreme Soviet's transition en bloc almost to "opposition"--these are just some of the landmarks on this path. As the legislators became increasingly "conservative," ALL FORCES THAT REJECTED THE PATH OF THE "DEMOCRATIC" DISMANTLING OF RUSSIAN STATEHOOD CONCENTRATED BY DEGREES AT THIS POLE. Ultimately it became an odd conglomerate which incorporated the most diverse factions--from communists to monarchists. Lacking a well-considered common program, ALL WHO WERE "AGAINST" DEMOCRATIC EXTREMISM, GATHERED HERE, WHICH, IN FACT, IDEALLY CORRESPONDED TO THE PREDETERMINED SCRIPT OF THE GAME. Reality is always broader than the stereotyped pattern, so events in this period developed at times in highly dramatic fashion, but ultimately the required result was, nonetheless, achieved in full. By the fall of 1993 the political situation had obviously become deadlocked. When, therefore, the conflict switched to the revolutionary, power phase--as of the time the president signed the edict on the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet and the congress--no one was particularly surprised. Its temporal framework may be defined perfectly precisely: from 21 September through 5 October. Carefully planned, by all accounts, it was crowned with a "success" as complete and decisive as, it would seem, the victors themselves even had not expected. The Supreme Soviet was destroyed in both the literal and metaphorical meaning of this word, and the clashes of the army and the militia with its defenders were presented to society as a "communo-fascist rebellion." The imposition of a state of emergency in Moscow and the disintegration of the entire vertical line of the soviets, down to the local soviets also, conclusively concentrated state power in the hands of the "reformers," who had smashed simultaneously the vast majority of opposition political organizations and the "conservative" news media. The country had once again accomplished a revolutionary leap into a new quality of its political being: FROM BENEATH THE DISLODGED DEMOCRATIC MASK FLASHED THE BARED WOLF'S TEETH OF A CYNICAL RUTHLESS DICTATORSHIP. The collapse phase of this process continues, and God only knows how far its end result will coincide with the "conductor's" original desires. But it is possible even now to draw some conclusions and even venture certain forecasts. Not Peace But the Sword... So how are we to view the fact that the "Supreme Soviet party" lost to the "president's party"? This question is for the patriotic consciousness far from being as simple as might appear at first sight. First, "cut off" as a result of the "communo-fascist rebellion" is to a large extent part of that same "democratic" elite which had come to power after the "putsch" in 1991. "Conservative" and "patriotic" slogans were for many of them merely a tool for establishing their own political individuality in the struggle for power, not by any means an expression of conceptualized beliefs arrived at after considerable torment. Compared with the democratic radicals, they would undoubtedly be the lesser evil, but in principle.... "Same broth, only a bit thinner," as the Russian folk saying aptly characterizes such situations. In addition, together with the "Supreme Soviet party" certain extremist organizations which had affiliated to it in the course of the power confrontation and which had performed a patently provocative role in the unleashing of the "rebellion" have found themselves swept from the political stage also. This fact may be ranked with the few positive results of the events, especially if it is considered how much blood the patriotic movement has been caused by the "extreme left" and the "extreme right," preventing the unification of the healthy forces, discrediting the movement as a whole, inciting hysteria, and affording the "democrats" a pretext for the dirtiest and most unbridled accusations against the patriots. And, finally, the main point (if we think about it, it is clear that nothing was concluded by the events in Moscow that followed the president's edict on the dissolution of parliament. On the contrary, everything is only just beginning). Having won round one of the "battle for Russia" from the party nomenklatura in 1991, the makers of the "new world order" staged round two also--against some of their recent allies, "incorrect" democrats who had "degenerated" in a spirit of "imperial thinking" and "great-power chauvinism." But the innocent blood, clamor, and din of this struggle attracted general attention, which had been exacerbated by the crisis processes in many spheres of social, economic, and state life. People involuntarily had to reflect on where the true causes of what is happening are rooted. The result is evident: It may confidently be said today that there has come to be considerably more people than there were a year ago even who are aware of the real nature of the present authorities, who understand in what a most difficult situation Russia has found itself today, and who are convinced that it can only be saved by a process of the unification of all healthy forces based on our centuries-old national-state, spiritual, and moral and religious values. Nor should the difficulties awaiting us on this path be understated. Nonetheless, there is hope. No repressive edicts or police measures of a fledgling dictatorship can halt the shift in the public consciousness, make up for the rapid reduction in the social base of the regime, or prevent the coming changes. It is important, however, that the patriotic forces learn a serious lesson from what has happened and not repeat their past mistakes in the future. This is the guarantee of success! There is no future for the present antipopular regime, however. IF IT IS COMPELLED TO EXIST FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF PEACEFUL, NONVIOLENT DEVELOPMENT AND LEGAL STABILITY, IT WILL INEVITABLY BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE OPPOSITION. The present "elite" can hold on to power only by intensifying the dictatorship. Increasingly new conflicts and social unrest are needed as a pretext for this. It would be no bad thing for today's exultant "democrats" to give some thought, incidentally, as to which of them will the next time be the victim of another political intrigue at a new turn of the brutal game. And it is, it would seem, inevitable, for only the tops have been cut off, the rootlets, on the other hand--the crisis phenomena in all spheres of contemporary Russian life--have remained entirely untouched. The main danger is that at each new such turn the power phase of the conflict will become increasingly prolonged and furious, pulling into its maelstrom increasingly large masses of people. How this might end requires, I believe, no explanation. This would be, for that matter, that very result, perhaps, to which the true conductors of our troubles, ensuring the unsinkability of the bankrupt regime, aspire. It is not fortuitous that this regime: Came to real power in August 1991 under the cover of deafening populist demagogy on the wave of a powerful political cataclysm; remained afloat for two years after this by inflaming an atmosphere of confrontation and political hysteria and repeatedly provoking the opposition into collisions; managed in the fall of 1993 to avoid a crushing political defeat merely at the price of the organization in Moscow of bloody clashes in which hundreds of people died. Such a regime is a regime of civil war. And all who desire to avoid national catastrophe need, regardless of their political positions, to join efforts to ensure for our people a peaceful future and the possibility of themselves, freely and consciously, deciding their historical destiny.
