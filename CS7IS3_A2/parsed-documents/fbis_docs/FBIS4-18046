For the first time academics who had contrived to study the problems of the market economy for several years in a country where official theory invariably coupled the word "market" with the term "capitalist," which had a universally negative sense, were included among the president's expert advisers. The group was and remains very small: There are six people directly involved in work connected with the formation of economic policy. The majority are young people aged between 25 and 40. In the words of the group's current leader, Doctor of Economic Sciences Aleksandr Livshits, two qualities serve as the criterion for the selection of experts: professionalism and personal integrity. Mr. Livshits calls his staffers "ammunition carriers," not, however, investing this term with any scorn. In the final analysis, no weapon will fire without shells. The 47-year-old leader of the expert group has been in his current post for just six weeks. Before this, having graduated from the Plekhanov Institute of the National Economy, he spent many years in academic work. He devoted his doctoral dissertation to market problems -- to "Reaganomics," the economy policy of the U.S. Administration in the first half of the eighties. The experts handle three things. First, "they support the president's current work on economic questions." To put it simplistically, they endeavor to make presidential edicts concerning the economy as rational and useful as possible. Second, they make short-term forecasts of the country's economic development. Third, they assess decisions on economic questions made by the president, the government, and the legislature. Objections to these decisions arise among the experts quite frequently. One recent example is the issue of changing customs tariffs. On this score the expert group has its own opinion, which it will endeavor to bring to the president's notice. The experts also had a hand in B. Yeltsin's recent letter to V. Chernomyrdin and to the Federal Assembly and Central Bank leaders on the subject of the defaulting problem. Although the expert evaluations do not always please everyone, the group's leader claims that there have been no significant conflicts between government structures and the experts. Relations with the State Duma are also developing just fine. The president sees his own experts rarely. However, for them it is not personal contact with Boris Yeltsin that is of greatest significance but the frequency with which the president reads the analytical memoranda and other documents that the expert group sends him. After all, right now in Russia economic policy is above all the result of a struggle between powerful lobbies whose deep bass is capable of drowning out the quiet voice of the specialists. However, on so important a document as the draft state budget the experts did manage to exert their influence. Their remarks and proposals were sent to B. Yeltsin in Sochi, where the president vacationed in March. In the words of Aleksandr Livshits, a significant number of these observations were taken on board by those who finalized the draft. As a result more attention was devoted in the budget to the social sphere. The experts themselves are also people of flesh and blood, with their own prejudices in economics and politics. However, according to their own claims, the expert group endeavors to be as objective as possible, keeping within the limits of strictly economic calculations and forecasts. As for attempts to lobby the president via the experts, few have been made. The group leader refused to cite specific examples, referring to the fact that "the interests of the most diverse forces are mixed up in this business." The Kremlin's comfortable offices dispose one to speculative constructs: Let us do such-and-such, they say, and rivers of milk and honey will flow from Moscow to the borders. Understanding this, the president's experts endeavor to behave fairly openly, meeting with a very wide variety of people. Among those who have visited them recently are "black-hands" (representatives of the independent mine workers' trade union), bankers, and farmers. Incidentally, most visitors complain that reforms, especially in the provinces, are at a standstill, and bureaucracy is as all-powerful as ever. Apparatus traditions should be anathema to the president's analysts themselves, even though their group belongs to the Russian president's staff of aides. None of the Kremlin economics experts worked under old system with the state leaders who preceded B. Yeltsin. Overall, the chief of the expert group sums up his work as follows: "Perhaps we have not done so very much. I cannot say precisely that we have managed to save Russia from a mass of economic idiocies which might have been committed."
