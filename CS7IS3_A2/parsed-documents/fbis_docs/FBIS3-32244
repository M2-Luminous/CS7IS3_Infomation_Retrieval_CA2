According to a press release from the crisis committee, the objectives of the 25 January resolution asking business people to close their doors from 28 January to 9 February were reasserted during a meeting between the crisis committee and members of the resigning government. The press release adds that some progress has been achieved. Additional meetings will be held on this topic on Thursday, 3 February, with national and international guests. The crisis committee of the Haitian private sector states that cooperation with the protest movement is increasing, translating the exasperation of a population facing arbitrary, inopportune sanctions that are being imposed on the nation by certain countries in the international community. Furthermore, this committee invites all the media which do not regularly receive press releases to contact the secretariat of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti as soon as possible. It should be pointed out that the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Haiti, Raymond Roy, exchanged bitter words with Mr. Schrager of the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince. Chamber of Commerce President Roy, who is also a member of the crisis committee, called Stanley Schrager's comments on the Haitian employers' movement untimely and biased. The diplomat had described the resolution of the Haitian employers, announced on 25 January, involving the temporary suspension of commercial and industrial activities in the country until 9 February as a means of demanding a solution to the crisis and the lifting of the embargo, as dramatic. The president of the Chamber of Commerce, in a press release issued on 2 February, pointed out that in the interest of protecting the constructive, harmonious relations with the United States while there is still time, the crisis committee of the private sector had asked the diplomats accredited in Haiti to avoid comments that could aggravate tensions.
