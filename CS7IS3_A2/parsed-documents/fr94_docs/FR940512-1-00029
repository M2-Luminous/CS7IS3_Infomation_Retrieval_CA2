ACTION: Proposed rule; notice of public hearing and reopening of comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) gives notice that a public hearing will be held on the proposed determination of endangered status for the Hine's emerald dragonfly ( Somatochlora hineana ) and that the comment period on the proposal will be reopened. The Hine's emerald dragonfly now persists in populations in Cook, DuPage, and Will Counties in Illinois, and in Door County, Wisconsin. It occupies calcareous, marshy streams associated with cattail marshes on dolomite bedrock. The public hearing and reopened comment period will allow comments on this proposal to be submitted from all interested parties. DATES: The public hearing will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, May 25, 1994, in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. The comment period on the proposal originally closed on December 3, 1993, was extended to January 3, 1994, and now closes June 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: The public hearing will be held at the Door County Courthouse, General Meeting Room (A150), 421 Nebraska Street, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. Written comments and materials should be sent to the Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, 1 Federal Drive, Fort Snelling, Minnesota 55111&hyph;4056. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours, by appointment, at the above Regional Office address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information on the public hearing contact Janet Smith, Supervisor, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Ecological Services Field Office, 1015 Challenger Court, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54311 (phone 414/433&hyph;3803; fax 414/433&hyph;3882). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The Hine's emerald dragonfly is known to occur in three counties in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area and in Door County, Wisconsin. It was proposed for listing as an endangered species on the basis of evidence that its range and numbers have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of the destruction of its habitat, and that the threats to the habitat are continuing. On October 4, 1993, the Service published a proposed rule to list the Hine's emerald dragonfly as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, as amended. The original comment period ended on December 3, and the deadline for receipt of public hearing requests was November 18. On December 10, 1993, a notice was published reopening the comment period until January 3, 1994. The Service believes a number of parties interested in the proposed listing did not receive notice of the proposal in sufficient time to submit comments or request a public hearing during the original comment period. On December 20, 1993, the Service received requests for public hearings on this proposal from Mr. Jerome M. Viste, representing the Door County Environmental Council, Inc., Fish Creek, Wisconsin, and Mr. George M. Reynolds, representing Reynolds & Co., Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Service has scheduled a hearing on May 25, 1994, from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m. C.S.T., at the Door County Courthouse, Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should have available a copy of their statements to be presented to the Service at the start of the hearing. Oral statements may be limited to 5 or 10 minutes if the number of parties present that evening necessitates some limitation. Oral and written statements receive equal consideration. There are no limits to the length of written comments presented at this hearing or mailed to the Service. In order to accommodate the hearing, the Service also reopens the public comment period. Written comments may be submitted until June 6, 1994, to the Service office in the ADDRESSES section or at the public hearing.
