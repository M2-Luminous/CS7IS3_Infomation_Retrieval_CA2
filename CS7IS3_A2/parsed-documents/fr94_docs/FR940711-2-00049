FR940711-2-00049 FR940711-2-00027 Office of Research and Development [FRL&hyph;5010&hyph;5] Ambient Air Monitoring Reference and Equivalent Methods; Reference Method Designation Notice is hereby given that EPA, in accordance with 40 CFR part 53, has designated another reference method for the determination of ambient concentrations of particulate matter measured as PM 10 . The new reference method is a gravimetric method which utilizes a specially designed PM 10 sampler for particle collection. The designated method is identified as follows: RFPS&hyph;0694&hyph;098, ``Rupprecht & Patashnick Partisol TM Model 2000 Air Sampler'', consisting of a Hub Unit and 0, 1, 2, or 3 Satellite Units, with each sampling station used for PM 10 measurements equipped with a Rupprecht & Patashnick PM 10 Inlet and operated for continuous 24-hour periods using the Basic, Manual, Time, Analog Input, or Serial Input programming modes, and with or without any of the following options: Stand for Hub or Satellite 57&hyph;002320 Advanced EPROM 59&hyph;002542 Large Pump (1/4 hp), 120 VAC 10&hyph;001403 Hardware for Indoor Installation consisting of: Temperature Sensor (Extended ␣Length) 51&hyph;002638&hyph;xxxx Roof Flange (11/4 ’ ’) 55&hyph;001289 Support Tripod for Inlet 57&hyph;000604 Sample Tube Extension ␣(1 m) 57&hyph;002526&hyph;0001 Sample Tube Extension ␣(2 m) 57&hyph;002526&hyph;0002 Hardware for Outdoor Installation in Extreme Cold Environments: Insulating Jacket for Hub Unit 10&hyph;002645 This method is available from Rupprecht & Patashnick Co., Inc. (R&P), 25 Corporate Circle, Albany, New York 12203. A notice of receipt of application for this method appeared in the Federal Register , Volume 59, March 30, 1994, page 14853. The hub unit of the Partisol TM Model 2000 Air Sampler contains a filter holder assembly, the flow control system, the valves to direct the sample flow through the hub or appropriate satellite unit, the sample pump, a microprocessor, keypad, information display, and associated electronics. Each satellite unit contains only a filter holder assembly and is connected to the hub unit through a single flow line. Each sampling station (hub or satellite) used for PM 10 measurements must be equipped with an R&P PM 10 inlet (other sampling stations may have other types of inlets). Only one sampling station may operate at a time. The Model 2000 uses 47mm diameter filters mounted in cassettes. Filter media meeting the minimum requirements specified in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 (Reference Method for the Determination of Particulate Matter as PM 10 in the Atmosphere) are available from R&P, or may be obtained from other sources, depending on individual user needs. A 5-place analytical balance is required for weighing filters before and after sampling. Test samplers representative of this method have been tested by the applicant, in accordance with the test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted by the applicant, EPA has determined, in accordance with part 53, that this method should be designated as a reference method. The information submitted by the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Atmospheric Research and Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFR part 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act). As a designated reference method, this method is acceptable for use by States and other air monitoring agencies under requirements of 40 CFR part 58, Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes, the method must be used in accordance with the guidance in appendix J to 40 CFR part 50 and the specific procedures contained in the operation or instruction manual associated with the method. Use of the method is also subject to any limitations specified in the applicable designation (see description of the method above). Vendor modifications of a designated method used for purposes of part 58 are permitted only with prior approval of EPA, as provided in part 53. Provisions concerning modification of such methods by users are specified under section 2.8 of appendix C to 40 CFR part 58 (Modifications of Methods by Users). In general, this designation applies to any sampler which is identical to the sampler described in the designation. Similar samplers manufactured and sold prior to the designation may be upgraded (e.g., by minor modification or by substitution of a new operation or instruction manual) so as to be identical to the designated method and thus achieve designation status at a modest cost. The manufacturer should be consulted to determine the feasibility of such upgrading. Part 53 requires that sellers of designated methods comply with certain conditions. These conditions are given in 40 CFR 53.9 and are summarized below for PM 10 methods: (1) A copy of the approved operation or instruction manual must accompany the PM 10 sampler when it is delivered to the ultimate purchaser. (2) The PM 10 sampler must not generate any unreasonable hazard to operators or to the environment. (3) The PM 10 sampler must function within the limits of the performance specifications given in table D&hyph;1 of part 53 for at least one year after delivery when maintained and operated in accordance with the operation manual.
