Mr. Serreqi said that "the Albanian party in the meeting asked further explanations about the incident. "Not even indirectly did the Greek party accept to take the responsibility that its citizens or nationals had carried out the terrorist act against the Albanian recruiters' centre. It also did not accept that possible investigation into the case be carried out by an international commission, although it offered a bilateral cooperation about the event," Mr. Serreqi said. Asked about the coming development of the relations between Albania and Greece, Mr. Serreqi said that "we requested from Greece to observe our sovereignty, not to interfere in Albania's home affairs." Greece admitted that in the future it will try to stop religious and other propaganda which is now going on about North Epirus. "I may say that this was the greatest success of the meeting," Mr. Serreqi underlined. "As regards relations between Albania and Greece, Greece reaffirmed that it considers normal relations with Albania as very significant. For this reason efforts were made to create a normal climate in the relations between the two countries. That is, the dialogue remains open," Mr. Serreqi explained. Asked about the state of the Albanian economic emigration to Greece, Serreqi said that: "We showed interest in determining a legal status for the Albanian economic emigrants in Greece. The official Athens is for the approval of this status but on several conditions. One must realise that this was the first meeting after the incident and as such, it was very difficult." Concerning the fact that Greece is now presiding the European Union, the Albanian foreign minister said that "Greece is the only Balkan country in the European Union, and it will preside it until the end of July." "This fact," Mr. Serreqi said, "would facilitate the relations between Albania and Greece and even broader in the Balkans, but, heretofore, it did not happen so."
