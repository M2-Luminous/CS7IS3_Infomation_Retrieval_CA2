But the opposition's opinion this year cannot influence the decisions of the ruling agrarian majority. All the more so as it is no secret that those who shout loudest about the loss of the Republic's independence are least interested in it. They mainly support unification with Romania and see Moldova's membership of the CIS as yet another major obstacle in the way of implementing their cherished dream of becoming part of the neighboring state. But the CIS issue cannot be seen merely in black and white terms. It is much more complicated. The opponents also include people who have no desire to join Romania but who are worried that such a powerful country as Russia will dictate its political and economic will and turn Moldova into its satellite. "That is the mentality in small countries," economist A. Muravskiy [name as transliterated], an agrarian deputy, told me. "They differ from big countries in being more sensitive to any infringement of their rights in a partnership." Also cautious about the CIS are the so-called "Westerners," who see the cure to all their ills as lying in the opposite direction to the east. But many economists believe that it will be impossible for the Republic to break into the Western market in the immediate future. At any rate, the first two months of this year cannot be called a success. Relations with the far abroad are as follows -- the Republic's imports exceeded its exports fourfold. And the bulk of these shipments were paid for with hard currency. Is it possible in this situation to seriously talk about entering the Western market or at least of balancing foreign trade? Paradoxically, it will be easier for Moldova to team up with the West by going through the eastern market. So, whichever way you slice it -- whether it be tough or desirable -- the CIS is a necessity for Moldova. On the basis of the results of the first two months of the year the CIS countries account for around 75 percent of Moldova's foreign trade turnover. And the main country is Russia. It accounts for almost 62 percent, and is followed by Ukraine (6.5 percent) and Belorussia [Belarus] (2.3 percent). But even here Moldova's trade is by no means in the black. Its deficit is 137 million lei. Under the corresponding article of the treaty, CIS membership means for Moldova freer movement of goods, services, money, and labor, coordination of its monetary, credit, and fiscal policy, and more acceptable customs duties -- and, consequently, prices for goods. But this decision -- long-awaited by some and undesirable for others -- will not of itself make things any easier overnight. This is already clear even to the most convinced supporters of the Commonwealth, who have lived through the period of naive romanticism when it had seemed that it would be enough to sign the treaty and the economic wheel would move toward stabilization. The political train, crushing the old economy underneath it, has gone a long way. Whether forward or backward -- only time will tell, but there is no doubt that other realities have emerged. Just as something else is obvious too. The new economy to back up those realities has not yet emerged. We are merely calculating our losses. Moldova remains without any industry. Whereas a few years ago industry accounted for 67 percent when it came to forming the budget, last year it accounted for just 9.3 percent. And the slump has not been halted. It will hardly be possible to rapidly restore our broken ties. And Moldovan Prime Minister A. Sangheli sees their loss as one of the main causes of the current crisis.
