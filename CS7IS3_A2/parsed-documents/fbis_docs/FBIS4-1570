The Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department yesterday admitted the problem had become difficult to control because of lax restrictions on the mainland covering intellectual property rights. The customs commissioner, Don Watson, predicted another huge increase in seizures of pirated CDs this year. The regional head of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Giouw Jui-Chian, said the Chinese government was drafting legislation that would make CD piracy a criminal offence - it is currently regarded as a civil matter. Giouw said the IFPI, which on behalf of the recording industry has been lobbying the Chinese government, had been told that a central authority would be set up to combat the problem and CD imports and exports would be subjected to rigorous checks from June. He said CDs pirated in China had been seized in countries throughout Asia and North America and two consignments had been recently confiscated by authorities in Central American countries. In the first two months of this year, Hong Kong customs officers arrested 75 people and seized more than 13,000 pirated CDs with a retail value of $600,000 [currency not specified]: Last year, the number of seized discs jumped to 95,671, compared with only 10,117 confiscated in 1992. Watson said he expected more seizures this year. Speaking after a ceremonial destruction of pirated CDs yesterday, Watson said the Government was working closely with the music industry to stop the influx of pirates, which last year cost the industry an estimated $300m in lost profits. He said intelligence indicated that organised efforts were behind the smuggling and distribution of pirated discs. "I not sure we can dignify them with the name of 'syndicates' as of yet but we're looking very, very closely at who is responsible for the distribution," Watson said. "I know when it first began as a problem, we were satisfied the (discs) were coming in, not in an organised way, but by travellers coming back from (Shenzen) bringing CDs with them which they could buy very cheaply. The picture has changed because of pressure applied by Customs and Excise and the police and I think now because of the profits factor, there is growing evidence that there is an organisation behind it." He said that several different Chinese authorities were responsible for enforcing intellectual property laws and without any co-ordinated effort the problem would be remain widespread. "I have spoken to the Chinese customs about this problem but the problem there is that they do not have the authority to deal with the situation in China," he said. "Until you can actually have one authority which is combatting the manufacture, distribution and sale of pirated CDs then we're unlikely to get very much further than we are at the moment. I understand that through the efforts of the IFPI some sort of co- ordinated action is being taken. "It is only through co-ordinated action against producers that we are likely to see any improvements in the situation locally. "I think the problem is due to the fact that the manufacturing capacity of CDs in China far exceeds the domestic demand for the product and the spare capacity is being used to produce these pirated CDs. I think the problem can only be resolved by the factories in China being closed down or being reduced to producing legitimate CDs for the legitimate markets. "I would hate to say it's out of control but...the major problem is the sheer volume of traffic between Hong Kong and China." Watson said none of the pirated CDs seized so far had been made locally and although some had been manufactured in other Asian countries, most were from China. Giouw said that until stronger legislation was introduced in China, the pirating of compact discs would continue to proliferate. "None of the pirates are afraid of the laws," he said. "If they are making a million a year, why should they worry about paying a fine or half a million dollars in damages?"
