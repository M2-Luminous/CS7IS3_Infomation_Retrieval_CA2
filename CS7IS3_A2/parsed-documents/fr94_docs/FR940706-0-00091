A system for contract administration must be maintained to ensure contractor conformance with the terms, conditions and specifications of the contract, and to ensure adequate and timely follow up of all purchases.

(20 U.S.C. 1221e&hyph;3(a)(1) and 3474; OMB Circular A&hyph;110) ยง74.48 Contract provisions. The recipient shall include, in addition to provisions to define a sound and complete agreement, the following provisions in all contracts. The following provisions must also be applied to subcontracts: (a) Contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain contractual provisions or conditions that allow for administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in instances in which a contractor violates or breaches the contract terms, and provide for remedial actions as may be appropriate. (b) All contracts in excess of the small purchase threshold shall contain suitable provisions for termination by the recipient, including the manner by which termination shall be effected and the basis for settlement. In addition, contracts must describe conditions under which the contract may be terminated for default, as well as conditions where the contract may be terminated because of circumstances beyond the control of the contractor. (c) Except as otherwise required by statute, an award that requires the contracting (or subcontracting) for construction or facility improvements must provide for the recipient to follow its own requirements relating to bid guarantees, performance bonds, and payment bonds unless the construction contract or subcontract exceeds $100,000. For those contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the Secretary may accept the bonding policy and requirements of the recipient, provided the Secretary has made a determination that the Federal Government's interest is adequately protected. If a determination has not been made, the minimum requirements are as follows: (1) A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price. The ``bid guarantee'' must consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder shall, upon acceptance of his bid, execute contractual documents as may be required within the time specified. (2) A performance bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``performance bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under a contract. (3) A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100 percent of the contract price. A ``payment bond'' is one executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as required by statute of all persons supplying labor and material in the execution of the work provided for in the contract. (4) Where bonds are required, the bonds must be obtained from companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties pursuant to 31 CFR Part 223_Surety Companies Doing Business with the United States. (d) All negotiated contracts (except those for less than the small purchase threshold) awarded by recipients must include a provision to the effect that the recipient, ED, the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, must have access to any books, documents, papers and records of the contractor which are directly pertinent to a specific program for the purpose of making audits, examinations, excerpts and transcriptions. (e) All contracts, including small purchases, awarded by recipients and their contractors must contain the procurement provisions of Appendix A to this part, as applicable.
