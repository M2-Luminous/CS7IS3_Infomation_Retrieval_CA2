Nevertheless, the Azeri Defense Minister has been refusing to sign this agreement till late evening. According to reliable sources, signing the agreement was postponed till 1000 on 17 May. The Azeri representative didn't come to this meeting, having left for Baku during the night, without notifying the sides. Political experts believe, the departure is related with aggravation of political situation in Azerbaijan, as opposition parties threatened to start political actions, if the agreement is signed. Russian President's Special Envoy Vladimir Kazimirov left to Baku on the same day. It's hard to guess whether Kazimirov will be able to persuade Azerbaijan in necessity of Russian presence, but he has declared several times that Russian forces will enter the conflict zone only if all sides agree with this. Reliable sources report, CSCE Minsk group chairman went to Moscow to participate in this meeting, but wasn't allowed doing so. We would like to remind that the Russian project stipulates a withdrawal of forces without preconditions in three days after a cease-fire is established. According to this project, troops will be introduced to Zangelanskiy and Dzhebrailskiy districts; regular police forces will be stationed in Agdamskiy and Fizulinskiy. Blockade is to be lifted only after the Armenian forces are withdrawn from Kubatlinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy districts. At the same time "AZG" reports, the Azeri representatives asked to postpone their decision till 2400 on 17 May, and refused to sign the document when the time came. Baku radio reported that the Azeri delegation didn't have the power for signing such an agreement. This information is confirmed by Russian "Novosti" TV program which said, there were two hindrances to the agreement. First is the Armenian demand to recognize Mountainous Karabakh as a side of the conflict and second, Azeri side not being empowered to sign the agreement. According to Novosti, the Azeri side declared yesterday they have no such power, and left to Baku for additional consultations. At the same time "Azatutyun" radio reported, after preliminary talks to the Azeri side Armenians have got the impression that Azerbaijan is ready to discuss the status of Mountainous Karabakh earlier than planned, ie immediately, after a cease fire is established.
