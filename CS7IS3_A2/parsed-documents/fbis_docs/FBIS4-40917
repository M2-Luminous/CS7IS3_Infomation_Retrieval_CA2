The party led by Vytautas Landsbergis and Giadiminos Vagnorius demands that the main item of the poll should be a 100-time indexation of people's deposits at savings banks, the speaker said at a news conference on Monday which was broadcast by national radio. He did not accept last Friday signatures of 413,110 Lithuanians in support of a referendum, which were collected by a sponsoring group of conservatives. Explaining reasons for his move, Jursenas said that "the old law is still in force. It lays down that such signatures should be handed over to the presidium of the Lithuanian parliament, an institution which is not provided for in the new constitution". Besides, sheets with signatures, hence the will of people, were not formalised with the final act, as it is provided for by the previous law. Therefore, he had no powers from parliament to receive 43 volumes of signatures. On the other hand, amendments to the law on referendum, which were adopted by parliament recently, were not approved by the Lithuanian president, which was well known to the sponsoring group. The legislature is to solve this "legal problem" on Tuesday. Leader of Lithuanian Conservatives Vytautas Landsbergis who also held a news conference on Monday, described the speaker's actions as "a demonstration of disrespect for the will of nearly 500,000 Lithuanian voters and a desire to win time".
