FBIS4-29617 "dreas118_l_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 16 Jun 1994 Philippines Official Opposes DPRK `Comprehensive' Sanctions Official Opposes DPRK `Comprehensive' Sanctions BK2006015394 Manila BUSINESS WORLD in English 16 Jun 94 p 12 BK2006015394 Manila BUSINESS WORLD English BFN [Text] Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo yesterday said "comprehensive" sanctions against North Korea following reports of its decision to withdraw from the International Atomic and Energy Agency (IAEA) are "premature" at this point in time. Instead, he said only "limited" sanctions, such as the IAEA's Board of Governors' decision to suspend nonmedical technical assistance to Pyongyang, are appropriate "at this point in time" because it symbolizes the concerns of the international community. The Philippines, a member of the IAEA's Board of Governors, supported the 10 June resolution of the Vienna based nuclear watchdog on the suspension of assistance to North Korea. The resolution was largely symbolic because Pyongyang has never availed of such technical assistance. "We (the Philippines) are not prepared to think of comprehensive sanctions at this point in time. We would rather encourage further dialogue between the IAEA and North Korea and its (Pyongyang) dialogue partners," Mr. Romulo said. "Moreover, we continue to believe that China can be the country that can make the difference and be a moderating force in this rather regrettable situation on the Korean peninsula," he added. He said the Philippines backed the IAEA action because it is a timely and limited measure "called for by the specifics of the situation" since the Stalinist North has yet to fully comply with current nuclear testing standards. The United States, South Korea, and Japan have voiced their concern on the Stalinist state's refusal to comply with IAEA requirements on nuclear inspection of North Korea's suspected nuclear facilities in Yongbyon. The three have threatened to impose sanctions on North Korea, with Tokyo reportedly contemplating on a package of possible steps such as a ban on cash remittances and trade restrictions. Remittances from the Korean community in Japan to the Communist North is estimated to amount to over $1 billion a year. The foreign affairs chief said it is important to explore all avenues for peaceful dialogue and to exhaust "every means of promoting" discussion before the international community resorts to sanctions. In this light, the Philippines is against possible economic sanctions against North Korea. The foreign affairs chief considers such sanctions "comprehensive." The Philippines called on North Korea to remain within the IAEA "for the sake of finding a peaceful solution to the issue" after Pyongyong declared its withdrawal from the Vienna-based U.N. agency. Mr. Romulo, who spoke to Philippine Ambassador to Vienna Reynaldo Arcilla yesterday morning, clarified that the IAEA Secretariat has yet to receive North Korea's notice of withdrawal. Under Article XVIII.D of the IAEA's statute, a state may withdraw from membership in the Vienna-based institution only if formal notice is given to the IAEA's depository state -- the United States. Until now, the IAEA Secretariat has not been informed by the U.S. Government of a withdrawal notice from North Korea. It further clarified that a "State's obligations under a safeguards agreement with the IAEA are independent of membership in the organization." Thus, North Korea still remains legally bound by its safeguards agreement with the IAEA under the non-proliferation treaty (NPT) agreement.
