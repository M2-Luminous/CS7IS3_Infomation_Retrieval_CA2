Churyumova and S.G. Dovbysh, All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Railroad Transportation; UDC 621.7.044:625.143.4] [Abstract] A technology of local hardening has been developed for the purpose of increasing the fatigue strength of railroad tracks in the vulnerable zone of bolt holes, namely by treating the quenched high-carbon M76 steel (0.71-0.82% C) rail steel with a detonation wave. In the experimental stage shock waves were generated by detonation of friable explosives (cyclonite, ammonite) and plastic explosives (seismoplast), the fuse cord passing axisymmetrically through the center of the bolt for either unilateral or bilateral hardening. Hardening tests were performed on 600 mm long rail segments with one drilled bolt hole 65 mm in diameter. Subsequent fatigue tests were performed in a TsDM-200/400 hydraulic vibrator under a cyclic flexural load alternating at a frequency of 5 Hz with a 700 kN amplitude and a 0.1 asymmetry index. The test base for the endurance limit was 2x10[.sup]6[/] cycles, cracking around the bolt hole in unhardened control specimens having begun already after 2x[.sup]5[/] cycles. Metallographic examination was performed under an MIM-8 optical microscope and in a ``Camebax'' microanalyzer. An analysis of the results indicates that there does not exist a one-to-one dependence of the rail life on the thickness h and/or the microhardness H of the thus hardened layer, but that the fatigue strength depends inversely on the hardenining gradient G= dH/dh: more uniform hardening (smaller gradient) results in a higher endurance limit and thus a longer life of bolted rails. A set of metal in excess of 0.3% evidently causes both microcracking and macrocracking. Optimum hardening with minimum roughness of the hole edges was attained by simultaneous bilateral detonation of seismoplast with a fuse cord. Figures 5; tables 1; references 8.
