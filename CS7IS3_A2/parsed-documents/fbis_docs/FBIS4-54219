The development of the new ultra-modern missile which is being hastened under the cloak of "nuclear non-proliferation" is a criminal act against nuclear disarmament, a renewed military operation against the independent third-world countries and a deliberate act for battening the U.S. war industrial monopolies, the analyst notes, and continues: The present U.S. administration declared that the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons is the "keynote of its state diplomacy." The United States, however, continues accelerating the modernisation of its nuclear weapons and, worse still, turns a blind eye to the development of nuclear weapons by its allies and some satellites, while casting suspicion and putting a bridle on the peaceful nuclear activities of the countries which go against the grain with it. The Pentagon seeks the aim of crushing the DPRK with strength in developing a new missile and in inveigling the allies into the execution of its strategy while setting afloat the rumour of "nuclear threat." The United States is drawing its allies including Japan into the execution of its aggressive strategy. The Korean people strongly oppose the U.S. moves to gain nuclear monopoly and build up arms and stifle anti-imperialist, independent countries including the DPRK under the cloak of "nuclear non-proliferation". The United States must not cry for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons only in words, but carry it into practice. It must, first of all, stop its wrong attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK engaged in peaceful nuclear activities under the pretext of the latter's fictitious "nuclear threat" and withdraw its nuclear weapons and troops from South Korea. And it must stop applying a double standard and cut back and, furthermore, completely scrap the existing nuclear weapons.
