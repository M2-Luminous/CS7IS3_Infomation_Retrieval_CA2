The source is one of the rare Western figures who have free access to Pyongyang and maintain close friendship with the Pyongyang leadership. "At a recent high-level meeting presided over personally by Kim Il-song, North Korea reaffirmed their policy that they cannot abandon their nuclear efforts unless there are clear assurances from the United States for improved U.S.-North Korea relations with the ultimate recognition of North Korea by the United States, lift of the existing trade embargo and for economic support," the source said. The source, whose latest visit to Pyongyang was timed with IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) inspectors' arrival in Pyongyang early this month, said he obtained the information from a ranking Pyongyang official with whom he has been on friendly terms. "It is feared therefore that unless these basic conditions are met, tension could build up between South and North Korea over the nuclear issue," the source said. He said that the United States in effect applies a rigid economic sanction against North Korea by limiting the amount of dollars carried by Korean-resident visitors to North Korea and banning trade with Pyongyang. The source observed that it appears North Korea has turned more intransigent as the international community's call for thorough nuclear inspection had threatened to diminish chances for the effective use of their "nuclear card." Until a while ago, North Korea planned to announce a limited opening if only there were a substantial progress in U.S.-North Korea relations such as the exchange of liaison offices, he added.
