The satellite will be carried by a rocket of the "Ariane" project design from the British company "Surrey Satellite Technology" of Surrey University. The satellite is called "Fasat-1" and is being developed by a group of Chilean and British aeronautic engineers. It weighs 50 kg and has four 80-centimeter sides. Initially, it will be placed in a low polar orbit 800 km from earth. It has a useful life span of six years. The satellite may be launched from platforms in French Guyana, Baykonur in Russia, or PRC platforms in Jiuquan or Jichank. According to the agreement signed with the British company -- which already has launched five similar satellites and manufactured two other ones for the ROK and one for Portugal -- two models will be manufactured. One will be put into orbit and the other will be a prototype to check on the flight design, develop the software, and then correct possible mistakes. This microsatellite, as it is defined in accordance with its international rank, will carry four experiments: communication with remote meteorological sites, aeronautic link with planes flying distant routes such as the Santiago-Easter Island route, permanent monitoring of emergency signals from planes and ships involved in accidents, and experiments with the detection of atmospheric ozone. The government plans to decisively incorporate space technology into the national community and create a national consciousness about the importance of this area as a logical prospect for future FACH action. This is why the government plans to stimulate educational and research organizations to analyze new ways of entering this advanced field. Currently, 15 FACH officers who are taking postgraduate courses in space sciences are working in this program. Three of them are taking a master's course on the subject. As a result of the agreement with the British company, the program has the two following stages. Immediately after the first satellite, "Fasat-2" will be launched. It is a constellation comprised of three microsatellites to be put into different orbits and will be manufactured in Chile. Finally, the "Geosat" will be launched in no more than 15 years. The "Geosat" will ensure a national telecommunications service based on two satellites placed in a geostationary orbit 36,000 km above the earth. To make this initiative available nationwide later on, the beginning of the FACH experimental conquest of space will be explained at the Technology Pavilion of Fidae '94 [International Aerospace Fair), which begins 20 March.
