He announced this today at a meeting with journalists. The head of the country's defense department denied reports by some of the foreign mass media that he had not left for Leningrad military district because of extreme social tension in society requiring, it is claimed, the presence in Moscow of a "strong hand". He also said that the reports that troops in Moscow military district had allegedly been put on an enhanced readiness footing were false. At the ITAR-TASS correspondent's request Pavel Grachev explained that he is one of those in possession of a so-called nuclear button. One button is with the Russian President, who is at present in Sochi; the second button is with himself; and the third is with the Chief of the General Staff, who has gone to France on a working visit. Pavel Grachev emphasized that, although the president has in his possession a control system for the strategic nuclear forces in the form of a "small nuclear case", there should always be one of the military leaders in Moscow at the permanent control point. "This evening the Chief of the General Staff is returning from Paris, and tomorrow I shall be leaving for Kaliningrad in accordance with the plan for visiting troops", Pavel Grachev stated in conclusion.
