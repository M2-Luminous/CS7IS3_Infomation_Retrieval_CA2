Eligible vessel means a vessel that has moratorium qualification and has an LOA that is less than or equal to the maximum LOA. Harvest or harvesting means any activity, other than scientific research conducted by a scientific research vessel, that involves the catching or taking of fish, the attempted catching or taking of fish, or any other activity that can reasonably be expected to result in the catching or taking of fish. Legal landing means any amount of a moratorium species that was harvested and landed in compliance with State and Federal regulations in existence at the time of the landing. Letter of authorization means a letter from NMFS to a vessel owner authorizing a vessel to make a legal landing of any moratorium species during the moratorium pending an initial written decision by NMFS on a vessel permit or license application or pending a final written decision by the Regional Director on an appeal. LOA means length overall as defined at §§672.2 and 675.2. Lost or destroyed vessel means a vessel that has been sunk at sea or been destroyed by fire or other type of physical damage and is listed on the U.S. Coast Guard Report of Marine Casualty, form 2692. Maximum LOA means a length overall assigned by NMFS for each original qualifying vessel that represents the greatest LOA to which a vessel may increase and continue to participate in the moratorium fisheries during the moratorium. For a vessel with an original qualifying length less than or equal to 104 feet (31.7 meters), the maximum LOA is 1.2 times the original qualifying length. For a vessel with an original qualifying length greater than 104 feet (31.7 meters) and equal to or less than 125 feet (38.1 meters), the maximum LOA is 125 feet (38.1 meters). For a vessel with an original qualifying length greater than 125 feet (38.1 meters), the maximum LOA is the original qualifying length.
