Soon after his return to Moscow on Thursday [16 June], the Russian president said in an exclusive interview with the evening "NEWS" program of the Ostankino TV Company that the regions he visited became closer to him politically. Yeltsin's trip, started on Tuesday, took him to the far eastern cities of Blagoveshchensk, a central city of the Amur region and Kyzyl, the capital of the Tuva Republic. On his way back to Moscow, he made a brief stop in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk on the final day of his tour. At a meeting with Kyzyl leaders, the president offered over 8 million U.S. dollars to the Tuva Republic for its economic development. Tuva, which joined Russia in 1914, has an area of 170,500 square kilometers with a population of 300,000. In recent years, the republic has shown light tendencies towards independence from Moscow. Yeltsin told Tuva leaders that the main economic indicators in the republic are worse than the Russian average, and then promised them a substantial aid from the federal budget. But he noted that "the republic cannot live by relying only on its own resources." He said, "The republic can go through the deep economic crisis only by closer cooperation with other regions and joining in the inter-regional association called the `Siberian Agreement.'" Yeltsin also said that "it is necessary" for the republic to develop relations with bordering Mongolia and with China. The Russian leader stressed that efforts should be made to implement the two decrees he signed in Tuva to develop the economy of the republic. According to the president, the former mistrust between Kremlin and the Tuva leadership has disappeared after his trip to Far East region.
