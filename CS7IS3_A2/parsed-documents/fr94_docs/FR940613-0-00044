FR940613-0-00044 FR940613-0-00015 The ISTEA included three narrow exceptions to the June 1, 1991, freeze date. Wyoming would have been able to allow the operation of additional vehicle configurations not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, provided they were authorized by State law not later than November 3, 1992. No additional vehicles were authorized, however, and accordingly no additional vehicles are included in appendix C over those listed in the previous two rulemakings on this issue. Ohio may allow LCV's with three cargo-carrying units of 28.5 feet each (not including the truck tractor) not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, to be operated within its boundaries on the 1-mile segment of Ohio State Route 7 which begins at, and extends south of, Exit 16 on the Ohio Turnpike. Alaska may continue to allow the operation of CMV's which were not in actual operation on June 1, 1991, but which were in actual operation prior to July 6, 1991. A preliminary list of the information provided by the States in response to sections 1023 and 4006 was published in the Federal Register as a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on March 20, 1992 (57 FR 9900). A second proposed list of vehicles and restrictions, including corrections, clarifications, and additional material submitted to the docket in response to the NPRM was published as a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) on February 25, 1993 (58 FR 11450). In the NPRM the information provided by the States was organized into appendices C and D to part 658; in the SNPRM that information was combined into a single list of vehicles and restrictions and presented as a new appendix C. The format of the SNPRM has been retained for the final rule. In response to publication of the SNPRM, 154 sets of comments were received from 136 separate entities. The vast majority of those comments deal with specifics on the information published in the SNPRM, and they will be discussed under individual topical headings. Four of the commenters, however, the American Trucking Associations, Inc. (ATA), the Wyoming Trucking Association, Inc. (WTA), the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities, and the Citizens for Reliable And Safe Highways (CRASH), provided comments concerning the rulemaking in general, and the philosophy used by the FHWA in presenting the information. These particular comments provide an opportunity for the FHWA to explain its approach. The ISTEA stipulates that the ``final list'' of LCV operational requirements for each State be published in the Federal Register not later than 180 days after the date of enactment. That date was June 15, 1992. The lead comment by the CRASH in its docket submission was that publication of the final list by the FHWA was ``long overdue.'' The CRASH contends that since the freeze does not take effect until the Secretary publishes the final list, the FHWA's delay in publication has prevented the law from taking effect. This in turn means that LCV's may today be operating on highways from which Congress intended they be barred. It concludes this comment by stating that the review and correction process included with the final rule can be used to make corrections after publication of the rule. As the FHWA stated in the Supplementary Information section of the SNPRM, the content of the States' original responses to the ISTEA request for LCV operational information covered the full range of what could be supplied, both in terms of items covered and volume of material. The diversity of the contents of the responses was so great that the FHWA determined that before any list could be finalized, increased uniformity both in terms of items covered and the type of information would be necessary. Thus, despite the likelihood that the statutory due date for a final rule might be missed, the FHWA determined that it was in the public's interest to publish a SNPRM soliciting further public comment on revisions to the initial list. The FHWA considered publishing a ``final list'' without this additional public procedure, but believed that the list published at that stage would have required numerous subsequent changes. We believe that the intent of Congress in including a correction process was to take care of relatively minor single-issue situations which may be discovered after publication of this final rule, not to make wholesale changes in a State's submission without good cause. The WTA expressed concern that the interpretations used by the FHWA in developing this rule have involved many combination vehicles that, until passage of the ISTEA, were not considered by anyone to be LCV's. In a similar vein, Alaska commented that the SNPRM ``seeks to significantly expand the ISTEA legislation and, we believe, severely constrains the states' abilities to legitimately regulate commercial traffic within each state.'' This final rule implements two similar, yet separate provisions of the ISTEA. Section 1023, as discussed earlier, involves LCV's and includes an LCV definition. The scope of vehicle combinations covered by this section is narrow. The definition requires that an LCV combination include a truck tractor, which by previous congressional action (section 411(f), Surface Transportation Assistance Act (STAA) of 1982) is defined as a noncargo-carrying power unit and two or more trailers or semitrailers. The combination must operate on the Interstate System, and its gross vehicle weight must be in excess of 80,000 pounds. The vehicles listed in appendix C as a result of this statutory definition include only what might best be described as the ``traditional'' LCV's, that is, the ``Rocky Mountain'' and ``Turnpike'' Doubles and the ``Triple.'' Under the definition of LCV provided by the ISTEA, it is true that the State of Alaska has no LCV's because it has no Interstate System mileage in the sense used in the ISTEA; that is, Alaska does not have Interstate System mileage designated under 23 U.S.C. 103(e), 139(a), or 139(b). Accordingly, all references to LCV's for Alaska have been deleted from this final rule.
