FR940902-0-00004 FR940902-0-00001 An example of how consumers reject smaller sizes is when kiwifruit is sold at the retail level out of 125 pound bulk bins. Consumers initially pick out the largest and higher quality kiwifruit, and displays are left with undersized and low quality kiwifruit that is rejected by later consumers. The committee's recommendation that the minimum size requirement be set at Size 45 will not significantly lower the volume of kiwifruit available in the fresh market. Although the committee reports that 12.1% of the California kiwifruit packout for the 1993/94 season was designated as Size 49, most of this total could be blended into the Size 45 designation because of the small difference between the two size designations. The practice of blending sizes makes it difficult to predict how much fruit will be eliminated by this rule, however, the committee estimates that the total packout will be reduced by only 1%. In addition, growers could adjust pruning, thinning, fertilizing, and irrigation techniques so that a larger percentage of kiwifruit will meet the higher size requirement. There is general agreement in the industry for the need to eliminate the packing of undersize fruit. Other alternatives have been suggested to eliminate shipments of low quality, undersized fruit, but would not adequately address the problem. One suggestion was to eliminate the blending of sizes by eliminating the size tolerances. This is not a realistic alternative, because as mentioned earlier, it would be cost prohibitive and impossible to achieve using today's packing methods. Another suggestion was to measure size by passing a fruit through a template with an opening large enough for an undersized fruit to fall through, but too small for a kiwifruit that meets the minimum size requirement to fall through. This template would be used to determine whether a fruit was undersized. However, this alternative does not take into consideration that kiwifruit grows in different shapes so that a heavier fruit that is short and broad could fall through a template while a lighter fruit that is long and narrow would not. Weight is currently used to measure size and is the most accurate measure of a kiwifruit's size. Another alternative presented at the meeting was to tighten the maturity requirements rather than the size standards so that undersized, immature fruit would not be shipped. However, not all undersized fruit is immature, but undersized fruit does tend to be more susceptible to quality problems. Thus, this alternative would not fully address the problem of blending in undersized fruit of inferior quality. Finally, another alternative presented at the meeting was to establish Size 45 as the minimum size, but continue to define it as 57 pieces of fruit instead of 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample as recommended by the committee. However, because of the approximately 0.12 ounce difference between a Size 45 kiwifruit defined as 57 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample and a Size 49 kiwifruit defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, this alternative would not go far enough to prevent the blending of undersized fruit. Section 8e of the Act provides that when certain domestically produced commodities, including kiwifruit, are regulated under a Federal marketing order, imports of that commodity must meet the same or comparable grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements. Since this rule increases the minimum size requirement under the domestic handling regulations, a corresponding change to the import regulations must also be implemented. Minimum grade, size, quality, and maturity requirements for kiwifruit imported into the United States are currently in effect under ยง944.550 (7 CFR 944.550). The minimum size requirement is specified in paragraph (a) of ยง944.550. This rule increases the minimum size requirement for imported kiwifruit from Size 49, which is defined as 60 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample, to Size 45, which is defined as 55 pieces of fruit per 8-pound sample. The increase in the minimum size requirement for importers of kiwifruit will also have a beneficial impact. This rule eliminates quality problems associated with undersized imported kiwifruit as it will for undersized domestic kiwifruit. In addition, the domestic trade's preference for larger size kiwifruit applies to imported kiwifruit as well as domestic kiwifruit. Thus, importers will benefit by improving the overall quality of kiwifruit shipments and increasing sales. The proposed rule concerning this action was published in the June 29, 1994, Federal Register [59 FR 33451], with a 30-day comment period ending July 29, 1994. Two comments were received, one in favor and the other in opposition to the proposed rule. The comment in favor of implementing the change set forth in the proposed rule was submitted by the Kiwifruit Administrative Committee and reiterated the arguments made in the proposed rule.
