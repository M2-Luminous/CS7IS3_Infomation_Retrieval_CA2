Dicenta emphasized to the Congress [of Deputies] Foreign Affairs Committee that "the Spanish Government may err on the side of generosity but not of naivety and passivity with respect to the Cuban people's suffering," and emphasized that "we also maintain scrupulous respect for Cuban sovereignty." There Is No Interference Hence he asserted that Spain's constant calls for respect for human rights and basic individual freedoms should not be interpreted as interference in Cuba's internal affairs. In his opinion, the good level of dialogue and relations between Spain and Cuba and the public and constant condemnation of the U.S. embargo do not prevent the government from reiterating its views on Cuba's future to the Fidel Castro regime. "We will emphasize the Spanish Government's firm resolve to cooperate in order to enable Cuba to emerge from the crisis and join the community of free and democratic countries with prosperous economies," Dicenta said.
