Saying that the Seoul government is looking into a real intention behind the remarks by Japan's Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano, the official said he felt sorry for a cabinet minister of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and contribution to the international community to have such a consciousness of history. "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to redress the past," the official maintained. Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the national daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN Tuesday by contending that the Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead designed for liberation of colonies and a greater East Asia coprosperity sphere. Nagano also argued that the "rape of Nanjing" in China was a hoax.
