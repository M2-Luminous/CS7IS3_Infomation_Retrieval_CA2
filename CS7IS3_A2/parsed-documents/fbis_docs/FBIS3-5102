The figure, representing the net balance in the nation's trade in goods and services and some unilateral transfers, totaled a preliminary 6.83 billion dollars before adjustments for seasonal factors, the ministry said. The January figures followed December's year-on-year gain of 9.3 percent to 12.57 billion dollars. That was a return to Japan's swelling black ink with the rest of the world after a November decline broke a string of six straight quarterly increases from year-earlier levels. Within the current account, the merchandise trade surplus -- the difference between exports and imports of merchandise -- rose 15.1 percent in January from a year before to 8.26 billion dollars, the ministry said. Exports rose 6.9 percent to 25.36 billion dollars, while imports rose 3.3 percent to 17.09 billion dollars.
