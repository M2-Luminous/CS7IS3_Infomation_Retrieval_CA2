The ministry believes its deficit should be 55 trillion rubles. The expenditure part comes to 178 trillion. We asked Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin what this money is going to be spent on. This is what he told us in a telephone interview. [Begin Dubinin recording] The expenditure part of the budget reflects those real outlays which have been planned by the government, set by the laws and resolutions, so to speak, and which we, the Finance Ministry, would not dare propose rescinding. We are proposing simply rescinding a whole series of laws, a whole series of resolutions, which we are simply unable to underpin financially with revenue, but there are things which inevitably have to be financed. Quite a large amount in our budget is spent, of course, on social and cultural measures. This comes to tens of trillions of rubles, and all this is a continuation of our policy aimed at supporting, on the one hand, the most needy areas, and also extending selective support to production sectors with capital investments, and in some areas, as in agriculture and the coal industry, with subsidies, although subsidies, of course, are not the best way of spending money. Russia's budget, like that of any other state, is burdened with the same historical state prerogatives, that is, the country's defense, international activity, the social sphere, and certain economic matters. There is hardly any point in telling you about the whole structure of the budget, especially as this is a draft, and there will clearly be certain alterations to it after the government has examined it, it has its own drafts, and it will be submitted to the State Duma. We tried at least to prevent the situation of industries and the social sphere from getting any worse, although it is quite difficult to do that when output is being cut generally, and the country is in a state of crisis. It is quite difficult to ensure a rise in the finance of one area or another, it is scarcely possible. Otherwise the whole structure of the budget has to be radically altered, say, totally stop financing one area and switch to another. Since no-one has taken such decisions, the structure of the 1994 budget will to a large extent look like the structure of the 1993 one. [end recording]
