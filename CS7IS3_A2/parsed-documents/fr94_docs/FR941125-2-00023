FR941125-2-00023 FR941125-2-00018 Determination Not To Revoke Countervailing Duty Orders AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Determination Not To Revoke Countervailing Duty Orders. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce (the Department) is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Brian Albright or Mercedes Fitchett, Office of Countervailing Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On August 31, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register (59 FR 44966) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty orders listed below. Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation and no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. Within the specified time frame, we received objections from domestic interested parties to our intent to revoke these countervailing duty orders. Therefore, because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke these orders. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). ‚ê£ 1Countervailing duty orders 1Effective date Argentina: Line Pipe (C&hyph;357&hyph;801) 09/27/88 53 FR 37619 Argentina: Standard Pipe (C&hyph;357&hyph;801) 09/27/88 53 FR 37619 Argentina: Heavy-Walled Rectangular Tubing (C&hyph;357&hyph;801) 09/27/88 53 FR 37619 Argentina: Light-Walled Rectangular Tubing (C&hyph;357&hyph;801) 09/27/88 53 FR 37619 Canada: New Steel Rail (C&hyph;122&hyph;805) 09/22/89 54 FR 39032 Israel: Roses (C&hyph;508&hyph;064) 09/04/80 45 FR 58516 New Zealand: Steel Wire (C&hyph;614&hyph;601) 09/02/86 51 FR 31156 Dated: November 16, 1994.
