Those who participated on the Israeli side were reserve Brigadier General 'Amos Gilbo'a and Dr. Yosi Olmert. On the Syrian side, there was Professor 'Aziz Shukri, dean of the Law Faculty at the University of Damascus, and another professor whose name was not given. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the document says that Syria agrees to peace with Israel based on the Egyptian model -- which includes the opening of embassies and trade, economic, and cultural ties -- in return for an Israeli withdrawal from the entire Golan Heights. Each stage in the normalization process will be accompanied by a withdrawal stage. Differences surfaced on the timeframe for the withdrawal and the fate of the Jewish settlements on the Golan, although the Syrians accepted the Israeli position that settlements should not be uprooted.
