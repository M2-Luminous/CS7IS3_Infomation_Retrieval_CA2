It is not possible now to know how it will be recorded or how the nation will remembered it. To a large extent, it will depend on its background in light of subsequent years. For now, we still lack the necessary distance for a thorough examination and a fair assessment. The passing year was rich in important events. It was a time of disputes and emotions, of thorough political reshuffles. The September elections changed the political configuration of the parliament. They handed over the helm of government to the left wing. They closed the first chapter in the history of the Third Republic, the chapter whose substance and form had been fashioned by political forces originating from Solidarity. The elections brought them the bitterness of defeat. Their actions and efforts did not get the voters' approval. I am convinced that time will correct this opinion and do them justice. Once the memory of things which are transitory in the lives of peoples fades, the true dimension of the achievements will become clearer--the undeniable achievements that have changed the face of Poland. The passing year was a year of disappointments but also of hopes. Our hopes came from a variety of sources. For some people these were the economic results heralding the beginning of growth, the overcoming of the economic collapse. For other people these were the political changes that have been carried out. These sources need not be mutually exclusive. I wish all of us to be able to receive hope from both of them in the coming year. May the new team not disappoint those for whom it was their hope. May it dispel the fears of those for whom it was a denial of hope. May it be bold but also prudent. While improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the state, may it not dampen its citizens' enterprise and initiative, and, while improving things that need improvement, not destroy the things that have started to bear fruit. The year that has passed was also a year of promises. That is a natural thing in an election year. Now comes the time of their verification. We have to change from electoral poetry to prose of governance. The next few months will show whether the force of words is backed by a real force of ideas and implementation. So may the year of promises not be followed by a year of disappointment. I wish the people wisdom of their rulers. I wish the country peace and success. I wish the state prosperity. May the year we are going to greet in a few hours' time be happy and more prosperous.
