Liberalism might also remain a considerable factor in shaping policies but not in the form of mass parties; rather, through its intellectual force. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] can be regarded as a new type of social democratic party, with extremely varied internal subdivisions. This is what we discussed with political scientist Mihaly Bihari, who was at one time connected to the Social Democrats and is now running in the election on the MSZP ticket. [Gazso] Reports are increasing about the chances of victory for the Socialists. Is this anticipated election success due to the spread of social democratic ideas or to "nostalgia," the personal charisma of individual politicians, or some skillful tactic in party politics? [Bihari] It can be attributed primarily to the failure of the Christian-conservative alternative that the demand for the other two alternatives--the liberal and the social democratic one--increased in Hungarian society. In the 1990 elections the country voted for a conservative, modernizing political course. However, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] failed for several reasons. The content of the modernization it proposed was not clear, the coalition sent the country in an economic catastrophe, and moreover, it operated the otherwise functioning political democracy in the wrong way. All of these factors resulted in the temporary failure of the conservative alternative. In our region, the new left appears in the form of socialist democracy: It is not communism, not reform communism, it does not represent a kind of old-fashioned "new left;" it intends to operate not merely in the spirit of reform, but not in an agrarian-plebeian spirit, either. Due to these features, this left can become a factor that can shape history and society in the long term. From this point of view, I consider the MSZP an accomplished social democratic party. Thus, in the history of Hungary these two alternatives--the social democratic and the conservative one--will alternate regularly, competing with each other, just as is customary in Western Europe. [Gazso] Many people say about the MSZP that it is a collective party of several trends and if it comes into power, these trends can easily conflict with each other. Is the danger realistic? [Bihari] According to the polls, the party might receive as much as 30-40 percent of the votes; this means more than 1 million voters. The political composition of these voters is extremely varied. Among them there are obviously people who have a nostalgia for the Kadar regime of the seventies, but they are not the ones who constitute the mass of supporters. Most of them spontaneously share the values of the left, reject too great social differences, consider the establishment of a social net and the efficient handling of unemployment important, and feel solidarity with the groups of society which are left behind and are forced to the periphery. Thus, in view of the political constitution of its voters, the MSZP is indeed a collective party, just like every other modern party. At any rate, the sociological composition of the voters gives a more truthful picture of internal subdivisions than the interviews given by certain politicians, or the position of certain individuals within the organization. It is another question altogether that concrete professional disputes can arise within the party. In the beginning there was indeed a difference between the economic policy draft put together by Laszlo Bekesi and the advertisement published last August and signed by the party chairman, but this difference of opinion was laid to rest in the course of the discussions in the fall, and today the party has only one program concerning this issue. [Gazso] How can governing social democratic parties work together with trade unions? [Bihari] There are examples of this cooperation going back several decades; let us consider, for example, the Scandinavian countries, the British Labor Party, the German Social Democrats, or the Spanish Socialist Party. These relations are hardly without conflict. The cooperation does not mean that the party rules the trade union or that the trade union rules the party. Both of them are forced to negotiate. Afterwards, the party must make other parties accept its position, and in the same way, the trade union must fight with other trade unions for the recognition of its position, and finally, all of this must be coordinated with the employers, as well. The participants of the modern "tripartyism," that is to say, the triparty negotiating system (government, employers, employees), coordinate their positions at a separate forum. Thus, the National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions [MSZOSZ] as a factor in the parliamentary group and the MSZP as governing party are not the ones to say the last word. After all, we are not dealing with a state party. [Gazso] Can the victory of the MSZP, or an eventual coalition between the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], have an effect on the party structure? Is it conceivable that the tripolar political system will become a bipolar one? [Bihari] Historically there is a chance that a left/left-center "party family" (MSZP, SZDSZ) will be formed on the one hand, and on the other, a right/right center group of parties (for instance, Association of Young Democrats [Fidesz], Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], Smallholder parties). This chance is too slight. In Hungary, liberalism has always been a very serious factor in forming political aspects, even if it was not expressed in mass parties. Thinking back on a 70-80 year history, I dare claim that various aspects of liberalism (a trend toward collectivism, modernized liberalism, or radical liberalism) do have a future, but liberalism has no chance of becoming a mass party. Liberals who want to express the concept of liberalism in the form of a mass party are sooner or later faced with a dilemma: Should they organize themselves like the parties on the left, or like the parties on the right? However, liberals who accept that liberal parties can have an effect primarily through their social sensitivity and high intellectual capability, and not as a mass-based party, will feel comfortable in a smaller party or in several civilian organizations of intellectuals. For Hungarian liberals, this is a realistic role. If they accept it, the three political centers will remain.
