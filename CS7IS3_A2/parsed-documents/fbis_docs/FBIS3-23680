Chernyshev, under the rubric "Details": "Was the Incident in Space an Accident? Awards Were Given Before the State Commission Drew Its Conclusions"] [Text] While the State Commission is still in session investigating the recent incident in space in which Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, who had turned over the reins to the new inhabitants of Mir, almost rammed their old living quarters as they flew by it after undocking the transport craft from the station, the cosmonauts have already been given high state awards for the flight. It's the opinion of specialists from the Control Center that it would have been more logical to wait until the investigation ended: what if the main cause for the incident was pilot error? The plan for time immemorial after the transport craft undocks from Mir has been that it fly around the station to inspect the exterior, says Viktor Blagov, the deputy flight director. During the fly-around, the transport craft got too close to the station. It seems that a light, glancing blow occurred. The response of the crew of Vasiliy Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov was adequate. "Had it been otherwise, would the result of the collision have been different?" "It would have been about the same." At worst, the station would have been punctured, which still wouldn't have meant a tragic outcome. Orbital craft are designed the way submarines are, that is, they're made up of sealed compartments. The arguments of the specialists are, perhaps, convincing, but also contradictory: according to the first reports from the Control Center, the problem involved possible damage to the docking assembly; then it was a glancing blow; and finally the most recent version -- no collision occurred at all. The most surprising thing about the story is that the people directly involved in it have, to this day, no information at all. "There are some interpretations of the telemetry, but nobody's telling us anything about it," said Aleksandr Serebrov in a telephone conversation. At NPO Energiya, to this day there are several versions of what happened. There was a collision, reports one specialist who should know, but they haven't been able to determine exactly where Mir was hit. In a fly-around the station by the new crew, no damage was seen. But just to make sure, a plan is being drawn up for the cosmonauts to make an EVA to make a careful inspection of the exterior. Technical problems, errors in planning, irresponsible actions by those executing tasks -- all those things are cropping up in this country's spaceflight and are approaching critical mass. Physician German Arzamazov, on the eve of the fifteenth mission to the Mir orbital station, caused a scandal and quit his job in the backup crew. The always emotionally reserved mission director Vladimir Solovyev has announced that the Control Center in Kaliningrad outside of Moscow is having to do extra work because the most basic order is lacking at Baykonur.
