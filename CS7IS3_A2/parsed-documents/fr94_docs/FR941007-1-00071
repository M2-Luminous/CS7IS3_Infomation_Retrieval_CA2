FR941007-1-00071 FR941007-1-00009 Under the revised proposal, the following aggregated loan data for small business and small farm loans would be placed in the public file: (1) the number and amount of loans in low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (2) a list of the geographies in which an institution made at least one loan; (3) the number and amount of loans inside and outside the institution's service area; (4) the number and amount of loans to minority- and women-owned businesses; and (5) the number and amount of loans to businesses and farms with annual revenues equal to or less than $1 million. Institutions would also be required to disclose the number and amount of community development loans outstanding. Institutions may elect to disclose publicly the number and amount of consumer loans to individuals and geographies by various income levels, and the number and amount of these loans made within and outside its service area(s). However, to protect the privacy interests of borrowers, an institution may not place in its public file any loan information described above for a particular year if special circumstances, such as a small number of loans or a limited number of geographies in the designated categories, could reasonably be expected to disclose the borrower's identity. A small institution would be required to include its loan-to-deposit ratio computed at the end of the most recent calendar year. The institution could include other data on its loan-to-deposit ratio if it believed the data would give a more accurate picture of its lending and lending-related activities. If a small institution elects to be rated under the lending, investment, and service tests applicable to larger institutions, it would be required to include in its public file all of the lending information described earlier in this preamble. An institution electing to be assessed under an approved plan would continue to provide a copy of its plan in the public file but would not have to disclose information submitted to the agencies on a confidential basis. In response to comments, the agencies have modified the provisions regarding the location of the public file. The complete public file would be required to be maintained at the institution's main office. In addition, at least one branch in each service area would be required to have copies of the bank's HMDA Disclosure Statements and all materials in the public file relating to the service area in which the branch is located. If a member of the public requested to review a bank's public file at a branch that did not have a copy, the bank would have to make a complete copy of the file for that service area available for review at the branch within 5 business days at no cost. Public Notice The December proposal would have required that institutions provide the Community Reinvestment Act Notice ``in the public lobby of its head office and each branch,'' and it would have set forth the Notice. The revised proposal makes minor changes to the Notice requirements. The term ``head office'' is changed to ``main office'' for clarity. Within the Notice, the statement of what is included in the CRA performance file would be expanded to describe more accurately the contents of the file. In addition, the revised proposal would require that the file include a map identifying the institution's service area, a list of its branches and ATMs in its service area, and a list of services the institution provides at each of the foregoing locations. Publication of Examination Schedule The December proposal would have required that each agency publish a list of the banks scheduled for CRA exams in each calendar quarter at least 30 days before the beginning of the quarter, and permitted members of the public to submit comments about a bank's CRA performance. The revised proposal would leave intact the provision concerning timing of publication, but delete as redundant the provision concerning public comment.
