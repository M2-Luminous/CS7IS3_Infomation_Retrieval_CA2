The Mitsubishi Company has been announced as the first Japanese company to establish a long-range business deal in Cuba. Also present in that investment is the Sumitomo Trading Corporation [name given in English], one of the largest automobile companies in Japan. Mitsubishi declared the Panamanian company, International Engines, its representative in Cuba. This company has been operating in the Cuban automobile market for more than 10 years. This is seen as a short-term investment with an immediate impact on the Cuban tourism sector, although the Japanese managers have expressed interest in extending their investments into other economic areas, and have confirmed their confidence in Cuban economic growth. The Cuban party said this investment implies the first economic rapprochement between Japan and Cuba.
