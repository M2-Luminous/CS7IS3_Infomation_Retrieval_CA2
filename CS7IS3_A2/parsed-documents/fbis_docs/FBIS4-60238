Israel will even step up its efforts in defense of the border area where army, security, and civilian personnel are deployed, Weizman added. He said: We will never abandon them because Israel is concerned with the security of this area and the fate of its inhabitants. At the end of a visit to the border area to convey congratulations on 'Id al-Adha, President Weizman met the press. Present were the South Lebanese Army's [SLA] General Lahd, some of the area's key figures, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, the commander of the northern sector, and the commander of the Liaison Force. Weizman said that peace in the Middle East rests with Syria and there is a link connecting Damascus, Beirut, and Amman on this issue. Weizman stressed that conducting unilateral talks with Lebanon depends on the Syrian president. I hope President Hafiz al-Asad will understand that the time is ripe for him to change his views concerning peace, he added. Before leaving the border area, Weizman held a 30-minute closed meeting with Gen. Lahd.
