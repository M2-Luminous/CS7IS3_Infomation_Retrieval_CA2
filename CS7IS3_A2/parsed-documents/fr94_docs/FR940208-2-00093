Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, an SRO is required to file promptly with the Commission notice of any ``final'' disciplinary action taken by the SRO. Pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of Rule 19d&hyph;1, any disciplinary action taken by an SRO for a violation of an SRO rule that has been designated a minor rule violation pursuant to the Plan shall not be considered ``final'' for purposes of Section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned person has not sought an adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his or her administrative remedies. By deeming unadjudicated minor violations as not final, the Commission permits the SRO to report violations on a periodic, as opposed to immediate, basis.
