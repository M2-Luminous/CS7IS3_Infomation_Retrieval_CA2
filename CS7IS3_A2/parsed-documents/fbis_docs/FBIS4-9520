Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) on Tuesday said the U.N. peace-keepers coming from the countries with which Yugoslavia has agreements on the elimination of visas would not need visas to enter Yugoslavia as of May 15. The Yugoslav Government had introduced entry visas and stay permits for all UNPROFOR members in mid-April. The government committee for cooperation with UNPROFOR took the stand that the mid-April decision did not pertain to the above specified cases, and instructed the Foreign and Interior Ministries to take the necessary steps. The Yugoslav Government also decided in mid-April that its prior approval would have to be obtained for the entry and movement of UNPROFOR transportation vehicles on Yugoslav territory, and that UNPROFOR personnel carriers would have to use only the roads designated by Yugoslav authorities. The committee, for its part, decided that UNPROFOR in future pay for all services on Yugoslav territory, including the use of facilities, which Yugoslavia had covered so far.
