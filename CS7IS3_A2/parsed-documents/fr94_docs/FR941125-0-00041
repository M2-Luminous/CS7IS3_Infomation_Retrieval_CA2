ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. These amendments are needed to implement changes in the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), giving the Secretary additional powers to assure the safety of reserve funds and assets maintained by guaranty agencies insuring educational loans under the FFEL Program pursuant to agreements with the Secretary. The amendments further define ``reserve funds and assets'' and establish the substantive standard for the return of ``unnecessary'' reserves. They also provide procedural due process for challenges to these orders and for orders requiring that reserve funds and assets outside of the guaranty agency's control be returned to it or to the Secretary. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect July 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Donald M. Feuerstein, Senior Advisor, U.S. Department of Education, 600 Independence Avenue SW., (Room 4624, ROB&hyph;3), Washington, DC 20202&hyph;5343. Telephone: (202) 401&hyph;2280. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The FFEL Program regulations (34 CFR Part 682) govern the Federal Stafford Loan Program, the Federal Supplemental Loans for Students Program, the Federal PLUS Program, and the Federal Consolidation Loan Program (formerly the Guaranteed Student Loan programs). These programs provide loans to eligible student or parent borrowers who might otherwise be unable to finance the costs of postsecondary education. The loans are guaranteed by State or private, non-profit guaranty agencies designated by the Secretary, which are required to maintain reserves to support those guarantees. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66) (OBRA), enacted August 10, 1993, added section 422(g)(1) of the HEA, which codified the long-standing and judicially-supported principle that guaranty agency reserve funds and assets are ``the property of the United States to be used in the operation of *␣*␣*'' the FFEL Program and the Direct Loan Program. To protect the Federal fiscal interest in the guaranty agency reserve funds and assets, OBRA authorized the Secretary to direct: (1) The return to the Secretary of ``unnecessary'' reserves from guaranty agencies (section 422(g)(1)(A)), (2) the return to the guaranty agency or to the Secretary under specified circumstances of guaranty agency reserves and assets held by, or under the control of, any other party (section 422(g)(1)(B)), and (3) guaranty agencies to cease any ``misapplication, misuse, or improper expenditure'' of reserve funds or assets (section 422(g)(1)(C)). On August 10, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the FFEL Program in the Federal Register (59 FR 41184). Those proposed regulations were developed in accordance with section 422(g)(1)(D) of the HEA, which requires that standards and procedures for section 422(g)(1)(A) and (B) be developed through negotiated rulemaking. Monthly negotiated rulemaking sessions were held from January through June 1994 in and around Washington, DC. Consensus was reached on all of the rules proposed in the NPRM and on the accompanying preamble discussion. The Secretary specifically relies upon that consensus and preamble in issuing these final rules without substantive change from the NPRM. These regulations improve the efficiency of the Federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary education. Encouraging students to graduate from high school and to pursue high quality postsecondary education are important elements of the National Education Goals. The student aid programs also enable current and future workers to have the opportunity to acquire both basic and technologically advanced skills needed for today's and tomorrow's workplace. They provide the financial means for an increasing number of Americans to receive an education that will prepare them to think critically, communicate effectively, and solve problems efficiently, as called for in the National Education Goals.
