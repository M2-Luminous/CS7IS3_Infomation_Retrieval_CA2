FR940602-0-00009 FR940602-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Office of Thrift Supervision 12 CFR Part 574 [No. 94&hyph;20] RIN 1550&hyph;AA63 Acquisition of Control of Savings Associations; Applications, Approval Standards and Procedural Requirements AGENCY: Office of Thrift Supervision, Treasury. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is amending its acquisition of control regulations to implement section 211 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). The final rule specifies additional factors that the OTS must consider in acting on applications to acquire savings associations under section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (HOLA). The intended effect of these amendments is to conform OTS regulations to the statutory changes. In addition, the OTS is amending its acquisition of control regulations to reflect the previous combination of the various holding company application forms in order to provide consistency between the forms and the regulations, to eliminate confusion, and to streamline the regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Sjogren, Program Manager, Corporate Analysis, (202) 906&hyph;6739, Supervisory Operations, Robyn Dennis, Program Manager, (202) 906&hyph;5751, Policy, or Kevin A. Corcoran, Assistant Chief Counsel, (202) 906&hyph;6962, Corporate and Securities Division, Office of Thrift Supervision, 1700 G Street, NW., Washington, DC 20552. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The OTS is adopting a final rule that revises its acquisition of control regulations to include new supervisory factors that the FDICIA requires the OTS to consider in reviewing and acting on applications to acquire savings associations under section 10(e) of the HOLA. These changes are required by section 211 of the FDICIA, Public Law 102&hyph;242, 105 Stat. 2236. In addition, the OTS is amending its acquisition of control regulations to reflect the previous combination of the various holding company application forms. On November 23, 1993, the OTS issued notice of a proposal to amend the agency's regulations implementing section 10(e) of the HOLA in accordance with section 211 of the FDICIA, and to amend the acquisition of control regulations to reflect the combination of the holding company application forms. 1 The public comment period expired on December 23, 1993. 1 58 FR 61850 (November 23, 1993). Section 211 of the FDICIA provides that the OTS must disapprove an application to acquire a savings association under section 10(e) of the HOLA: (1) If the company fails to provide adequate assurances to the OTS that the company will make available to the OTS such information on the operations or activities of the company, and any affiliate of the company, as the OTS determines to be appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with the HOLA; or (2) in the case of an application involving a foreign bank, if the foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by appropriate authorities in the bank's home country. Section 211 of the FDICIA also provides that the OTS's consideration of the managerial resources of a company or savings association shall include consideration of the competence, experience and integrity of the officers, directors and principal shareholders of the company or savings association. The OTS is adopting the final rule substantially as proposed. As proposed, the final rule, rather than including a separate definition of the term ``principal shareholder,'' relies on existing terminology, ``controlling shareholder,'' in the OTS acquisition of control regulations for this purpose, and requires the OTS to consider the competence, experience, and integrity of ``controlling shareholders.'' 2 2 Under the OTS acquisition of control regulations, a ``controlling shareholder'' is ``any person who directly or indirectly or acting in concert with one or more persons or companies, or together with members of his or her immediate family, owns, controls, or holds with power to vote 10 percent or more of the voting stock of a company or controls in any manner the election or appointment of a majority of the company's board of directors.'' 12 CFR 574.2(g). In addition, the final rule provides that the OTS also will consider whether an applicant has provided the OTS with adequate assurances that it will make available such information on its operations or activities, and the operations or activities of any affiliate of the applicant, that the OTS deems appropriate to determine and enforce compliance with the HOLA.
