At a press conference after the day's cabinet meeting, Hata, who is also deputy prime minister, said political reform is a problem for each member of the Diet, and the prime minister can not deal with it by himself. Hata indicated parliament must shoulder the responsibility if the political reform package fails to be passed. The ruling coalition parties and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party are continuing negotiations on a compromise after the House of Councillors rejected the bills last Friday. The bills cleared the more powerful lower house in mid-November. Following the upper house rejection of the bills, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa said he would keep trying to realize his commitment to political reform until Saturday, the last day of the current extraordinary Diet session. Hosokawa has repeatedly pledged to take responsibility if he fails to enact the reform bills by the end of the Diet. The pledge is interpreted as indicating his readiness to disband his cabinet or dissolve the lower house to seek a snap election on the issue of political reform should the reform bills be scrapped.
