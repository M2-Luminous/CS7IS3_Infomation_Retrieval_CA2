Professor Beganovic, can you tell us about the health situation of the citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Beganovic] This situation is rather grave. There is undernourishment. There are epidemics of infectious diseases, although they have not been widely spread, they have not grown into pandemics. For that, we can, above all, thank our people, who know how to maintain hygiene even under such conditions and also thank our medical staff who are making efforts and [words indistinct] to help people as much as possible. [passage omitted] In this free part of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, we have about 70,000 seriously wounded people, a large number of disabled, a large number of paraplegics, a large number of cases of chronic diseases, a large number of cases of psychological disorders, and, generally speaking, we were very rarely able to help and do something for the improvement of health. We were trying to save lives, we were saving elementary health so a person would not die, would survive, and then, with time, we shall try to return him to full health. [passage omitted]
