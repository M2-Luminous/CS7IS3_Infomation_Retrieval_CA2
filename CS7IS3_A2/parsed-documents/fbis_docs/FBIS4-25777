The former is on the Korean Peninsula, and a war seems to be erupting. The latter is in Bosnia, in southern Europe, and Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev said that if the situation were not handled well, it would result in a world war! As a matter of fact, whether the situation is more tense in the East or in the West, it will only lead to an outcome, that is, the situation will relax after a moment of tension, and no war will erupt. Neither the situation on the Korean Peninsula nor that in Bosnia will trigger a world war. The situation on the Korean Peninsula is tense. After seceding from the IAEA, the DPRK now is saying that it may withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States said that it would impose severe sanctions on the DPRK and that if the motion is not adopted by the UN Security Council, it -- together with its several allies -- would impose sanctions on the DPRK. The DPRK's reaction, however, was that: If you impose sanctions on us, it will mean a war. It seems there is no leeway left. Is this the case? The answer is no. Former U.S. President Carter is now maneuvering in the DPRK. China too is persuading various parties and hopes that the talks can be resumed to bring about peace. Russia also took the stand of discussing and settling the dispute through talks when it proposed the idea of calling an international conference. The most fundamental question is: Who wants to go to war? Is it the DPRK? No, it cannot afford a war. In modernized warfare, a small country with few soldiers will use up all its strength very quickly, which is not worthwhile. What about the United States? Clinton is full of worries and dares not make any decision, even when thinking for a long time about dispatching troops to Haiti to deal with the 7,500-strong Haitian armed forces, who are equipped only with obsolete firearms dating back to World War II, so he certainly will not provoke the DPRK troops, who are more ferocious. If half of the more than 30,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in the ROK are killed, would he still be President? As said before, the DPRK really wants to open a dialogue with the United States, to win U.S. diplomatic recognition, and to receive U.S. economic aid. In any case, no war will erupt as long as no party really wants it. As the saying goes, one hand alone cannot clap; now that neither hand wants to clap, how can a sound be made?! On the other hand, the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have adopted a resolution to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, but Clinton can use his presidential power to veto it. The Congress needs a two-thirds absolute majority vote to overrule Clinton's veto. Now Russia is not the only country against lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims; Britain and Canada also object to it. Clinton must seriously consider this. Even if the arms embargo is lifted, it will not necessarily lead to a world war. Who is going to fight the so-called world war? Russia and the United States? A nuclear war? Their strategic nuclear missiles are no longer trained on each other. The United States is using its money and technology to help the Russians dismantle their nuclear weapons, and U.S. experts and journalists have visited Russian nuclear missile bases, which in the past were kept absolutely secret. Moscow is placing its hopes for economic restructuring on the West; how can it be in the mood to fight a war! Kozyrev's bluff only lays him open to ridicule!
