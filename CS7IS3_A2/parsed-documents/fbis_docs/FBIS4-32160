Smejkal told CTK that the priority goal of the HSMS, registered on June 1, was self-rule for Moravia. He said that the participants in the constituent congress considered the movement a successor organisation to the original Self-Governing Democracy Movement for Moravia and Silesia (HSDMS) which was transformed into the present Bohemian and Moravian Centre Party (CMSS) in January. Some members of the original movement, especially those active at Brno's local administration, disagreed with the move. Delegates from the Brno organisaton accused CMSS Chairman Jan Krycer at the CMSS congress on June 4 "of a loss of prestige of the party, disintegration of the organisational structure and decline in the party's popularity." The CMSS has 9 out of a total of 200 parliamentary seats. But according to the latest public opinion polls, it would not cross the parliamentary border of 5 per cent now.
