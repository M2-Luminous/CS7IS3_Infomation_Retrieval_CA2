Their move came as senior Tories urged MPs and European election candidates to concentrate their fire on opposition policies, amid growing concern that party infighting over the EC is harming its local and European election campaigns. Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, said yesterday: "What the party should do is get on to the attack against the Labour Party and the Liberal Party, and set out the fundamental differences and the gap between our view of of Europe and their view of Europe." Senior Tories are furious at the way "fanciful" reports claiming Mr Major was contemplating withdrawing from the European Community have dominated the final stages of the campaign for Thursday's local elections, and threaten to overshadow the forthcoming launch of the party's European electlon campaign. But there was fresh confusion last night over the Tory Euro-manifesto, which is being revised at Mr Major's insistence. On Friday Mr Major said it would be published "in a few days'time." Yesterday, however, senior party sources said it would not be released until the third week of May. Ministers on the party's Right say they are less concerned with the detail of the manifesto than with the Government's long-term plan to ensure that Britain's agenda wins the day in the 1996 inter-governmental conference, which will hammer out the successor to the Maastricht Treaty. They want the Government to draw up detailed proposals -- including plans to reduce the EC's power and a new system of voting within the European Council -- to be published well in advance of the conference. The Right will also seek Conservative manifesto commitments for the next general election to keep Britain out of a single currency, and to use the veto to block any further moves towards a more federal EC constitution. A radical plan to curb the powers of the Commission will be published this week by the European Policy Forum [EPF], an independent think-tank with influence in the Foreign Office and Downing Street. The EPF proposes breaking the European Commission's grip on policy by splitting it into three separate bodies with responsibility for overseeing the single market, financial programmes and international trade. Euro-sceptic Tory MPs are furious with Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, who on Friday accused them of being "out of touch with reality." One prominent Tory backbencher said yesterday: "It is not the Euro-sceptics who are out of touch but Douglas Hurd. He is not only out of touch but out of credibility. If his constant refrain that Europe is coming our way is the sick joke of the decade."
