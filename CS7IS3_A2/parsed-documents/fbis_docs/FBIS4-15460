Kostikov told a briefing here today that the military sometimes call a base an object. Thus, the Skrunda Radar Station was named a base by mistake instead of an object. "None has planned to build a military base, and the Latvian leadership was presented apologies in connection with the technical mistake," he said. As for military bases in Commonwealth States, the Russian military presence there is intiated by the Commonwealth States themselves, stressed the presidential press secretary.
