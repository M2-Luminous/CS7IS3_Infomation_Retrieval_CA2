One of the issues of the paper carried a story headlined "Spring Has Come. The Indefatigable Politician Is Buzzing Around," which says the phrase "Eurasian Union" is aimed at "simpletons." "Uzbekistan still has a long way to go to reach the level of Europe, where states can afford the luxury of unification without being afraid to find themselves under somebody else's dictatorship," the story says. "The essence of the Eurasian Union idea is not new. It pursues the aim of restoring the Soviet Union, which is nothing but gibberish," the story says. Such was the first reaction in Uzbekistan to Nazarbayev's idea. The newspaper received the story from the Republic's national news agency. Kiev -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, in comments to journalists, called Nazarbayev's initiative "premature," but said it "needs serious study." He said the final decision on it should not be the prerogative of the heads of state of the countries concerned but ought to be based on referendums in them. Kravchuk said he objected to the dissolution of the CIS, which, he said, had not yet exhausted its potential.
