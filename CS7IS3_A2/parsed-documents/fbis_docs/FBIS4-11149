This topic was addressed by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina. Here is a report on this morning's session by journalists Zenaida Costales, Maria Elena Alonso, and Orlando Contreras [as heard]: [Begin Contreras recording] Upon talking this morning about emigration problems, their origin, the nature of this conference, and the desire to pursue work jointly with the emigre community in order to normalize relations, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said that Cuba realizes the time has come for consular facilities to exist not only in Washington, and that the U.S. authorities are aware of this opinion. Robaina said he felt it was necessary to give this conference some continuity, and also said he feels that the diversity of ideas within the emigre community should not constitute an obstacle to continuing this work. The foreign minister said: Cuba is not giving up on the emigres, and the emigres are not giving up on the fatherland. Robaina explained: The society summoning them is not a bankrupt society, and added that all the proposals being presented at this meeting will be studied. The foreign minister summed up the history of Cuban emigration, the historical circumstances surrounding it, and its nuances -- from Heredia to Wilfredo Lam -- and the (?fundamental) differences that exist between the emigre community in favor of annexation, and that part of the community that demands that the nation's sovereignty, history, and culture remain intact and linked to its projected future, both inside the United States and in other countries. Robaina's words led to a discussion that, like the first day's, unfolded within a framework of respect and a willingness to seek feasible solutions, the culmination of which obviously overflows the framework of this conference of only three working days. However, to judge by the statements of emigres, problem areas and possible solutions are being identified; and areas for concrete proposals by the emigre community to the nation -- topics such as the emigres' entry into and exit from Cuba; the positive tone of the change in perceptions of an important part of the emigre community, also linked to the nation's understanding toward those Cubans; and other specific matters. Just a few moments ago, conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso gave a briefing [preceding word in English] on this morning's work. [end recording] [passage omitted]
