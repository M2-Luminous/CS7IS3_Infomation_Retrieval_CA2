The CAP believes it is important to give peasants greater access to posts of democratic representation to ensure that agricultural problems are discussed as "national high-priority" issues. In exchange, the CAP commits itself to promote voting in the countryside and to fight abstentionism because this is how to channel the social and political demands of this sector to the state. This organization, made up of 11 national peasant associations, warned that if the government fails to modernize itself and to allow new local, regional, and national politicians, it will continue to slowly lose its legitimacy, thus promoting the emergence of new opposition groups. In its document entitled General Guidelines To Preparing the CAP Proposals To Modernize the Countryside With Social Justice, which will be discussed on 30 April and 1 May by all CAP members and will eventually be submitted to the new president, the CAP demands political democracy and insists that the new "countryside politicians" cannot be left out of the decisionmaking process and the drafting of policies geared toward the rural social sector. In its analysis, the CAP highlighted the Chiapas issue and the need to amend Article 27 of the Constitution and to upgrade the Program of Direct Support to the Countryside (Procampo) to constitutional rank. The CAP also believes that at least $4 billion must be earmarked for Procampo annually and that expired portfolios from official and commercial banks must be written off. The CAP also noted its decision to join the national peace and reconciliation efforts because "neither armed nor legal violence is good for anyone." The organization maintained "all interests at stake are legitimate;" thus, it suggested "a reconciliation by way of compromise." The CAP document, which will be discussed within the organization, indicates "the only condition we demand is justice and understanding. Should we pay any costs, these must be fair, and we must have the absolute guarantee that socioeconomic and political benefits will be fully enjoyed." The document, which includes statistics on the evolution of international prices for basic grains and on production and harvesting costs, states the following: "The costs incurred and sacrifices made during a reform must be limited; should they not be evenly and fairly shared, any modernization project will fail." As the CAP added that the end of paternalism means autonomy for the rural social sector, not a "divorce from the state," the organization, which will mark its fifth anniversary this year, stressed: "Accepting socioeconomic development is not populism. We demand fair conditions to compete at the level of the NAFTA trade partners." As it addressed political issues, the CAP pointed out it already planned to meet with all presidential candidates to know beforehand their projects for the countryside and to make sure "our organizations will have solid foundations on which to choose a candidate." The organization also said its members agreed to "work for the opening of opportunities in the decisionmaking of the institutions involved in the fight against abstentionism and in the campaign to convince people to vote. As political entities, we cannot be left out of the drafting of political decisions." The agrarian organization believes strategic alliances are necessary at all stages of primary production, industrialization, and commercialization to be "competitive in final, selective, or intermediate markets. The alliances and commitments among our organizations, industrialists, and businessmen are essential for each one of us, always under the possibility of being straightforward and complying with the already signed agreements."
