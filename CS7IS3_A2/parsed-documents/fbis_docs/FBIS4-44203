This failure was not intended (it is difficult to accuse the head of state of being "guilty of association with criminals," as Jean Carbonara, joint author of a damning report on the Rwandan "death squads," did), but it bears witness to the failure of a "particular" African policy. To understand this clearly, it is necessary to go back to 1990. Africa was then part of the head of state's "preserve." In the Elysee, an "Africa group" advises and guides Francois Mitterrand's decisions. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, his father's son, headed that body, which virtually has decisionmaking power without any outside control. He was helped by Gilles Vidal. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand scarcely has any diplomatic experience. A former AFP journalist in Lome, he was appointed almost by "imperial fiat." There is no dispute about that. Many "scandals" were to characterize the term which Jean-Christophe Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal spent at the head of the presidency's Africa group. The most recent ones took place in the Ivory Coast (speculation in cocoa and coffee) and in Liberia (games of influence and money with the mineral resources of that country ravaged by war). When war broke out in Rwanda in 1990, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand and Gilles Vidal obviously had ringside seats. The Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry], disqualified by the presidency, does not have any African policy. The presidency immediately reacted to the "invasion" of the rebels: the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] soldiers who came from Uganda were presented as the "Khmers Rouges" of Africa. Paris had clearly designated an "enemy," a word regularly heard at the time in military and diplomatic circles. On the basis of this position of principle, Paris sided with the Rwandan Government led by President Juvenal Habyarimana. Not without arguments, but unconditionally. The French soldiers, sent in October 1990 to bring out the foreign nationals, remained there while the Belgian soldiers, once the operation was over, returned home. In the name of defense agreements signed between the two states, Paris provided logistical support and instructors for the Rwandan Army. No dialogue was opened with the rebels: Are they not France's "enemies?" "The Fachoda [place in Upper Volta which was ceded to the British in 1899] complex, the view of French speakers against English speakers, the statements about the RPF -- the Khmers Noirs of Africa, our enemies... That is all true!" a very highly placed source now admits. In January 1991, in other words, after four months of uninterrupted French military presence in Rwanda, President Francois Mitterrand sent a letter to the Rwandan head of state. Dated 30 January 1991, this letter provides a framework for the French doctrine. Declaring himself to be "profoundly disturbed by the harmful consequences which the continuation of destabilizing military action could have for peace in the region," Francois Mitterrand stated that this "conflict can only find a lasting solution through a negotiated settlement and general cooperation." He put forward three conditions and added, for President Habyarimana's benefit: "In light of the difficulties being experienced by your country, I would like to assure you once again of France's support." Arms Supplies Things are clear: Francois Mitterrand talks of "support." A very highly placed source admits that the first arms supplies then started: "In 1991, France supplied the Rwandan state with 7 million francs [Fr] worth of military equipment. In 1992, we supplied the equivalent of Fr14 million worth. In 1993, Fr7 million worth." In other words arms worth a total of Fr28 million. The latest supplies date back to February 1993. "It is true that in February 1992, we supplied a large amount," this official, who has access to all the documents, admitted. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand did not remain inactive. He made many trips to the region: "He tried," it is now being said, "to establish contact with the RPF." The initial line of support for the Rwandan Government, hastily established, was strengthened as time went by. The French soldiers who remained on the spot were also affected by this increasingly hostile attitude toward the RPF: "The military," it is admitted, "made Rwanda a personal cause." This is understandable: Sent by the political authorities in the framework of a support mission for an army, the French soldiers, by dint of their proximity to the Rwandan Army and the fact that they were training it, eventually established friendly relations. More seriously: French diplomacy, largely informed by the military, bowed to them and repeated what they said without any reservations: For instance, one diplomat abroad stated in 1992 that the massacres allegedly perpetrated by the government militias were mere "rumors." In August 1991, the first contacts were established between the Elysee and the RPF. It had taken 11 months. In July 1992, real talks started. But the French parliamentary elections were approaching, and defeat was looming: It was necessary to protect the rear. Jean-Christophe Mitterrand left the Elysee's Africa group. He was "appointed" to an important position in a big French company and regularly visits Africa. Gilles Vidal, his deputy, was appointed ambassador to Cameroon, to the great displeasure of "career" diplomats. The new heads of the Elysee Africa group -- Bruno Delaye and Dominique Pin -- took over the issue in July 1992. The policy originally decided was continued. Even now, in its official chronology, the Elysee, referring to the RPF, talks of "inkotanyi," in other words, "cockroaches" in Kynyarwanda. However, slight but important changes were made by the new team. Witness the letter sent on 28 August 1993 by RPF President Alexis Kanyarengwe to Francois Mitterrand: The RPF, the rebel leader writes, "thanks" France for the "role of observer it has played during our negotiations." As proof that it was a reconciliation, the RPF president took the precaution of adding: "France and the RPF have not always shared the same viewpoint with regard to the French Government's position on this conflict." That is an understatement. Especially because mistakes were building up. At the beginning of 1993, the International Human Rights Federation published a damning inquiry report on the Rwandan regime. The leaders of the death squads in the pay of the regime were named, and it spoke of the first signs of a genocide. The Rwandan head of state was criticized by name. The report reached the Elysee. However, the authorities took no account of it. In fall 1993, Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana was received in Paris by Francois Mitterrand. It was an official visit with a red carpet and guard of honor. Did Francois Mitterrand then discuss the problems raised by the report on the death squads published at the beginning of that same year of 1993? "Yes," the Elysee now says. One official relates: "The president said to the Rwandan head of state: `Iniquities, unacceptable things have come to my attention. I know that you are heading a country at war but...' The Rwandan president then replied to Francois Mitterrand: `Yes, I know about this, but I am not responsible. There are extremists. I have called for investigations. Those guilty of iniquities will be prosecuted before the courts." Franco-African Family No condemnation was ever pronounced by a Rwandan court. At a meeting in Kigali six months ago, Mr. Nkubitu, the capital's public prosecutor, said: "The tragedy in this country is that everybody knows who is guilty and no official has ever been brought before the courts. In our country, there is no justice." Last April, at the start of the "genocide," Mr. Nkubitu was able to flee Kigali in incredible circumstances: He hid in a sack of potatoes. He is now living in exile in Belgium. It is the presidency which provided a final document for the file: a letter sent by Francois Mitterrand to U.S. President Bill Clinton on 27 September. Reaffirming the importance of implementing the Arusha agreements, Francois Mitterrand urged Bill Clinton to intervene to ensure that a UN force was finally deployed in Rwanda: The international community must react rapidly or the terms of the agreement, Francois Mitterrand writes, "are likely to be violated." "When I took office," a top official now admits, "I wondered about the French presence in Rwanda. It was explained to me that Burundi and Rwanda had joined the `Franco-African family.' They should not be abandoned."
