We have been informed the negotiations extended because the peace commissioner and Subcommander Marcos held a meeting with representatives of nongovernment organizations who have staged a security siege around the cathedral since 19 February. We have been informed reporters will have access to the cathedral at 1930, 30 minutes before the participants give statements. [Unidentified announcer] Is that within one hour? [Armenta] Correct. In the meantime, Subcommander Marcos said this morning the political parties are more interested in leading the talks than in resolving problems. Subcommander Marcos met again this Thursday with representatives of the media, particularly radio media, which did not have access to the San Cristobal de las Casas Cathedral yesterday. The EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] subcommander said the representatives of the parties with whom he met on 22 February never heard his demands and just argued among themselves, as if they were at the Chamber of Representatives. Marcos explained no agreement was signed with representatives of the PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution], PDM [Mexican Democratic Party], Cardenist Front for National Reconstruction Party, Mexican Green Ecologist Party, and the Labor Party to incorporate the EZLN demands to the political platforms of each of these parties. He added: It seems they only came to have their pictures taken with the EZLN delegates. [Begin Subcommander Marcos recording] Certain parties did not come due to the masks with which we are covering our faces. They think that is not hygienic. Others prefer to wait and see what will happen or perhaps fear the movement wants them here to accuse or attack them. We expected those who came would listen to us; instead, they came and said hello. We tell them we want them to monitor the talks and not leave us alone. We told them we are ready to follow the path of peace, if it will lead to an obtainment of our demands. Then they started to talk and discuss, as if they were at the Chamber of Deputies. We then waited until they stopped talking. They were not talking to us at that point. Then, one of them said we, the party of national or international journalists, want.... [pauses] Then another party official got upset and said we.... [pauses] Then they started a debate [words indistinct]. We waited to see when they would become tired, and when we realized they would never become tired, we told them we had to go, because the beans were getting cold. [end recording] [Armenta] The EZLN subcommander insisted on the need for the presidential candidates to commit themselves to respecting the accords that may be signed here at the San Cristobal table, so that whoever wins the elections follows up on these commitments. I can also report the members of the Special Commission for Peace of the Mexican Bishops Conference are here in San Cristobal de las Casas. They are six bishops, led by Adolfo Suarez Rivera. Also here is Oaxaca Bishop Hector Gonzalez; Carlos Talavera of Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz; Raul Vera, dominican bishop; Francisco Aguirre, Tuxtla Gutierrez bishop; and Felipe Arizmendi of Tapachula. We have been informed the bishops will speak to reporters tomorrow to give their viewpoints of the peace and reconciliation negotiations. Within 30 minutes, the six bishops who form the Special Commission will hold a mass here at Santo Domingo Square.
