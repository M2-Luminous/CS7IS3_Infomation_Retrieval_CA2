When the clamor of "linking trade with human rights" has just subsided, certain Western nations are again trying to peddle their "linkage between trade and laborers' rights and interests" in a bid to force it into the GATT document. This will naturally meet objection from the vast number of developing nations. In light of this fallacy, trade expanded by the developing nations with their cheap labor prices is "immoral," "unfair," and "unequal" to the laborers of the developed or developing nations; international trade organs should set up a standard for labor prices and consider it a condition for developing nations to enter the international market. In other words, Western nations can erect trade obstacles under the excuse of the poor remuneration of the laborers in some countries. People may feel it strange that the gentlemen of the rich nations have suddenly shown concern for the interests of the laborers in the poor nations. People with good sense know that this is another trick played by some Western nations to make up for the decline in their economic competitiveness. In the name of showing concern for the interests of laborers of the developing nations, they are actually practicing trade protectionism. As everyone knows, for various reasons, the wages of laborers of the developing nations have always been lower than those of the developed nations. It will be impossible to compare the per capita wage of several hundred dollars of a poor nation with that of $20,000 of a rich nation. This is common sense. It is the right of the developing nations to take advantage of their cheap labor to increase exports and take part in international competition, which brooks no outside interference. To increase remuneration of their laborers, the developing nations must expand trade, develop their economies, and increase incomes of their people. It would be unrealistic to raise the wages of the developing nations to a level forced by the Western nations, irrespective of their own national conditions. Moreover, it will also weaken one of the limited advantages of the developing nations, benefit the rich nations, let the poor nations suffer, and eventually harm the interests of the laborers of the developing nations. Thus it can be seen that those who have proposed "linking trade with the rights and interests of laborers" are not really concerned about the well-being of the laborers. Instead, they want to take this as an excuse to deprive the poor nations of the opportunity to strive for development with their advantage of cheap labor. Such a practice of ignoring the national conditions of the developing nations and forcing the poor nations to compete with the rich ones on the same level is tantamount to a fight between a light weight boxer and a heavy one, which is even more "immoral," "unfair," and "unequal." Trade protectionism is a behavior which lacks foresight. This is particularly true in the trade protectionism practiced by the developed nations to the developing ones. It should be noted that trade and economic growth of the developing nations has precisely offered an extensive market and investment place for the developed nations. The situation in East Asia today serves as a practical example. The problem is, on the one hand, some Western nations want to make the most of the opportunity to strengthen economic cooperation with the developing nations; on the other hand, they are also afraid that the developing nations will become powerful, which in turn will menace their own interests. Hence, they adopt all kinds of measures to restrict the growth of the developing nations. Such a self-contradictory move will only intensify the confrontation between the north and south, harm the interests of developing nations, and eventually ruin their own interests. Although the situation after the end of the Cold War has proved that naked military intervention will not work, economic intervention is now on the rise. "The linkage between trade and laborers' rights and interests" is a reproduction by the hegemonists in the economic field. This merits vigilance.
