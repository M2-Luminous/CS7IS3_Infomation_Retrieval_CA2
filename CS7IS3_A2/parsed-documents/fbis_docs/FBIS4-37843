He deeply regretted the violation of the cease-fire for the sixth time today and reiterated the need to implement Security Council Resolution 924 and restore the constructive dialogue between the two sides. In statements he made today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Yemeni crisis has in fact entered a stage of internationalization, with the Security Council's intervention. He noted that the Arab League had tried to resolve the crisis, but its mission was unsuccessful. He ruled out the possibility of sending an Arab League delegation on a new mediation mission to resolve the Yemeni crisis. But he referred to possible Arab League participation as part of a UN delegation undertaking to arrange a cease-fire there. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League's Secretariat General is at present coordinating with the United Nations in the search for a solution to the crisis. He added that the Arab League does not aim to compete with any other party or to exclude anyone from the solution mechanism, but its main objective is to reach a cease-fire and search for a settlement through a constructive and objective dialogue between the Yemeni parties. On the question of the Arab League's recognition of the south Yemeni state, he said: We in the Arab League are bound by rules and laws that stem from the Charter and its council's authority. He added: The Arab League accepted the unity of the two Yemeni sectors when the north and south were joined into one state that became the Yemeni people's legitimate representative. He said that any change in this status requires referral to the League's Charter and its council's authority. He expressed his belief that the question of recognition is not the only issue being raised now. He added that the main issue is the cease-fire and the restoration of a dialogue between the Yemeni parties. He added that it is premature to raise the question of recognizing south Yemen at the Arab League level. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid went on to say that the Arab League member states are sovereign. If one of these countries recognizes south Yemen unilaterally without the Arab League's involvement, the League would have no authority over it. He stressed that the Arab League is constantly coordinating with the representatives accredited to it and with the United Nations through the League's New York offfice, which is constantly sending reports on the latest Yemeni crisis developments in the United Nations. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said he expects the Security Council to hold another meeting to emphasize the cease-fire resolution. But he ruled out a Security Council resolution imposing international sanctions on any party that violates it. He admitted that it is difficult for the Arab League to adopt a resolution on dispatching international observers to supervise the cease-fire in Yemen, not only because Sanaa is opposed to it, but also because there are technical, administrative, and logistical difficulties that impede the international observers' work in Yemen.
