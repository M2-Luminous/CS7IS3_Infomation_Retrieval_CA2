FR940407-2-00141 FR940407-2-00075 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [Docket No. 94&hyph;19; Notice 1] First Brands Corporation, Receipt of Petition for Determination of Inconsequential Noncompliance First Brands Corporation (FBC) of Danbury, Connecticut has determined that some of its brake fluid fails to comply with 49 CFR 571.116, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 116, ``Motor Vehicle Brake Fluids,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR part 573. FBC has also petitioned to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.) on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential as it relates to motor vehicle safety. This notice of receipt of a petition is published under section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgement concerning the merits of the petition. Section S5.1.7, Fluidity and Appearance at Low Temperature, of Standard No. 116 states: When brake fluid is tested according to S6.7, at the storage temperature and for the storage times given in Table II_ (a) The fluid shall show no sludging, sedimentation, crystallization, or stratification; (b) Upon inversion of the sample bottle, the time required for the air bubble to travel to the top of the fluid shall not exceed the bubble flow times shown in Table II; and (c) On warming to room temperature, the fluid shall resume the appearance and fluidity that it had before chilling. Table II of S5.1.7 states that when the brake fluid is stored at ^40 ○ # 2 ○ C. for 144 hours T1# 4.0 hours the maximum bubble flow time is 10 seconds. When stored at ^50 ○ # 2 ○ C. for 6 hours # 0.2 hours the maximum bubble flow time is 35 seconds. NHTSA notified FBC that a sample of Prestone Brake Fluid, AS&hyph;400, failed to meet the requirements of S5.1.7 (NHTSA file NCI 3293). FBC's initial investigation determined that the brake fluid was packaged on May 4, 1993, at its subsidiary, Paulsboro, Packaging, Inc., and that the fluid was manufactured by Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) and identified as UCC's PM6060, lot # 0319083. FBC further stated: All [of the] product in FBC's distribution system packaged from the specific lot # 0319083 was placed on hold and all packaging of Brake Fluid PM6060 was ceased pending a full investigation and implementation of corrective measures. FBC produced 202,704 units (12.0 fl.oz.) from lot # 0319083, and currently has 61,752 units on hold at various warehouses. Based on review of all data and consultation with USC, it is FBC's opinion that the noncompliance will not affect product performance in a motor vehicle or create a safety concern. FBC is recommending that no recall of [the] product outside of FBC's distribution system be made. It is further recommended that the product in inventory (61,752 units) also be released for sale. FBC also stated that it has elected to convert to an alternative UCC brake fluid identified as PM6340, which has a freeze point of ^65 ○ C., and will provide an added margin to meet the requirements of S5.1.7., Standard No. 116.
