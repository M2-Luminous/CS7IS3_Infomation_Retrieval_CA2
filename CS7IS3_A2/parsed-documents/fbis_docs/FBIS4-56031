The Russian leader writes that during last year's visit to Warsaw, he handed to the Polish side a file containing the entire Solidarity dossier. I asked our Moscow correspondent Andrzej Siezieniewski if he knew Yeltsin's book. [Begin recording] [Siezieniewski] Yes, I have read through it. The excerpt you want to ask me about is indeed in the book, on page 180, in the chapter: Russia and the world, sub-heading: Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel. It reads as follows: It is well-known that the KGB tried to oversee the destruction of the Solidarity trade union. I brought Lech Walesa--Boris Yeltsin writes--a copy of the documents of the Suslov Commission, the shadow leader of the Brezhnev Politburo. It was a whole dossier on Solidarity. Polish and Soviet KGB men analyzed in detail the whole truth about the leaders of the workers' movement. Sometimes it was terrible to read these documents, Boris Yeltsin says, because the KGB x-ray was so ruthless. I slapped the file with my hand and said: It is all here, take it. Walesa turned slightly pale--Boris Yeltsin recalls the moment he handed the Polish president the documents he had brought with him on his visit to Warsaw last August. [Announcer] Have the Russia media given any information at all about what was in the documents President Yeltsin brought to Warsaw? [Siezieniewski] No, there was nothing known about that. In any case, Boris Yeltsin did not give details about what was in the diplomatic luggage he took to Warsaw. It is certainly well-known that Boris Yeltsin had access to the KGB archives, and if he says that what he took with him and what he handed over to the Polish side contained, among other things, the dossier on Solidarity, then we can most probably believe him--although Boris Yeltsin is a politician, and one does not always play fair here, what is said does not always correspond 100 percent to the truth. [end recording] [Announcer] I also telephoned Boris Yeltsin's adviser, Yuriy Leonov. [Begin Leonov recording] Some sort of documents were handed over to President Walesa, but I do not know their exact content. In my opinion, insofar as they were handed over to the Polish side, only the Polish side can make the decision to publish the documents. [end recording] [Announcer] I asked Minister Andrzej Zakrzewski of President Lech Walesa's Chancellery. [Begin Zakrzewski recording] I have never entered into polemics with the NIE weekly and I will not do so, because I am one of those people who regard Jerzy Urban's weekly as journalistic folklore, although again I am not one of those people who underestimate that weekly's influence. However, regarding the substance of what you asked about, I know nothing of the file mentioned by your Moscow correspondent. I have Yeltsin's memoirs, I received them yesterday, but I have not read them yet--and the competent people, the only people who could give binding information, are abroad for the next four days, for they are in Switzerland. I have not the faintest idea about any file from the most secret Kremlin safe concerning the KGB's detailed study of the Solidarity leaders. I have not set eyes on it, and I doubt whether... [pauses] Well, maybe it does exist, but in any case I know nothing about it. [end recording] [passage omitted]
