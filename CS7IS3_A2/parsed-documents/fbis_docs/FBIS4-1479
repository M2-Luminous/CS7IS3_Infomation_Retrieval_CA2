FBIS4-1479 "drafr083_c_94008" FBIS-AFR-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 29 Apr South African Press Review for 29 Apr MB2904144094 MB2904144094 BFN [Editorial Report] THE STAR `Power' in Process of Democracy -- "Closely scrutinised, this incredible week has delivered enough faults and failings to fill an encyclopeadia. But there are times that close scrutiny is misleading, and this is one of them," begins the Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 29 April in a page-10 editorial. "The big picture is majestic," contends the editorial. "South Africans rose to the occasion in dignity and, on the whole, in remarkable peace." New problems and situations await the new South Africa, concludes THE STAR, but "if we have not yet found the answers to all the issues of the future, we have found the way to face them. This week we have seen and experienced -- and felt -- the power of the process of democracy." BUSINESS DAY Electoral Irregularities Viewed -- "It is unfortunate, though not altogether surprising, that the main feature of the election, apart from the actual voting, is the huge number of alleged irregularities, many of which are serious," begins the Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 29 April in a page-8 editorial. The task of declaring the election free and fair now awaits the Independent Electoral Commission, IEC, and "those who carp at the supposed anomaly of the IEC judging its own performance should best be quiet. Anyone who thought this a bad idea should have said so months ago when the politicians set out the IEC's terms of reference." In order to declare the elections free and fair the IEC has "to satisfy itself that the numerous irregularities have been sufficiently evenly spread, so that no party has been substantially disadvantaged. The last thing we need is a major party rejecting the outcome because of legitimate grievances." A heavy responsibility awaits Judge Kriegler in making his decision on the elections, and "no one will envy him this responsibility." SOWETAN Absence of Voting Intimidation -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 29 April in a page-8 editorial is "proud of the total absence of intimidation" during the voting period across the country. "What seems evident is South Africans have become mature after the terrible changes in our lives lately. All that remains is that our people will accept the results with similarly responsible discipline." People To Demand `Immediate Satisfaction' From New Government -- A second editorial on the same page warns that "people will demand immediate satisfaction from a new government after the elections. It will be impossible to satisfy all expectations as apartheid has left large sectors of our country in an overwhelming mess." "A new Government must be seen to act with vigour. The planning and clearing of areas for housing must be in evidence. The plans to proceed with putting up houses for millions of homeless people can then be developed in stages." WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN Buthelezi, IEC `Incompetence' -- "The pattern is the same all over: the force of numbers and the strength of individuals overcoming the problems of the elections," notes Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English for 29 Apr-5 May. There was "calm" and "little violence" and "the inevitable conclusion is that the election can still work -- despite the IEC. There is no point in mincing words about that organisation. Despite hundreds of millions of rands, lavish salaries and massive popular support, they have messed it up through sheer incompetence. It has been a gravy train without wheels." The IEC "failed at its most basic logistical task: getting ballot papers to the polling stations." "When it became apparent that things were going wrong, Mr Justice J. Kriegler chose to fluff the details, covering the extent of the problem. He was cocky and super-confident, in defiance of the facts being put before him. He was dismissive of the media -- the link between himself and the public he so badly needs on his side -- and made little attempt to rally support behind him. It was a mistake." "Luckily, everyone has been leaning over backwards to make sure the election works -- with the sole exception of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi." "He disrupts the election preparation as much as possible, then he complains that it does not run smoothly. He should not be allowed to get away with it. Sadly, IEC incompetence has given him more ground than he should have." NEW NATION Buthelezi `Exploits' IEC `Incompetence' -- Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 29 April in its page-16 editorial cautions that "all is not won yet and the struggle to secure the election faces serious threats." The threats came mainly from Inkatha and the Pan- Africanist Congress (PAC), "each warning of the lack of freeness and fairness in the elections." The paper questions Buthelezi's "supposed commitment to transition through elections. He has punctuated virtually everyone of his comments by warning that the freeness and fairness of the election was being threatened -- by the incompetence of the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), intimidation from the ANC and bombings by his old rightwing partners in the tattered Freedom Alliance." "It was Buthelezi's intractable attitude to negotiations and disdain for the reasonable principle of majority rule that must take a large part of the blame for the problems faced by the poll." KwaZulu was one of the areas most affected by the IEC's "shortcomings" but "this was not because of the IEC's incompetence but because of Inkatha's bellicose and sometimes violent resistance to the commission preparing these areas for the elections." Therefore, Buthelezi "must not be allowed to exploit the incompetence of the IEC, or the problems experienced in the management of these elections to delay the outcome of the poll. While it is his right to challenge the freeness and fairness of the elections, he must not be allowed to prevent the IEC from announcing a result soon."
