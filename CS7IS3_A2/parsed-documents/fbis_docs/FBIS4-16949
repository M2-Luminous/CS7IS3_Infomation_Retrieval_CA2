Nonetheless, the aspiration by Economic Policy Committee Chairman Sergey Glazyev to tighten up control of foreign economic activity caused concern of such exporters as the Rosvooruzheniye corporation: The firm refused to provide the hearing information about its activity. The subject of arms export and related investment problems of the military industrial complex enterprises were discussed in camera, with the participation of general designers, and prior to that representatives of the government, Foreign Economic Relations, and Central Bank apparatuses briefed the deputies on the general state and prospects of foreign economic activity. Ivan Materov, first deputy foreign economic relations minister, told the house that at present the government cannot make decisions on lifting export quotas because the insolvency of Russian consumers leaves them without the requisite resources, which have not been sold abroad only because no export licenses have been granted. Materov, however, confirmed that from 1995 most of the quotas will be phased out. Sergey Tsyplakov, chief of the government apparatus' foreign economic activity department, motivated the need to lift export quotas by the fact that the current quota and license system encourages abuses: "In some export-related spheres things are running wild." The government apparatus representative expressed special concern over the growing disparity between Russian exporters' contractual prices and world prices. Mr. Tsyplakov closed his statement with the conclusion about the need to step up state control of foreign economic activity. The participants also recognized as a priority the search for sources to repay Russia's foreign debt for which purpose it is proposed to use promissory note circulation and sell Russian state property (quite possibly, Petr Aven and Alfa-Bank will attend to this in the end). According to information in KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession, the Glazyev committee in the very near future is to submit to the Duma's consideration a number of bills on regulating foreign economic activity (On Foreign Economic Activity, On Changes to the Law on Foreign Investments in the RFSFR and Concession Contracts, and On Production-Sharing Arrangements) which envision a clear-cut separation of all functions of the federal power bodies in the sphere of foreign economic activity. One of the indispensable elements of the future system is tough control of arms exports. According to information in KOMMERSANT-DAILY's possession, at yesterday's closed session Rosvooruzheniye's monopoly activity in this sphere received a rather negative assessment on the part of military industrial complex enterprise representatives who are unhappy with the distribution of incomes from the sale of their production. It is noteworthy that Sergey Glazyev regards the cadre and technological potential of these enterprises as the foundation for overcoming industrial decline in Russia.
