Guatemala is making history. Today, 10 January 1994, should signal to all Guatemalans that there is a new light in the process to consolidate our democracy. Today a new opportunity emerges. We must not and will not lose this opportunity because our government is determined to show its political willingness to achieve peace. Because of the importance of what occurred in Mexico today, I wish to tell you that the agreement to renew the peace negotiations has been signed by the government peace commission and the URNG General Command, as witnessed by the UN secretary general's representative. Following intense work during the period 6-10 January, the two delegations agreed on a framework to foster the resumption of an in-depth and dynamic negotiation process that will open the door to a prompt solution of the armed conflict. The signed agreement covers the main aspects of the negotiation mechanism and in it the parties sought to design innovative mechanisms, bearing in mind the previous accords and achievements. Within the framework of bilateral negotiations, the parties agreed to ask the UN secretary general to appoint a moderator to promote the reaching of agreements on the entire negotiation agenda, which was approved in Mexico in 1991. The parties have expressed their commitment to reaching a firm and lasting peace agreement in the briefest possible time during 1994. They also agreed to promote the creation of an assembly that will promote reciprocal contributions from civilian society and the participants in the negotiation process. Therefore, they agreed to ask the Guatemalan Bishops Conference to appoint the president of an assembly of civilian sectors, bearing in mind for this position Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno who would have the special mission of promoting, here in Guatemala, a consensus among civilian society regarding the essential topics on the negotiation agenda. He would subsequently foster the approval of the agreements signed by the parties, so they can become great national commitments. To strengthen the negotiation process, the parties also agreed to ask the Governments of Colombia, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Norway, and Venezuela to form a group of friends of the Guatemalan peace process, so they can be honor witnesses to the agreements reached by the parties. The parties reiterated that verification is a fundamental element to guaranteeing the fulfillment of the agreements. Therefore, they should be accompanied by appropriate national and international verification mechanisms. For this reason they will ask the United Nations to undertake the international verification of the agreements. It is truly satisfactory to confirm today, with the approval of the framework for the resumption of the negotiations, that the parties are demonstrating their willingness to reach the goals established in the agreement. There is still difficult work to be done to make this new framework bear fruit with specific achievements in the discussion of the general agenda of the negotiations. The next round of negotiations will be held in the second half of February. It will be devoted to the discussion of the agreement on human rights and the setting of a timetable for the negotiation agenda. It is an ambitious but essential program to conclude, with the flexibility being demonstrated now, successful negotiations. I wish to express thanks for the constant interest shown and the support provided by the international community and my appreciation of the hospitality shown by Mexico, which has always supported the peace efforts in Guatemala. In particular, I wish to thank the United Nations, which has permitted the setting for this successful meeting. Fellow countrymen: Guatemala has begun to build peace, working simultaneously for the two focal points of the peace plan that our government proposed to the Guatemalan people -- national reconciliation and the fight against poverty, as a means to building a firm and lasting peace. We Guatemalans should jointly build peace. Today, we have taken a great step by beginning the end of the domestic armed conflict, above all bearing in mind that there are human lives at stake. But this is not enough to achieve overall peace. It is here in Guatemala, with productive work and attention to the people's most heartfelt needs, that unitedly we should build peace with social justice for all Guatemalans. Thank you very much and good night.
