In a speech at a Tokyo hotel, Malaysian Ambassador to Japan H. M. Khatib said Japan has not yet made a decision on whether to join the EAEC because it is "very concerned" about the U.S. position on the caucus. Japan initially said it was waiting for a consensus on the plan by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), but is still undecided even after a consensus was reached, he said. "All it has said so far is that it is still studying the proposal and is waiting for more details about operational aspects of the EAEC," Khatib said in the speech sponsored by the Asian Affairs Research Council. "It seems clear to us that Japan's position on the EAEC is dependent on the U.S. position," he said. "As long as the United States remains opposed to the EAEC, Japan has excuses not to be part of this caucus." He said it would be a "pity" if Japan, which could play an important part in the EAEC, would cause the EAEC project to stall, pointing out that Japan's absence from the caucus would make China and South Korea reluctant to participate. But he said ASEAN would wait for Japan to make a decision because Japan is important for the caucus. Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed proposed the establishment of the EAEC in 1990. The potential members include Japan, South Korea and emerging Southeast Asian nations. Khatib said the EAEC aims at promoting an open and free trade system and is not meant to be a closed, inward-looking trade bloc. It is also compatible and unconfrontational with the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, he said. The envoy said ASEAN believes the U.S. would approve of the EAEC once it has a better understanding of the idea, so that ASEAN will continue to be "transparent" with the U.S. about it. But if the U.S. still cannot "rid itself of its own difficulties" despite the transparency, ASEAN hopes the U.S. will not take any "measures destructive of this positive effort to further enhance growth of East Asian economies which will also benefit the U.S. in turn," he said. "It really is unwise for anyone to kill the goose that could lay enough golden eggs for all," he said. Mahathir, who boycotted the U.S. invitation to an informal APEC summit in Seattle last November, will attend another summit in Indonesia this fall, he said.
