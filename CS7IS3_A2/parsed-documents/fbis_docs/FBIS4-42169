Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see the Foreign Office Minister of State, Douglas Hogg. Foreign Office officials refused to comment yesterday on the meeting except to insist it was not linked to the fatwa calling for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic Verses -- the main irritant in Anglo-lranian relations. Iran's embassy also refused to comment. The expulsion follows recent British charges that Iranian intelligence has been in clandestine contact with the IRA. This was denied by Tehran, which then made the charge -- conspicuously not denied -- that Britain's M16 had planted a bug in the London embassy. Unusual secrecy surrounded the expulsion decision, and it was not clear whether it was related to the IRA row or to other bilateral strains. Suggestions of a Bosnian link were played down. Mr Ansari was told there was irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing. Britain wants to keep the expulsion quiet to preclude Iranian tit-for-tat expulsions. Both countries are limited, by mutual agreement, to 15 diplomats in each other's capital. Reticence about the decision stems from concern that publicity given to the IRA allegations last month was counterproductive, provoking anti-British hostility in Iran, including calls for a boycott of British trade or even the severing of links. Relations between the two countries have been stormy since Iran's Islamic revolution in l979. Ties were severed in 1989 over the Rushdie affair but restored in 1990.
