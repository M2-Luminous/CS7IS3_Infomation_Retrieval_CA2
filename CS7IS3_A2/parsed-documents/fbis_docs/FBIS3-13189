Last Thursday the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency (IRNA) reported, without quoting the source, that Mr. Robert Pelletreau, undersecretary of state for Near Eastern affairs had said that Washington did not intend to subvert the Islamic government in Iran and that it was ready to sit down with Iranian officials and discuss outstanding issues on which Tehran and Washington have different views. Mr. Pelletreau was also quoted as saying that the political system in Iran is here to stay for a long time to come. It has been noticed that the subject of Iran-America relations is usually raised when some tragic event occurs in the Muslim world. For instance, the topic was widely discussed in the western media simultaneously with the signing of an accord in Washington last September between Mr. Yasir 'Arafat and Mr. Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister of the Zionist state. And now we hear the same story told by a different person after the slaughter of more than 60 Palestinian worshipers at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Al-Khalil (Hebron). This might have been done with the intention of diverting attention of the people of Iran from vital issues and maybe for conveying a message to its officials that if they should look the other way, they would be compensated. Nevertheless, the official stance of the Islamic Republic of Iran on this issue has been made known on many occasions. The last time it was done was by the leader of the Islamic Revolution, Ayatollah 'Ali Khamene'i, who said on the 14th anniversary of the seizure of the former U.S. Embassy by Muslim students in Tehran that, "The Iranian nation does not need to negotiate, or have relations with an arrogant enemy such as America." Anyway, if Washington is sincere in its aims to reconcile differences with a big Muslim country in the Middle East the easiest way would be to settle all financial matters with Iran. The first step Clinton's administration can take is release all Iranian assets that were frozen by the former U.S. president Jimmy Carter. The next step would be to attend to other issues of dispute between America and Iran such as the downing of the passenger airliner in the Persian Gulf. These and several other points can be negotiated and a solution found to end the animosity between Iran and America. But will the U.S. ever be able to keep aside its arrogance? Will it realize that a revolutionary nation can never be forced to yield by arrogance, threats and baseless accusations such as international terrorism and violation of human rights?
