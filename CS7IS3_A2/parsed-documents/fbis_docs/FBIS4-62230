The production of oil dropped by 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year as compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the output of coal -- by 9 per cent, gas -- by almost 1 per cent, light petroleum products -- by 12-18 per cent, and electricity -- by 4 per cent. In general, the slump in this sector of the economy remained at last year's level and equalled to 6.5 per cent, ITAR-TASS was told at the Russian Ministry for Fuel and Energy. In expert opinion, the output of energy resources was negatively influenced not only by the general recession, but also by such factors as default of payments, which reached 19 trillion roubles in the fuel and energy complex alone, regularly delayed budget allocations, and further reduction of investments. Along with general economic factors, experts link the dropping oil output of the recent years with the growing share of deposits on the developed oilfields that yield to extraction with great difficulty. The marketing of refined products is another factor responsible for slumping oil production, because the consumers have turned insolvent. This explains the stoppage and closure of about 15,000 oil wells, which brought down oil extraction by approximately 4-4.5 million tonnes. The fuel sector's financial "hunger" has had a negative effect on the processing of crude oil and the production of light petroleum products. Their volumes dropped by 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year as compared to 1993, which equals to more than eight million tonnes.
