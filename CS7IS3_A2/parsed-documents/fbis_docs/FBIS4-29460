FBIS4-29460 "dreas118__a94009" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan USFJ Surveys Air Bases To Prepare for Korean Crisis USFJ Surveys Air Bases To Prepare for Korean Crisis OW1806133894 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1806133894 Tokyo TOKYO SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 16 June that U.S. forces in Japan [USFJ] have surveyed air bases of the Air Self-Defense Force [ASDF] that can be used by the latest U.S. fighter jets at a time when debates on sanctions against North Korea have heated up. The USFJ is believed to have surveyed the ASDF air bases to prepare for an emergency on the Korean peninsula. The USFJ appears to have chosen four air bases -- Chitose Air Base, Mizawa Air Base [currently under joint use by Japan and the United States), Matsushima Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base -- for use by U.S. forces. Those air bases are expected to be used by U.S. Air Force fighter jets that are deployed from the United States to Japan to bolster the fighting capability of the USFJ in the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula. There is a possibility that the USFJ will ask the ASDF for rear support. The use of those air bases by U.S forces will certainly trigger a controversy because it raises the question of Japan's exercise of the right of collective self-defense. In the past few months, U.S. forces have deployed Patriot missiles and armed helicopters in South Korea. U.S. forces also plan to deploy more fighter jets in South Korea and quickly deploy aircraft carriers in waters off the Korean peninsula. There is no change in the USFJ's air power. The survey of ASDF air bases by the USFJ is taken as their first move in Japan following the tense situation on the Korean peninsula. The USFJ is believed to intend to use the ASDF air bases to bolster its air power and to enhance readiness to prepare for an emergency on the Korean peninsula. Chitose Air Base and Matsushima Air Base are far away from the Korean peninsula and North Korea's fighter jets have a short flying range, with the exception of MiG-29 fighter jets. The USFJ is believed to want to use the two air bases for defensive purposes. According to a source in the Defense Agency [DA], U.S. forces in the United States plan to send air wings consisting mainly of F-16 fighter jets to Japan in the event of emergency in the Far East. The U.S. forces also plan to send Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) aircraft and air tankers to Japan. It is unclear how many combat aircraft the U.S. forces plan to send to South Korea in the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula. An air wing is composed of 25 F-16 fighter jets and 400 ground crews. In the event of an emergency on the Korean peninsula, there is a possibility of the USFJ asking the ASDF for rear support including the supply of oil and ammunition. It is difficult for the ASDF to provide such rear support under the current law. If emergency legislation with a limited period of enforcement on the Acquisition and Cross-Serving Agreement (ACSA) is enacted, then the ASDF would be able to provide rear support for the USFJ, depending on the circumstances. The ASDF's rear support for the USFJ may constitute a "military action," and Prime Minister Hata has stated that "Japan cannot participate in any military action." The ASDF's rear support for the USFJ, therefore, may trigger the question of Japan's exercise of the collective riht of self-defense. There is a view that the USFJ has surveyed the SDAF air bases in a bid to look for shelters for U.S. military aircraft, and it remains unclear how the USFJ intends to use the ASDF air bases. The fact is important, however, that the USFJ has studied the possibility of using ASDF facilities at a time when the situation on the Korean peninsula has grown tense. Another source in the DA, has tried to keep the survey of ASDF air bases by the USFJ from triggering any controversy, saying, "I believe that the USFJ is simply preparing for the worst case." The USFJ is able to use five ASDF air bases including Chitose Air Base, Hyakuri Air Base, and Komatsu Air Base only when joint Japan-U.S. military exercises are conducted. There is no legal basis for the USFJ to use those air bases in the event of an emergency. A senior DA official has indicated that "the ASDF and the USFJ can jointly use those air bases in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Status of Force Agreement."
