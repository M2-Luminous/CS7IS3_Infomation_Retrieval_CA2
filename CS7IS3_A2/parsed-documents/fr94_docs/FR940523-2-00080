FR940523-2-00080 FR940523-2-00042 Status: New Collection Contact: Julie B. Fagan, (202) 708&hyph;1197. Date: May 2, 1994. Part A: Justification President Clinton has pledged an additional 100,000 police officers by 1998. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has been directed by the White House Domestic Policy Council (DPC) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to assist in fulfilling that pledge by providing for 4,100 police-equivalent positions in 1994 and 5,000 position per year between 1995&hyph;1998 (see Attachment One). The primary HUD programs that permit the funding of law enforcement and security officers are the Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant (PHDEP), Community Development Block Grant, Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), Comprehensive Grants (Comp Grant), and operating subsidies. From those programs, HUD is expected to provide the positions outlined above. OMB assumes that HUD will use $124 million in budget authority in FY 1994 and $150 million for FYs 1995&hyph;1998 to fund these positions. A1.0‚ê£Circumstances That Make Collection Of The Information Necessary The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) administers four of the five programs identified above. The programs fund the activities of only public and Indian housing authorities (HAs). PIH does not currently have the mechanisms to measure or determine the costs or specific number of law enforcement and security personnel our grant monies are supporting. The Public Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP) funds a variety of public housing anti-drug efforts, including the hiring of law enforcement and security officers. Since program inception in 1989 the PHDEP has funded 1762 grants totalling $532,459,075 million. According to the plans of the FY 1991 to FY 1993 grantees, approximately $178 million of the funds were targeted to additional security or law enforcement staff. Over the same period, the proportion of total dollars targeted specifically to additional law enforcement and security costs has remained about the same each year. While PHDEP grantees are required to submit semi-annual reports on the status of grant activities and funding, the level of detail varies greatly, and the information is only reviewed on a grant by grant basis, and is not collected or concatenated on a field office, regional office or national basis. Information from PHDEP semi-annual reports are insufficient sources because the reports are not standardized and several other PIH funding sources pay for police/security costs. In FY 1993, CIAP grants totalled $326 million, and are currently being phased out. The reports required from CIAP grantees report ``anti-drug costs'', but do not include anti-crime costs, and do not separate labor from other related costs. In FY 1993, Comp Grants totalled $2.5 billion. The Comp Grant program allows costs for ``health and safety'', but none of the Comp Grant reports capture any information on security and law enforcement personnel costs. Public Housing Operating Subsidy (O/S) can also be used to pay for ``Protective Services'', including labor, materials, and contract costs. In FY 1992, nationwide, $108.2 million were spent on all protective services costs. Of those funds, $71.9 were spent on labor, and $32.7 on security contract costs. Since FY 1987, the dollars spent on labor costs by all housing authorities has increased by 44 percent from $49.8 to $71.9 million, while the dollars spend on security contract costs has increased by 42 percent from $76.1 million to $108.2 million. HUD does not collect information at any level of greater detail. The Law Enforcement/Security Form for which OMB approval is sought would be required from HAs annually. Use of this form will enable the level of law enforcement and security support to be shown in a consistent manner, through annual compilation of the requested data. The planned characteristics of the form are for reporting at the agency level. HAs will report on the funds and positions relative to the relevant grants they are operating.
