FR940812-0-00015 FR940812-0-00007 The Committee met June 28, 1994, and unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $270,200, $21,395 more than the previous year. Budget items for 1994&hyph;95 which have increased compared to those budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Executive salaries, $83,850 ($81,500), clerical salaries, $18,650 ($17,600), employee benefits, $15,800 ($14,500), audit fees, $3,650 ($3,500), office rent, $21,500 ($19,000), postage and messenger, $5,000 ($4,500), telephone, $2,500 ($2,000), fieldman travel, $4,000 ($3,500), purchase of equipment, $4,500 (3,000), acreage survey $10,000 ($5,000), and reserve for contingencies, $19,250 ($6,705). Items which have decreased compared to the amount budgeted for 1993&hyph;94 (in parentheses) are: Temporary help, $5,000 ($8,000), and data processing, $3,500 ($7,000). All other items are budgeted at last year's amounts. The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.60 per salable ton, $0.30 less than the previous year. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 168,875 salable tons, will yield $270,200 in assessment income, which will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Any funds not expended by the Committee during a crop year may be used, pursuant to ยง993.81(c), for a period of five months subsequent to that crop year. At the end of such period, the excess funds are returned or credited to handlers. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis, (2) the crop year begins on August 1, 1994, and the marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable California prunes handled during the crop year; (3) handlers are aware of this action which was unanimously recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and is similar to other budget actions issued in past years; and (4) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
