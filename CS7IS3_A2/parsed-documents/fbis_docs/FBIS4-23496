[Kanyerengwe] Yes and no. We knew that there were already plans in each MRND [National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development] cell, but we could not predict the scope or the wickedness of the current events, with massacres that have decapitated all the active classes in the country, both Tutsis and Hutus. We feel that civilian society has practically been swept aside and that an entire generation of active, dynamic people, intellectuals, professionals, and merchants has been wiped off the face of the earth. These were the people who jeopardized the Habyarimana regime, so they were liquidated. [Braeckman] According to you, where are the brains behind what has happened? [Kanyerengwe] Apparently all the MRND's structures are involved, from the highest level to the local authorities who often led the groups of killers. As time went by, the group which formed around President Habyarimana solidified, with ramifications for the entire country. This group is responsible for the current situation. [Braeckman] If you win a military victory, with whom will you govern this decimated country and how will you deal with the MRND? [Kanyerengwe] We consider that the MRND as a party and institution, is no longer part of the political scene and completely disqualified. However, it is still possible to hold talks with individuals. We desperately hope that an international investigation will help us to shed light on that party's responsibility at all levels. Moreover, we must revive the dialogue with the survivors from the other parties and the survivors of civil society. [Braeckman] You signed the Arusha agreements which enshrine the principle of power sharing. Are these agreements still valid? [Kanyerengwe] Their spirit is valid, in any case, even if adjustments will have to be made as far as the MRND is concerned. We want to form a provisional government of national union with all the survivors of the other parties that signed the agreements. Halting the Massacres Is a Precondition for any Cease-fire [subhead] [Braeckman] Do you wish to move rapidly toward elections? [Kanyerengwe] Elections? How can we talk about that today in view of the situation in the country, and the thousands of refugees, displaced persons, and people who have disappeared? The very first thing we have to do is reestablish a minimum level of security for the population. After that, of course, we will see. The war must stop; that is the first thing. [Braeckman] So why has a cease-fire not yet been concluded? [Kanyerengwe] We feel that the precondition for any cease-fire is that the massacres be stopped. All the people being held hostage must be evacuated so that they can go where they like. A cease-fire means that each side stops its troops where they are and that hostilities cease. [Braeckman] So you are not seeking to win total military victory? [Kanyerengwe] Of course not. We do not want either military victory or the surrender of the Army. We want a political solution. However, if a political solution is not forthcoming, then the RPF will continue its struggle. [Braeckman] With whom will you agree to talk? [Kanyerengwe] With the government Army, in the first place. Of course the Army has its share of responsibility for unleashing and continuing the massacres, but it is still a national and legal institution. On the other hand, there is no question at all of initiating talks with the current interim government, which has no legitimacy at all. This government was put together by resurrecting legislation which had already been abolished by the Arusha agreements. The text of these agreements is valid as basic law. Furthermore, we hold the members of this government directly responsible for the massacres. In Butare, in particular, they called for murder. In both Butare and Kibongo, the prefects who had managed to prevent the massacres were kicked out and then killed. The massacres started afterward. The only way we will meet with this government is with an arrest warrant. [Braeckman] Many refugees fear RPF reprisals. [Kanyerengwe] The current drama is that all or almost all Rwandan citizens have been implicated in the massacres. The massacres were planned at the highest level but they had to be implemented by organized corps of the MRND and the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic (CDR) (an extremist Tutu party) and groups of delinquent youths recruited for this purpose. Then, all Rwandan citizens were forced to kill or they too would be exterminated. Everyone who did not participate in the massacre was endangered, as was everyone who helped and hid the victims. Today, those who have killed are afraid and wonder what will happen to them, whether or not they will be forgiven. In reality, we have to distinguish between the leaders who herded the people before them, and the poor manipulated peasants who acted to save their own skins. [Braeckman] Is there any chance of an amnesty? [Kanyerengwe] Certainly not. It is because all past crimes and successive massacres have gone unpunished that we have the current drama. We want to end the cycle of violence. We want the leaders to be arrested and we want the international community to help us do this. The Main Problem Is Abandoned Children and Orphans [Braeckman] Why do you insist that the people remain grouped together, even in those areas controlled by the RPF? [Kanyerengwe] For safety reasons: We are trying to organize people in the areas we hold, and we know that the Interhamwe [Coalition for the Defense of the Republic militia] are hiding in the hills. That is why we are controlling movements people, at least for the time being. It is also true that the fighting is continuing at such a rate that the administration cannot keep up, and there are gray areas. We must first chase out the Interhamwe. Then, of course, we plan to let the people return to their homes. [Braeckman] The refugees in Tanzania accuse the RPF of having carried out massacres, too. [Kanyerengwe] I know. We have made inquiries about where these massacres we are supposed to have committed took place. The state of decomposition of the bodies found there shows clearly that these people were killed a long time before the RPF arrived in these areas. We also know that this is what is being said by people who themselves participated in the killings and are now hiding abroad. [Braeckman] What will be Rwanda's main problem in the future? [Kanyerengwe] The problem of abandoned children and orphans. There are thousands, tens of thousands of such children wandering around the country, wounded, mutilated, and traumatized. We appeal to all nongovernmental organizations, to all the friends of Rwanda, to come to the aid of the children of our country.
