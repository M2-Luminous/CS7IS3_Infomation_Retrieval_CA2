Relief for the Iraqi people lies in the implementation of Resolutions 706 and 712. The international community has no confidence in the Iraqi regime or its compliance with resolutions. [Badawi] Don't you agree, though, that the only party being hurt is the Iraqi people, of which you are a part, rather than the regime? Do you continue to hold that retaining the sanctions will topple the regime? [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi people will not benefit from lifting the sanctions. The regime will use the ensuing income to purchase weapons and new tools of repression. Only the regime will benefit from lifting the sanctions. [Badawi] There has been a relative and limited shift in the positions of certain major powers like France and Russia toward the Baghdad regime. How do you feel about that? [Al-Jalabi] France and Russia seem to be misreading the situation. Russia seems to think that scrapping the sanctions will bring in money Iraq can use to pay the huge military debt it owes Moscow. As for France, important commercial interests there want drilling concessions in the Majnun oil field. These interests think extending support to Saddam at this point will help him survive, and then they will be in a position to clinch the oil drilling contracts. They are influencing their government. We think their influence is extremely limited. [Badawi] If the Iraqi regime can capitalize on some positive shifts by certain world powers, you, as an opposition, will benefit as well. There are reports you receive financial support from abroad, especially from regional powers opposed to the Iraqi regime. Don't you think such an attitude makes you less credible as a patriotic opposition? [Al-Jalabi] Saddam [words indistinct] and destroyed the Iraqi people's independent movement. We set up offices and we are working from inside Iraq. We have moved the opposition from exile onto Iraqi territory, where we are engaged in real, democratic, and open political action. We believe our credibility with the Iraqi people is strong. As for the reports about financial backing, I have no comment, you are not being specific. [Badawi] In light of the present situation in Iraq, how do you see the country's political landscape developing? [Al-Jalabi] The Iraqi regime is now progressively losing all the requirements of a proper state. The regime is abdicating state functions, like securing food, protection and safety for the population. Thefts are rife, as are murders. The regime is doing nothing about them. The regime is growing weaker and weaker, and the people are poised to pounce on it. We are now mobilizing our resources to promote that end. [Badawi] Thank you, Mr. al-Jalabi. [Al-Jalabi] Thank you.
