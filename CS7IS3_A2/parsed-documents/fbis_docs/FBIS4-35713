FBIS4-35713 "drnes106_a_94001" FBIS-NES-94-106 Daily Report 24 May 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria FIS Sources Note Strained Ties With AIG FIS Sources Note Strained Ties With AIG PM2505105194 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 24 May 94 pp 1, 4 PM2505105194 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Report by Jamal Khashuqji: "Algeria: Salvation Front Accuses Islamic Group of Trying To Impose Its Influence Over It by Force"] [Excerpts] London -- Political sources in Algeria noted yesterday the continuation of the confusion over the statement issued by the Armed Islamic Group [AIG], in which it said that the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and the Islamic State Movement [ISM] had been unified under its leadership. They said that no official denial has been distributed by the groups operating under the FIS' banner -- which increases confusion among the ranks of Islamic oppositionists. However, sources close to the FIS have stressed to AL-HAYAH that the relationship with the AIG is strained and presages clashes between the two sides. The sources complained about what they termed "the lack of discipline among the group's elements and their promotion of repudiationist and extremist views threatening the unity of the mujahidin and the Algerian people." They pointed out that the straw that "broke the camel's back" was the AIG elements' attempt to impose their influence by force over FIS elements. The FIS accuses the AIG of being "infiltrated" by Algerian security organs, and of being run from outside the country by foreign quarters promoting "an extremist ideology combining al-salafiyah [Islamic reform movement], political jihad, and repudiation of society," according to an Algeria leading figure. The leading figure pointed out that most of the AIG's cadres "came from Afghanistan and did not participate with the FIS in its political action before the January 1992 coup," which was followed by the cancellation of the elections following which the FIS nearly assumed power. He stressed "the existence of a scheme being implemented by Algerian security organs using AIG elements with or without the AIG's knowledge, with a view to introducing the AIG as an alternative to the FIS, which peacefully persuaded the Algerian people to espouse the Islamic plan and presented to them a political, socialist, and economic program." He added that security organs know that "the Algerian people will abandon the Islamic plan if it is promoted by a group of uneducated people promoting repudiationist ideas and who are fighting just for the sake of fighting and who believe that an Islamic state can only be set up by force." He added: "The ruling clique tried to cancel the FIS' existence when it issued an administrative decision to disband it. But it has continued to derive its legitimacy from the people, who have given it their confidence. And they are now trying to cancel it by replacing it with a deviationist group." [passage omitted] The leading figures said the FIS is making contacts with Islamic leaderships abroad to urge them to suspend the support the AIG receives from some quarters. However he was pessimistic about that. He said: "Most of these quarters are mysterious, and the world Islamic movement itself is suffering at their hands. They are new on the scene and do not respect senior ulema, so it is difficult to deal with them." He pointed out that an AIG thinker named Mus'ab al-Suri, who worked in Afghanistan in the past and now lives in Spain, records tapes attacking the FIS and its programs for political change and accusing Cheikhs Abbasi Madani and Ali Behadj of deception because they accepted the principle of democracy and of turning to the people. He cited an incident he described as "serious" which took place in Tiaret province in southern central Algeria, as a group from the AIG attacked a camp belonging to the Islamic Front and held a number of its covert action activists.
