One of its indicators is resistance to fungi, which can be examined in direct relationship to properties of a material and their changes under the effect of various factors, including extreme ones (Astafyev, 1966; Flerov, 1972; Gerasimenko, 1984; Lugauskas et al., 1987). There are virtually no data on fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of microassemblies used extensively in electronics (Blagnik, Zanova, 1965; Andreyuk et al., 1980; Gerasimenko, 1984; Kanevskaya, 1984; Zaikina, Yelinov, 1985; Koval, Sidorenko, 1989). Yet the structure of assembly materials and data on low fungus resistance of some of them warrant the assumption that microassemblies are vulnerable to fungi, particularly when used in regions with high humidity, as well as in tropical and subtropical climates. This article deals with a discussion of the results of studying fungus resistance of thin- and thick-film elements of microassemblies under model conditions. We tested fungus resistance of microassemblies consisting of thick-film elements based on various pastes -- resistance, condenser, conductor, dielectric insulation and condenser, as well as thin-film elements based on resistance and dielectric alloys listed in the table.

Viability of conidia: applied conidia showing no growth on specimens. Condensate rating: 1) few large drops that fall off readily; 2) numerous medium-sized drops, almost stationary; 3) small drops over the entire specimen, stationary. The tests for fungus resistance were carried out in accordance with GOST 9.048...9.053-75 (with 1986 supplements). We used fungus strains isolated from specimens of analogous composition that had undergone field tests in different climate zones. Isolation, identification, determination of lag phase and viability of conidia of tested fungi were carried out by conventional techniques (``Methods of Experimental Mycology...'', 1982). The tests were repeated 3-5 times. The findings were submitted to statistical processing. We assessed reliability of difference between experimental variants according to Student's criterion at 95 percent level of significance. It was impossible to assess unequivocally the fungus resistance of the tested thin- and thick-film elements of microassemblies in all test variants; it differed and depended on a number of factors. The principle of establishing the extent of growth of fungus colonies and giving it a score on the 30th day of the experiment served as the basis for determination of resistance of the materials to fungi (GOST 9.048...9.053-75). There is no special GOST [State standard] for microassemblies; however, the distinctions of fungal growth on them enable us to discuss the need to create one. Microassemblies are a combined substrate consisting of variable ceramic or polymer materials in the form of an underlayer on which there are metal parts. The two elements of this substrate are not quite equal in accessibility to fungi due to the physicochemical properties of their surface. Evidently, this is what caused the differences in growth processes of micromycetes that were noted on the microassemblies. Microassemblies are a specific substrate that does not contain the basic agents of mycodestruction essential to vital functions: carbon, nitrogen and available water. In this respect, metabolic processes of mycodestructive agents have not been sufficiently studied, which makes it difficult to analyze and assess their growth, and also delays development of protective measures. While in bacteria such substrates are interpreted as ``nongrowth'' elements and a detailed explanation of the possibility of functioning of different species on them is available, for fungi a classification of substrates according to this criterion has not been developed (Okorokov et al., 1974; Malashenko et all., 1982). Investigation of the metabolism of mycodestructors requires new, modern approaches that permit deeper examination and explanation of the functional capacity of the fungal cell on substrates of anthropogenic origin that contain no organic matter but permit normal metabolism of heterotrophs (Forster, 1950; ``The Life of Microbes....,'' 1981). This has become particularly urgent at the present time, when basically new data are appearing to explain the specific metabolism of mycodestructors similarly to what has been established for bacteria (Cascelton, 1976; Zonneveld, 1988). For the time being, however, it is not deemed possible to explain the growth of mycodestructors on microassemblies, and we must limit ourselves merely to stating the facts on fungus resistance. In assessing fungus resistance of the tested microassemblies, we observed differences in fungal growth as a function of the structure of their components. Three types of mycodestruction can be distinguished: 1) both the underlayer and elements are sensitive to fungi, 2) only the underlayer is sensitive to fungi, 3) only elements are sensitive to fungi. Most fungus-sensitive microassemblies are characterized by fungal damage to both components. Fungus growth was observed only on the underlayer in elements based on dielectric material DO 14-30. In resistors based on polymer paste 0650, only the paste was subject to mycodestruction. Of all the fungal cultures used to infect microassembly specimens, the following formed a film and sporulated normally: Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, A. terreus, Paecilomyces variotii, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. funiculosum, Trichoderma viride. Damage caused by only one fungal species was noted in 11 out of the 23 tested specimens, and incidence of fungi varied: Aspergillus terreus and Paecilomyces variotii developed only on one specimen; Aspergillus flavus on three, and A. niger on five. Combined damage by two fungal species was observed in five specimens, and by three species on one, but we were unable to detect any stable link in formation of these complexes. The most eurybiontic species also prevailed: A. flavus and A. niger. Multicomponent colonies did not differ either structurally or in sporulation time. Usually, A. flavus was the main background in the film, whereas A. niger was arranged in islets in its center. An analogous film structure was noted in variants with complexes of A. flavus + Paecilomyces variotii, A. flavus + Penicillium funiculosum, A. niger + Trichoderma viride. It is only in the variant of formation of a two-component film by the A. terreus + Penicillium funiculosum complex that their colonies were distinctly circumscribed with lumina of 1-2 mm between them, which did not disappear with age. This finding can be interpreted as a manifestation of antagonism on a certain level, which is known for many mycodestructors (Andreyuk et al., 1980). It is much more difficult to interpret the vulnerability of microassemblies to 1-2 fungal species, since joint presence of a rather considerable number of species, between which syntrophic interactions are established, is more often observed when fungi grow on inaccessible substrates (Blagnik, Zanova, 1965; Koval, Sidorenko, 1989). We were unable to establish any pattern whatsoever or to explain the selectivity of fungi in relation to the corresponding series of tested specimens. In spite of the fact that assessment fungal growth in terms of rating the underlayer and microassembly did not always coincide, they were stricken by the same species of fungi. However, it must be noted that the underlayer played the leading role in manifestation of fungal growth in all variants of the experiment. Even in those cases where assessment of fungal growth in points almost coincided for both microassembly components as, for example, specimens of resistance ruthenium pastes 4413, 4451, 4461, conductor 3701, dielectric insulation 8031 and dielectric condenser 8021, the difference between underlayer and elements with respect to time of colony formation and conidial viability was distinctly demonstrable. The lag phase was shorter for all tested fungal species on the underlayer, whereas maximum growth rating was observed at earlier stages. A correlation between fungal growth rating and nature of condensate was observed in all specimens. This can be explained if we compare the hydrophobic properties of the underlayers used. In this instance, the textolite underlayer was highly hydrophobic. This was confirmed when we carried out tests following a somewhat altered protocol, as compared to GOST, according to which the tested microassembly specimens were kept in a desiccator for 24 h at 98-100 percent humidity and temperature of 15-18�, following by heating at 26-28�C. In all specimens, the condensate differed in droplet size, quantity and mobility: 1) a small number of large drops, over 1-1.5 mm in diameter, that rolled off readily; 2) numerous droplets 0.5-1 mm in diameter, virtually stationary; 3) numerous drops 0.1-0.3 mm in diameter, stationary. The nature of condensate distribution on the specimens was analogous to the nature of drop formation when the specimens were innoculated with conidial suspension. Since moisture is the main factor affecting fungal function, in this instance too it was easy to track the relationship of fungus resistance to formation of condensate and hydrophoby of the microassembly surface. In the case of high water repellence of the microassembly surface, the drops of condensate or applied conidial suspension were notable for larger size and high mobility, which prevents adhesion of fungal conidia and, consequently, does not permit their further growth. Fungus resistance of resistors based on polymer paste 0630 with a textolite underlayer indicates that use of hydrophobic underlayers can be one of the methods of producing microassemblies that are impervious to mycodestruction. Distortion of working parameters of microassemblies was observed not only with growth of conidia and formation of fungal colonies, but also in the case of a considerable level of contamination when the number of conidia exceeded 10[.sup]6[/]/mm[.sup]2[/]. This can be attributed to the effect of metabolic products of conidia that are produced in trace amounts even when conidia were in an anabiotic state (``Biology of Conidial Fungi,'' 1981). The observed destructive processes differed, depending on structure of the underlayer and microcircuit, analogously to the experimental variants in which colonies were formed. Evidently, evaluation of resistance of microassemblies to fungi must be made with consideration of several criteria characterizing the physicochemical properties of the surface (hydrophoby, porosity, moisture condensation, electric charge, etc.), and the assessment should be expressed as a fraction, which would correspond to the fungus resistance of the underlayer and fungus resistance of the microcircuit. Since the methods used to determine fungus resistance of microassemblies do not provide reliable estimate and do not permit prediction of reliability of using them under diverse ecological conditions, the need arises to develop new models that conform better to naturally occurring contamination and mycodestruction processes.
