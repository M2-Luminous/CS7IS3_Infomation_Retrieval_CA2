ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document contains the determination with respect to the referendum on the merger of Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonville, North Carolina, to become the consolidated market of Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. A mail referendum was conducted during the period of April 4&hyph;8, 1994, among tobacco growers who sold tobacco on these markets in 1993 to determine producer approval/disapproval of the designation of these three markets as one consolidated market. Growers approved the merger. Therefore, for the 1994 and succeeding flue-cured marketing seasons, the Windsor, Williamston, and Robersonvile, North Carolina, tobacco markets shall be designated as and called Windsor-Williamston-Robersonville. The regulations are amended to reflect this new designated market. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 27, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Director, Tobacco Division, Agricultural Marketing Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone number (202) 205&hyph;0567. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notice was published in the March 25, 1994, issue of the Federal Register (59 FR 4124) announcing that a referendum would be conducted among active flue-cured producers who sold tobacco on either Windsor, Williamston, or Robersonville, during the 1993 season to ascertain if such producers favored the consolidation. The notice of referendum announced the determination by the Secretary that the consolidated market of Windsor-Williamston-Robersonvile, North Carolina, would be designated as a flue-cured tobacco auction market and receive mandatory, Federal grading of tobacco sold at auction for the 1994 and succeeding seasons, subject to the results of the referendum. The determination was based on the evidence and arguments presented at a public hearing held in Williamston, North Carolina, on November 19, 1993, pursuant to applicable provisions of the regulations issued under the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended. The referendum was held in accordance with the provisions of the Tobacco Inspection Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 511d) and the regulations set forth in 7 CFR 29.74. Ballots for the April 4&hyph;8 referendum were mailed to 1,054 producers. Approval required votes in favor of the proposal by two-thirds of the eligible voters who cast valid ballots. The department received a total of 365 responses: 274 eligible producers voted in favor of the consolidation; 72 eligible producers voted against the consolidation; and 19 ballots were determined to be invalid. The Department of Agriculture is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12788, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This final rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule. Additionally, in conformance with the provisions of Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, full consideration has been given to the potential economic impact upon small business. Most tobacco producers and many tobacco warehouses are small businesses as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It has been determined that this action will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, and will not substantially affect the normal movement of the commodity in the marketplace.
