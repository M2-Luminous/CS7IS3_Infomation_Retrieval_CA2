"One cent," that is, one-hundredth of a dollar, renowned Washington writer Hobart Rowen whines, "is now worth no more than one Japanese yen." Even more than this rather curious observation, the more or less forced attempts to explain the slump of the dollar to one's fellow-citizens show that textbooks fail when emotions rule the markets. According to the textbooks, the dollar ought to be strong, because interest rates have been going up in the United States since the beginning of February, while in Germany they are going down. For 18 months the U.S. economy has been experiencing "an appropriate, if not even vigorous recovery" (Rowen), while in Germany and in Japan the signs of economic revival are not particularly dramatic. To make matters worse, however, the dollar is declining compared with the yen, which should actually be weakened because of the confusions of Japan's domestic policy and the new government crisis. At the time of the Plaza Accord in 1985 the dollar was worth 250 yen. At that time it was worth 2.65 German marks [DM] compared with the German currency. At that time the G-7 decided to bring the U.S. currency down to a more comfortable level, above all to reduce the U.S. foreign trade deficit. Looking back, it did not help much. The most recent commentaries forget, however, that the dollar has declined to an all-time low only compared with the yen. Compared with the mark, the U.S. currency met its Waterloo as early as the fall of 1992, when the Bush Administration's ability to act on the economy fanned worldwide distrust in the dollar. At that time DM1.3850 was offered for $1. Of course, the commentators admit that, in view of the rising export deficits, a weaker dollar would actually be welcome to the Clinton Administration. However, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has always denied that the Administration accepts or even promotes the slump of the dollar to improve the foreign trade results. Nor must the politician let himself be caught in the suspicion that he is secretly promoting the import of inflation in this way. Instead of supporting the dollar, the United States has the alternative of raising interest rates. Actually, on the U.S. markets there is speculation only about the date of a new increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board -- whether it will be this week or after the meeting of the Open Market Committee on 5 and 6 July.
