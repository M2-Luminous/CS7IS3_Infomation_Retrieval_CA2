Announcing the publication of the Discussion Paper, Mr. Atkins said: "The paper seeks to develop a transparent and coherent strategy for identifying and controlling chemicals which are particularly dangerous to the environment, especially those released from diffuse sources. The proposed strategy is based on internationally accepted criteria for assessing the risks to human health and the environment and advocates a measured approach to the control of these risks. "Our objective is to build upon existing programmes and measures, so that we remain consistent in our approach and minimise the burdens on the public sector and industry. "The proposed new policy framework is a response to the challenges the Government established in the UK Strategy for Sustainable Development. It also aims to meet two objectives of the Governments deregulation initiative - greater clarity in the operation of environmental regulations and the consideration of viable alternatives to regulatory action which maintain existing environmental standards." Notes To Editors The Discussion Paper - Reducing Emissions of Hazardous Chemicals to the Environment was released today for public consultation. Its publication fulfils a commitment made in the Sustainable Development Strategy. The paper describes a new policy framework for reducing diffuse emissions of hazardous substances to the environment. It consists of a discussion paper supported by several annexes. The discussion paper considers components of the proposed new framework in a stepwise manner beginning with criteria for identifying environmentally hazardous chemicals. The proposed criteria are intended to be consistent with those used in other UK substance based policy initiatives. This is followed by an outline of the principles of Risk Assessment; a vital component of the proposed strategy designed to inform decisions as to the extent of risk posed by a particular chemical and the degree of control necessary to manage the risk effectively. The paper then discusses a proposed hierarchy of measures to control chemical risks. Alternatives to regulatory control are considered including voluntary agreements with industry and economic instruments. The supporting annexes provide detailed information on typical point and diffuse sources of emissions of hazardous chemicals and many of the existing control measures including international initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol and the Oslo and Paris Conventions. Technical guidance on priority setting and risk characterisation for hazardous chemicals is also provided. The Government is seeking responses to the proposed strategy and related issues by the 31st May 1994. Press Enquiries: 071 276 0929; (Out of Hours:071 873 1966); Public Enquiries Unit:071 276 0900
