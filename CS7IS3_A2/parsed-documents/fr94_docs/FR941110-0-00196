FR941110-0-00196 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: One commenter stated that fines should accrue until a follow-up survey confirms compliance. This commenter said proposed ยง488.230(i)(7) should be revised because it rests on a clause rejected by OBRA '87 that paper review cannot adequately determine compliance. The commenter also said that if a facility requests a survey and is found out of compliance, the facility would be held liable for the costs of the survey. Response: We do not accept this comment. First, we are not suggesting that written credible evidence submitted to HCFA or the State can confirm substantial compliance in every situation. We are well aware that not every deficiency can be determined to be corrected by written evidence as not every requirement is related to a written record. OBRA '87 did increase the number of outcome oriented requirements and reduce the number of paper compliance requirements; however, it did not eliminate all paper compliance requirements. The examples used in the discussion of the comment above describe situations in which written credible evidence can confirm substantial compliance. When we can confirm substantial compliance without an on-site revisit, valuable resources can be conserved, creating a savings for the taxpayer. We do not accept the comment to charge the facility for the costs of the survey when it alleges substantial compliance but is found to be noncompliant at a revisit. The Act does not include the imposition of a survey charge as an available remedy. Comment: A commenter asked how a facility will notify the State when it has corrected the noncompliance. Response: When a facility has corrected the noncompliance, it may notify the State in whatever manner it feels is most appropriate. For instance, in certain situations written credible evidence sent through the mail will be the best method of notification. In other cases a telephone call to request an on-site revisit will be the most appropriate method of notification. Comment: A commenter asked how penalties will be computed during the interim when a facility believes it is in compliance and a survey team, upon revisit, disagrees. Response: While a revisit is pending, the penalties continue to accrue at the rate originally specified by HCFA or the State. However, HCFA or the State may propose to increase the daily penalty if a facility with nonimmediate jeopardy deficiencies alleges compliance, but on a revisit, HCFA or the State finds that the facility's deficiencies have become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy. When a facility disagrees with the decision made at the time of the revisit, this disagreement could be resolved through the administrative hearing process. HCFA has authority to settle cases at any time prior to a final administrative decision for facilities in which HCFA's enforcement action prevails. The State has authority to settle cases at any time prior to the evidentiary hearing decision for all cases in which the State's enforcement action prevails. These provisions are specified in redesignated ยง488.444. However, a civil money penalty would not be computed and collected until substantial compliance is verified, HCFA's or the State's decision of noncompliance is upheld after a final administrative decision, the facility waives its right to a hearing, or the facility is terminated. Comment: One commenter suggested adding a new provision to require that follow-up surveys be conducted within 10 days of the facility notifying the State or HCFA that it has substantially corrected deficiencies. The penalty is terminated on the date the facility provided the notice if the deficiencies are substantially corrected at the time of the revisit or the 10 day period for a revisit has elapsed and the revisit has not occurred. If a revisit determines the scope and severity of the deficiencies has changed, the penalty amount is adjusted and the penalty is effective on the date of the facility's notice. Response: We cannot accept this comment in total. However, as previously explained in this preamble, we are accepting the commenters' suggestion to incorporate the concept of substantial compliance into the regulation as the standard providers must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs as SNFs or NFs. Consequently, a remedy is lifted when deficiencies lessen to the point that the facility is in substantial compliance. The amount of the civil money penalty is increased to reflect repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements. The civil money penalty may be increased for a facility that has deficiencies, which, after imposition of a lower level penalty amount remain uncorrected and, in fact, become sufficiently serious to pose immediate jeopardy. The civil money penalty would be shifted to the lower range of penalty amounts for a facility which had immediate jeopardy deficiencies if the immediate jeopardy is removed. However, if the noncompliance that continues after the immediate jeopardy is removed constitutes repeated deficiencies in the same regulatory grouping of requirements, the civil money penalty would be increased in accordance with ยง488.438(d)(2) of this final rule. In a previous discussion, we clarified the reasons why we will not be constrained by a specified timeframe to conduct on-site revisits or suspend a penalty until we can revisit and the date when the penalty begins to accrue.
