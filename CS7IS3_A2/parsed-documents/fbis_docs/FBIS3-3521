Departments involved in agricultural development stipulated the reserved land is not allowed to be used for purposes other than farming, unless approved by the responsible department. One of the economically developed provinces, Zhejiang reported a record 45.6 billion yuan in total agricultural output value last year. However, for various reasons, the development of agriculture is still being threatened by intensified market competition, officials of the department in charge of agriculture said. To bring into play the initiative of farmers in growing food, the provincial government will also lift the grain purchase price, establish a risk fund system, and improve the grain reserves and readjustment systems. A host of granaries will be set up along the main roads running through the province, to relieve pressures on the grain-producing areas as well as make things convenient for grain transportation, government officials said. In addition, local governments and financial organizations at all levels will expand investment in the agricultural sector in 1994. According to sources from the provincial government, it will increase input in agriculture by ten percent this year. A total of more than three billion yuan was invested in the agricultural sector in 1993, the sources said. Researchers from the provincial research institutes will work hard to popularize fine varieties of crops as well as advanced planting techniques among farmers throughout the province, to help them benefit more from farming activities. Official sources said that the province's cultivated area of early rice this year is expected to reach some 871,000 ha.
