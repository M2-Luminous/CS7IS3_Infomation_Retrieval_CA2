During the 30-minute meeting, he answered a wide variety of questions. Sergey Stepashin characterized the country's current crime situation as critical. Soon the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, headed by Viktor Yerin, and the FCS will sign a cooperation pact in the struggle with corruption and organized crime. However, the shortcomings of legal and judicial laws continue to serve as loopholes through which criminal elements escape from retribution. [Begin Stepashin recording] What is particularly alarming today are the shortcomings in the judicial system. I remember when I was the chief of the St. Petersburg and before that the Leningrad administration of the (?KGB) and then the Security Ministry. We had 12 cases involving corruption among the highest echelons of power, at the level of heads of administrations, two deputy mayors, the former director of the Baltic Steamship Company Kharchenko -- you may have heard of that affair -- and they were all (?thrown out) by the courts. [end recording] As far as the establishment of contacts between the Russian Mafia and their foreign colleagues is concerned, the FCS has already signed a number of agreements on joint cooperation with the special services of China, Korea, Egypt, and Japan. The director of the FBI will visit Moscow at the beginning of July to bridle the rampant mafiosi together with our counterintelligence agents. The activities of North Korean citizens on the territory of the former Soviet Union also elicit very serious alarm since they are, under various pretexts, engaged in a search for components for nuclear weapons. In conclusion, Sergey Stepashin told the news conference that the FCS plans to intensify its activities aimed at strengthening Russian interests. Tonight he will leave for Vladivostok to continue his visit to the Far East.
