FR940426-2-00133 FR940426-2-00078 Circular 7005.1 provides that recipients should review each of their routes every three years to determine whether that service could be more effectively provided by private operators. FTA proposed to eliminate this provision, since reports from grantees indicated that it entails a significant administrative burden, especially for major grantees with large and complex route structures, requiring the devotion of substantial staff time to conducting reviews on an arbitrary three-year cycle. Five commenters, one representing private transit providers and four representing public transit agencies, addressed this issue. The commenter for the private sector termed an anomaly FTA's characterization of three-year route review as an undue burden, since the FT Act calls for Federal review of a grantee's planning processes every three years. This comment confuses FTA's statutory duty to conduct triennial reviews to ensure that transit programs comply with Federal requirements with a nonstatutory, nonregulatory mandate that a grantee review all routes within its system, even if use of a private operator is not feasible on its face or if, in fact, no private operator is available to provide service on these routes. This commenter also indicated that three-year route review is necessary to stimulate competition for transit services, but offered no evidence that the provision has ever been successful in increasing competitive bidding opportunities. The four commenters on behalf of transit agencies supported recision of the provision, agreeing that it requires an inordinate amount of staff time while producing few corresponding benefits. They emphasized that the decision of whether to put routes out to competitive bid should be made by the local transit authority working with the community and determined in the community's best interest. One grantee stated that the provision was redundant, since all of its service is already provided under contract with private operators. Another agency objected to a Federal mandate, suggesting on-going analyses of service to assess the cost-effectiveness and appropriate service levels required to meet demand, with an evaluation of whether service should be put to competitive bid based on its location, service area, deadhead miles, ridership level, and relationship to other services within the region. FTA agrees that use of such factors should provide some grantees with a more rational basis for determining the frequency of route reviews than the current mandatory three-year cycle, which, according to the commenters, is often an empty and time-consuming exercise. FTA therefore concludes that the three-year reviews of service routes provided by Circular 7005.1 should no longer be required. Instead, FTA encourages grantees to include periodic review of route service in the consultative process required under section 9(f) of the FT Act (49 U.S.C. app. 1607a). Grantees should base the frequency of these reviews on the factors cited above and any other factor a grantee finds relevant to its local circumstances. FTA believes that route evaluation using this process will relieve grantees of an undue administrative burden, while resulting in competitive bidding decisions that are based on appropriate and meaningful local factors. C. Fully Allocated Cost Analysis Circular 7005.1 provides that grantees should use a fully allocated cost methodology when providing service for comparison with the costs of potential private operators. The use of this accounting methodology was intended to ensure that local decisionmakers have considered all costs associated with the provision of service by a public agency.
