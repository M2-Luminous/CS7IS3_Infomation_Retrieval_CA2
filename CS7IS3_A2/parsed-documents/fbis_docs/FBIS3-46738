The LDP boycott earlier forced the ruling coalition to deliberate on the package in the absence of the largest opposition force in a Diet session that reconvened the same day. As a result of the LDP concession, legislators from the LDP, the Japanese Communist Party [JCP] and the Niin Club parliamentary group will question Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and other ministers in Thursday's session, the officials said. However, the LDP and ruling coalition partners failed to hammer out an accord on the parliamentary agenda for Friday and thereafter, they said. Meanwhile, the coalition decided to hold mandatory parliamentary hearings of a selected group of political scientists and citizens on the package on January 12, coalition officials said. Such hearings are mandatory procedures that have to be followed before a vote on the package. A standoff between the coalition and opposition, which has been demanding major modifications to the package, will be inevitable if the coalition proceeds with the hearings, LDP and coalition officials agreed. The ruling coalition earlier agreed to modify a proposed legal requirement that the Diet refuse to allocate House of Representatives seats to miniparties that failed to collect 3 percent of valid votes cast at the most recent national election, coalition officials said. The agreement came at a meeting of the executives of seven coalition partners at the coalition's political reform headquarters, the officials said. Both LDP and JCP have been demanding that the controversial provision be removed from the package of four political and electoral reform bills. The electoral bill calls for replacing the current 511-seat lower chamber with a mixture of 274 single-seat constituencies and proportional representation system, under which an additional 226 seats would be distributed on a nationwide basis. The so-called "3-percent requirement" would oblige the Diet to deny miniparties that failed to win 3 percent of eligible votes any seats that would be appropriated to bigger parties that met the requirement in proportion to the number of votes they had mustered in single-seat constituencies. The provision also means that unless a party has the record of winning 3 percent of votes in the most recent national election, it is not qualified to receive an official subsidy to finance its political activities from a newly created fund of 30.9 billion yen. The LDP and JCP have argued that such a provision would undermine the Diet's ability to translate into national policies the desires of voters who placed their trust in miniparties that failed to garner 3 percent of eligible votes. Yamahana told the House of Councillors' special committee on political reform, "The most crucial thing is to legislate the package. We will do our utmost by responding sufficiently to arguments between the ruling coalition and opposition camp." The committee kicked off the new year's first deliberations Wednesday after an eight-day recess, but the No. 1 opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) boycotted the session. In a meeting of committee managers earlier in the day, the LDP demanded that the resumption of debates be postponed until Thursday, parliamentary sources said. Prime minister told the committee session that reconvened in the morning the LDP's boycott is "very regrettable." "It is our heavy responsibility to settle the political reform matter in order to revive public trust in politics," he said. The ruling coalition decided Tuesday to complete debate on political reform at the upper house committee "by January 14" even if the LDP continued to boycott the committee sessions, coalition officials said. The package cleared the House of Representatives on November 18, but deliberations had stalled since then due to a parliamentary row over the opening of Japan's rice market and a payoff scandal involving Hosokawa.
