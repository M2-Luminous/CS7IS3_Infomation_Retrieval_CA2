What is the purpose of this document? [Constantinescu] The document is the result of a long study carried out by the Foundation's experts exclusively on the basis of official data supplied by the National Statistics Commission. By referring to that data, the document drew up suggestive charts on the main components of our economic and social life, such as unemployment, inflation, production, and trade (both domestic and foreign). Along with the public presentation of this image, we are also presenting the CDR's solutions for taking Romania out of the crisis and promoting the country's recovery. [Lupu] Why now? [Constantinescu] After enduring the last stage of the communist dictatorship and after this transition period, which, in our opinion, should now draw to an end, we would like to see these documents -- on what has happened and what should happen -- become the subject of a dialogue between responsible political forces, a dialogue which should be adequately covered by the press. At this point, I would like to digress a little from your question and tell you at the very beginning that I am particularly interested in striking up a relationship with the readers of ADEVARUL daily. I am not saying this to incur their liking, which is a common political trick. I say it as a steady reader of your newspaper, which addresses not an important category of the electorate, but an important category of citizens of the country. I have no doubts that a large proportion of ADEVARUL readers did not and do not share the ideas that I am promoting on behalf of the CDR. But, as I said during my election campaign, I am more interested in those who do not vote for us. I realize that one can never convince everybody. There must be people with other opinions, as well. If we had come to power, the existence of an opposition would have been as necessary as ever, since the opposition represents the interests of the citizens toward any administration. I am convinced that now is the time for a dialogue where facts -- not words -- count. [Lupu] A short while ago you launched a "Manifesto for the Salvation of Romania," as a basis for future discussions with the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. Nevertheless, the signals that you received from those quarters have not been all that positive so far. Does the manifesto or the latest document represent a last offer made by the opposition to the ruling party? [Constantinescu] No offer should be the last one and no dialogue should be the last one, either. Politics is important for the very reason that its role is to turn chaotic and violent confrontations into exchanges of ideas. [Lupu] Nevertheless, it seems that the negotiations conducted by the CDR parliamentary parties with the PDSR have only led to minor results. What are your plans for the forthcoming period? [Constantinescu] Unfortunately -- why not be open about it? -- we have noticed that for the past four months the PDSR has used us to counter the claims of its allied parties situated even further to the left of the political spectrum and to offer a false image of dialogue for both internal and external consumption. I do not see any further point in prolonging this incorrect and inefficient political game. [Lupu] What is the Convention doing about it? What will it decide at the next meeting of the CDR Council? [Constantinescu] Next week, we will be holding a meeting of the CDR Council. Speculations have been made, particularly in the press, to the extent that we will raise the issue of launching an election campaign. But this campaign is not a goal in itself. It should only be a means for a positive change in people's lives. What we now see as the current power's behavior is a reaction to the latest public opinion polls, which, regardless of nuances, have primarily emphasized that the CDR is ahead as far as the people's trust is concerned, thus turning our movement into the primary political force in the country. Then, according to the views of the participants in these public opinion polls, a CDR government has now edged into first place (with 35 percent), followed by a CDR- Democratic Party [PD]-PDSR government second, and a monocolor government like the current one third (with only 14 percent). Nowhere in the world can you have a viable government when all the opinion polls indicate that the level of distrust exceeds 70 percent! [Lupu] On the basis of the data in these polls, we conclude that, if elections were to be held now and these results were achieved, then the CDR and the PD would find themselves in today's situation of the PDSR and its current allies. Therefore, the basic aspects of the problem would not change and the parliamentary blockage would remain. How would you proceed in such a situation? [Constantinescu] Indeed, this is the direction indicated by all recent opinion polls. In all seriousness, though, I must say that elections are not carried out by opinion polls. We must take into consideration the huge means of influencing and organization available to the current power, primarily their ability to present themselves as a party-state. They are using, to a greater or lesser extent, the force of the state for the benefit of the party. However, if the blockage generated by the government's immobility persists on the key issues of reform, then the situation will further deteriorate and public support for the current opposition will grow. [Lupu] Do you hope that you will exceed the 51 percent that the opinion polls credit you with? [Constantinescu] Yes, so as to create a clearer majority that I believe the country needs so much. At the same time, I would like to clarify further a point linked to the parliamentary blockage, as you called it and as the rulers also call it. Well, there is no such thing as a parliamentary blockage! It only appears in the excuses of the current power, which wants to pass their only failures into the opposition's court. When the current parliamentary majority wants to pass a law, it does so, as the case of the Law on Agricultural Income Tax clearly shows. The opposition strongly opposed that law and even left Parliament's hall. However, the law was passed. Of course, the opposition can do something about it all, and it did so. For instance, these are the tactics that we adopted in the case of this law: The opposition seriously participated in the debates of the parliamentary commissions, thus managing to diminish the negative impact of this law by reducing the size of the stipulated taxes. If the initial form presented by the government is compared with the latest version, one can see the improvement. Therefore, if we did not exactly manage to block the government's draft law, we did manage at least to dilute it. On this occasion, people may notice that Parliament is not to be blamed for everything that does not work. Similarly, they may realize that Parliament's achievements are also due to the opposition's efforts.
