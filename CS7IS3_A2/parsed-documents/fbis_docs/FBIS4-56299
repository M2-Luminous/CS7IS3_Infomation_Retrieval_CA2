They believe this decision suggests that the government will not be able to guarantee clean presidential elections because it is preparing to face postelection discontent. Andres Rozental, deputy foreign relations secretary, denied that importing riot vehicles reflects fears of possible outbreaks of violence after the August elections. The official said the purchase of armored equipment is "a natural development in all world countries," adding that any claim it will serve to control postelection disturbances is "irresponsible." Rozental explained that importing 24 riot units was the responsibility of the National Defense Secretariat, which has been totally silent. The Media Directorate only stated "they do not know anything yet." He criticized the U.S. newspaper that reported this for doing so "without having any evidence," indicating that the purchase is indeed related to possible postelection disturbances. Juan Jose Castillo Mota, deputy of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), justified the measure and said it was about time to enforce the law and equip security forces with the most modern technology. "The equipment is not to restrict freedom of expression, but we must start to enforce the law with groups of citizens who commit abuses during demonstrations, especially when they block highways, an action that sometimes involves 20 to 50 people. Thus, in these cases we must clear highways and enforce the law," Castillo added. Last Thursday, the SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS NEWS published a front page report claiming that in the past two months the Mexican Government has imported at least 24 armored vehicles designed to control riots and that "this is apparently in preparation for civil disturbances after the late summer elections" in Mexico. Government Adopting Hard Line: PRD During a tour of Los Angeles, PRD National President Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano said "the creation of the Mexican Public Security Coordinating Board (CSPN) and the appointment of Arsenio Farell to chair it shows that the government is adopting a hard line. The purchase of the riot equipment has the same purpose. "The government seeks to compensate for the evident weakness of its presidential candidate with these kind of measures." Mario Saucedo, secretary general of the PRD CEN [National Executive Committee], said everything seems to indicate that this administration expects a citizen mobilization "because it is planning to impose its candidate." There is no doubt, he insisted, given the most recent measures, that "it will try to implement this action at all cost." Ricardo Valero, coordinator of the PRD deputies, pointed out the most recent federal government decisions on security matters "are disturbing and extraordinarily dangerous." He added that a confirmation of the purchase of riot tanks in relation to the creation of the CSPN and the reappearance of figures such as Carlos Hank Gonzalez would "objectively" lead us to conclude that Salinas de Gortari has no intention of supporting a credible electoral process. Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, spokesman for the Cardenas presidential campaign, pointed out that these developments "are clear signs of the entrenchment and hardening of the position of the state." He wondered: "If they will guarantee clean elections, what do they want armored vehicles for? PRD Legislator Julio Cesar Garcia underscored the repressive nature of a measure such as the one that was reported, because it jeopardizes the constitutional rights of freedom of expression and of conducting public demonstrations. Garcia said the government is seeking ways to protect itself and apply a forceful hand on possible protests following the presidential elections of 21 August. Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, also a PRD member, demanded "specific information" from the government regarding the alleged purchase of 24 riot units and an explanation of the purpose of the purchase because the conclusion one might reach at this point is that the goal is to impose a "hard-line policy" and a policy of "confrontation." He added: "I do not wish to make predictions or speculations, but we do hope this administration is not thinking about using them to counter political demonstrations" because this possibility, which is undemocratic, reflects a false concept of national security." PAN: Lightning That Presages a Storm Felipe Calderon, secretary general of the PAN's CEN, pointed out that "this kind of purchase is disturbing because it suggests that the government is preparing to confront future political problems." He added that resorting to this kind of equipment "as an element of repression" is no way to confront the causes of the violence that is provoked in the country. Actually, he said, a culture of political responsibility must be promoted instead of the modernization of the apparatus of repression. PAN Federal Deputy Jose Paoli said that should the federal government not explain the purchase of riot vehicles, this will be demanded within the Chamber of Deputies. PAN Legislator Manuel Rivera del Campo pointed out that, although the authorities refuse to admit it, importing riot vehicles shows that "it is clear that things are not going as well in the country as they wish to make us believe because there are many problems that the government has not solved. "It is not correct to confront citizen protests or demonstrations through forceful means because they will create more problems than those that they are trying to solve," he added. Rivera noted that "the government is expecting an ungovernable situation after the elections and adopted this measure as a precaution against a conflict in order to be able to subdue the demonstrators." He warned: "This is lightning that presages a storm." Forceful Actions and Violence: ONG [Nongovernmental Organizations] The national network of civilian human rights organizations also gave its opinion on the 24 riot units that the Mexican Government purchased in the United States. It stated that "if there were political will, there would be no need for tanks to face riots." "The purchase of this equipment suggests that there will be no clean presidential elections," it added. Mariclaire Acosta, of the Mexican Defense and Protection of Human Rights Commission [Comision Mexicana de Defensa y Proteccion de los Derechos Humanos], said: "We must realize that the government is determined to face a major postelection conflict." She underscored that these problems will be similar to those faced in France, where political disorders are settled through forceful and violent means. Emilio Krieger, president of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers (ANAD), pointed out that "this is a serious" measure and that "one could presume that the government is purchasing weapons in preparation for the elections." I would like to know, he added, whether the purchase of these tanks is related to the electoral process; this must be explained not by the National Defense Secretariat or the Government Secretariat, but by the president of the republic. The Roads and Safety Secretariat said the weapons it plans to purchase seek to modernize the sector. It reported that the pistols it will purchase will reportedly hold 18 rounds and added that it is currently negotiating with a Swedish company called Sixsahuer. [Mexico City LA JORNADA in Spanish on 29 April on page 53 publishes a 150-word article stating that: "Enrique Jackson, secretary general of the Federal District government, and Humberto Benitez Trevino, attorney general of the Federal District, said they know nothing about the purchase of riot equipment."]
