At 0.3 percent, GNP dropped much less than that of western Germany (1.9 percent). Austrian industry reacted quickly to the declining orders from abroad. It reduced production by 3 percent and investments by one-fifth. A total of 6.5 percent of all jobs were lost in industry in 1993. Consumption and the construction industry had a stabilizing effect. The recession left clear traces in the budget, however: At 98 billion schillings, the budget deficit was twice as high as planned.
