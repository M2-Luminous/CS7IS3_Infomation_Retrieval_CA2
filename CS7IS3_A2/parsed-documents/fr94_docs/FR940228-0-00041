FR940228-0-00041 FR940228-0-00007 In its comment letter, the PSA stated that the ten-day buy-in rule for customer sell orders should not be adopted because it has minimal customer protection benefits. The PSA noted that improvements in the settlement processes and the fact that most Treasury, agency and government mortgage-backed securities are now in book-entry form have resulted in increased deliveries and fewer overall fails. For those few fails that may still occur, the PSA stated that ``[b]roker-dealers have business incentives to clean up fails to limit their market exposure.'' 13 For mortgage-backed securities, the ten-day buy-in time frame would be problematic since it would require delivery of securities outside of the regularly scheduled settlement cycles. The PSA suggested that, if Treasury believes a buy-in rule for customer sell orders must be adopted, the time frame should be consistent with the applicable buy-in time frames for fails to receive. 13 June 17, 1991 PSA Letter, supra note 5, at 3. The Department continues to believe that buy-in rules for customer sell orders are needed to strengthen customer protection because a customer's failure to deliver a security to an executing broker or dealer could result in that broker's or dealer's failure to deliver to another counterparty. Further, these rules will prevent customers from taking advantage of market fluctuations by refusing to deliver a security to a broker or dealer when the price rises after a sell order has been executed. In response to the comments made by the PSA, the Department is revising the buy-in time frame for customer sell orders in new paragraphs 403.4(l) and paragraph 403.5(g), applicable to registered government securities brokers-dealers and financial institution government securities broker-dealers, respectively, from ten business days to 30 calendar days for all government securities, except mortgage-backed securities, and to 60 calendar days for all government mortgage-backed securities. 14 These time frames are consistent with the buy-in requirements for fails to receive addressed above. The Department also modified the customer sell order rules to permit the use of alternatives other than purchasing securities (e.g., securities may be borrowed, substituted or bought back) in closing out orders. Again, this is consistent with the buy-in rules for fails to receive. 14 The Department is also adopting without change, the amendments to section 403.1, which requires registered broker-dealers to comply with paragraph 403.4(l). The buy-in rules for customer sell orders continue to provide an exemption for short sales, which are the primary cause for non-deliveries. This should significantly reduce the number of fails subject to these requirements. Similar to buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status, broker-dealers will be allowed to effect buy-ins for customer sell orders of mortgage-backed securities at the next regularly scheduled settlement cycle. 15 15 The SEC's buy-in requirement for customer sell orders has been suspended with respect to exempted securities. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 10093 (April 10, 1973), 38 FR 12103 (May 9, 1973). It is the Department's understanding that SEC staff intends to recommend to the Commission a proposal to lift the suspension of paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3&hyph;3 with respect to exempted securities and amend the provision in a manner that would conform with Treasury's final rule in paragraph 403.4(l) as it relates to government and mortgage-backed securities. Finally, the Department is also adopting without change redesignated paragraph 403.5(h), which will now grant the appropriate regulatory agencies for financial institutions the authority to extend the 30- and 60-calendar day time frame for buy-ins of customer sell orders if a financial institution broker-dealer requests an extension. No comments were received on this provision.
