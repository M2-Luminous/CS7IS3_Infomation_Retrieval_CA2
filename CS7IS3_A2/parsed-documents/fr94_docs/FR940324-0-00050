FR940324-0-00050 FR940324-0-00020 TFI refers to D c measurements made by Zapalac (HP83) and Stranden and Berteig (HP80a). Zapalac reports D c values of 3.3 × 10 ^4 cm 2 /s and 6.0 × 10 ^4 cm 2 /s for concretes with densities of 2.3 and 2.4 g/cm 3 . The measurements by Rogers and Nielson (RO90) also give the dependence of D c on the concrete density. The residential concretes that they tested had densities generally of 2.1 g/cm 3 or less. For the densities used by Zapalac, the Rogers and Nielson correlation predicts D c values of 1.2 × 10 ^4 and 4.0 × 10 ^4 cm 2 /s. Thus, the data used in the risk assessments are consistent with Zapalac's data. Stranden and Berteig did not give the densities for their concrete, so a direct comparison is not possible. However, it is worth noting that since the Stranden and Berteig measurements relied only on the radon generated within the concrete, they are not a very sensitive measure of D c . Since a significant fraction of residential concretes have densities less than 2.2 g/cm 3 , the value of 5.1 × 10 ^3 cm 2 /s for D c is reasonable for the risk assessments. Objection: The radon decay product equilibrium fraction of 0.5 is the upper bound of the range of 0.3 to 0.5 found in the Florida Statewide Radiation Study. The average indoor radon equilibrium fraction from houses where the radon concentrations ranged from 0.4 to >8 pCi/l was 0.42. The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) in its Report 94 and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) recommend 0.4 as an indoor equilibrium fraction. The selected value of 0.5 is also inconsistent with the assumption of 2 air changes per hour. Krisiuk (HP80b) gives a value of 0.36 for a ventilation rate of 2 air changes per hour. If other removal mechanisms are considered (e.g., plateout and deposition), the equilibrium would be even lower. Use of 0.5 for the equilibrium fraction results in overestimating the risks from indoor radon exposure by a factor of at least 1.4. Response: The EPA's radon risk factor incorporates a 0.5 equilibrium fraction. The value of 2 air changes per hour was not chosen to be consistent with the radon decay product equilibrium fraction. If they were made consistent, then 1 air change per hour (HP80b) would have been used. The value of 1 air change per hour is about the average for residences in the United States (NA88), and results in an average equilibrium fraction of about 0.5. Thus, the use of 2 air changes per hour in the risk assessments is non-conservative. Objection: Based on estimates of the NCRP in Report No. 45, the PATHRAE model overestimates the effective gamma dose rate by a factor of 2.5. Response: For Scenarios 1 and 2, the BID gives an annual external gamma dose equivalent of 3.5 mrem/y from a soil Ra-226 concentration of 0.69 pCi/g. This is equal to a dose rate of 2.5 urad/h per Pci/g of Ra-226. TFI references the 1.6 urad/hr per pCi/g value recommended by the NCRP (NCRP75 and NCRP87). Thus, the NCRP's value is lower than the PATHRAE results by 36 percent, not the factor of 2.5 claimed by TFI.
