He added that, as China maintained its policy of attaching importance to improving friendly relations with Japan, it intended to keep those relations going from generation to generation by deepening exchanges with the JNP, the ruling parties, and opposition parties, and by promoting mutual understanding. In response, Mr. Banri Kaieda handed over a letter from Prime Minister Hosokawa addressed to President Jiang Zemin and indicated the JNP was committed to further improving relations between Japan and China.
