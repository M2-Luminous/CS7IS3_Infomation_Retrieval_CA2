This involves approximately 24 billion German marks for 1994-98. However, it remains to be seen whether Krueger will achieve this goal. It is expected that the minister has to set priorities to ensure the smooth continuation of EU-financed projects with German participation, for instance in information technology. It is also expected that there will be differences of opinion on industrial policy. Last week, the Mediation Committee, which consists of the 12 EU research ministers and 12 representatives of the European Parliament, agreed on the 1994-98 EU research budget. The Fourth Research Framework Program, which unites all research activities of the European Union, will allocate 12.3 billion ECU. In addition, in 1996 another 0.7 billion ECU can be approved, the use of which is to be made dependent on the economic situation. After a formal confirmation of the results achieved in the Mediation Committee by the Council of Ministers and the parliament, the committee can now present the 20 specific programs, with which the framework program is to be implemented. According to the Research Ministry, 1.25 billion of the 12.3 billion ECU will go to Euratom (840 million ECU for fusion research, 414 million ECU for nuclear safety) and 9.4 billion ECU to the actual technical programs. A total of 3.4 billion ECU are to be allocated to information and communications technology, followed by about 2 billion ECU for industrial technologies, which include material research, aviation research, and the fields of measuring and testing. In the program for non-nuclear energies, (about 1 billion ECU) 60 percent are to be used for renewable energies and 40 percent for research and development work for energy saving. Approximately 1 billion ECU are planned for environment, climate, and ocean research. In the FRG Research Ministry it is assumed that, within the framework of the Program for Industrial Technologies, the committee will also suggest means to promote the automobile industry. This, however, will probably provoke a controversy over European industrial policy, because, in contrast to France or Italy, for instance, the FRG rejects specific promotion of the automobile industry or other industrial branches for reasons of order policy. Still, in the ministry it is not expected that the automobile industry will get nothing at all. The Research Ministry also expects differences of opinion regarding the item "International Cooperation" amounting to 540 million ECU. While the southern EU countries are striving for more intensive cooperation with Latin America, Krueger primarily thinks of cooperation with the countries in Central and Eastern Europe. First tenders for project proposals are to be issued at the end of 1994 and the beginning of 1995. The projects are assessed anonymously. Even though Krueger will try to have all 20 programs passed during the second half of 1994, when Germany will hold the EU presidency, it remains to be seen whether this will be possible. Thus, Krueger must set priorities to get as many programs as possible passed. Of particular importance is the smooth EU financing of projects in the field of information technology with German participation. The passing of the environmental program is considered to be politically important. The EU decisions also have an effect on the EU's Common Research Office. It operates eight institutes in four countries, including an institute in Karlsruhe.
