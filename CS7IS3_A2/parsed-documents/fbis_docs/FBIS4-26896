Zhang Kexiao, a senior official in charge of housing development, said the plan is to build 3.19-million-sq.-m of fully serviced homes by 1997 on the eastern outskirts of the city, the capital of central China's Hubei Province. Zhang said these houses will be able to accommodate about 200,000 people, each currently having less than eight sq. m of housing area, the minimum figure prescribed by the central government. "The site levelling, the building of roads, water and electricity facilities for the whole area have now been completed, and we expect to complete the 800,000 sq. m of houses of the first phase by the end of the year," he said The whole project will cost nine billion yuan, he added. Some 30 to 40 percent will be financed by the Hong Kong-based New World Group, the rest by the city government. He noted that the government has reduced or remitted part of the taxes and charges for the project, such as the land rent, to ensure the houses will be affordable to low-income residents.
