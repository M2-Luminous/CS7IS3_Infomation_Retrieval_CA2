It will not be easy to push this through, but it is economically and technically possible, Ludger Volmer, spokesman of the Federal Executive Committee, said before journalists in Bonn on Tuesday [26 April] on the occasion of the eighth anniversary of the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl. One can build on the 1986 SPD decision to abandon nuclear power within 10 years. Volmer and his party friends Klaus-Dieter Feige and Manfred Busch affirmed the call for the immediate shutdown of all Chernobyl-type reactors, which are the most dangerous timebombs in East Europe. Retrofitting measures that cost billions [currency not specified] would not reduce the risk of a new catastrophe. New energy policy priorities have to be set. The abandonment of nuclear energy in Germany can break existing barriers and initiate an energy policy throughout Europe that is oriented toward ecological restraint, it was stated.
