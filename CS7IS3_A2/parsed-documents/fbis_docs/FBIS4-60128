He said he hoped this conduct will not lead to undesirable consequences between the two Muslim neighbors. In a statement to a MENA correspondent in Khartoum on his reaction to recent developments, Dr. Jad-al-Haqq said he finds no justification for the Sudanese conduct on such holy days. Dr. Jad-al-Haqq added that he received a telephone call from Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on the surprising Sudanese conduct, and the minister hoped things will not go too far. The ambassador added that he asked Minister Musa to postpone the dispatch of an aircraft to transport Egyptian nationals from Sudan. He requested a chance to see whether his contacts with senior Sudanese officials and key figures, particularly Dr. Hasan al-Turabi, would succeed in solving this crisis, which might ruin relations between the two countries. Dr. Jad-al-Haqq expressed the hope that the Sudanese will be reasonable and refrain from this conduct, which should never happen in a Muslim or non-Muslim state no matter what. The ambassador questioned why officials in the Sudanese Government did not follow the traditional procedure of notifying him of their plans in advance.
