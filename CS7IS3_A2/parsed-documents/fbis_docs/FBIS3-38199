Mr. Cotti was speaking after discussions on the third day of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort of Davos. Switzerland has been negotiating for closer relations with the EU following its rejection of membership of the European Economic Area in 1992. Meanwhile, the Mexican president, Carlos Salinas De Gortari, has appealed to the forum for investment in his country. He described the uprising of indigenous rebels in the southern state of Chiapas as a local problem in a region of deep poverty, and said the government was determined to reach a political solution. The highlight of the forum is shortly due to take place, when Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres meets Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasir 'Arafat. The two men will discuss how to resolve differences over the Palestinian autonomy accord.
