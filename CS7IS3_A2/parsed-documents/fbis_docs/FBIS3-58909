At the same time, the relevant decrees were also published which set March 27th as the date for coming general elections and April 15th as the date for the first meeting of the new legislature. Meanwhile, Premier Carlo Azeglio Ciampi conferred separately here Tuesday [18 January] morning, first with the Senate Speaker Giovanni Spadolini at Palazzo Giustiniani [residence of Senate speaker], and then with House Speaker Giorgio Napolitano at Montecitorio [parliament], on a decree extending voting into a second day, March 28th, so that Orthodox Jews could cast their ballots once the sun went down on their Passover holiday during which time they cannot participate in other than religious activity. Coming out of the meeting, Spadolini said he had the impression that once the consensus was assured of the various parliamentary caucuses, the decree could be launched this very day. Spadolini said he would be contacting caucus leaders by telephone, noting that complete unanimity was not required. In reply to a journalist's question, Spadolini noted that customarily the government did not present electoral decrees once parliament was dissolved and elections were called but that this exceptional procedure was resorted to, given the exceptional circumstances, although there was no constitutional veto on such a move. A similar assessment was made by Napolitano who also proceeded to sound out causcus leaders in the Lower House.
