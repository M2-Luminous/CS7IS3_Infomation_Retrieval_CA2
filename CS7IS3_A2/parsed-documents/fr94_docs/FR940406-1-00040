FR940406-1-00040 FR940406-1-00011 APPENDIX I. Definitions As used in this appendix_ 1. ``Automobile,'' ``fuel economy,'' ``manufacturer,'' and ``model year,'' have the meaning given them in Section 501 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C. 2001. 2. ``Cargo-carrying volume,'' ``gross vehicle weight rating'' (GVWR), and ``passenger-carrying volume'' are used as defined in 49 CFR 523.2. 3. ``Basic engine'' has the meaning given in 40 CFR 600.002&hyph;85(a)(21). When identifying a basic engine, respondent should provide the following information: (i) Engine displacement (in cubic inches). (ii) Number of cylinders or rotors. (iii) Number of valves per cylinder. (iv) Cylinder configuration (V, in-line, etc.). (v) Number of carburetor barrels, if applicable. (vi) Other engine characteristics, abbreviated as follows: DD_Direct Injection Diesel ID_Indirect Injection Diesel R_Rotary TB_Throttle Body Fuel Injection S.I. (Spark Ignition) MP_Multipoint Fuel Injection S.I. TD_Turbocharged Diesel TS_Turbocharged S.I. FFS_Feedback Fuel System 2C_Two_Cycle OHC_Overhead camshaft DOHC_Dual overhead camshafts 4. ``Domestically manufactured'' is used as defined in Section 503(b)(2)(E) of the Act. 5. ``Light truck'' means an automobile of the type described in 49 CFR Part 523.5. 6. A ``model'' of light truck is a line, such as the Chevrolet C&hyph;10 or Astro, Ford F150 or E150, Jeep Wrangler, etc., which exists within a manufacturer's fleet. 7. ``Model Type'' is used as defined in 40 CFR 600.002&hyph;85(a)(19). 8. ``Percent fuel economy improvements'' means that percentage which corresponds to the amount by which respondent could improve the fuel economy of vehicles in a given model or class through the application of a specified technology, averaged over all vehicles of that model or in that class which feasibly could use the technology. Projections of percent fuel economy improvement should be based on the assumption of maximum efforts by respondent to achieve the highest possible fuel economy increase through the application of the technology. The baseline for determination of percent fuel economy improvement is the level of technology and vehicle performance with respect to acceleration and gradeability for respondent's 1994 model year light trucks in the equivalent class.
