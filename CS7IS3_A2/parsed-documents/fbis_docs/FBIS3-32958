On the one hand, we have construction and services, both public and private, which are expanding rapidly and reporting high profits; and, on the other hand, we have most of agriculture, mining, and industry, as well as some internationally negotiable services, such as tourism and big business credit, where profits are declining, as are growth and job creation. It is very likely that the economy will continue to be spurred on by construction and services in 1994, especially in the country's principal cities, where overt unemployment has fallen below 8 percent for the first time in many years. But these rosy statistics on urban unemployment and GDP [gross domestic product] conceal another story, one whose impact the next administration will have to grapple with. The composition of production and employment is changing at a dizzying pace. The uncontrolled opening of the economy and the revaluation of the peso are leading to the deindustrialization of the country and a decline in the proportion of stable, well-paying jobs covered by collective bargaining agreements. Construction and services do create jobs, but the jobs are less secure and pay less than those in industry. The labor reform measures, which did a great deal to make this market more flexible, have had the opposite result of what was expected: The proportion of workers in the informal sector has gone up as a result of the payroll cutbacks and the expansion of services. The development model that the next government will inherit is thus much more like Spain's than like Taiwan's. The hypertrophy of construction and services, derived from a revalued currency and short-term foreign capital movements, is something very different from what the Asian Tigers have done to create economies based on the export of increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods. Our case is more similar to that of Spain before the peseta collapsed and the construction boom subsided while the flow of foreign capital stopped in a fearful response to the growing balance of trade deficit.
