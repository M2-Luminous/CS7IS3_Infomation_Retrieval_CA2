FR940622-0-00024 FR940622-0-00011 Set forth below is a summary of the current legislative provisions concerning the responsibilities of Medicare participating hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) in emergency cases. This legislative summary first sets forth the major provisions of section 1867 of the Act, as originally enacted by COBRA on April 7, 1986, and including all amendments that have occurred since that time. The summary then describes separately the amendments made by OBRA 89 and OBRA 90, which were enacted after the publication of the June 16, 1988, notice of proposed rulemaking. 1. Current Provisions Section 9121 of COBRA added a paragraph (I) to section 1866(a)(1) of the Act and added a new section 1867 to the Act. As amended, these sections prohibit hospitals (including rural primary care hospitals) with emergency medical departments from refusing to treat individuals with unstable emergency medical conditions and also contain provisions designed to halt the inappropriate transfers of these individuals to other medical facilities. ( Note: For purposes of this preamble, all further references to ``hospital'' in the context of a ``Hospital's Responsibility for Emergency Care'' include rural primary care hospitals.) Section 1866(a)(1)(I) of the Act requires that a hospital participating in the Medicare program must agree to comply with the requirements of section 1867 of the Act to the extent applicable. Section 1867 of the Act currently provides the following: •A hospital with an emergency department must, within the capabilities of its emergency department (including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department), provide an appropriate medical screening examination to any individual who comes to the emergency department for examination or treatment of a medical condition and on whose behalf the examination or treatment is requested; the purpose of the examination is to determine whether the individual has an emergency medical condition. This requirement applies regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare benefits. •If an individual, regardless of eligibility for Medicare benefits, has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must either provide for further examination and treatment (within its capabilities) to stabilize the medical condition or make an appropriate transfer, with a proper certification, of the individual to another medical facility, unless the treatment or transfer is refused. •A hospital may not transfer an individual unless_ +␣_The individual, or a legally responsible person acting on his or her behalf, requests the transfer, or ␣_A physician, or other qualified medical personnel, after consulting with a physician (who later countersigns the certification because a physician is not physically present in the emergency department), has certified that the medical benefits expected from the treatment at the receiving facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child, from effecting the transfer; and +␣The transfer is an ``appropriate transfer'', that is, a transfer_ _Where the transferring hospital provides the medical treatment within its capacity that minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child; _In which the receiving facility has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual and has agreed to accept the transfer and to provide appropriate medical treatment; _In which the transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all appropriate medical records (or copies) available at the time of transfer that are related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented including records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observation of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, treatment provided, results of any tests and informal written consent or certification (or copies), and the name and address of any on-call physician who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment; _In which the transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required, including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer; and _That meets other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of the patient. •A hospital that fails to meet the requirements of section 1867 of the Act_ +␣Is subject to termination of its Medicare provider agreement if it fails to comply with section 1867; and +␣Is subject to civil monetary penalties if it negligently violates section 1867 of the Act. The penalty cannot exceed $25,000 for each violation committed between August 1, 1986 (the effective date of the statute) and December 21, 1987, or $50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987. (The amount was raised by section 4009(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87), Pub. L. 100&hyph;203, effective December 22, 1987.) (Exception: If the hospital has fewer than 100 State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds, then the maximum civil monetary penalty is $25,000. See discussion of section 4008 of OBRA 90 below.) •Each physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment or transfer of an individual (including a physician who is on-call for the care of such individual) is also subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $25,000 for each violation ($50,000 for violations on or after December 22, 1987), including_ +␣The signing of transfer certifications if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits of transfer did not outweigh the risks, and +␣Misrepresenting an individual's condition or other information, including a hospital's obligations under this section. A physician may also be excluded from participation in the Medicare and State health care programs for a violation that is gross and flagrant or repeated. •If a hospital violates the requirements of section 1867 of the Act and a patient suffers personal harm as a direct result, he or she may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain damages for personal injury under the law of the State in which the hospital is located and may obtain such equitable relief as is appropriate.
