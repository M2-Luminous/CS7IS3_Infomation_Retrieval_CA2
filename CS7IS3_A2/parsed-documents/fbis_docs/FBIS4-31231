Klaus. As we have reported, NOVA announced via CTK that it would not broadcast the program with Klaus due to a "technical error." In fact, this was not due to a "technical error" but because Klaus reacted acrimoniously to some of the questions from L. Beniak, and the program, according to RUDE PRAVO's information, was not aired at the request of the prime minister. The RUDE PRAVO editorial office has managed to obtain a recording of the program and, in view of the fact that the whole issue has meanwhile become politicized, it considers it necessary to fulfill its obligation to keep the public informed and to disclose some of the prime minister's replies. The NOVA management was still insisting yesterday evening, under the threat of legal action, that RUDE PRAVO not publish anything from the recording. We are publishing some excerpts that document the course of the interview. [Beniak] I asked my friends abroad to send me all of the newspaper clippings possible in which they write about you. I found a couple of characteristic features in them: He has the talent to say terrible things in the most amiable way; he has an unfortunate aptitude for making enemies of people who support his policy; and he does not suffer in silence when he has to deal with people whom he regards as fools, including reporters. And, there are adjectives such as "virulent," "gruff," "hurtful," "contemptuous," "aggressive," and "arrogant." What affect does this have on you when they write that you are arrogant? Do you let it pass, or does it annoy you or bother you? Do you have the nasty feeling that someone does not understand you? [Klaus] I think these are only some of the clippings. I think we could bring in completely different clippings. That was one tendency in these clippings, and it has become a definite cliche. I think that, when a reporter does not know what to write, does not know what to say, has no arguments, and so on, he resorts to these facile and unidirectional judgments, when it is not the substance but something superficial that is being assessed, and I really disagree with this. I do not believe that this is true. [Beniak] Nevertheless, you are perhaps the only politician, or the only politician accessible to us, who, for instance, does not forgive reporters if they do not ask a question properly. You are certainly the only one. You immediately feel the need to point out that it is imprecise. Others react, let us say, politely, let it pass, and then answer. [Klaus] We each have some proclivity. I have to admit that sometimes I chose this one, sometimes another. That I always correct reporters if it seems to me that the question is wrong, again I have to say that it would appear otherwise; this is simply not true. I repeat and I insist that sometimes a person chooses one technique and strategy and sometimes another. [Beniak] Karel Hvizdala, when he wrote a book with you in 1992 called First Report, reminded you that, in reply to a question on what you consider to be your weakness, you once said: a lack of credence in opinions held by someone else. You said this on 4 April 1990 in an interview that I recorded with you and that you authorized. Do you think this was, shall we say, a slip of the tongue...? [Klaus] Of course, I cannot, over four years, remember every single word that I said. I certainly could not have meant this, I could not have said.... I said that there may be a tendency toward this, or that there may be in this respect, if I were to measure it on scales, then I would say in a ratio of 51:49, that there may be a certain problem. However, there is no question that this would be an absolute judgment, and I simply do not think it is. [Beniak] Sometimes you definitely encounter manifestations of antagonism--let us say, you are asked questions to which you reply that their resolution is not within your jurisdiction. Typical questions: Will you increase the price of something else? I mean the kind of antagonism in PRACE, for example, when it published an interview composed of questions readers had sent to the editorial office--it was very noticeable there. What affect does this have on you? [Klaus] You are choosing only negative questions, and now you are forcing me to go on the defensive. I will not accept them, Mr. Editor. I do not accept this. The world is not like this, not at all like this. It is quite different. Another motif prevails absolutely. I will not accept these questions. I do not accept them; do not be angry with me. I do not accept them. Why do you not speak about other issues? Why do you choose one random interview? Why do you interpret this interview in this way? The world is simply not like this. It is not a view of the world that I accept exists like this. [Beniak] I am unable, in the course of 20 minutes, to ask questions from which it is possible to put together... [Klaus] You are the one who is asking that we do something like this... I am not desirous of it. [Beniak] I have spent several days reading your interviews and books... [Klaus] Something else is paramount, right? [Beniak] I am trying to ask questions that you are not normally asked or that you evidently do not like to answer... [Klaus] They are asked constantly, these questions. If the day before yesterday I had a one-hour interview on Radio Frekvence 1, the questions were about nothing other than this. I simply do not understand where these questions can lead, how it is possible to answer them. I cannot imagine this at all. [Beniak] I am saying--and you know this from sports--that a person reveals himself most when he is under pressure, when he has to respond to something that is unpleasant for him. [Klaus] Then, the only possibility is if he accepts this pressure, if this pressure is fair, if this pressure is correct or incorrect. [Beniak] Do you think my questions are unfair? [Klaus] No; the issue does not involve fairness. I am surprised by their selection, by their range. I do not understand where it can lead and where it is leading. You had better ask; this is probably a waste of time for your viewers. [Beniak] What kind of leader of the opposition would you be? [Klaus] What kind of question is that? What do you want to say? If we are ever in opposition, then, undoubtedly, we will act somehow. [Beniak] What kind of opposition would it be--good, bad? [Klaus] What could the answer possibly be to that question, an answer that would satisfy you a little, at least a little? I could now start asking you questions and you would be under pressure. It does not seem to me that these questions add anything; they lead to an opening being created for something, they lead to a possible answer, they lead to a situation in which a person could somehow reveal something that is not known about him. I do not believe this, I simply....
