The Jordanian leadership and people were not content only to condemn and denounce the reprehensible crime, organize protest demonstrations, explain its obnoxious hostile and provocative designs, and outline the intentions of those behind it but accompanied this with concrete practical measures denoting maturity, wisdom, and deliberation. His Majesty King Husayn donated 100,000 Jordanian dinars. The Government also donated 100,000 dinars. The Jordanian citizens donated goods and medicines, as well as the blood needed for the wounded. His Majesty King Husayn's reply was a national response showing a high sense of responsibility, wisdom, and clarity of vision. The king called on the Arab leaders to shoulder their responsibilities, and to unite their ranks, actions, and stands. He also called on them to forget their differences and rise above the causes of dispute and estrangement. [passage omitted] In any case, all the people and countries in the world and all the international organizations and bodies, including the UN Security Council and the United Nations, have come to realize that it is impossible to achieve peace in the occupied Palestinian territories with the presence of the settlements and the Jewish settlers. It has also been proved that the Arab citizens, the Islamic holy places, and the Muslim and Christian places of worship there need international protection. This requires the dispatch of an international peacekeeping force to the occupied Gaza Strip and the West Bank to protect their inhabitants and holy places. The responsibility for the bloody dawn massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque is borne by Israel and by the United States which encourages it to pursue its settlement policy. This calls for a united Arab stand to confront all these momentous challenges.
