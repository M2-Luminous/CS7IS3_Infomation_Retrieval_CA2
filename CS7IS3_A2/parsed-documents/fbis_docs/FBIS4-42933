The two ministers discussed the issues of artificial tension in Greek-Turkish relations and the Ecumenical Patriarchate's security. The foreign minister described the meeting as positive and said he hopes there will be a positive results in the future. Papoulias added that he and his Turkish counterpart agreed that shrill diatribes do not help to create an appropriate climate to deal with the existing problems. He said unfounded accusations that Greece is supposedly backing terrorist organizations in Turkey are unacceptable. He also raised the issue of the recent attacks against the Patriarchate. Papoulias said he was satisfied with yesterday's statement by his Turkish counterpart denying Turkish press reports on Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller remarks. The foreign minister said he and Cetin agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in combating drug trafficking and the issue of illegal immigrants. The two sides also agreed to promote the treaty on economic cooperation in the Black Sea and establish a cooperation bank in Thessaloniki. Cetin described the meeting as very useful and stressed that the two sides must closely follow actions that undermine the common view. Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that remarks by Cetin yesterday were more careful and moderate, adding that the government considers them an effort within the more general climate of artificial tension that is being cultivated by Turkey. Venizelos said the Government reacted carefully and calmly, adding that Cetin's remarks were positive. He stressed that Ciller's statement has significance, even if it was made in a private discussion. Greece has to ascertain Turkey's policy. Asked if Ciller's remarks are linked to developments in the Cyprus issue, Venizelos said the Cyprus issue is an international problem, not a Greek-Turkish problem. He added, however, that Greek-Turkish relations depend on the Cyprus issue and whether Turkish Cypriot intransigence will continue. Thirty-five Turkish deputies submitted a question in the Turkish National Assembly asking for an investigation into the activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. At a news conference at the National Assembly, the Turkish deputies referred to a betrayal of the Patriarchate and asked that decisive measures be adopted.
