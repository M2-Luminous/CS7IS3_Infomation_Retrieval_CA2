Police personnel moved to repress the demonstrators but in the end an agreement was reached to negotiate and the blockade was lifted. A group of congressmen arrived at the site and signed an agreement that addressed seven items. As a result of this agreement the blockade was suspended until 21 February when President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will meet with peasant union representatives at Government House. The main items of the agreement are the peasant's request to have Agriculture minister Raul Torres and Agrarian Reform Institute President Cancio Urbieta removed, and the price of cotton increased to 1,500 guaranies per kilogram. The congressmen promised to investigate the monopoly of Cadelpa [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] over the distribution of cotton seeds and agrochemicals, and to study the possibility of controlling the prices of basic staples. As of 0900, some 1,500 peasants from various districts of San Pedro Department gathered at the southern end of the bridge over the Jejui River. The main purpose of the demonstration was to ask that the price of cotton, the cash crop which is being harvested now, be set at 1,500 per kilogram. At first the demonstrators said that they would not leave until they received a concrete answer to their demands. They were unable, however, to continue their demonstration because PEO [Special Operations Police] troops used force to keep the highway open, hurting a few people in the process. At one point San Pedro Governor Erico Ybanez showed up and tried to calm things down. Instead he heard loud criticism for his lack of action to resolve the problems of the peasants. Ybanez had to leave in a hurry harassed by the peasants who kept accusing him of helping them only when he needs political support. A group of congressmen including Senators Elba Recalde, Pura Aguero de Decoud, and Juan Manuel Peralta, and Deputy Jose Vazquez Vazquez later arrived. The legislators came to seek a quick agreement that would reopen Highway No. 3. It was very obvious from the very beginning that the peasants were not well organized, which led to unnecessarily long discussions about what should done. Each peasant representative talked about their concerns and they all complained about the shortcomings of the administration's agricultural policy, the lack of a clear-cut cotton policy, and their ongoing woes caused by the low price of agricultural crops and the high cost of living. After a discussion that lasted more than four hours, legislators and peasants finally reached a temporary agreement by which the road block was lifted. The legislators promised that President Wasmosy will meet with the cotton farmers.
