According to Prof. Petkov, this is the most appropriate time to strike. Only shock forms of action and pressure on the government can awaken Bulgarian politicians from their current slumber, Prof. Petkov said. The KNSB, one of the two major trade union amalgamations in this country, decided to resort to a general strike on April 4, 1994, scheduling it for May 17. It has been provided for staggered strike actions to start already on April 13. The management of about 200 enterprises across the country will receive strike declarations already this week, Prof. Petkov said. In two-thirds of the enterprises there will be joint strike actions with the other major trade union amalgamation in this country -- Podkrepa, the KNSB leader told journalists. Two enterprises are already protesting, he added. Protest actions will first start in the mechanical engineering branch, the military industrial complex, the electronic industry and the food processing industry, the KNSB leader said. KNSB structures cover 55-60 percent of Bulgaria's employed active population, according to Prof. Petkov. A protest rally has been scheduled for April 14 in Sofia. The KNSB member federations will start strike actions on May 14. According to Prof. Petkov, KNSB has received proposals from some political forces for joint strike actions, but he declined to comment or provide further information. The KNSB is planning to accompany the general strike with a civic boycott of prices and tariffs imposed by state-owned monopolist enterprises. KNSB demands an agreement with the government envisaging compensations for the latest drastic drop in incomes. The trade union calls for bringing wages, pensions and social benefits in line with the real cost-of-living rises. KNSB insists on a temporary price freeze for staple goods and services. It urges that a state programme for stabilization of the foreign exchange and financial market be adopted. The union will call off the strike if Prime Minister Berov takes part in the official talks and gives guarantees that the trade union's demands will be met. Prof. Petkov did not specify what kind of guarantees KNSB expected. In his view, the strikers would score a "supersuccess" if parliament passed a decision obliging the government to meet the trade union's demands. KNSB will seek support from the European Trade Union Confederation, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions and national trade unions in Europe. KNSB sets great store by the principled position of the organizations and the possibility to exchange experience rather than by financial support, Prof. Petkov said today. KNSB demands have the backing of leaders of the extraparliamentary Bulgarian Social Democratic Party and the Civil Alliance for the Republic. The Socialist Party's leadership linked its support to the condition that no political demands be made. KNSB and the Socialists will be holding consultations on a weekly basis. The trade union leadership will meet other political forces as well.
