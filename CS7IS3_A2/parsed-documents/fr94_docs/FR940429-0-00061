FR940429-0-00061 FR940429-0-00010 Appendix Analysis of Comments and Changes ( Note: This appendix will not be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations.) An analysis of the comments and the changes to the regulations follows. General comments that refer to broad issues rather than a specific section or sections of the proposed regulations are discussed first, followed by a discussion of other issues in the order in which they appeared in the NPRM. It should be noted that not all comments are discussed in this appendix. There are several reasons for this. First, many of the concerns expressed by commenters were directed to the statute, not the proposed regulations. In some instances, those comments are mentioned in the discussion that follows because of the importance of the issues that were raised. In most instances, however, they are not mentioned because the Secretary is not legally authorized to make the changes suggested by commenters. Second, many commenters made excellent suggestions for editorial and technical changes, as well as other minor changes, that, in the Secretary's opinion, strengthened the regulations; the Secretary has merely incorporated these suggestions without comment. For example, in ยง602.11(b)(1)(ii) the Secretary received a comment that it was better to include third-party information received by the Secretary, in addition to that solicited by the Secretary. Third, some comments appeared to be based on misunderstandings of what was actually in the NPRM. For example, a few commenters expressed concern about the absence of a particular provision that was, in fact, included in the NPRM. Fourth, several comments appeared to be directed toward specific practices of currently recognized accrediting agencies that commenters believed violated either the proposed regulations or what the commenters believed to be established accrediting practices. In general, these comments are not discussed here, but Department staff will investigate these complaints as part of the Department's ongoing monitoring of agencies. General Comments The Secretary received numerous comments about the overall impact of the proposed regulations. In general, commenters opposed to the proposed regulations believed that the NPRM did not achieve the coordinated balance of responsibilities among the triad members that it sought to achieve, and that it provided for extensive and duplicative data collection and reporting requirements that created a costly and unnecessary burden on the entire higher education community. Further, they believed that the regulations did not regulate ``narrowly to the law,'' as they purported to do. In general, these commenters suggested that the Secretary should review each requirement in the proposed regulations to determine if it was required by the statute and should further ensure that all requirements that meet this test and are included in the final regulations are implemented in the most reasonable and cost effective manner. This, they believed, would ensure the Department's compliance with Executive Order 12866.
