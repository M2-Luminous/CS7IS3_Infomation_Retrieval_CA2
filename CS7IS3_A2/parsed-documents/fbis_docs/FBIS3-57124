He said he had accepted Fedorov's resignation and this matter would be decided by President Yeltsin. The prime minister also said that he had conferred with the head of state for 30 minutes Monday morning discussing the budget draft for the first quarter of the year. He explained that he had never had and would not have "any differences with the president and never intended to pass the buck to him." Answering an Interfax question, Chernomyrdin denied press reports that he had invited Professor Leonid Abalkin, an authority in economics, to work as his adviser. He said, however, that he wanted to have a closer look at what each of his advisers was doing. Chernomyrdin promised that the government would pay its debts to farmers but emphasized that this had to be done "in a reasonable way and the cabinet does not intend to grant credits easily." Chernomyrdin said his government would stick to its policy of reform, "but the time has come when, in addition to monetarist ways of solving economic problems, non-monetarist methods should be used, too." There is, for example, one mechanism that has never been used previously -- "agreements between the government, trade unions and producers on the pricing of output and on setting the levels of wages for a certain period," he said. He said the present tough credit and financial policy would be continued. Commenting on the future monetary union between Russia and Belarus, the prime minister said not enough preparation work had yet been done for the relevant documents to be signed. He said he would certainly visit Minsk. "The hullabaloo over relations with Belarus" is "harmful and totally wrong," he said. "They want to pull us further away from each other, but they won't manage to," he said. Chernomyrdin said Russia would remain loyal to the CIS economic union treaty. "Nothing has ever been done or will ever be done at the expense of Russia and the Russians, or at the expense of Belarus, Kazakhstan, or Ukraine," he said.
