The situation in the valley is still bad, and this fire has spread to the Jammu area also. Bombs are being blasted in Doda, Udhampur, Kishtwar, and Jammu city itself, and the sphere of terrorist activities is increasing. Bomb blasts, loss of innocent lives, and looting and burning are very common now. It seems that the government is sleeping. Such incidents have been happening in Jammu region for the last four years. Our government refuses to wake up. We are not talking about limited activities, but of total inactivity! How can there be any good administration possible when the responsibility for administration has been given to criminals who have served jail terms, are untrustworthy, have bad records, and have been expelled from their positions for some crime or other. Such people have been appointed to important positions. These include persons who had opposed India at the United Nations level. How can we expect the situation to improve with such appointments? The situation in the home ministry is such that one minister says one thing and the other something else. Both ministers in the home ministry have adopted different attitudes about Jammu-Kashmir, and the attitude of the Jammu-Kashmir government is yet another factor. Let us take the Hazratbal affair. It is hard to understand why the government wants to provide itself such an elaborate proof. The opinion of the security forces about it is very different. How many murders have been committed in Doda and Kishtwar? How many bombs went off? What kind of situation exists in Jammu? The situation of the Jammu population is very different from that of the valley population. If the situation continues to worsen here, it could get a lot more dangerous than in the valley. I just do not understand some of the developments. My simple and straight question is: How long will we play with words? We want to continue our talks with Pakistan. We have also have presented six points on which the talks would be based. Pakistan has taken the position that it wants to talk to us on its own terms. I wish that the Parliament first explained to the people of our country what right Pakistan has to interfere in a situation that is between us and our people? Whatever is happening between us and our own people is our own affair and I just do not understand the reason for holding mutual talks [with Pakistan] over it. Pakistan's position in Kashmir is only that of an aggressor. The only question we can discuss with Pakistan is: When will it withdraw from the area it has taken over as an invader? I fail to understand why we repeatedly use words which leave out many facts. Why have we accepted Pakistan according to its own perspective instead of from our own perception? Whenever we talk with Pakistan at the international level, we talk under the conditions set by Pakistan, for example, violation of human rights. Why do not we tell Pakistan that it has no right to interfere in our affairs? We have failed to present our case to the world that the talks that are being held with Pakistan are over the part of Kashmir that is occupied by Pakistan. In fact, the talks should be held to discuss the region that Pakistan is occupying illegally. We have not been able to explain at the international forum that we can hold talks with Pakistan only based on the removal of the Pakistani government's and the Pakistani army's occupation of Kashmir. We have not been able to present this case strongly to this date. Pakistan has talked a lot about self-determination, however, it does not understand what this term means. If we talk about self-determination within the framework of all countries in the world, every country has the danger of breaking up. Self-determination can lead only to breaking up a country. Just like any other country, India also has its own borders. Is it possible that people from any part of India should ask for separating from India based on their self-determination right? Obviously, we cannot endanger any nation's unity this way. No part of India can be separated from it, and we must explain this very clearly to the international community. The fact is that the international community does not have the right to interfere in any country's internal affair. Jammu-Kashmir's merger into India is both legal and final. This has been fully supported in the United Nations also. The United Nations also has recognized that Pakistan is illegally occupying a part of Indian territory. However, we have fully failed in raising these basic issues. We must explain to the international community that if any Indian state is toyed with under Pakistan's pressure, the scary catastrophe of the 1947 partition would be reenacted. Unfortunately, the shadows of the 1947 partition are still chasing us. Pakistan by interfering in the Kashmir issue, various parties that are active in Kashmir, and the people who are trying to give a religious color to this affair, have all forgotten that India's Muslims do not live only in Kashmir. 120 million Muslims are spread all over India. As for the human rights issue, the statements issued by Robin Raphel and Clinton are very disappointing. Robin Raphel has put a question mark on Kashmir's merger into India. By saying this, she has implied what the United Nations has said is also wrong. President Clinton and Robin Raphel forgot that the human rights in Kashmir are being violated by the terrorists who are trained in Pakistan and sent to our country for carrying on murder and carnage in our country. I would like to ask a basic question of the Americans. Have they read the history of India? Do they know that the thousands of years old Indian culture is based on human rights? The foundation of our thousands of years old civilization and culture is human rights. Our nation's civilization never practiced piracy. Our nation has never colonized another country. We never even thought about colonizing. Our nation gave birth to Mahatma Buddha, Bhagwan Mahavir, and Mahatma Gandhi. These are the people who are known as ambassadors of peace and non-violence in the whole world. The United States itself fought a bloody battle to keep its unity. What lesson can it give us about human rights today? Other civilizations in the world have taken lessons from us in this subject. It is surprising that whoever talks about human rights in Kashmir only sees the security forces. They never mention human rights violations committed by the terrorists who are playing with the lives of innocent citizens day and night. They do not mention that their extreme actions and atrocities have forced hundreds and thousands of Kashmiris to flee their homes and live in camps outside Delhi. Our government has failed to shed light on this aspect of terrorism in Kashmir. We can easily find an answer to this question if we recognize whether the terrorists or the security forces came to Kashmir first. It is clear that the terrorists came there and spread terrorism and tried to break up our country. That is when the need to send the security forces there was felt. The security forces are protecting lives and property of the citizens in Kashmir. I want to tell the U.S. administration that the UN resolutions about holding a plebiscite that Pakistan talks about day and night also call for Pakistan to vacate the part of Kashmir it is occupying. We have failed to communicate this fact also. Is it not surprising that they are talking about holding a plebiscite by separating it from the whole resolution! We are being very careful. I know the problems the government is facing. It has to go to the World Bank, and borrow money from the IMF. The situation is such that India cannot function without borrowing money, everything will close. We cannot borrow money from these international organizations until the United States supports our request. However, when India's dignity is challenged, when India's self-respect is challenged, then, in my opinion, we should remain hungry and not give the United States the right to trifle with our national pride. The situation is very painful when we give our statements with such hesitancy, fearing that we do not get out of the diplomatic language. We are not willing to pawn our national pride and dignity to even the most powerful nation in the world--the United States or any other nation-- when it comes to Kashmir and India's unity. The Indian people are willing to remain hungry, but are not willing to compromise their self-respect. We have to understand this perfectly. I am now hearing some talk in my own country about starting a political process in Kashmir. I also support the political process. However, I have some questions before we do that. My first point is that political process has been tried in Kashmir for a long time. We had a government elected by democratic process functioning there. This political process has been working for several decades. The governments elected by the people ran the business in Kashmir. How did terrorism arise while these governments were there? Now, if we think that a political process is necessary to end terrorism, I do not want to muddle up this issue by saying that the present situation in Kashmir has resulted mostly from the lack of strong leadership there. The political process could not create a strong and responsible leadership. I wonder if the reason for starting a political process is to make the United States happy?
