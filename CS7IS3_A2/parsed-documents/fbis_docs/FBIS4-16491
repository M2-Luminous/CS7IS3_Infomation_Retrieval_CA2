Dudayev thought that what he described as "certain elite circles in the Russian leadership" might make next May the decisive time for Russia. Dudayev said that the Russian leadership consisted of factions, each playing its own game, and that his government felt this as it tried to have talks on a Russian-Chechen treaty. He added that some Russian politicos went as far as negotiating with the Chechen opposition. "It would be logical if we responded by making contacts with those who oppose the Russian leaders but we do not do so for ethical reasons," Dudayev said. Meanwhile, an informed source in the Chechen leadership told Interfax that Dudayev was under pressure to discontinue the Russo-Chechen talks until an authority emerged in Russia which would have the situation under its full control.
