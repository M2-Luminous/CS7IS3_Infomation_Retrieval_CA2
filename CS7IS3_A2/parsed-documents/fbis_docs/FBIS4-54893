As is known, the state treasury involves 406 billion tolars, and the budget deficit may reach somewhat less than 12 billion tolars. Before the deputies commenced the debate on the proposed amendments to the Law on Implementing the Budget and to the numerous individual items of the budget -- there are more than 170 of those -- deputies heard introductory speeches by Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek, Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari, Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank of Slovenia, and representatives of the Pension Institute and Health Institute. Here is a report by Suzana Kos: [Begin recording] [Kos] After six years of recession, last year our state embarked upon economic growth for the first time. In the first quarter, industrial production was as much as 3.4 percent higher than in the same period last year. This is what Prime Minister Drnovsek pointed out in his introductory speech. Improvement is seen in building, traffic, tourism, and agriculture. The number of unemployed reduced by more than 6 percent until March, while the number of employed has increased. Last year's inflation was the lowest since 1979 and, according to Dr. Drnovsek, it is not going to increase in the future either. After lengthy negotiations, the agreement on the policy of wages in this year and the section on wages of the collective agreements were signed last year, and all partners have agreed to a fixed increase of nominal wages below the rate of inflation. Prime Minister Drnovsek spoke about the outcome of the negotiations, the signed document, and for the first time announced the corresponding legal document. [Drnovsek] With this agreement, the government also received the approval of other negotiating partners, the trade unions, and representatives of employers to establish by law the realization of such an agreement keeping in mind the poor experience with realizing collective agreements last year. In our opinion, a significant (?breakthrough) will be reached in managing this perhaps most necessary sphere of macroeconomic policy. Realistic possibilities have been established for [word indistinct] most unfavorable currents by the end of 1994 and for the establishment of such macroeconomic conditions that would enable further production growth and reduction of unemployment. [Kos] Both the prime minister and Finance Minister Mitja Gaspari pointed out that the budget deficit must not exceed 1 percent of gross domestic product and that the government would insist on that. Gaspari devoted his speech above all to presenting basic aims and important points in the budget documents for this year which will be discussed by the State Council now. [Gaspari] The estimate of the sources of revenue is established on the basis of the current prices, provided the planned price increase that I mentioned regarding the previous (?implementation) is respected, so it is necessary to rearrange the existing funds and not revenue from taxation in the possible budget adjustments, unless the parliament decides for an increase of budget deficit. I hope that it will not endorse such a decision or proposal. [Kos] Dr. France Arhar, governor of the Bank of Slovenia, pointed out that the policy and aims that the central bank will try to reach to a great extent depend on the decisions the deputies will make when deciding about the budget and on the level of the deficit they will endorse. The governor also said that as we have gotten rid of hyperinflation, we shall now work on abolishing the big state treasury [as heard]. [Arhar] And already this month, it plans to appear on the market without this well-known iron formula, but with a new instrument, a new monetary instrument and with a view to starting a new practice and a new philosophy in this sphere. Therefore, it will come up with a cost of money and creating this cost, and with such parameters that are realistically suitable to our competitors, the states with which Slovenia has the highest trade.
