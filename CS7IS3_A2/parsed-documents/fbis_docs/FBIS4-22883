It is based on the principle of paleoclimatic analogues, establishing a correlation between the concentrations of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere and in the ocean surface layer and the Earth's global temperatures. The results of chronostratigraphic and paleobotanical studies are used in reconstructing the landscape-climatic conditions of the Holocene climatic optimum which prevailed in Western Siberia about 5500 years ago because due to the anthropogenic factor it is expected that by 2000 the CO[.sub]2[/] level will be restored to the conditions observed there during that time. The natural climatic changes in Western Siberia, like those for Siberia as a whole, fit in quite well with global environmental changes. The climatic rhythm established for the Holocene, as well as definite refinements obtained using specifically Siberian materials, make possible a quite reliable prediction of the nature and direction of natural climatic processes in the near future. The natural trend, giving evidence of progressive cooling, very probably was disrupted in the 1970's by the anthropogenic factor leading to global warming. The climate is becoming milder, in northern Siberia warmer and moister, whereas in the south, in arid steppe regions, it is becoming moister. The transformation of landscapes, vegetation zonality, permafrost, variations of river runoff and lake levels will occur with a definite lag because the rate of anthropogenically induced climatic conditions exceeds the natural trend by tens or hundreds of times. How soon serious deformations of natural systems will begin will evidently be dependent on the climatic trend in the 21st century. Figures 6; references 47: 42 Russian, 5 Western.
