Addressing a conference in Baku with the government members and heads of the local administration, the president said that the "force and the character of the Armenian military operations indicate that the Armenians get military support from the outside." "Their military operations are being prepared by professional military experts," said Aliyev. He said that the Azeri army rebuffs the aggressor. Azerbaijan has only one way out -- to defend itself and strengthen the country's defense potential. He ordered that military commissariat to recruit additional soldiers within 10 days. Aliyev said that by his decree he dismissed three leaders of local military departments. The president ordered that the defense minister demote these chiefs and send them to fight on the frontline. The president said that from now on the branches of the "power" ministries in the regions should be subordinate to the heads of the local administration. He said this was being done to improve the interaction between the representatives of the administrative-states local bodies.
