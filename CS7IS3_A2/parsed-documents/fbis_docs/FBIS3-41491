Last Friday in Hamburg, the yearly meeting of the Federal Association of German Waste Management [BDE] focused on the concentration in the waste management sector and energy supply firms' commitment to this market. There is more of a market for waste than ever before. Hellmut Trienekens, president of BDE, estimates that by the year 2005 there will be surge in Germany's market from the current approximately DM75 billion to nearly DM200 billion. This includes building rubble, crushed road surface and industrial waste. It is large companies that are increasingly engaged in this lucrative business. In the past, the monopolies commission, the top watchdog over the market economy and competition, repeatedly voiced sharp criticism of the process of concentration in the sector. The monopolies commission's president, Dieter Wolf, did not even refrain from criticism in Hamburg. According to Wolf, it is, above all, the activity of the large energy supply firms in taking over the numerous small and mid-size waste companies that constitutes a threat to competition. In Wolf's words: ``More and more I get the impression that monopoly yields on the protected energy supply markets are henceforth being applied profitably to other markets.'' Hence, at present, of nearly 1,000 waste management firms, only 10 large ones are getting half of the turnover in the waste management sector. Nor did Wolf spare criticism of environmental minister, Klaus Toepfer, who was in attendance and who previously had eloquently supported his recycling model. Wolf lamented: ``As early as the introduction of the packaging ordinance, many of the monopolies commission's misgivings were not taken into consideration.'' Without the restrictions on competition, it is impossible to give practical application to the ordinance. Accordingly, the Dual System Germany [DSD] is a demand monopoly. Wolf was unable to recognize any kind of advantage compared to the government waste management monopoly that prevailed earlier. As a consequence, business is stocking almost exclusively products with the green dot. That is tantamount to a restriction on a company's freedom of organization since no merchant has any other choice should he be unwilling to take back the packaging himself. Wolf described this situation as ``strictly prohibited under monopoly law.'' The monopolies commission president expressed it quite harshly: ``This kind of system passed on in the guise of civil law tends to exploit the citizenry.'' For this reason the Federal Monopolies Office wants by all means to prevent energy supply companies from taking over the DSD. Solving DSD's financial crisis through waste management would entail heavy influence of waste managers. Not only their financial commitment but also the appointment of three DSD board members from waste management causes the monopolies commission to be mistrustful. In any event, the BDE does not want to take over the DSD. At least that is what BDE president, Trienekens remarked. He is willing to give back his board mandate immediately, once the DSD regains its financial standing and waste managers' demands are satisfied. Frank-Rainer Billigmann, in charge at BDE headquarters, argued in a similar vein. Waste management's stabilization of the Dual System has ``helped'' Toepfer's recycling model ``to survive.'' Whereas he gave the environmental minister a hearty welcome, he greeted Dieter Wolf with a frosty: ``We are interested in seeing your report.'' Earlier he indirectly accused the monopolies commission of overstepping its jurisdiction in criticizing the DSD's personnel policy.
