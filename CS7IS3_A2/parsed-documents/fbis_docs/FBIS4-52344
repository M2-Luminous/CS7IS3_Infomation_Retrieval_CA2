The United States has been calling on Japan to participate in the research program of the theater missile defense [TMD] to cope with ballistic missiles developed by North Korea. At the present stage, Japan has yet to decide on whether to participate in the research program, but building an air defense system is expected to be a task in the plan for defense buildup to be implemented after 1996. MEC plans to undertake a wide range of research on radar, antimissile missile, and command communications network. The research team is comprised of about 20 engineers mainly from MEC's Kamakura Plant (in Kamakura City, Kanakawa Prefecture), and they are in charge of missile, communications, and fire control system in their respective divisions. The TMD, which the United States plans to develop, is a system which will make phased interceptions of enemy missiles with various missiles deployed on the ground and at sea after satellites detect their launching. However, Japan adheres to the principle of using space for peaceful purposes, and Japanese experts are divided over the use of satellites to detect their launching. MEC will examine two options -- the new air defense system that uses satellites and the one which does not use satellites. MEC is now working on the development of "a new medium-range SAM," the next-generation surface-to-air missile for the Ground Self-Defense Force. It has manufactured missiles along with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Toshiba Corporation. MEC, which has developed a high-performance aircraft radar, will certainly participate in the TMD development program as a key Japanese partner once Japan decides to participate in it. MEC says, "At the present stage, we are studying various theoretical problems." It plans to vigorously propose to the Defense Agency the building of the new air defense system. The United States is said to have estimated the cost of developing the TMD at approximately $30 billion (approximately 3 trillion yen). It has asked Japan to participate in the development program through: 1) the purchase of U.S.-built air defense system; 2) financial cooperation; or 3) joint development.
