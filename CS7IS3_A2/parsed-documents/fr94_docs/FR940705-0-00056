FR940705-0-00056 FR940705-0-00005 The generic risk disclosure statement would not, however, alter the separate disclosure requirements concerning electronic trading systems or trading linkages between domestic and foreign futures exchanges that may be mandated by U.S. self-regulatory organizations. 19 19 See 58 FR 17495, 17496, n.7 (April 5, 1993) citing, for example, NFA Compliance Rule 2&hyph;28, CME rule 874 and Commodity Exchange Inc. rule 5.14 (addressing risk disclosure requirements applicable to foreign futures and options as a result of trading linkages between domestic and foreign exchanges). See also CME rule 577 and Chicago Board of Trade rule 9A.20 which address the risk disclosure requirements applicable to users of GLOBEX, and New York Mercantile Exchange rule 6.22 which addresses the risk disclosure requirements applicable to the users of the ACCESS electronic trading system. Finally, the Commission notes that if a firm elects to use the generic risk disclosure statement rather than the statement required by rule 190.10(c), and uses a separate subordination agreement required by Financial and Segregation Interpretation No. 12_``Deposit of Customer Funds in Foreign Depositories'' for customers depositing margin in foreign depositories, 20 that statement must be separately acknowledged. 21 A separate signature also would continue to be necessary where subordination or similar consent to contractual modification of certain rights is required for other purposes, such as for participation in cross-margining programs. 22 20 See 53 FR 46911 (November 21, 1988). The Commission stated that the subordination agreement discussed in Financial and Segregation Interpretation No. 12 may be incorporated into the rule 190.10(c) bankruptcy disclosure document or separately executed. Id. at 46913&hyph;46914. 21 Separate acknowledgement of the rule 190.10(c)(2) disclosure statement in this context is a substitute for execution of a separate subordination agreement. 22 Id., citing ``Financial and Segregation Interpretation No. 12.'' Separate Statement In its previous revision of rule 1.55, the Commission included an amendment intended to clarify that the prescribed risk disclosure statement may be provided as a physically separate document or in a booklet containing other commodity interest account materials, as long as the rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement appears as the cover page or the first page, and is the only material on such page, by which it means the page immediately following the cover page. As the generic statement requires approximately two pages of printed text, the statement may appear on more than one page, provided that it is the only text that appears on those pages. Application to Rule 30.3 and 30.10 Orders After the effective date of these rule amendments, all firms operating pursuant to confirmed rule 30.10 relief, 23 and firms complying with the terms of an outstanding order under rule 30.3 may elect to use the generic risk disclosure statement or the risk disclosure statements mandated by rules 1.55 and 33.7 and applicable Commission orders, as appropriate. 24 23 Firms operating pursuant to Commission rule 30.10 relief had been permitted to comply with the risk disclosure requirements set forth in the relevant Commission orders, i.e., they could continue to use the text of rule 30.6 as published prior to the 1993 revisions to Commission rules 1.55 and 30.6 (which incorporated the rule 30.6 disclosures for foreign futures into the rule 1.55 disclosures for domestic futures) ( see 58 FR 17496 (April 5, 1993)). 24 See, e.g., CFTC Advisory No. 90&hyph;1 [1987&hyph;1990 Transfer Binder] Comm. Fut. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶24,597 (disclosure statement relating to the deferred payment of option premiums for options). Timetable for Implementation Under the most recent disclosure revisions, the Commission stated that firms would be permitted to use existing disclosure statements ( i.e. , either separate rule 1.55, 30.6, 33.7 and 190.10(c) documents) up to and including July 1, 1994. 25 25 See 58 FR 17495, 17497 (April 5, 1993). Although the Commission intends for the current rulemaking to take effect upon the publication of this Federal Register release, the Commission is permitting firms for a period not to exceed sixty days after the date herein to continue to use the separate statements contained in rules 1.55 and 30.6. Accordingly, after the date herein, firms may use either the new generic risk disclosure statement or the revised rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement (which incorporates the rule 30.6 disclosure statement) or, for a period not to exceed sixty days after the effective date of this Federal Register release, the separate rule 1.55 and rule 30.6 risk disclosure statements to comply with relevant risk disclosure obligations. 26 26 See no action letter of the CFTC's Division of Trading and Markets dated June 8, 1994 regarding the July 1, 1994 effective date of the revised rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement.
