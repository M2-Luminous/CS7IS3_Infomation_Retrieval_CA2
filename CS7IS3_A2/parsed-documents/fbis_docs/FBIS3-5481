NEC Corp. will build a new line at its plant in Roseville, California, that could produce 64-megabit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips, an NEC spokesman said. NEC also plans to build a manufacturing plant in Kyushu for 64- megabit chips for production starting in August. Hitachi Ltd. is building a plant in Ibaraki Prefecture that will contain facilities for production of 64-megabit chips, a Hitachi spokesman said. Fujitsu Ltd. also has a plan to build a similar-level of facilities for logic chips, a Fujitsu spokesman said. The moves are viewed by analysts as efforts by Japanese chip makers to gain a step on their U.S. and South Korean rivals in the market share contest for 64-megabit chips.
