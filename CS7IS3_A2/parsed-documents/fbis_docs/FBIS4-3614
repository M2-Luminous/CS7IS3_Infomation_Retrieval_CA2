But his motion did not make it onto the agenda of the session. The "abortion" of this proposal for "denouncing Britain" greatly disappointed the forces from various quarters who were eager to seize power. One would seem to be blaming the pro-China people wrongly if one thinks they have misjudged the situation and vied with each other to "step forward." There is one "encouraging" factor in all this, that is, the People's Liberation Army [PLA] has also put forward proposals for "denouncing Britain." Because the proposals were very sensitive, after the high-level CPC personalities did some "persuasive work," they were quietly withdrawn. Commanders of Three Military Regions Submit Proposals for "Denouncing Britain" Signed by 88 People It is learned that the undisclosed proposals were handed in to the general meeting on 12 March, after they had been signed by 88 members of the PLA delegation. The three initiators of the proposal are powerful people. They are: Lieutenant General Li Zhu, commander of Beijing Military Region; Lieutenant General Gu Hui, commander of Nanjing Military Region; and Li Xilin, commander of Guangzhou Military Region. They submitted two proposals, the thrust of which was to condemn Britain for confronting China and causing disturbances in Hong Kong, and they demanded the termination of its colonial rule in Hong Kong. According to some personalities who read the proposals, this was tantamount to the military openly expressing their opinion on the Hong Kong issue. Judged by the wording of the proposals, they are very unhappy with the current policy toward Hong Kong, thinking that it is weak and even smacks of capitulation. The Military Decided for Themselves and Demanded the Remaking of Hong Kong Policy This is a very subtle mentality. One wonders if it is because Deng Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on "reflecting sovereignty through the stationing of armed forces" has imperceptibly upgraded the status of the gun barrel. As things stand now, the military is showing a tendency toward making decisions for themselves on the issue of Hong Kong. The proposals signed by 88 military personalities contain the following five major points: 1. To sternly condemn the British authorities for openly violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and brazenly tearing up the agreements between the governments of the two countries. 2. To lodge a serious protest about the British authorities blatantly putting forward the constitutional reform package that interferes in China's internal affairs and attempts to extend their colonial rule. 3. To issue a stern warning to the British authorities that they should not try to turn Hong Kong, which is China's territory, into a zone of international political dispute and a base for opposing China and the communist party. 4. Asking the government to take firm and resolute measures in the event of changed circumstances, especially when Hong Kong is plunged into a trauma, and recover Hong Kong to end Britain's colonial rule ahead of time. 5. Asking the government to give serious thought to terminating high-level contact and withdrawing the Chinese ambassador to Britain in view of Britain's change of position on China and deliberate deterioration in bilateral relations. A battery of such terms as "solemnly" and "request" sound as if the military is above the CPC Central Committee. A point of breakthrough seems to have been made in "letting the gun command the party." Jiang Zemin Personally Persuades Military Deputies This situation immediately attracted the attention of the CPC high-level leadership. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin took the matter up himself and visited the military deputation two times to persuade them. Jiang Zemin said: The Central Committee is following the principle of striking only after the enemy has struck on the issue of Hong Kong, because the initiative and timetable are both in our hands. As things stand now, we can recover Hong Kong ahead of schedule according to reason. Our stand has not changed, and it will not change. Political cooperation between China and Britain is entirely nonexistent. But we should watch how things develop so that we can better handle the affair with justice on our side, to the benefit of ourselves, and with restraint. The current CPC policy toward Hong Kong seems to be pleasing neither the people at home nor abroad. It cannot explain to its people what is meant by "striking after the enemy has struck," yet it cannot cut off all cooperation with the British Hong Kong Government. This very policy of "being strong in appearance but weak inside" has met with criticism at home and caused "ideological confusion" among the loyal "patriots" in Hong Kong in particular. In order to reassure people, some political figures, such as Qian Qichen, Wang Hanbin, and Lu Ping, had "heart-to-heart" talks with some NPC deputies and vice chairmen of the national committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] from Hong Kong and Macao during the recent NPC and CPPCC sessions. They explained what the central authorities have been doing to fulfill its "obligation" to the people. Qian Qichen Claims China Is Strong Enough To Deal With Britain Qian Qichen said: The Sino-British relations are now at rock bottom and facing noncooperation or even confrontation. This is a natural result of Britain changing its policy toward China and confronting us on the issue of Hong Kong. This situation is not something we wanted to see, because Hong Kong is, after all, China's territory and the 5 million odd Hong Kong compatriots are part of the big family of China. But Britain wants confrontation, wants to extend its colonial rule beyond 1997, and wants to turn Hong Kong from an international financial, industrial, and commercial center into a city of international political dispute. How can we let Britain's plot succeed! We must be responsible to history, to the 1.2 billion Chinese people, and to our 5 million odd compatriots in Hong Kong. Also, we must be responsible to foreign businessmen who have properties and investments in Hong Kong. Therefore, we will not yield even a single inch or compromise even once to colonialism on matters of sovereignty and principle. We have the confidence and strength to deal with and defeat Britain's old political tricks. Deng Xiaoping Recently Instructs: Check the Dynamic From a Point of Stillness, Overcome Disturbance With Substantial Strength Qian Qichen also emphasized: After putting up such confrontations, Britain lost what it had been capitalizing on. Now the initiative is entirely in our hands and so is the timetable. A high degree of consensus among the party, the government, the military, and the people nationwide is the basis on which we make our decisions. Qian Qichen also revealed the central authorities' latest strategy for dealing with Britain, that is, to check the dynamic from a point of stillness and overcome disturbance with substantial strength. It is said that this was proposed by Deng Xiaoping when he recently spoke to the central leading comrades. Lu Ping put forward the policy of "uniting with all those who love China and Hong Kong." He said: "With the exception of the core members of the pro-Britain, anti-China ultra-right organizations that attach themselves to foreign forces, we should unite with all Hong Kong compatriots and expatriates in Hong Kong who are willing to work for the smooth transition of Hong Kong and who are willing to stay in Hong Kong and help build a new Hong Kong under the principle of one country, two systems, the Basic Law, and the leadership of the future Special Administrative Region [SAR] Government. This is our policy." Wang Hanbin on "Preparing for Both Eventualities" Wang Hanbin was more specific when he talked about the current preparatory work. He said: Now Sino-British relations are in an abnormal state. It is impossible for China to take the initiative to try relaxing and mending relations, because the basis for doing so is not there. The Sino-British Joint Declaration has been sabotaged by the British side, so its role has been almost entirely taken away. We no longer have the basis for Sino-British cooperation at this stage and such basis will not be ready for some time. The Chinese side does not place any unrealistic hope in the situation. The current work is mainly to prepare for the following two things: 1. The Preliminary Working Committee's work should be realistic and should be strengthened, increased, and accelerated. The preparations for setting up the SAR should be carried out and arranged earlier than scheduled. 2. The work of the relevant departments in the central government has been more or less assigned and various preparations made. Once Hong Kong is plunged into a political trauma, the society lands in protracted turbulence, and foreign countries meddle in Hong Kong affairs and try to change Hong Kong's status, we will not have a second choice. Wang Hanbin said: The initiative is entirely in our hands. No violation of the integrity of national sovereignty and the sacredness of our internal affairs is allowed, as they override everything else at all times. Ye Xuanping: China and Britain Will Not Have the Conditions and Climate for Cooperation CPPCC Vice Chairman Ye Xuanping disclosed a piece of information to the NPC deputies from Guangdong Province: The central authorities have made it clear that they will do everything to ensure the stability and development of Hong Kong. Naturally, they have various preparatory measures, including full political, economic, and military considerations. They will not let Britain control the destiny of Hong Kong beyond 30 June 1997. You and I can see that day when it comes. If things change, it will not be in three years and a few months. China and Britain will not possibly have the conditions and climate for cooperation. That "restoring cordial relations with the British side is impossible" seems to have become a "common understanding" shared by personalities at all levels in the CPC. But opinions on how to deal with the "British colonialism's plot in Hong Kong" differ. What merits attention is that the CPC's Hong Kong policy has been constantly challenged, which is bound to cause the already "left"- leaning policy to get out of control.
