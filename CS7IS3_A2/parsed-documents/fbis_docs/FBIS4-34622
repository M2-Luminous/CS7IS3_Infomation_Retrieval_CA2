He said the financial assistance granted thus far is equivalent to approximately half of the next national budget. According to Castillo, the financial assistance granted thus far to banks experiencing problems of liquidity had unleashed the inflation process, which is the usual consequence of releasing inorganic funds into a weakened economy such as Venezuela's. Castillo said his party will ask the executive branch to step up the process of reopening the intervened banks so they can pay their depositors.
