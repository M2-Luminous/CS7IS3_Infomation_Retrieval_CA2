An edict to this effect was signed by President Nursultan Nazarbayev who was granted additional powers by the former parliament until the opening of a new parliament. This move was officially explained by the fact that measures are being introduced in the republic to streamline and balance the budgetary system. Asked by ITAR-TASS if this was a deviation from the course of reforms in the economy, authoritative experts from the presidential apparatus said that the existence of the free economic zones had resulted in unbalanced budgets at various levels. [passage omitted] The experts believe that given the grave financial situation in the country, it is more expedient to have just limited and localized free economic zones. The edict did not affect these.
