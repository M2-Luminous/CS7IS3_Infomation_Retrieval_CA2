While Kooijmans met with Prime Minister Li Peng and his counterpart Qian Qichen, the confrontation between Beijing and Washington over human rights escalated. Yesterday student leader Wang Dan was arrested for the second time in a week for further questioning. Kooijmans's U.S. counterpart, Warren Christopher, who is in Australia and will arrive in Beijing on Friday, said that the dozens of arrests last weekend "could have a negative impact" on his visit and on the assessment of Beijing's human rights policies. President Clinton wants to first see a significant improvement in human rights before extending China's most-favored nation trading status another year. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has accused Clinton of "irresponsible interference in China's internal affairs." A few days ago Clinton criticized the arrests in Beijing and Shanghai. Kooijmans received a similar reaction when he questioned Li and Qian about the recent arrests. The Netherlands is avoiding a confrontation to be able to exercise maximum pressure on Beijing, a civil servant in the Netherlands delegation said. Nevertheless, Kooijmans spoke of "difficult discussions." "The Chinese leadership still has very little sympathy for human rights," he said. "They see foreign concern in the context of an ideological controversy and believe that human rights are being used as a political weapon." Kooijmans said that the Netherlands Government's room for maneuver should not be compared with that of the U.S. Government. The U.S. approach "is felt here to be particularly offensive. This emerged clearly from the reactions," he said. "We have our own approach. I find it important each time to inspire confidence by not using human rights as a political weapon. To show that concern about human rights is real and not something which you raise for other motives." The minister said he had "no reason at all" to think that his contribution was leading to any change in China's policies. "But I have been active in human rights long enough to know that you should never expect results overnight, that it is a very gradual process," he said. In addition to the arrests of the dissidents, Kooijmans discussed with Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Premier Li Peng the Tibet question and China's harder approach to religious activities. Kooijmans said that in the last year little progress had been made in China's contacts with the dalai lama, the exiled Tibetan god-king, or with his representatives. As for the religious decrees announced last month, the Chinese Government gave the impression that they were intended to protect the religious freedom of the recognized religious communities or to oppose Islamic fundamentalism, Kooijimans said. Kooijmans said he had the impression that the decrees were also directed against a number of Christian communities. He expressed his displeasure about this and advised the Chinese to contact the World Council of Churches and the Vatican. Kooijmans also gave his Chinese hosts a new list of names of people about whom the Netherlands Government is asking for information. Most of the people mentioned are in prison after being sentenced in court. A number of them are in "administrative detention," which comes down to being held for three to four years without trial.
