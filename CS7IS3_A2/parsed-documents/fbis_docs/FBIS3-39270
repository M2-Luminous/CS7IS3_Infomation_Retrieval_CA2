The AMF will be reintegrated in the GATT in three phases, over a period of 10 years. For the time being, none of the countries have as yet finalized their offers where the opening up of their markets is concerned. Thus the negotiations will continue for several months. The United States has not rejected the rate ceilings (higher than 35 percent) applicable to the products in which the developing countries are competitive. The garment industry, in which the manpower criterion is particularly important, is increasingly threatened. The very intensive manpower factor in the clothing sector in Portugal and Greece is the source of some concern because of the cost difference, which handicaps these countries vis-a-vis the PVD [less-developed countries]. Although French textiles are always manufactured on our own territory, the industrialists have already launched the process of shifting the manufacturing of garments to the Maghreb or the island of Mauritius, for example, GATT or no. But design and final processing will remain in the countries paying high wages, including France. However, "It is estimated that within five years, almost 150,000 jobs in the textile-garment industry may cease to exist," Georges Jolles, the new president of the Union of Textile Industries (UIT) says. The job stakes remain extremely important. This is the case, moreover, with the other labor-intensive industries. The Longuet Report reminds us that in France, the manufacturing of clocks and watches provides 7,000 jobs, the shoe industry 35,000, the paper and cardboard industry 25,000, the tire sector 32,000, and the toy industry 8,000. For the time being, the professionals are complaining of the limited openness agreed to by the American, Indian, and Pakistani governments. According to the Union of Clothing Industries, there is a strong potential market in certain of the developing countries where the emergence of a middle class can be seen. India and Pakistan have thus far refused to participate. But the experts note that trade negotiations are not the only means available for lowering customs barriers. The financial aid provided to the PVD by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank within the framework of the "structural adjustment" policy is often accompanied by "very firm recommendations" that they open up their frontiers. There remains one last positive point. Seven out of every 10 international patent infringements pertaining to textiles involve French products. In other words, the French industrialists will benefit from the agreements reached on patent rights (see tomorrow's LE QUOTIDIEN).
