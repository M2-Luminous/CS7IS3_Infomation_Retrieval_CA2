Finance Minister Abdullahi Hasan Ahmad, in a statement to SUNA, said that the two-day talks discussed steps and proposals to normalize Sudanese relations with the IMF. He said that Sudan made proposals to the delegation which, if accepted, would probably result in the sending of another IMF mission around the end of this month. That delegation would discuss elements of an agreement on which the fund's governing council would base its report, concerning its dealings with Sudan, during its June meeting. The minister described this round of the talks as fruitful, and said that agreement was reached on the delegation's proposals concerning dealings with Sudan, which would be conveyed to the governing council. Sudan's delegation to this round of talks was headed by the finance minister. Today the delegation met Dr. Muhammad Khayr al- Zubayr, the minister of state for planning, and Dr. Sabir Muhammad al-Hasan, the governor of the Bank of Sudan. The IMF had resolved to compel Sudan to a forced withdrawal from the organization last February, on grounds that it had not settled its debt, which amounts to half a billion dollars.
