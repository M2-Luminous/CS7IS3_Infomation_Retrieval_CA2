"Today there are as many Chinese soldiers in Lhasa as there are Tibetans. Tibet, its people, and its unique culture are in grave jeopardy," said Lodi Gyari, president of the International Campaign for Tibet (ICT). There has been no progress on human rights in Tibet in the past year, Gyari said. The ICI showed photographs smuggled out of Tibet showing a massive build-up of military facilities, six prisons, and huge areas of new housing. The group also displayed an official city planning map for Lhasa in the year 2000 which showed the traditional Tibetan areas of the city reduced to virtually nothing -- just the Jokhang and Potala palaces, described as cultural and tourist sites. Roads to monasteries in and around Lhasa are frequently the sites of military checkpoints, effectively restricting monks' movements, and military installations virtually surround many monasteries, the ICT said. "ICT and others have documented repeated and widespread use of arbitrary detention, torture and repression of religious and other civil freedoms throughout occupied Tibet," the ICT said. ICT hoped to alert Americans as the country weighed renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status. President Bill Clinton said last year that he would not extend China's MFN beyond June 1994 unless Beijing could demonstrate significant progress on human rights. One specific request was that China begin dialogue with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama. Gyari endorsed Clinton's call for China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama, but said there must be a clear commitment from the Chinese government to the time, place and a substantive agenda for such negotiations to be useful. "In the case of Tibet, China has made no signs of taking steps to protect Tibet's unique cultural and religious heritage, as stipulated in the president's MFN executive order," the ICT said. Human rights analysts believe the number of political prisoners held in Lhasa's six prison camps has risen by 30 percent in the past year, the ICT said. China has countered that Tibet remained at the centre of anti-socialist activity from "internal and external hostile forces".
