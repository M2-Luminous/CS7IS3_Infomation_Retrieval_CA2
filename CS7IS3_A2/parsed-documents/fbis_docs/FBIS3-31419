Yesterday, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] had the opportunity of experiencing such a pleasure. Macedonia kept its cool while the most irreconcilable opponents against its international recognition, namely the Socialists, won the elections in Greece. The Macedonians still remained calm when the Greeks withdrew from the UN negotiations about Macedonia because of the country's new name and flag. When political circles in Athens threatened to close their country's borders with Macedonia, the ruling forces in Skopje briefly commented that this could not be serious. When the EU member-countries, one after the other, established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, the Greek Minister of European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos started behaving like a drunken third class actor, getting on the Western powers' nerves. On that occasion Macedonia experienced a certain satisfaction which was hardly noticeable, nevertheless. The confession of certain Greek diplomats who admitted that the dispute with Skopje is a lost cause for Greece was also accepted without any comment on the part of Macedonia. The official recognition of Macedonia's sovereignty by the White House was the latest confirmation of the fact that Macedonian politicians are betting on the right card. Since the very first day of its separation from former Yugoslavia Macedonia has been conducting a consistent policy aimed at winning the good will of the United States. This applies to all Macedonian political actions starting from a courageous minority policy, such as none of the Balkan countries dares to promote (as a matter of fact, the results followed in due time, and the police just managed to prevent an Albanian separatist conspiracy) to the Macedonian government's persistent and heroic struggle which was finally crowned by the stationing of a U.S. "blue helmets" contingent in the republic. According to some political observers, certain actions of other Balkan countries, such as Bulgaria's refusal to allow U.S. nuclear arms to be deployed on its territory, and last but not least, the stubborn behavior of Greece, are positively contributing to Macedonia's good relations with the West. Until yesterday Washington was the last hope for Athens. Since yesterday the U.S. is the strongest shield for the protection of Macedonia's independence. There is even more -- by the act of establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia the White House assumed the role of chief actor -- temporarily in charge of the Macedonian drama and reversed the positions. Athens, which relied on its international contacts, on its traditional presence in West European affairs, and on its membership in the European international organizations, suddenly appears to be in a situation very similar to that described as international isolation. Macedonia, whose government, until recently, used to complain about the Western countries' lack of interest and about the inconsistency of their behavior toward Macedonia, finally awaited the moment of sticking its tongue without any risk. As a matter of fact Macedonia did so yesterday by proposing to resume negotiations with Athens, with a somewhat offensive magnanimity.
