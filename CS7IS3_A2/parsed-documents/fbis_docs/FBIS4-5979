FBIS4-5979 "dreas074_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Thailand Ambassador Clarifies Press Editorial on Burma Ambassador Clarifies Press Editorial on Burma BK1704114994 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST in English 17 Apr 94 p 23 BK1704114994 Bangkok THE SUNDAY POST English BFN [Letter from Thai Ambassador to Burma Wirasak Futrakun to the SUNDAY POST] [Text] Sir: Allow me to offer my view on some points which were made in the editorial that appeared in your distinguished newspaper (THE SUNDAY POST) on 10th April 1994, entitled, "It's time-wasting telling Burma what press freedom is about." 1. I have never heard of the incident that was mentioned in the editorial involving the Thai Ambassador and the Burmese Foreign Ministry in the aftermath of the 1988 uprising in Burma. I doubted whether the Burmese Minister reportedly slammed one of Thailand's English language dailies on the table before the Thai envoy could take a seat. For during my tenure in Myanmar [Burma] up until now, I have never encountered a display of bad temper by any of the ministers to me. The people of Myanmar on the whole are devout Buddhists like the Thai people. Therefore, such display of angry emotions is considered inappropriate. Even during the heights of some crises, such as the Hill-491 incident, the Myanmar authorities were never rude to the Thai ambassador. Whenever a protest had to be made to the Thai side, the tone of the message of the Myanmar side was always more in sorrow that such things should not have happened between friends rather than in anger. 2. The invitation to H.E. Brig Gen Myo Thant, Minister for Information of Myanmar, to visit Thailand is not aimed at "erasing Rangoon's doubts that the (Thai) government supports press criticism of the State Law and Order Restoration Council," but is part of the high-level exchanges between Thailand and Myanmar for the purpose of promoting friendly ties between two neighbouring countries. We need to have a long-term perspective about Myanmar as our largest immediate neighbouring country which we must maintain and promote cordial relations if we desire peace and prosperity for our people living in ten provinces along our Western border. 3. Our good-neighbour policy towards Myanmar is not based on a desire for economic gains as crassly alleged by some so-called Western experts on Myanmar. If you look at the actual foreign investment figures of the Foreign Investment Commission of Myanmar, Thailand places fourth (US $70.17 million) behind South Korea (US $96.38 million), the United States (US $200.25 million), and Singapore (US $240.63 million). There is no more logging or fishery concessions for Thai companies in Myanmar. We pursue the present policy towards Myanmar simply because we want to have Myanmar as a good neighbour. I often told my Western colleagues that where you stand depends on where you sit. I also asked them why did the British Government pursue constructive engagement policy towards South Africa while other western countries sought to isolate and sanction it. In our case, a peaceful and prosperous Myanmar is in Thailand's national interests. 4. Regarding your objection to the names "Myanmar" and "Yangon," these are ancient and indigenous names used in our neighboring country. Myanmar has been trying to shed her colonial legacy associated with the names or the pronunciation given by her former colonial power. Does the BANGKOK POST wish to continue to constantly remind our neighbouring country of her colonial past, thereby repeatly pouring salt into old wounds? Wirasak Futrakun, ambassador of Thailand, Union of Myanmar.
