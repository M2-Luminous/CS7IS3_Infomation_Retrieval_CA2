Congratulations on your victory. [Calderon] Thank you very much. Thank you also for Radio Caracol's coverage of these elections and for being present in our country, your efforts to unite the America's, and our brother nations of Colombia and El Salvador. I would like to say that I have become and will continue to be a servant of the Salvadoran people. In addition, I am at the disposal of the Colombian people. [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, are you now extending an olive branch to those who not so long ago were your political rivals? [Calderon] Yes, I am extending my hand to all the Salvadoran people. I am no longer the presidential candidate but the president of all Salvadorans; those who voted and those who did not vote for me. I have become the president and head of state of El Salvador who is going to work for all Salvadorans, regardless of their political affiliation or ideology. I plan to work for all Salvadorans. In this respect, I also extend my hand and call on all the political sectors that in spite of their positions of genuine and conscientious opposition, to grant me the opportunity to govern El Salvador. [Rodriguez] Dr. Calderon, since we Colombians are not fortunate enough to know you that well, and we expect to see you shortly in Colombia, briefly tell us something about Armando Calderon Sol. [Calderon] Armando Calderon Sol is a fighter. A fighter for peace, progress, and liberty in El Salvador. Armando Calderon Sol is a relatively young politician who entered the political scene at an early age as a result of the chaos and anarchy that prevailed in El Salvador. I have been the mayor of San Salvador for two consecutive terms. I was deputy to the National Assembly. I have been a fighter for the defense of liberty in our country. I am a conservative, and I believe that populism and demagoguery have done too much harm to our country as well as to Latin America. Those past populist and demagogue leaders who interfered on so many occasions and believed in socialist solutions only encouraged corruption and discredit to the countries. I believe there is a new ideological rebirth taking place. It is a rebirth of conservative ideas, and it is a rebirth for everyone where liberty prevails. Pragmatism and ideologies have been discarded. [Rodriguez] There is no doubt Dr. Armando Calderon, that that is how it is. Now we will speak to Armando Calderon Sol, the statesman. What will your first government task be? What does El Salvador most urgently need? [Calderon] I believe my first task should be to consolidate the state of law, peace, and social harmony. We must ensure social peace. We have been able to silence the weapons; we have accomplished peace in the country, now we need a genuine social peace. To ensure this, we have to assert the state of law in this country and we have to consolidate it. Actions should be directed to this purpose. We must validate our goodwill. We must also improve police performance, and create the conditions of citizens safety all Salvadorans are demanding. We must provide all Salvadorans safety for their lives and property. It is unacceptable for us to come out of political violence and then fall prey to common violence. [Rodriguez] What is pending in the peace process that your government must meet so the process can have credibility in the eyes of your nation and the international community. [Calderon Sol] I believe, on our part, there is a great deal of willingness to fulfill the peace agreements. I believe these agreements are [word indistinct]; they are agreements belonging to the whole nation and they must be faithfully kept. The only issue left unresolved is the total and absolute dissolution of the National Police and for the National Civilian Police to be deployed throughout the territory. This is our recently organized constitutional institution that will give security to the citizens nationwide. We, in our future government, have made a commitment to totally support the National Civilian Police, support its new Police Academy, and as soon as possible dissolve the National Police and have the National Civilian Police operating at full strength. The other pending issues are some recommendations by the Truth Commission, such as the improvement in Salvadoran justice and the improvement in the administration of justice. We all agree on this, there is national consensus that for Salvador's social peace, for the consolidation of the process, it needs speedy and efficient justice; Salvadoran justice must be improved. In terms of this we have the political willingness to implement constitutional reforms that will bring better and more efficient justice to the Salvadoran people. [Rodriguez] What type of economic, political, diplomatic, and integration relations are you going to maintain with nations such as the Andean Group? [Calderon Sol] We want to have very close trade relations with Colombia and the Andean Group. What is more, we would like a true integration of America as a whole. We have this very clear idea in our mind, this very clear idea that you have upheld; that is the Bolivarian idea. We believe that NAFTA has to spread to all the Americas, and we should struggle for a true economic integration to enter the world's largest world market which is and will be the United States with Canada and Mexico. All the Americas should form a true integration. In this way, all the nations of the Americas, this immortal America, will have true integration, the overcoming of difficulties, and sustained development. [Rodriguez] The opposition points to you as a right-wing man linked to processes already overcome in El Salvador. What can be done for El Salvador to recover that lost unity so that yesterday's opposition can work, if not in the government, at least to the benefit of El Salvador as a whole. [Calderon Sol] I believe we have made a great deal of progress. Peace is gaining more ground each day. It is being consolidated; it is being strengthened. Currently, with the political participation in this 20 March historical event, the radical left wing, the left wing that destroyed infrastructure, that caused destruction during the war, finally participated in this political event. It has been able to open the road for its political participation. They won 21 deputy seats in a parliament of 84 deputies. Former commanders, the majority, former commanders of the Salvadoran guerrillas are in our Legislative Assembly.
