I think, and this is my personal opinion, that the new year will not fail to be tense, dangerous at times, and full of difficulties. However, we observe its arrival, having gained something like a special-period culture. We sense or know what are the traumatic aspects of the complex picture ahead and, above all, see our goal more clearly. However, we still have to more clearly define the paths to reach that goal. The deadlines set by the power centers of the empire for the collapse of the Cuban project have passed. Here we are. The country has not become an anarchy, nor have centrifugal forces prevailed. What prevailed is political tradition in the face of so many highly diverse factors of disintegration; those having to do with our economic ties abroad are already known, and those generated by the domestic economic crisis we had to face. However, here we are. One of the challenges that I see in the new year is that of participation, either that of labor groups in the management of enterprises or that of citizens in general in the People's Government bodies. Anyway, what is taking place in Cuba is a participatory democracy. I believe that previously, the participation of diverse sectors of the population in the decision-making process was somewhat detached due to the state's basically paternalistic, vertical relationship, which limited the participation of the people in the process of defining and solving problems. What is being advocated now is basically a different participation. The Cuban people need a readjustment of the so-called pattern of accumulation, based on higher levels of efficiency and the intensive use of our human and material resources. In order to achieve this qualitative leap, the Cuban people must increase their participation in a more conflicting stage, and free of the state's paternalism. The state itself is relinquishing its role as regulator in certain economic fields and at the same time, the people's autonomy is increasing while becoming more complex as the result of new ideas and performers in the life of the country. This process, which is already taking place and will continue to develop in the future, is supported by a certain experience and knowledge. Nothing will startle us. We will be here.
