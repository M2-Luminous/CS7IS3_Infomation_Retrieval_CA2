Interest rates took a jump in absolute and relative terms, and international and Brazilian institutions had enormous losses. After the initial panic, the market has stabilized in the past few days, but the loss was inevitable. It now remains to be seen whether it was only a regular adjustment of a market that has experienced an extraordinary rise for more than one year, or whether some basic conditions underwent lasting changes. The manager of one of New York's most important international investment funds told GAZETA MERCANTIL that the market will recover "slowly and partially." He expects a "substantial drop" in Eurobonds and other securities offered by developing countries, including Brazil, for this year. He believes costs will rise and the financial flow reduction might affect stock market investment. [passage omitted] Profits on debt certificates (the "Brady's") and Eurobonds from developing countries already have jumped significantly. The crisis was triggered by the increase in U.S. interest rates. Treasury 30-year securities, the market's most sensitive indicator, which were paying 6.3 percent at the end of January, jumped to 6.9 percent (on 9 March they were paying 6.85 percent). Since T-bonds are the gauge, the basis of comparison for the market, it was only natural that the yield on all securities should have edged up. What happened, however, is that the increase was much higher than proportionate. Or in other words, the "spread" [preceding word in English] on securities from Latin American countries vis-a-vis T-bonds shifted gears. This is obvious comparing quotations published by the U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns on 21 January, before the crisis, with the current ones. In Brazil's case, the spread of bonds on interest in arrears (IDU [expansion unknown]) increased from 477 points to 600, the "exit bonds" [preceding two words in English] from 383 to 488, and the "new money bonds" [preceding three words in English] from 434 to 565. For Argentina the damages was even greater because the FRN's [expansion unknown] spread jumped from 302 to 478. Even the spread on Mexican "discount bonds" went from 160 to 232 points. This increase also affected the quotation of Latin American Eurobonds in the secondary market. The "spread" on several Brazilian papers increased from 10 to 30 points. Bonds with longer maturity dates, in general, suffered even more. The spread on the bonds issued by the Argentine Republic worth $1 billion, whose maturity day is now a little less than 10 years away, increased from 238 to 307 points. In Brazil's case, a sector of the market believes the announcement of an agreement with the IMF might push prices up. The fact, however, is that during the past the arrival of some good news such as the approval of the Social Emergency Fund and the URV [Real Value Unit] helped cushion the increase compared to other countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, but did not avoid it. Combined rates on "Brady"-type papers show an average drop from 20 percent (Bloomberg) to 15 percent (West Merchant Bank) due to the crisis. This is not the first crisis that has shaken the emerging markets. During the last quarter of 1992, Brady papers lost approximately 10 percent of their value due to the combination of the Brazilian political and economic crisis and the excess offer of Mexican papers. What is more worrisome today is the nature of the crisis. International investors' renewed interest in the emerging Latin American markets was prompted by the combination of various factors, among which is the recovery of their economies. Anyhow, everybody agrees that a crucial factor was the major drop in U.S. interest rates, thus making them unattractive. Investing institutions such as the pension funds that must pay their clients a minimum 7 percent interest a year were forced to seek more risky alternatives that are, consequently, more profitable. What made the bonds market drop (increasing the profitability of their papers) was not only the increase in U.S. short-term interest rates. The drop was caused by the signs that the very long cycle of low and dropping rates probably has ended. U.S. rates have increased because the rhythm of activities has been much greater than expected and this starts to push inflation up. As a banker stated: "Nobody says whether U.S. interest rates are going to increase; people only talk about how much and when they will increase." [passage omitted]
