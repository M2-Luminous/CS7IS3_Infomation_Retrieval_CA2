FBIS4-58989 "drnes090_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-090 Daily Report 9 May 1994 SYRIA Christopher's Success Depends on `Facts and Deeds' Christopher's Success Depends on `Facts and Deeds' JN0905143994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1230 GMT 9 May 94 JN0905143994 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: The U.S. Administration is expected to resume its efforts in the Middle East early next week with a new tour by its chief diplomat, Warren Christopher, in order to clear the way for the resumption of the Washington bilateral negotiations. It is natural that the resumption of the negotiations should be linked with the degree of seriousness in Israel's answers to the basic questions Secretary of State Christopher carried from Damascus after he held detailed talks with President Hafiz al-Asad. It is also natural that progress or stalemate in the peace process should be linked to real change in Israel's position. No one would disagree that the establishment of peace needs action rather than sweet talk on the importance of and the need for achieving that peace. The U.S. Administration has sensed Syria's true intentions, and President Bill Clinton has not concealed this. Moreover, he has reiterated on many occasions his belief in Syria's credible position and its serious trend toward peace. Christopher did the same during his tour of the region last week. Syria's concern for pushing the peace process forward, however, does not at all mean any relinquishment of its constants or any bargaining over territory, rights, and sovereignty. These are matters that Syria will never reconsider under any circumstances. President Bill Clinton's administration, as well as Israel, knows this fact. Total withdrawal from Golan is the basis for negotiations on the Syrian track. This occupied Syrian territory should return completely to the motherland, as it used to be before the June aggression of 1967. Syria's right to sovereignty over its territory is a fact that cannot, and will not be bypassed. What applies to Golan also applies to the occupied part of southern Lebanon and to Jordanian territories occupied by Israel. Hence, the importance of continued coordination among the Arab parties involved in the peace process. This coordination will be a guarantee for the Arabs and will constitute a weapon that will enable them to regain their usurped rights and their occupied territories and to avoid the Israeli trap of unilateral deals and partial settlements. Experience has shown that such settlements will not achieve peace, but will undermine the chances of achieving a comprehensive and just peace. The best example is the disappointment of the Palestinians in the occupied Arab territories following the signing of the fragile self-rule accord, which will keep the Palestinian people subject to Israel's mercy and domination. Syria is working to establish a comprehensive peace and durable peace that will not create disappointments. Such a peace cannot be achieved without the implementation of the relevant UN resolutions and the land-for-peace principle, which former President George Bush's administration proposed, and on which the Madrid conference was launched under the U.S. and Russian sponsorship, and to which current President Clinton's administration committed itself after pledging to play a fair and complete partner in the peace process. Those who seek such a peace will find every cooperation from Syria. But if talk about peace is merely an Israeli maneuver, no new tour by Washington will achieve anything to save the peace process from the crisis in which the Israeli rulers have placed it. Syria has repeatedly asserted that peace falls within the strategy it has adopted for many years. But the other side, Israel, has been talking about peace at a time when it places obstacles, mines, and thorns on the road. Today, we say that the opportunity to achieve peace is available if intentions are sincere and if statements turn into action on the ground. Otherwise, the establishment of a just and comprehensive peace will remain out of reach. This fact will be sensed by the head of U.S. diplomacy, Warren Christopher, when he returns to the Middle East. He should deal with facts and deeds to succeed in his new mission and so that the peace process can witness a real move toward its desired goal.
