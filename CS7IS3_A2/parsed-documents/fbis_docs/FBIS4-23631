A group of about 100 anti-riot policemen, armed with guns and tear gas cannisters, sealed off Abiola's residence Saturday, placed him under house arrest and stationed a police armoured vehicle in front of the entrance. On Sunday, they lifted the siege, hours after he left the house for a venue in central Lagos where he made his declarations before disappearing into hiding. Abiola, a millionaire Yoruba politician, is the presumed winner of Nigerian presidential elections in June last year. The military regime of then president Ibrahim Babangida cancelled publication of the election results and installed a hand-picked civilian government. [passage omitted]
