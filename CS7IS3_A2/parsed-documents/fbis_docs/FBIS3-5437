On behalf of the national resistance forces of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] and the Cambodian nation and people in the countryside, in the cities, and in Phnom Penh and abroad who have taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese enemy aggressors for the defense of Cambodia's land and race since 1979, I would like to submit to all of you, excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen -- who are representatives of countries and governments that cherish peace and justice in the world and have all along provided firm support to the just cause of the Cambodian nation and people -- this open letter for your consideration. I. In the past, the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] always welcomed and supported all initiatives and international conferences aimed at mobilizing relief assistance to alleviating the misery and suffering of the Cambodian nation and people, victims of the Vietnamese war of aggression. The PDK always urged that humanitarian aid provided by the international community reach the needy Cambodian people. The PDK's position on this matter, either before or after the signing of the Paris agreement, is already known to national and international public opinion. II. At the same time, the PDK has also done its utmost to oppose any activities which, under the cover of assistance of any kind, are aimed at consolidating and developing the Vietnamese-installed regime, continuing the war in Cambodia, and allowing communist Vietnam to swallow up the Cambodian nation and race through military aggression, demographic invasion, and through the power structure it has set up in Cambodia since 1979. III. Your excellencies, ladies, and gentlemen, you are not unaware that ever since its formation, this government with two prime ministers has been used by the Vietnamese communists and the alliance as an instrument to launch small- and large-scale military operations aimed at destroying the Cambodian national resistance forces and the people in the DK's liberated zone so that they will be able to vie for their own interests in Cambodia. At first, they launched the military operations against the region of Phnom Chhat in Thmar Puok District of Battambang Province and against Stoung in Kompong Thom Province. Then, starting from September 1993, they have mobilized a large number of troops with many top-ranking commanders and a huge amount of weapons, ammunition, and other war materiel to destroy the national resistance forces in the region of Anlung Veng in Oddar Meanchey Province. The objective of their large-scale military operations is to eliminate the DK forces, which support His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's five-point idea for Cambodia to achieve genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and peace. It can be said that the military operations launched by this government with two prime ministers are against national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. On the surface, it is fighting between the two-headed government's forces and the DK forces. However, the formation of the government with two prime ministers and the current Khmer Royal Armed Forces and the strategic policy of the countries which they serve are known to all. Their true nature is that of all-round power structures set up by the Vietnamese aggressors since 1979, with the only difference being that the personalities of some political parties have been put in here and there in order to mislead national and international public opinion. Diplomatic sources in Phnom Penh have also clearly indicated that there have been a large number of Vietnamese forces in Cambodia. They are to be found in various ministries, in the puppet army, and even taking part in the fight against the national resistance forces on various fronts, particularly on the Anlung Veng battlefield. Since August 1993, even though the Cambodian nation, people, and national resistance forces have insisted on talks among all Cambodian leaders with a view to achieving national reconciliation and unity so as to restore peace in Cambodia, and even though the king himself made a five-point proposal on 24 November 1993, the Vietnamese communists' puppets, such as Hun Sen, Tie Banh, and others, have only cried out: Fight, fight, fight! In his proposed annual plan, Hun Sen has called for the military strength to be expanded by forcibly enlisting students, workers, and farmers in villages and communes so as to continue the vietnamese war of aggression. In its various trips abroad, the government with two prime ministers has tried hard to buy arms and ammunition and to request assistance regarding military equipment. It has gone so far as to rubber-stamp communist Vietnam's sending of its troops and war materiel into Cambodia under the cover of the so-called cooperation on military issues between Cambodia and Vietnam worked out during Chea Sim's trip to Hanoi at the beginning of this month. Besides, communist Vietnam continues to send its nationals to Cambodia under the framework of its strategy to swallow up Cambodia through demographic invasion. The number of those Vietnamese in Cambodia has increased to nearly four million. This is indeed a very big threat to the survival of the Cambodian nation and people. IV. In brief, we can see that Vietnam's war of aggression continues unabated either through military war or demographic invasion or through the power structures it has set up since 1979. In such a situation, will the assistance of all kinds provided by the international community to the government with two prime ministers be able to rebuild the country? Or will it be helpful to the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the alliance in continuing to kindle the flames of war that will bring about ruin and destruction for Cambodia and its people and death to the Cambodian nation and race? During the past 14 to 15 years, especially after the signing of the Paris agreement, have the Vietnamese communist puppets built anything in the interests of the Cambodian nation and people with the huge amount of assistance -- worth millions of dollars -- given to Cambodia by the international community? Rather, have they not used all that money to expand their war machinery and their instruments for repressing the Cambodian people? Every dollar given by you to the victimized Cambodian people as humanitarian aid has been diverted by the Vitnamese puppets to buy ammunition and poisonous products to kill the Cambodian nation and people. Past experiences show that the assistance generously provided by the international community to Cambodia will certainly be transformed into weapons used by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance to carry on the war to kill the Cambodian nation and race -- which is what they have been doing ever since the formation of this government with two prime ministers. The flames of the war will flare up with no end in sight. In such a situation, will the assistance to be provided by the international community for the construction of Cambodia not be in contrast to your purpose? If so, how will this affect your consciences as the representatives of the peace- and justice-loving countries and governments who want to help relieve the Cambodian nation and people from misery and suffering? If the Vietnamese war of aggression continues in Cambodia, will it be beneficial to Cambodia as well as to the strategic, political, and economic interests of the countries in this region or not? Will communist Vietnam, which annexed Laos and Cambodia, not be a threat to regional security? On the contrary, if the assistance is used to compel the government with two prime ministers to accept and implement the five-point guideline of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk so that Cambodia achieves genuine national reconciliation, national unity and peace, will this not be a benefit to Cambodia and the region as well? Once Cambodia has national reconciliation and peace and investment from countries near and far, will this not help to ensure the security, stability, and prosperity of the Southeast Asian region? V. On behalf of the PDK and the Cambodian people who have taken part in the struggle against the Vietnamese aggressors for the defense of their nation and race as well as for peace and security in this region, I would like to make a sincere appeal to you, the representatives of peace- and justice-loving countries and governments and of the international organizations, to consider whether to provide the assistance in a way that will help the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and the alliance continue their war to kill the Cambodian nation and people and menace regional peace and security, or instead to use this assistance to compel the government with two prime ministers to accept and implement the five-point guideline of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk that will pave the way for the achievement of genuine national reconciliation, national unity, and peace in Cambodia, thus strengthening peace and security in the region -- a way which is the best for peace in Cambodia and in the region.
