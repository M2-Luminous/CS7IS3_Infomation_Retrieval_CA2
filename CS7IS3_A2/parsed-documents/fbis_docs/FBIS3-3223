The number of petitions, demonstrations, rallies, strikes in factories and markets, and boycotts of school classes rose sharply. The report said most of the cases were because of delays in payment of wages for workers and teachers, price rises, resettlement caused by urban re-development, hefty levies on peasants and the reclamation of farmland. Some erupted as a result of racial and religious problems, it said. "As the disputes directly hinged upon the interests of a group of people, some incidents were of a larger scale and lasted for a long period of time. They involved more people. Over the past year, these incidents have increased. (We) should have a high degree of vigilance over the problem," the report said. The increase in mass unrest was only part of a nationwide picture of worsening law and order in the past year, marked by a dramatic increase in major crimes, gang activities, social evils, fraud, violence and industrial accidents. "The overall law and order situation remains grim. The number of problems has been relatively large," the report said. The ministry reported that major crime cases handled by police officers at all levels had risen by 18 percent annually in the past few years. Theft and robbery cases took up 80 percent of cases it said. Highway robbery had sharply increased last year. Crimes on roads and highways remained out of control in some places. Gangsters, some armed with guns and knives, had seriously endangered social order in some villages and township areas, the report said. The ministry highlighted coastal cities when discussing the rampant growth of social evils such as the sex trade. Such activities have also spread into villages. The total number of fraud cases involving more than 100.000 yuan (about HK$88,800) soared by 53.2 percent in the previous year, it said. There were more than 10 "hundreds of million of yuan" cases, including the US$10 billion case (HK$77 billion) in a Hebei branch of the Bank of Agriculture, which involved malpractices in the issuing of letters of credit. The report accused domestic and international criminal elements of collaborating to take advantage of loopholes in the financial system, under the guise of fund-raising. Some criminals had given bribes to banking officials to siphon massive amounts of foreign exchange out of the country, it said. The report pointed out the number of assaults on public security officers had also gone up. The number of injuries rose from about 600 in 1985 to more than 8,000 last year and 275 were killed. The ministry admitted a small number of public security officers were involved in corruption. "Although the number is small, the impact is really bad. The reputation of the whole police force has been tarnished and the relationship between them and the masses has been damaged." Following the anti-corruption campaign launched last August, it said the ministry had handled 1,677 cases of violations of laws and regulation by 2,002 public security officers. The report said it was hoped a new People's Police Law would be forwarded to the Standing Committee for discussion soon. The ministry urged police forces to prepare for unrest and to closely monitor the situation.
