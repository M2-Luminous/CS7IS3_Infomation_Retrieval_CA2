The source said that Saddam's bloody regime promised its agents a reward of $10,000 for killing a foreigner in north Iraq and that Schmidt is a victim of this criminal campaign. The spokesman affirmed that Saddam makes light of the UN resolutions, particularly Security Council Resolution 687, which stipulates that halting terrorism is one of the conditions for lifting the international sanctions imposed on Iraq because of Saddam's indiscriminate policy. These sources added that unknown gunmen killed Schmidt and her Kurdish companion, 'Aziz Qadir, at noon the day before yesterday when they were travelling to a village in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate to report on the arrival of humanitarian aid to the region.
