Some people believe that nominating the new commander is an attempt to remove troops from under the Interior Ministry's strict control. The Council of Ministers is allegedly pursuing the goal of providing governmental structures' security in case Belarus encounters events similar to those that occurred in Moscow in October 1993. This is why they appointed "their man" to this post, someone who is devoted and reliable. [Platonov] These are fabrications. Nothing has changed since my nomination. The functions of the Interior Troops are the same. Article 1 of the Law on the Interior Troops determines the status of these troops as a state-controlled armed formation responsible for protecting lives, health, rights, freedoms, and personal interests of citizens, society, and the state, its constitutional structure, as well as the sovereignty and security of Belarus. Article 5 adds that the interior minister exercises general control over the Interior Troops, while direct control is exercised by the deputy minister, who is in fact the troops' commander. Why did they appoint me? I think because 50 percent of my functions as deputy minister coincided with functions performed by the Interior Troops command. Combining the two posts seems like a sound idea to me, preventing the forming of a large bureaucratic machine. I am an appointed functionary, just like other interior officers. [Gukovskiy] You said that nothing had changed since your appointment. What would you like to change? [Platonov] I have had too little time for these kinds of conclusions, while there are a lot of urgent problems. These include supplies of equipment and materials. Look how poorly armed our interior troops are.... We will probably turn to the government for help. The combat readiness of our troops must be increased. [Gukovskiy] On the first day of the [13th] Supreme Soviet session, Independence Square in Minsk was packed with special equipment and people in militia uniforms, reportedly belonging to a Belarusian regiment. What kind of unit is that? Did deputies need such a powerful shield? In my opinion, this gave the opposition an excuse to accuse the government of using force to step up tension. According to the Popular Front, this almost amounted to orchestrating an unconstitutional coup. [Platonov] The Prosecutor's Office investigated this affair following a motion from the Popular Front. The mass media depicted me almost as a dictator who came to arrest the legislature on that day. This is nonsense. I simply followed orders. Moreover, that was not Kebich or Danilov who gave these orders, although newspapers have been describing the latter as a monster. The orders were issued by the interior minister himself. Can you imagine what could have happened had I failed to perform this task and provide for the deputies' safety? The situation was very tense. On the eve of the session, Belarusian Servicemen Association Chairman Nikolay Statkevich was summoned to the KGB offices and notified that in case of unrest the blame would be put on him. Today, the Servicemen Association is rejecting everything, but believe me that there was a great danger of clashes and provocations. With regard to the Belarusian regiment, I want to underline that this is quite a different unit performing other functions. There were no representatives of the regiment in the square. Minsk residents simply associate this name with the activities of the former regiment of the USSR Interior Troops used for operations in hotspots of the former Soviet Union. This operative regiment has been disbanded and a militia brigade has been formed on its basis and that of a militia regiment. The brigade protects public order in the Belarusian capital, also during mass demonstrations. [Gukovskiy] One of the tasks of the Interior Troops is protecting the safety of the Republic and its citizens. In light of this, how do you assess the activities of the Belarusian Servicemen Association? [Platonov] The association was registered by the Ministry of Justice as a public movement. However, it is evidently performing political functions. From this perspective, the association's activities, in my opinion, are illegal. I do not think that we should have any "armed servicemen" aside from the Armed Forces. From whom will they protect us? The nationalist inclination of the Servicemen Association, the Popular Front, and other similar organizations is very dangerous. It is good that we have become independent and won our sovereignty, but we should not overshoot the mark. Take disputes over the "historic" victory of Orsha, for example. Have they contributed to Belarusian-Russian friendship? Only one step separates nationalism and national chauvinism from fascism. We will continue to keep close watch over any manifestations of these tendencies. [Gukovskiy] Do you have problems maintaining relations with other law enforcement agencies? [Platonov] Your question must have been prompted by the well- known letter from the Interior Ministry and KGB leadership to Shushkevich and Kebich. I cannot be held responsible for the entire ministry. I have always had good relations with the KGB, the Defense Ministry, and the State Committee for National Security and Crime Fighting. There are no obstacles to our work on the part of Danilov. Today, neither the KGB nor the Interior Ministry can be left uncontrolled. Our structure is subordinated to the Council of Ministers and helps enforcement structures coordinate activities, draws other ministers and departments into resolving urgent issues, including issues of material supplies. We are grateful to the Defense Ministry that has often helped us in the past, and which recently granted us one of its garrisons for training our troops. [Gukovskiy] How proficient are the Interior Troops? [Platonov] We have good officers, a majority of whom have both special military training and experience. Some 800 Belarusian officers have been redeployed to the Republic from other regions of the CIS. They, too have problems, of which the housing problem is the most acute. However, the active stance taken by the government and personally by Vyacheslav Kebich, who recently visited the troops, gives us hope that they will be resolved. Yet, we are disappointed with low proficiency of our active service soldiers. Military commissariats often draft young people unfit for the Interior Troops. [Gukovskiy] You are urging the importance of professional training, but as far as I know, you were nominated to be deputy interior minister after working in the Komsomol. This fact is often cited by your opponents. Could you brief us on the highlights of your biography? [Platonov] I was born in Vitebsk in 1940 in a Belarusian family, although I was registered as a Russian because my family was evacuated to Krasnoyarsk Kray during the war. I returned to Belarus in 1961, graduated from the department of physics and mathematics of Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute, and became a schoolteacher. Then, I served in the Army and worked in the Komsomol. My last job here was as first secretary of the Central Committee. I studied in the Social Sciences Academy between 1980-1983, where I wrote my dissertation. Then, my life dramatically changed -- I was directed to work in the Interior Ministry. Those who blame me for lack of professionalism do not know that before entering the Academy I took a special course at the Armed Forces General Staff and received a the rank of colonel. [Gukovskiy] Unlike many representatives of the nomenklatura, you often mention your membership in the CPSU and the years spent in the Komsomol. [Platonov] This is not something of which to be ashamed. I am proud that I worked under the leadership of people like Petr Masherov. They taught me to be responsible and provided me with invaluable moral support. [Gukovskiy] In accordance with the law, you cannot be a member of any party. What are your political inclinations? [Platonov] I do not see any powerful political trend whose ideas I would like to follow. Unfortunately, extreme left-wing and right-wing views prevail in the political spectrum of Belarus. Representatives of all these groups know me, because I often attend their meetings -- that is part of my job. Times are changing and so are law enforcement agencies. Earlier, we tried to resolve problems by means of muscle. Today, we have legal footing for our actions. Neither I nor my subordinates want to provoke clashes and demonstrate who is the boss. All issues of contention should be resolved peacefully.
