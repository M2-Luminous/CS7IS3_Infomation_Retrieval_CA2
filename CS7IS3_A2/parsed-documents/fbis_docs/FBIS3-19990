First he was defeated by Rudolf Scharping in the membership poll on the national chairmanship of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. Then the party leadership abandoned him when he worked out the energy consensus with Federal Environmental Minister Toepfer. Toepfer's four-year-old red-green coalition, which he himself praised as a "model for Bonn," has lost a lot of value since the theme of jobs pushed aside all other wishes and visions. But anyone who thought that Schroeder would now enter the landtag elections as a beaten man was deceiving himself. Schroeder was there once again and that is not all--everywhere he was the first on the scene when it was a matter of jobs. He helped initiate the highly regarded new worktime model at the Volkswagen Works and stood by the labor force of the Dasa Works in Lemwerder that was supposed to be closed. However one assesses his individual intrigues, the head of the government was well received in his own federal land. The Schroeder posters that got by without the name Schroeder and even without the abbreviation SPD were evidence of his unbroken self-confidence. "Listen, decide, and act," was the only commentary on the face pensively supported in his hand. Thus the people were given the message that the former Juso [Young Socialist] has finally turned into a trustworthy land father. Schroeder learned to deal with the adversities of life early. The charming bon vivant, whom many see in him and whom he himself sometimes extols when he presents himself ironically as the "chairman of the Toscana caucus," is just one side of his being. The other side is that of the climber, who has developed a respectable existence as an attorney by way of the second educational path after very humble beginnings and thereby made his way in politics. That took toughness, ambition, and intelligence. The skilled Lower Saxon--Schroeder grew up in Lippe, Westphalia--never waited for anyone to call him. He was there wherever opportunities opened up for him and he developed a fine feel for what was expected of him in each case. He became chairman of the Jusos in 1978, Bundestag deputy in 1980, top candidate of the SPD in Lower Saxony in 1984, and minister-president in 1990. The stations of his path were by no means on a straight line. He left a lot of his comrades behind on the curves. His extraordinary rhetorical talent always helped him out. Often enough that got him through. Schroeder's persuasive power is based on double feedback: he almost always finds the right tone and then, purely out of enthusiasm for the effect of his own words, he says what the people want to hear. Hence the role that he plays of the pragmatic or "doer" suits him much better than his former role, that of the ideologically set SPD leftist. Bushy eyebrows and the massive chin indicate the pronounced will to power of a politician who is just now reaching his 50th birthday. The fact that Schroeder's ambition will not always be satisfied in Hannover is well-known in the SPD. Even Engholm felt the hot breath of the Lower Saxon on his neck. So it will be with Scharping if he does become federal chancellor very soon.
