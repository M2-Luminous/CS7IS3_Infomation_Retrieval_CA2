The sample(s) shall be collected at the period(s) most representative of the total discharge. 6.

However, for purposes of this permit, any consecutive 24-hour period that reasonably represents the calendar day may be used for sampling. 7.

The NOI shall include (1) The name and address of the person that the permit will be issued to (2) the name, and address of the operation, including county location, (3) the applicable individual NPDES number(s), (4) the identification of any new discharge location not contained in the expired permit, (5) evidence that the operation has obtained approval of a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) Order from the FDEP, (6) a map showing the facility and discharge location (including latitude and longitude), and (7) the name of the receiving water. Operators having several individual permits are encouraged to consolidate requests for coverage into one NOI for all individual permits. The previous submission of the proper forms in the renewal application does not relieve the permittee desiring coverage under the general permit of the requirement to file a NOI. b. Dischargers with current individual NPDES permits that desire coverage under this general permit are required to file an NOI to the Permit Issuing Authority at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of their current permit(s). The NOI shall contain the same information specified in paragraph a above. Permittees desiring to renew their individual permit are required to submit the appropriate application forms at least 180 days before expiration of their individual permit. c. Dischargers who have not previously obtained an individual NPDES permit are required to submit to EPA the FDEP approval order letter approving the site RAP. The RAP approval order shall be attached to an NOI to be covered by the general permit and shall contain the same information specified in paragraph a above. The application for coverage under the general permit must be made at least forty-five (45) days before the discharge is to commence. d. Dischargers seeking coverage under Part I A.3.a. will be required to submit to EPA the date the discharge is expected to cease, results of analytical data and the same information in paragraph a above, except items (3), (4) and (5). Notification of coverage to discharge will be upon receipt of EPA's short-term coverage letter. e. Notification of coverage will be given by the Permit Issuing Authority by certified mail to the permittee, for dischargers seeking coverage under Part I Sections A.1 and A.2, with the issuance date for each facility being the effective date of coverage by the Permit Issuing Authority. f. Dischargers meeting the conditions set forth in Part I A.3.c. are not required to submit an detailed NOI as outlined above, but must submit a copy of the analytical tests and a summary of the proposed activity at least one (1) week before discharge begins. These dischargers are covered upon receipt of the data, unless notified otherwise by EPA. g. The coverage of the permit shall expire on XXXXXX , five (5) years from the effective date of the permit. h. In accordance with 40 CFR 122.28(a)(2) permittees who are covered by this general permit who seek to be continued under this general permit, shall submit an complete NOI in accordance with paragraph a, to EPA 180 days before the expiration of this permit. Section G. Additional General Permit Conditions 1. The Permit Issuing Authority may require any person authorized by this permit to apply for and obtain an individual NPDES permit when: a. The discharge(s) is a significant contributor of pollution; b. The discharger is not in compliance with the conditions of this permit; c. A change has occurred in the availability of the demonstrated technology of practices for the control or abatement of pollutants applicable to the point sources; d. Effluent limitation guidelines are promulgated for point sources covered by this permit; e. A Water Quality Management Plan containing requirements applicable to such point source is approved; or f. The point source(s) covered by this permit no longer: (1) Involve the same or substantially similar types of operations; (2) Discharge the same types of wastes; (3) Require the same effluent limitations or operating conditions; (4) Require the same or similar monitoring; and (5) In the opinion of the RA, are more appropriately controlled under an individual permit than under a general permit.
