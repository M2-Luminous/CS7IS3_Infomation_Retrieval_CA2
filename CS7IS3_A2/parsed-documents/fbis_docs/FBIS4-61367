The accidents, though relatively minor, will add to concern about nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union, where it has been compromised by ancient equipment, an exodus of staff and the smuggling of dangerous materials. In Germany yesterday, a spokesman for the federal criminal office in Wiesbaden said there had been a sharp increase in the illegal trading of radioactive material from eastern Europe, on a black market dominated by Russians, Poles and Czechs. The spokesman said nearly 200 cases of nuclear smuggling had been registered in 1992 -- about two-thirds involving eastern European suspects. The figure was certain to rise in 1993, and in some cases, he said, there had been indications of a "background of organised crime". In Monday's accident at Chernobyl, an alarm was set off in reactor unit three, which was triggered by falling water levels. A cable short-circuited as officials tried to reconnect the reactor to the grid after two weeks of maintenance. On Tuesday, a robotic arm failed while moving nuclear fuel rods in the oldest reactor unit, number one. The failure sent a container banging into an adjacent installation. Although these were minor incidents, the first rating one on the international scale of nuclear incidents, they scarcely enhance international confidence in the running of the plant. "It could emotionally influence the inspectors who were there," Tatiana Yagish, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian nuclear authority, said. The IAEA has already declared the plant, and reactor number one in particular, to be unsafe to operate, and the United States has demanded the plant's closure. Ukraine signed an agreement with the US to shut down the plant once it found an alternative energy source, but Ukraine's parliament reversed the decision on the grounds that they were becoming too dependent on expensive Russian fuel. The problem of safety has been compounded by an exodus of qualified staff to Russia. Most were trained in Russia, and many are ethnic Russians. Wage levels in the Russian nuclear industry are three to four times higher than in Ukraine. Chernobyl itself, the site of many incidents since the catastrophe affecting reactor number four in 1986, has a new director. Last year, there were 175 separate incidents recorded at Ukraine's five nuclear power stations -- a 20 per cent increase on the previous year. Ukraine is still struggling with the consequences of the 1986 disaster, which it admits has caused some 8,000 deaths, and is still costing about 12 per cent of the national budget. The concrete casing around reactor four has developed serious cracks. Last year, Ukraine launched a competition to design and build an alternative, but nothing has been done. The impoverishment of nuclear installations in eastern Europe is increasingly making Germany a "special attraction" to dealers. But there have been no indications so far that traders have found profitable business from buyers with Germany as an end destination. Some of the material came to Germany aboard Russian military transports from Siberia, and was "stored" in former Soviet military installations in eastern Germany before being offered to potential buyers. German middle men were cooperating with what was described as a "Russian-Polish nuclear cartel". Radioactive material suitable for the construction of nuclear bombs has so far not been confiscated, the police authorities said. But the smuggling of uranium, and non-nuclear substances, such as scandium and red mercury, none the less posed a "considerable danger" to both dealers and the public.
