This is why the anti-inflationary measures have followed a "gradualist" course, Economy Minister Ignacio Posadas stressed in remarks to the Argentine newspaper AMBITO FINANCIERO. Referring to the Argentine convertibility plan, the minister said: "The transformation Argentina has experienced has impact, is revolutionary." And his opinion is that convertibility has "a symbolic value, but in my opinion it does not compare with structural reforms that are more substantial and long lasting." Posadas admitted: "There was a time when our government seriously debated the possibility of implementing something similar, but it did not because the indexation of pensions imposed by the Constitution would have implied that a shock [preceding word in English] policy would have been followed by an enormous increase in social security expenditure." He also added: "It was not possible to synchronize the process with the generation of fiscal resources from privatizations; this is a minority government. This was the great difference (with Argentina) that made us adopt a gradualist anti-inflationary strategy." Referring to "currency over-evaluation," the minister said "this is a topic being discussed throughout Latin America," and that the so-called "over-evaluation" is nothing less than the level of competition of national enterprises when compared with foreign enterprises. "It would be dangerous to generalize because it implies not acknowledging the fact that some enterprises have had problems and others have made progress," he said. Posadas indicated that it is not fair to attribute competition problems to exchange rate problems "because there are a series of factors in play: salary agreements within the private sector that have not come up to expectations; certain markets that receive our exports have suffered a recessionary period during the past few years; and some of our competitors, such as Southeast Asia, have had much lower costs than our own." He also cited the argument of the inflow of capital that has kept the dollar at a low price in our market and has led the Central Bank to intervene in order to sustain the dollar to prevent a greater loss of competition by enterprises. "In any case, what can be questioned is whether every thing is being done, but what cannot be denied is that in this respect an active policy has been followed," the minister said. The minister rejected devaluation to improve competition because it would only be "a short-term improvement that would lead to greater inflation." Posadas also evaluated the current government's accomplishments, saying: "We can feel satisfied if we take into account this government's starting point, but if we measure our task with all that we wanted to do and with what the country needs, then we have to acknowledge that we have not achieved all that we would have liked to."
