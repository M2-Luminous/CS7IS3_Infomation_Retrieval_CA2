Deo: "Pakistan's Double-Speak"] [Text] Pakistani authorities have often spoken with two voices on their country's nuclear programme. Generally it is described as a purely peaceful programme. But when it comes to reacting to US pressures on non-proliferation Pakistan stoutly defends it as being vital for its security typifying the inherent dilemma before Pakistani thinkers on many national issues. This, of course, does not surprise those who have followed the general Pakistani discourse on defence or foreign policy. Nawaz Sharif also said during a National Assembly debate that the government will not be permitted to cap or to roll back the nuclear programme which was a guarantee of Pakistan's freedom and independence. In his winding-up remarks Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali said that he would continue to counter all attempts at creating misunderstandings regarding Pakistan's nuclear programme. He reaffirmed that a political decision had been taken to use this capability for peaceful purposes only. Shortly thereafter, Sadar Assef who was visiting Dhaka for the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] Foreign Ministers' meeting shocked his audience by declaring that Pakistan would "continue with its nuclear programme as long as threat of war with its traditional rival India exists.... Nuclear capability should not be an exclusive privilege of the western world or India." At least one daily, THE MUSLIM, has questioned the wisdom of Sardar Assef's utterances. The current phase of debate on Pakistan's nuclear policy began with Benazir Bhutto's statement that the programme had been capped in 1990. Nawaz Sharif denounced any possibility of capping as an anti-national act. Gen Aslam Beg, a former Chief of Army Staff, has now come out with a signed article in THE NATION . He recalls that it was an American, Richard Barlow, who had "unequivocally asserted" that Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability in 1987. The US Administration chose to ignore this report so long as Soviet forces remained in Afghanistan but used the same (Barlow report) to accuse Pakistan of having crossed the red light. Gen Beg admitted openly that Pakistan "had embarked on all the nuclear steps simultaneously". These were: uranium enrichment up to 95 per cent and above; preparation of the device by integrating all its elements; laboratory tests of all the elements of the device; final test of the integrated system either by detonation (hot test) or without it through a cold test; developing the delivery system. He also confirmed that Pakistan had developed this capacity in 1987 and added that the process of freezing the first stage of this programme had "actually started in January 1989, that is after a deliberate and conscious decision taken in a conference co-chaired by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the then Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto." There was thus "no substance" to Benazir's allegation that she was kept in the dark about Pakistan's nuclear programme. According to Gen Beg, phase one of the programme was frozen at the 3 percent enrichment level. "Subsequently, phase two got automatically frozen because of lack of the basic material i.e. enriched weapon grade uranium. The process of freezing, disclosed Gen Beg, "continued during Nawaz Sharif's tenure. The United States is now intensifying the pressure on Pakistan to roll back its programme and exterminate the capability which Pakistan has acquired after years of toil and sacrifice." Now Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, commonly considered as the father of the Pakistani bomb, has surfaced with his own cryptic observation that the programme was never capped or uncapped and directed further enquiries to the Chief of Army Staff [COAS]. Reminding his audience that he was still a government servant, he volunteered his opinion that no one can accept a thing detrimental to the country's security or defence nor must he do so. Dr Khan is mercifully silent on whether the COAS could agree to freezing (or roll-back) if he thought that doing so would not be detrimental to Pakistan's security or defence. In the meantime Benazir has once again publicly reaffirmed Pakistan's determination not to roll back the nuclear programme since non-proliferation in South Asia was regional issue. Pakistan, she reiterated, will not sign the Nuclear non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] unless India also signs it. With all these statements it is quite evident that Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability (crossed the red light) in 1987, that Washington was fully aware of it but chose to ignore this fact in providing the annual certification to the US Congress, that Benazir was a party to the freezing decision taken in January 1989 and her disclaimer in Washington that she was kept in the dark about Pakistan's nuclear programme was disingenuous. That Pakistan is in possession of one or more nuclear devices is indirectly confirmed by its acquisition of missiles from China. Caretaker Prime Minister Moir Qureshi had said on August 26 that "the short range tactical missiles Pakistan received were required to meet our legitimate self-defence requirements... As a sovereign state Pakistan cannot and will not sacrifice its right to take whatever step we deem necessary for its security." Qureshi later justified the nuclear programme as "inevitable for the defence of the country". Read in their totality, all these statements suggest that Pakistan has nuclear capability but probably of limited dimensions. It has also loosely talked of an Islamic Bomb thus giving its nuclear programme an extra-regional dimension. Perhaps for its own reasons Washington is exaggerating the extent of Pakistan's nuclear programme. By encouraging Pakistan to harp on linking its signature on the NPT with India's, Washington is trying to confuse the issue. India does not sign the NPT for its iniquitous character, not for any regional reasons. By now there is enough evidence that the five-nation conference proposed by Nawaz Sharif in 1991 was in fact an American cuckoo's egg deposited in the Pakistani crow's nest. The proposal died an early death although efforts are repeatedly made to revive it. If Pakistan wants to consolidate its security, it should engage in meaningful talks with India without laying the precondition that the so-called core issue of Kashmir must be tackled before any meaningful progress can be made in other areas. Even in the nuclear area, bilateral talks could prove more fruitful than the present tactics which in effect merely serve the American policy of consolidating its stranglehold on yet another field of technology. In fact, Pakistan should join India in demanding a more equitable and just international regime when the NPT Review Conference meets in 1995.
