In the platform statement on the goals and objectives of the Russian patriotic movement, Sergey Glazyev and Andrey Golovin (former leader of "Smena-New Policy") pointed out that "People's Alliance" is "not a Moscow party of a mythical 'majority,'" but "a young, powerful, and energetic organization of a political center. A party of the ordinary people, who are the linchpin of vast Russia." According to Dmitriy Olshanskiy, "People's Alliance" is a party in which all political structures capable of forming a coalition are interested. The alliance leaders see their main objective as the unification of all patriotic forces. In their view, the great political potential of "People's Alliance" members will help the party to influence the way the country is governed, and to rule the state if it wins the next elections. The "People's Alliance's" program of political and economic reform in Russia confirms the seriousness of its founders' ambitions. The conference approved the Russian patriotic movement's charter unanimously and without any amendments, just as they adopted a program statement, which was only required to be finalized by the political council. The conference also elected a political council made up of 14 members. Also unanimously, "People's Alliance" elected its cochairmen -- Andrey Golovin and Dmitriy Olshanskiy. As stated at the conference, "People's Alliance" has already set up 10 regional branches. The constituent conference of the "People's Alliance" Russian Movement was scheduled for June.
