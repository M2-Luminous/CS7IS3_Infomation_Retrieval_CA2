They are members of a workers' deputies group from the council of the People's Republic of Albania and include: Deputy Shaban Memia, of the Albanian Democratic Party (APD) in Tirana, who was chairman of the delegation; Deputy Simon Puta (AFD); Deputy Nevrus Cela (APD); Deputy Ethem Ruka (Albanian Socialist Party); Deputy Roland Tafili (APD); and Deputy Skender Gjinushi (Social Democratic Party). On 15 December, the guests were received by Sejm Speaker Jozef Zych, and on this occasion they underscored the value and pleasure of their visit and their opportunities for deepening their knowledge of the extensive structural changes made in Poland. The chairman of the delegation expressed his belief that their stay in Poland would begin a process of cooperation between both parliaments and countries and said that one of the goals should be for a Polish group to visit Albania and call for bilateral groups in both parliaments. The Albanian deputies held talks with the heads of the following committees: Foreign Affairs, Constitutional Responsibility, Legislation, Privatization, and the National Assembly Constitutional Commission. The delegation met with the leadership of the SLD [Democratic Left Alliance], UD [Democratic Union], and UP [Union of Labor] parliamentary clubs. The deputy chief of the Sejm Chancellery, Director General Wojciech Popkowski, briefed the deputies on the legislative process, the Sejm's Rule of Procedure, and the powers of the State Tribunal. Janusz Ziolkowski, secretary of state and chief of the Presidential Chancellery, and Iwo Byczewski, deputy secretary of state in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, discussed the prospects for developing bilateral relations with Albanian members of parliament. Clarification of some of the aspects of the Balkan situation were also discussed. [passage omitted]
