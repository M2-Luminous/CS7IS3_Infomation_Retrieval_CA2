In remarks made while attending the military exercise "Taysir 13" east of the Suez Canal today, Tantawi praised the skill of the 3d Field Army and noted the combat ability of the Egyptian soldier. He called for continuing tough training for small and medium-size units and for providing the necessary care for soldiers to enable them to achieve a high level of physical and technical competence and to always be ready to defend Egypt. He said the state and the people are securing modern and advanced equipment for the Army to enable it to perform its tasks honorably. In the exercise, a mechanized infantry unit of the 3d Army crushes an enemy attack in a mountainous region. The unit stops the advance of enemy forces, destroys them, restores defensive positions, and launches a counterattack. The exercise begins with enemy warplanes attacking the positions of the mechanized infantry unit. The Air Force then intervenes, confronting enemy planes and forcing them to flee. Reconnaissance units start to gather military information on the movements of the two sides. Ground defenses, helicopters, and vehicles equipped with antitank missiles confront and destroy the attacking enemy tanks. Our forces use mine fields and landslides to hinder the enemy advance. Here the competence of the Egyptian antitank missile "al-Ahram" appears. The missile is mounted on light military vehicles and can destroy enemy tanks far away. In the next phase of "Taysir 13," the 3d Army tanks launch a counterattack against enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses on them. Electronic war techniques, represented by jamming and obstruction, are used. Antichemical-warfare units carry out surveys to make sure the enemy used no chemical weapons in the battle. The exercise is part of a major training plan currently being implemented by the 3d Field Army using live ammunition; it coincides with the anniversary of the return of dear Sinai to Egypt. Mechanized infantry, tank, helicopter, reconnaissance, chemical warfare, and Air Force units took part in the exercise. The drill seeks to highlight the ability of commanders to make decisions in emergencies and control their forces during the battle. It also aims to unify the method of action used by the Armed Forces branches in mountainous regions and to train tank crews working in the mountains.
