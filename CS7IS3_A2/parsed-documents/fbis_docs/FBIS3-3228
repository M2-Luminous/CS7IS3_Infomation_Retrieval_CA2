Under the TRS system, one of a series of recent, major reforms, taxes are classified and collected separately by the central and local governments, ensuring that both have stable income sources, with the central government gaining a larger share of increased incomes. The new system has taken international practices as reference. Like other major reforms, the new taxation system will have a long-term and fundamental positive effect on local economies and create some temporary difficulties for some departments or localities. Whether or not local governments will put the national interests above their own and whether or not they are willing to accept the new system, therefore, will decide the progress and even the success or failure of the TRS system. At the ongoing session of the Eighth National People's Congress here, local leaders have shown their understanding of the need to give priority to overall national interests when discussing the new taxation system. They agree that the TRS system will have great significance for promoting a rational growth of state coffers, increasing the central financial power and beefing up the central government's macro- economic regulating capacity. In the long run, the new system will be conducive to a fast, sustained and sound development of the national economy. The local and central governments have no differences on this understanding. Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju said that a socialist market economy will not work without behavioral standards. Reform of the financial and taxation systems aim to set standards and norms to adjust interest relations between the state enterprises and between the central and local governments. If the proportion of revenues for the central coffers is too small to carry out macro regulations, the whole situation may be thrown into chaos and it will be difficult for Shanghai to develop under such circumstances. Therefore, Shanghai gives active support for the TRS system. Statistics show that the revenues of the central treasury accounted for only 45 percent of the total financial revenues of the country in 1992. During the year, the central treasury had to pay half of its expenditures by issuing bonds and borrowing loans. While local financial departments gained substantial increases of revenues last year, difficulties of central finances deteriorated. A weakening of the central financial power was attributed mainly to the contractual financial system which diverted the lion's share of increased incomes to localities in the past decade. A goal of the TRS system is to increase the proportion of revenues for the central coffers to 57 percent of the total, which is considered necessary for the state treasury to perform normally. Chen Huanyou, governor of Jiangsu Province, said realization of the goal means localities will increase their revenue contributions to the central coffers gradually. Though local economies may be affected to a certain extent, the impact should be temporary only. "with a `bigger cake' and growth of the national economy, localities will be benefited," he said. Provincial officials estimate that Jiangsu will contribute an additional 18.5 billion yuan to the central coffers between now and the year 2000 under the TRS system. Shanghai and Jiangsu have led the country in contributions to the central treasury in the past decades. In 1993 Shanghai handed over 13 billion yuan and jiangsu, 7.6 billion yuan, accounting for 70 percent and 50 percent of their local financial revenues respectively. The new taxation system will affect some provinces that develop rapidly. Guangdong will be at the front to bear the brunt. According to the new system, 70 percent of a locality's increased revenues will be handed over to the central coffers, with the locality itself keeping the rest. Of Guangdong's financial revenues of 34 billion yuan in 1993, only two billion yuan was turned over to the state under the old financial system. Under the new TRS system, Guangdong has to hand over many times that amount to the central treasury this year. However, leaders of Guangdong Province expressed their support for the new system. Governor Zhu Senlin said the new system means a redefining of relations between the central and local authorities rather than a recall of local power. The measure will mobilize local initiatives and facilitate a readjustment of the country's economic structure, he said. Huang Kehua, director of the Finance Bureau of Shandong Province, said increased revenues for the central government will enable it to carry out macro-economic controls effectively. Since the second half of last year, the central government has adopted a series of macro-economic control measures, which have alleviated and solved some economic contradictions and problems. Achievements made so far have helped people understand the necessity of macro-economic controls in the process of establishing a market economy. Zhang Ruifu, director of the Finance Bureau of Hunan Province, said that macro-economic controls can alleviate and solve the problems of unfair wealth distribution and regional imbalance. Solution of the two problems is considered an important factor for social and political stability in China. "The central treasury, with increased revenues, can better support underdeveloped areas, agricultural provinces and ethnic minority areas," he added. For this reason, Hunan, Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan and other inland provinces have placed great hopes on the new taxation system. In enforcing the new TRS system, the central government has adopted a gradual approach and shown a certain degree of flexibility. This, meant to protect the vested interests of localities, also wins votes for the TRS system. For instance, the central treasury will return a certain amount of revenues to localities based on their 1993 contributions; localities which used to receive subsidies from the central coffers will continue to retain this privilege for a period to come; provinces and regions with a concentration of ethnic minority people will be allowed to adopt some transitional methods to alleviate the pressure on lower-level financial departments. Though the new taxation system has been implemented smoothly in the past months, financial experts said that it is necessary to study contradictions and problems arising in its implementation, study countermeasures timely and minimize its negative effect.
