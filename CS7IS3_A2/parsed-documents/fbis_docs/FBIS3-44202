Dos Santos even declared that he dictates laws to his negotiators in Lusaka from the time these laws are in the Ministry of State Security laboratories until their implementation at the negotiating table. International mediators are not immune either. In an interview with the ANGOLAN PRESS AGENCY he said: [Begin dos Santos recording] In my capacity as president of the Republic and commander in chief of the Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, I have a rather important interventionist role to play. So, I have intervened in the process since its preparation stage. I have intervened in the assessment of strategies and tactics, and my intervention has also had to do with the details of negotiations in Lusaka, the observers, and so forth. So my intervention is rather extensive. [end recording] Eduardo dos Santos is still advocating a military solution for the Angolan conflict, urging his troops to be ready to fight once more. The MPLA-PT chairman, however, said his government is unable to solve the critical economic problems faced by Angola. [Begin dos Santos recording] Poverty is a problem. Obviously, the state does not have the necessary conditions to deal with the fundamental problems of food, medical assistance, education, and so on. I believe all adopted measures were palliative. [end recording] The Luanda government is unable to solve the basic problems of the Angolan people, particularly regarding food aid. It is the Futungo leading class, however, that benefits most from the war--in which it is bent on investing all Angolan funds [word indistinct] because it gets profits from the purchase of weapons. Questioned about corruption in his government, with three ministers at the top of the list, Eduardo dos Santos did not deny or acknowledge the fact, but he admitted that there is corruption in the party and government he leads without, however, having discussed the issue in the MPLA-PT Central Committee meetings. [Begin dos Santos recording] We do not deny or confirm this. These issues were not discussed in the Central Committee meeting (?I presided at). I believe there is generalized corruption in the current government and the party that won elections. [end recording] Eduardo dos Santos neither knows nor ignores the anachronic corruption in the leading class of his organization but knows that it exists. The case has never been mentioned in the meetings of the regime's high hierarchy. Here is the main cause for the prolonged suffering of the Angolan people.
