They are also one of the departments designated by the central authorities as being of importance to the anticorruption struggle. To correct others, we must correct ourselves first. Procuratorial organs at all levels in the country must fight corruption in their own system and purify the procuratorial ranks to more effectively fulfill their roles in law supervision. Zhang Siqing said: Procuratorial personnel are warriors at the frontline of the anticorruption fight, but they are also important targets which corrupt criminal elements try to win over to their side and corrode. From problems that have been exposed so far, we can see that only a small minority of the procuratorial ranks has violated the law and discipline. However, this fact has a very bad effect on the masses. It seriously ruins the image of procuratorial organs and damages the sanctity of the state legal system. Some procuratorial personnel have used their procuratorial authority to obtain personal gain or wantonly used their authority to infringe on the rights and interests of citizens, such as by using it to practice favoritism and commit fraud, to demand and receive bribes, and to leak classified information on cases which are being handled, and by wantonly using it to illegally detain people and extort confession by torturing people. These are the main manifestations of corrupt phenomena in procuratorial organs. We should focus on strictly investigating and dealing with these cases, which involve acts that violate law and disturb discipline. We must never connive with or tolerate such acts; nor should we cover up those acts or shield their perpetrators. It has been made known that last year, while they were vigorously investigating and dealing with major and important cases involving corruption and bribery, the procuratorial organs focused on fighting corruption in their own system and scored a certain degree of success. Since August 1993, procuratorial organs at all levels have been comparing themselves to what is stipulated in provisions on honesty and self-discipline in order to investigate and correct themselves. At the same time, they have strictly investigated and dealt with cases involving procuratiorial organs and personnel who violated the law and discipline. They investigated and dealt with 568 personnel who violated the law or discipline, and they sorted out 24 types of fees and fines which were arbitrary collected or imposed within the procuratorial system.
