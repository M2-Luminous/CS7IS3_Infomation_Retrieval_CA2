The prospects are not bad, because within the next 18 months, the Germans, French, and Spaniards will assume the presidency of the European Union [EU] one after another. After his talks with Spain's Prime Minister Filipe Gonzalez in Schwerin, Chancellor Helmut Kohl was already enthusiastic about the troika at the head of the EU until the end of 1995. Nevertheless, the triple-team will not find things easy, for it will consist of large European member-states, and in the past this has repeatedly given rise to mistrust, if not opposition, on the part of smaller countries, says the MITTELDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. NEUE ZEIT of Berlin says on this topic: Considering the substance of the observations made at the 11th German-Spanish consultations, one may be permitted to have doubts. Everyone wants the best. Success depends on specifics. But more important than all good intentions is the climate this time. It was good to bring the Spanish Prime Minister Gonzalez, representative of southern interests in the EU, to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and discuss an eastward expansion there as well. The partners must be convinced that this expansion does not lead to a German special path, that doing the one thing does not automatically mean abandoning the other, the consolidation of the EU, says NEUE ZEIT. NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG represents the following view: The formation of a European triple-team consisting of Germany, France, and Spain, announced by Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez, will not encounter unanimous support in every EU country. Above all, in Great Britain there is profound suspicion about such a troika, but one cannot assume a leadership function if one applies the brakes all the time. Without the boost supplied by Germany and France, stagnation would have been almost inevitable, and there would have been no EU. Also in future, the EU needs such pioneers, not bosses, and it is to be considered highly positive that Spain is placing itself in this group of kinetic forces, says the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG.
