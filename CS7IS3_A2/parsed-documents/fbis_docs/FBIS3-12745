In a press statement on the most important ideas he communicated to the Israeli leaders on behalf of the Palestinian president, Papoulias said: These ideas revolve around calming the atmosphere and creating a new atmosphere that would facilitate things, provide security for the Palestinians, and lead to disarming the settlers and resuming the dialogue between the two sides. He said that the Israeli side has promised to take these ideas into consideration and will reply to them later. He said: Efforts will be exerted in the future and the EC hopes that the peace efforts will produce good results and will not reach a dead end.
