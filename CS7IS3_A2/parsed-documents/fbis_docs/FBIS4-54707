On this occasion Silajdzic said that a limited cease-fire could be significant for the resumption of negotiations. He stressed that the aggressor was buying time with his acts -- such as bringing in soldiers dressed in police uniforms in and around Gorazde, and settling its people in other people's houses. We have established a federation of Bosniaks and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats, and we are still offering the federation to those who want to live with us, Silajdzic said. Asked by Hogg what kind of relations would be established with the Serbian entity in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Silajdzic said: Whatever kind of entity they choose, they can join the federation. However, we cannot allow the people of Banja Luka to not be able to return to their homes. The international community has to guarantee them this right. All this would imply that the Serbs will have relations with Serbia, but not to the disadvantage of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that the contact group has a lot to do. We are taking it seriously, and we think that it is important for all of us, Silajdzic added.
