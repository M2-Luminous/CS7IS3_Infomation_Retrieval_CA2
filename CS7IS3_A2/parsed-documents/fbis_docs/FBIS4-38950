The document, in particular, reads, as follows: "Recently, a neighboring state's military formations have insolently held a so-called `grand council' on our territory. They are guarding Crimea's antistate, anti-Ukrainian parliament, creating havoc and raping women. We demand the protection of Ukrainian citizens from unruly, armed foreigners. "We emphasize that the formation, development, actions, and financing of the Russian cossacks are under the supervision of the Russian Government. That is why we regard cossack raids on our territory as Russia's interference in Ukraine's internal affairs, the more so in that the existence and presence of paramilitary public formations is outlawed in Ukraine." The "Ukraine" democratic association demands that the Ukrainian Foreign Affairs Ministry immediately lodge a note of protest with the Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry in connection with the presence of Russian cossacks in Crimea and Russia's active interference in Ukraine's internal affairs; that the Internal Affairs Ministry deport Russian cossacks from Ukraine and hold those from their formations who committed crimes liable under Ukraine's laws; and that DerzhKomKordon [State Committee for the Protection of Ukraine's State Border] immediately enhance the regime of control at the border and introduce Ukrainian entry visas to put an end to the influx of criminal elements and prevent the import of drugs and arms.
