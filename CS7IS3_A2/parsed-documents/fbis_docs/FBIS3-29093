"Forcing upon the developing countries market opening and liberalisation of foreign trade with the economic `aid' as the lever is an important feature of the neo-colonial method the imperialists are employing," he noted, adding: "Market opening and liberalisation of foreign trade are, in actuality, for the stronger to overpower the weaker." "As the reality shows, in consequence of the neo-colonial policy of the imperialists, the developing countries are daily getting poorer and the bipolarization of `the rich gets richer and the poor poorer' is now expanding worldwide, and this deals a hard blow at the developed capitalist and imperialist countries, too", he stated. He stressed the need to abolish the old international economic order based on neo-colonialism and establish a new fair one based on democratic principles. "It is important," he said, "to democratise the international economic relations so that all the countries and all the nations may exercise the sovereignty, irrespective of their size and strength, and disparity in wealth. For this purpose, an end must be put to the unfair old international economic order such as unfair division of labour, dependent trading structure, non-equivalent exchange and predatory monetary and financial system which are forced by imperialism today. If a fair international economic order is to be established, the developing countries must be independent in economy. For this, the developing countries must, first of all, adhere to the principle of self-reliance. They must actively develop South-South cooperation on the principle of collective self-reliance." In the second part of the report, he stressed the need to establish a fair international political order. "If the developing countries are to be freed from the neo-colonial yoke, it is important for them to have political sovereignty," the reporter noted, and added: "What is essential to the establishment of political sovereignty is to unite the popular masses as an independent political motive force capable of shaping their destiny by their own efforts with an independent fighting target." The reporter quoted His Excellency Kim Chong-il as saying: "The decisive guarantee of victory in the revolutionary struggle and constructive work is to strengthen the party, the general staff of the revolution, and closely unite the masses of people around the party and the leader and thus reinforce the driving force of the revolution." He noted: "Unity is the life and soul of an independent driving force and the source of its invincible strength. "The imperialists who are seeking economic subjugation and political domination are most afraid of the unity of the popular masses into one independent motive force and resort to the splittist moves to obstruct it. One of such manoeuvres of the imperialists is the `multiparty parliamentary democracy' of Western style forced on the developing countries. "The `multiparty parliamentary democracy' is the application of the principle of free competition to the political arena, which is aimed at setting up a political domination system commensurate with the economic domination system. "What the people of the developing countries need is not `multiparty parliamentary democracy' of the West but an independent political system which can ensure the unity of patriotic forces under the banner of independence against imperialism. "Therefore, the people of the African countries should develop by themselves a political formula conducive to the unity of all the patriotic forces in conformity with the specific conditions of their countries. What is important here is to reject the interference of all outside forces in their internal affairs and establish a democratic order strictly defending the sovereignty of each country in the international community. All the countries should reject any privilege and interference in other's internal affairs ignoring the principle of fairness and international justice in the international relations and develop friendship and unity and cooperation on the principle of equality and mutual benefit." In the third part, the reporter said that all the victories and achievements of the Korean people in building a new independent society are results of the application of the chuche idea. "The reality of Korea proves that the chuche idea which regards independence as the life and soul of the country and the nation and sets it as the basic way of building a new society to strengthen the motive force and enhance its role is, indeed, the guiding idea of the revolution and construction with invincible vitality," the reporter noted, and said: "We should make sincere efforts for the building of a new independent society by creatively applying the universal truth of the chuche idea to the specific conditions of our countries and strengthen international cooperation among the peoples aspiring after independence. We should resolutely oppose the moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries who are obstructing the reunification of Korea and wage a more powerful international solidarity movement in support of the reunification of Korea."
