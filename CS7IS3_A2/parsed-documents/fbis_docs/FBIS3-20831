The blockade against our country has halted many projects, including the gasification of Serbia south of Batajnica, which has been dragging on for 10 years now. The biggest problem has always been the lack of money. The question now is whether Serbia will solve these problems as well, since there are two consortia for the gasification of southeastern Serbia. The job will probably be undertaken by the one with the stronger political position in these times. Only three days before the last elections, on 16 December, a meeting took place at Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's office between Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of "Progres," and Stepan Romanovich Derezhev and Vladislav Vladimirovich Pochinkin, the directors of "Gasprom" in Moscow. The official announcement said that these men are representatives of a consortium to construct the southern branch of the gas line across Serbia. In the presence of the president as well as Prime Minister Sainovic, it was reported that "a contract was signed concerning this major job." Speaking of former Prime Minister Sainovic, it must be noted that he has long been acquainted with the cooperation between "Progres" and "Gasprom." It is perhaps partially for that reason that insiders say that he will be the FRY ambassador to Moscow. The founders of the consortium, at least according to the Serbian Government accord signed by Sainovic, are the mixed Russo-Serbian enterprise "Progresgas-trejding," Belgrade, as well as NIS, "SARTID 1913," and "Beobank," so that it was logical to expect that these members would put their signatures on the contract concerning joint financing and construction of the gas line through which gas would one day arrive not only from Hungary, but also from Bulgaria. But since the members of the consortium existed only "on paper," without any mutually arranged relations, without any agreement to govern this, it was normal that only two "serious" firms would then emerge, which are in fact the foundation of this consortium: "Progres" and "Gasprom." Priority to Mixed Enterprise Even that information about Russian financing of the Serbian gas line under the blockade elicited reactions by IZVESTIYA, and it was explained in Moscow that this job will get under way only after the sanctions are lifted. A month ago, we too looked for someone at "Progresgas-trejding" to explain this, but Toplica Nedeljkovic, one of the directors of the mixed company, considered it a bad time for anything to be written about that. Thanks to Mirko Marjanovic, the general director of "Progres," we spoke to "Progresgas-trejding" about the new consortium only a few days ago. We asked Filip Grujic, the assistant general director of "Progres," and Toplica Nedeljkovic, the director of "Progresgas-trejding," what has happened over the course of the month and a half since the contract was signed in President Milosevic's office. They explained to us that the goal of creating the consortium is to gasify that part of Serbia and to ensure an alternative and supplemental path of entry for gas, at Dimitrovgrad, in addition to the existing one at Horgos. According to the government accord, the job coordinator is "Progresgas-trejding." $190 Million From Stockholders?! "We are a Russo-Serbian mixed enterprise, there will be Russians involved in the job, so it is logical that we be the exponents of the job," says Nedeljkovic, who before assuming this post was in fact an assistant to Nikola Sainovic, then the minister of energy at the very time when "Progres" was intervening to cover the debts of importers and users of gas by exporting our goods. At the time, "Progres's" entry into the gas business created conflicts with NIS, but some sort of compromise, about which nothing can be written at present, was found to the satisfaction of all. The role of the founders is to create the conditions for realization of the job in the first phase. That would mean finding money, providing projects.... The readiness of the Russian firm to come in with money is not disputed. Will that be only money, or equipment and labor as well? The people at "Progresgas-trejding" with whom we spoke do not deny that an investment program has been drawn up within NIS (while they do not mention "Energogas, although it is known that it is behind this), and that they have plenty of necessary projects (for the Pojate-Nis-Dimitrovgrad line) from which the new consortium will profit. Thus, they will also need what the old consortium, which is still in existence, produced. The task of the new consortium is to construct the line in question from Pojate to Dimitrovgrad, as well as the Nis-Knjazevac-Bor-Prahovo, Nis-Leskovac-Vranje, and Nis-Prokuplje-Kursumlija-Pristina lines. It is estimated that between $180 and $190 million is needed for all these lines. We would add that "NIS Energogas" knows nothing about these talks that you have had with NIS. "That is a relationship problem at NIS," says Nedeljkovic. "We are planning," Grujic continues, "to build the gas lines with investments from future stockholders, who will be the co-owners of the gas lines, who will run them and have the right to share the profits that we expect. We intend to create a new enterprise whose job will be the operation of the gas lines constructed with stockholder investments." Can this principle also apply perhaps to the long-distance hot-water line from the thermoelectric power plant in Obrenovac to Belgrade? "Certainly. If that had been done, the job would have already progressed quite far," Grujic replies. Whoever Provides the Money Gets the Work The officials with whom we spoke emphasize that firms that are not among the founders but that accept the principles will be allowed to join the project. It has been agreed that everything that NIS has invested thus far in these lines will be recognized as an investment in the new enterprise. For example, the planner will be the same. Incomplete investments made within the NIS context concerning gas will be completed by those who began them. Our consortium will not interfere in this regard, they say. They emphasize that "there is no controversy in relation to the existing consortium. They themselves can finish what they have begun, and if someone from that consortium wants to participate in this one, they can join it." "No one can be guaranteed work unless they provide money," says Grujic, in response to complaints from firms in Nis who are afraid of losing business. If they do not have the money to invest, then they can invest their labor as future co-ownership. The capacity of this branch from Bulgaria is two billion cubic meters of gas annually. Around seven billion cubic meters can enter each year from the Hungarian line. This would allow for a normal supply until 2011. However, Nedeljkovic says that we have never taken more than 2.5 billion cubic meters from the Hungarian line (plus a billion cubic meters of domestic gas). Thus, with this branch, if there is enough consumption and users that can pay for the gas in this country, it will be possible to import around nine billion cubic meters annually. This branch would close the "gas line ring" and reduce the dependence on petroleum derivatives (and increase the dependence on imported gas).... Gas is cheaper than petroleum, Grujic and Nedeljkovic emphasize, stressing that the possibility of a "goods for gas" arrangement is very great. Conditions will also be created for getting gas to Montenegro one day. Have the founders signed any mutual agreement that would lend legal status to the consortium? "The principles have been agreed to, and an agreement is being drawn up," says Toplica Nedeljkovic.
