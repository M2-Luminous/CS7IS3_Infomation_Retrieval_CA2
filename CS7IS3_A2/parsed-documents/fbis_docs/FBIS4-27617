FBIS4-27617 "dreas106_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 30 May 1994 Thailand Official Notes Impact of New GSP Program Official Notes Impact of New GSP Program BK3005101294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 30 May 94 p 23 BK3005101294 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Thailand will be affected by a 30.5 percent reduction in ceilings proposed by the United States under its Generalised System of Preferences [GSP] tariff-reduction programme. The current GSP eliminates import duties on products shipped to the United States from developing countries, up to a ceiling of $108 million a year per product. Under the new programme, the ceiling will be $75 million a year. The new GSP will be extended for 10 years from October 1, 1994 to September 30, 2004. While the initial ceiling will be $75 million based on 1995 figures, the figure will increase by $5 million a year. A Business Economics Department source said three Thai products shipped to U.S. markets in 1993 exceeded the new ceiling: automotive wiring, $116.97 million; computer equipment, $98.49 million, and microwave ovens, $77.45 milllon. The source said the one benefit to Thailand is that the new GSP programme will not link environmental concerns to qualification tariff preferences. However, the programme may be withdrawn earlier than the 2004 deadline if the World Bank identifies a recipient country as having achieved a per capita annual income of more than $7,900. The first GSP programme from 1976-84 was designed to help developing countries gain access to U.S. markets without any conditions. Under the second programme which expires at the end of September, the extension of preferences depends on the development level of exporting countries. Recipient countries are also required to open their goods and services markets to American firms, protect U.S. intellectual property rights and meet international labour-rights standards. Kanitson Nawanukhro, deputy director-general of the Business Economics Department, said a U.S. Congressional subcommittee has recommended that the new GSP programme be ready for Congress at the same time as ratification of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
