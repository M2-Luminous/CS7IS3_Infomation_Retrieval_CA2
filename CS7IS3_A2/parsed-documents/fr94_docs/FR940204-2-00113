Copies of all pertinent documents (Docket No. NRTL&hyph;2&hyph;92), are available for inspection and duplication at the Docket Office, Room N&hyph;2634, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. The address of the laboratory covered by this application is: Canadian Standards Association, Toronto Facility, 178 Rexdale Boulevard, Rexdale (Toronto), Ontario M9W1R3, Canada. Final Decision and Order Based upon the facts found as part of the Canadian Standards Association Rexdale (Toronto) facility original recognition, including details of necessary test equipment, procedures, and special apparatus or facilities needed, adequacy of the staff, the application, amendments, and documentation submitted by the applicant (see Exhibit 8. A.&hyph;D.), the OSHA staff finding including the original On-Site Review Report, as well as the evaluation of the current request (see Exhibit 8. E.), OSHA finds that the Canadian Standards Association's Rexdale (Toronto) facility has met the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.7 for expansion of its present recognition to test and certify certain equipment or materials. Pursuant to the authority in 29 CFR 1910.7, the CSA Toronto (Rexdale) facility's recognition is hereby expanded to include the five additional test standards (product categories) cited below, subject to the conditions listed below. This recognition is limited to equipment or materials which, under 29 CFR Part 1910, require testing, listing, labeling, approval, acceptance, or certification by a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory. This recognition is limited to the use of the following five additional test standards for the testing and certification of equipment or materials included within the scope of these standards. CSA has stated that these standards are used to test equipment or materials which can be used in environments under OSHA's jurisdiction, and OSHA has determined that they are appropriate within the meaning of 29 CFR 1910.7(c).

As part of this condition, CSA agrees that it will allow no representation that it is either a recognized or an accredited Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) without clearly indicating the specific equipment or material to which this recognition is tied, or that its recognition is limited to certain products; All products certified within this program shall be tested and certified only at the Rexdale facility. Products which may have been previously evaluated at any of CSA's other facilities must be re-evaluated at the Rexdale facility in order to be considered to have been approved under the NRTL program. In order to distinguish between products tested and certified by CSA under the OSHA/NRTL program at the Rexdale facility from all other CSA facilities or from non-NRTL programs, the following procedures shall be followed for all products tested and certified at the Rexdale facility under the OSHA/NRTL program: Where the CSA registered certification mark is utilized on a label on the product, the label will also bear the acronym ``NRTL''; The product shall also be clearly identified in the Directory of CSA Certified Products by using the ``NRTL'' acronym. CSA shall inform OSHA as soon as possible, in writing, of any change of ownership or key personnel, including details; CSA will continue to meet the requirements for recognition in all areas where it has been recognized; and CSA will always cooperate with OSHA to assure compliance with the letter as well as the spirit of its recognition and 29 CFR 1910.7. EFFECTIVE DATE: This recognition will become effective on February 4, 1994, and will be valid until December 24, 1997, (a period of five years from the date of the original recognition, December 24, 1992), unless terminated prior to that date, in accordance with 29 CFR 1910.7. Signed at Washington, DC, this 28th day of January, 1994. Joseph A. Dear, Assistant Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;2543 Filed 2&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;26&hyph;M
