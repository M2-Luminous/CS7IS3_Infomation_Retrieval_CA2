The navy blue seaman's cap, Zhirinovskiy's trademark, disappeared Wednesday night at a reception in the Council of Europe restaurant in honour of the assembly's new secretary general, Sweden's Daniel Tarschys. In a communique, the Russian MP denounced "the moral level of European parliamentarians," but advised the thief to wait before selling the cap. "The stock exchange quotation of my headgear will increase considerably in the near future," the communique said. Zhirinovskiy also renewed his attacks against France "where there is no democracy," and against the Council of Europe, saying he would do his utmost to prevent the admission of Russia. The Russian MP criticised the French for giving him a restricted visa limited to the city of Strasbourg and to the duration of the council's parliamentary spring session, and said he had no intention of coming back.
