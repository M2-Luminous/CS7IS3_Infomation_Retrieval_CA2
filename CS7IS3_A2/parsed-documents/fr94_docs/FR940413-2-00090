ACTION: Closure of a portion of a Commission hearing to the public. SUMMARY: Upon the request of two respondents and petitioners in the above-captioned final investigations, the Commission has unanimously determined to conduct a portion of its hearing scheduled for April 12, 1994, in camera. See Commission rules 201.13 and 201.35(b)(3) (19 CFR 201.13 and 201.35(b)(3)). The remainder of the hearing will be open to the public. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: James Lyons, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3094. Hearing impaired individuals are advised that information on this matter may be obtained by contacting the Commission's TDD terminal on (202) 205&hyph;1810. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission believes that unusual circumstances are present in these investigations so as to make it appropriate to hold a portion of the hearing in camera. This decision is made in light of the desirability of affording a full discussion at the hearing of business proprietary information (BPI) concerning (1) the condition of the domestic industry or industries; (2) confidential pricing, capacity, and capacity utilization data; and (3) confidential data regarding profitability, cost of goods sold, and sales, general and administrative expenses relating to a small number of domestic producers. In making this decision, the Commission nevertheless reaffirms its belief that whenever possible, its business should be conducted in public. Authority: The General Counsel has certified, pursuant to Commission Rule 201.39 (19 CFR 201.39) that, in her opinion, a portion of the Commission's hearing in the above-captioned investigation be closed to the public to prevent the disclosure of business proprietary information. By order of the Commission. Issued: April 7, 1994. Donna R. Koehnke, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8812 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7020&hyph;02&hyph;P
