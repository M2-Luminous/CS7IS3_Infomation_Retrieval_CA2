Two developments I found out about support this view. At a brief meeting with leaders of the provinces and municipalities yesterday [8 March] morning, General Secretary Jiang Zemin repeatedly stressed the importance today of properly handling the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform and economic development should be carried out under the precondition of stability. Meanwhile, it is necessary to develop the economy by constantly advancing reforms to bring about long-term stability. On the other hand, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee adopted a 10-character policy -- democracy, realism, unity, stability, and motivational atmosphere -- after examining a plan on the coverage of the NPC and CPPCC sessions, adding two characters for stability to last year's eight-character policy. Meanwhile, the Central Committee also called for the two democratic sessions to be permeated with an atmosphere promoting the free discussion of views. [passage omitted]
