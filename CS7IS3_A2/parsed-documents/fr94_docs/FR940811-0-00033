FR940811-0-00033 FR940811-0-00016 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 228 [FRL&hyph;5028&hyph;7] Ocean Dumping; Designation of Site AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA designates a deep ocean dredged material disposal site (SF&hyph;DODS) located off San Francisco, California, for the disposal of suitable dredged material removed from the San Francisco Bay region and other nearby harbors or dredging sites. EPA has determined that the site selected in the Final EIS as the preferred site will be the site designated as SF&hyph;DODS in this Final Rule. The center of the SF&hyph;DODS is located approximately 49 nautical miles (91 kilometers) west of the Golden Gate and occupies an area of 6.5 square nautical miles (22 square kilometers). Water depths within the area range between 8,200 to 9,840 feet (2,500 to 3,000 meters). The center coordinates of the oval-shaped site are: 37 ○39.0 ’ North latitude by 123 ○29.0 ’ West longitude (North American Datum from 1983), with length (north-south axis) and width (west-east axis) dimensions of approximately 4 nautical miles (7.5 kilometers) and 2.5 nautical miles (4.5 kilometers), respectively. This action is necessary to provide an acceptable ocean dumping site for disposal of suitable dredged material; the suitability of proposed dredged material is determined by appropriate sediment testing protocols. The designation of SF&hyph;DODS is for a period of 50 years, with an interim capacity of 6 million cubic yards of dredged material per calendar year until December 31, 1996. Site capacity following December 31, 1996 will be determined based on either a comprehensive long-term management strategy for management of dredged materials from San Francisco Bay or on a separate alternatives-based EPA evaluation of the need for ocean disposal. Disposal operations at the site will be prohibited if the site management and monitoring program is not implemented. EFFECTIVE DATE: This rule is effective September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: The supporting document for this designation is the Final Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Designation of a Deep Water Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site off San Francisco, California, August 1993, which is available for public inspection at the following locations: A.
