There were no expressions of joy over the additional step on the way to the implementation of the agreement on self-government, but people intensely followed media reports about the talks. "Until people see changes happening before their very eyes they will not believe that a new era is indeed on their doorstep," Ghassan al-Khatib, a leading member of the team conducting the peace talks, said shortly before the agreement was signed. Al-Khatib is one of a group of public figures who have been strongly criticizing the PLO leadership's decisionmaking process. Palestinians involved in the peace process have been resentful over the fact that they have not been included in the talks ever since the Declaration of Principles was signed. In view of this criticism, Faysal al-Husayni was summoned to Cairo at the last minute. Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi is not sure that the Cairo agreement constitutes a step forward. He heads the critics of the PLO leadership, and has not budged from his position that the settlements are the obstacle precluding the attainment of the main goal. "As long as the settlements remain untouched and as long as land, particularly in Jerusalem, is being confiscated to build houses I do not think we are advancing toward the goal we are seeking to reach." The aspiration for a just peace that meets the expectations of both peoples is not being realized, 'Abd-al-Shafi believes. Israel is forcing on the Palestinians all sorts of clauses and things that they should not accept. Moreover, he believes that the insistence on controlling the border crossings was unnecessary. "Let Israel go on controlling the borders. It does not matter, as long as there is a change on our side," said 'Abd-al-Shafi, alluding mainly to the settlements and what ensues from their continued existence. [passage omitted] Furayh Abu-Middayn is pleased that some progress has been made in the talks, but like many others in the Gaza Strip, is sorry that Yasir 'Arafat was forced to accept conditions and arrangements he does not like and which might cause problems in the future. "Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] is not pleased either, but he realizes that the Palestinians are the weak side because Rabin is unwilling to give in. 'Arafat hopes that a new mechanism of relations will nevertheless evolve that will enable a substantial change in the future." What worries Abu-Middayn most is the arrangement concerning the roads leading to the settlements. "The continued presence of Israeli soldiers in the area constitutes a powder keg. This friction will cause problems. We will not be able to control the extremists, and extreme soldiers may also act irresponsibly." In his opinion, an arrangement could be worked out similar to the convoys driving to Mount Scopus before 1967. "The roads could be opened to the passage of settlers two or three times a day. You need not assemble a gigantic military convoy each time they want to drive to Tel Aviv to buy a carton of milk. People in Israel apparently do not understand what this means to the Palestinians who have to be in contact with the soldiers day in and day out." The arrangement concerning Netzarim and Kfar Darom is absolutely illogical, says Abu-Middayn. "Because of 40 people, hundreds of thousands will suffer," he says. If the inhabitants of Netzarim and Kfar Darom were relocated, even to settlements in the Qatif Bloc, the Palestinians would retain territorial continuity and there would be fewer points of friction. He claims he has heard Netzarim settlers say they are willing to leave. "They will quit the moment they get compensation and, if not, they will slowly leave of their own volition," he asserted.
