In the past few days the Ukrainian authorities have carried out a series of provocative acts against facilities and servicemen of the Black Sea Fleet, which have threatened to escalate into armed clashes. On 8 April the Ukrainian authorities used armed force in an attempt to take over in the port of Odessa the Black Sea Fleet's hydrographic vessel Cheleken, which was carrying out scheduled work to service navigational equipment in the Black Sea. In order to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, the ship's commander showed the Ukrainian representatives the required ship's documents. No infringement was indentified. Nonetheless, the Ukrainian side forcefully attempted to detain the vessel and to prevent the Cheleken from entering Sevastopol. On the night of 10-11 April a unit of Ukrainian servicemen numbering up to 120 men seized by force the 318th Division of Black Sea Fleet reserve vessels, their shore base, communications unit, weapons, and property. The commanders of the division, Captain Feyoktistov and Commander Starikov, were arrested and taken in handcuffs to the commandant's office. The personnel of the shore station were immediately taken to the village of (Chubanka), 10 km from Odessa. Some of the personnel of the vessels and members of their families were kept isolated on the territory of the division's garrison. During the action the servicemen and civilians were subjected to taunts and beatings. This action by the Ukrainian authorities is a gross violation of the understandings between the president of Russia and the president of Ukraine on refraining from unilateral actions in respect of the Black Sea Fleet until the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, all agreements between Russia and Ukraine on this issue, and the flouting of the norms of international law, including human rights, are resolved. There is no doubt about the provocative nature of these actions. The government of the Russian Federation is making an emphatic protest to the government of Ukraine in connection with such actions and demands the immediate release of the Black Sea Fleet servicemen and family members, as well as immediate restoration of the status quo in respect of the fleet's installations prior to these provocative actions. It demands that an investigation be launched and all necessary measures taken against the culprits. The government of the Russian Federation stresses that Russia's course in respect of Ukraine has been and remains a course of friendship and cooperation. May I add to what has been said in the statement that what has happened in Odessa is certainly an example of crude, perhaps even shameful, methods of resolving things. All the more so since we are talking about the one Black Sea Fleet, which is under the joint command of Russia and Ukraine. The Russian side has as a matter of urgency sent Admiral Feliks Gromov and special envoy Yuriy Dubinin to Ukraine with the aim of looking into what happened on the spot, with the involvement of the Ukrainian side. A whole series of questions arises over this incident. First, why did this happen just now? Second, who stands to gain from aggravating relations and increasing suspicion between Ukraine and Russia? We are convinced of the need for a joint, constructive approach to dealing with all the issues which have arisen. This is what is demanded by the long-term interests of inter-state relations between Russia and Ukraine.
