This was reported by Foreign Minister Celso Amorim. [Begin Amorim recording] The treaty represents our total integration in a system of guarantees proscribing the use of nuclear weapons. It is a treaty that includes all of Latin America and the Caribbean. All the meaningful countries ratified it, except for Cuba, which did not sign it. However, I believe that now with this ratification by Brazil, as well as by Argentina and Chile-- which were the countries that promoted the amendments--Cuba will now sign it. With this, Latin America and the Caribbean will be an area totally free of nuclear weapons. It must be pointed out that the treaty not only entails a commitment by Latin America but by the nuclear powers as well not to use or keep nuclear weapons in Latin America. [end recording] The Tlatelolco Treaty also allows the control of nuclear installations by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
