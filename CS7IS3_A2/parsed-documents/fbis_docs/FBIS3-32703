The unexpected removal of the military officer, who by the way still had two more years to serve, caused him to ask his superiors to let him retire. They apparently had no difficulty in granting his request. Gen. Caballero has, in fact, gone home. Among the many posts occupied by Caballero were the general commander of the Caracas Military Police, chief of the National Guard Regional Command No. 5, and finally the National Guard chief of staff. Gen. Caballero is a graduate of the Armed Forces of Cooperation Officers Training School (EFOFAC) and a member of the 1966 graduating class called the Battle of the Yokes [Batalla de los Horcones]. He is considered a firm defender of the democratic system and one of the National Guardsmen who confronted the coupist intentions of those promoting the 4 February and 27 November 1992 uprisings. Names of other officers are being reviewed to occupy top positions in other forces, like the Army, Navy, and the Air Force, despite obstacles due to a lack of division generals and admirals. It was reported that President Caldera's order, made prior to yesterday's proposals of the top military command, is to completely reorganize the top cadres of the National Armed Forces before the promotion of the candidates to top posts within the armed institution. The unofficial candidates for inspector general and chiefs of staff of the respective forces, which are in the hands of Defense Minister Div. Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, are the following: In the National Guard, as is already known, its commander general is Egberto Fidel Artuza Delgado. Those who would serve with him, at least until next July, are Brig. Gen. Julio Cesar Pena Sanchez, (Inspector General), and Brig. Gen. Euro Luis Rincon Viloria, who will surely be out by July. In the Navy, Commander Gen. Vice Adm. Carlos Ramos Flores still has two more years of service to go and Rear Adm. Joel A. Rodriguez was given the post of inspector general. The post of chief of staff is reserved for the commander himself because there is apparently "no trustworthy candidate" for that post. The commander general of the Air Force is Otto Garcia Rivara. Tulio Prado Fernandez, who was formerly the Air Defense chief, is the new inspector general of the Venzuelan Air Force, and Brig. Gen. Jose Agustin Borges Blanco is the chief of staff. The latter is a strong candidate to be discharged in July. In the Army, in addition to Commander Gen. Moises Orozco Graterol, the proposal is to appoint Div. Gen. Alberto Emerich Esqueda Torres from the Security and Defense Department to the post of inspector general and Div. Gen. Nestor Lara Estrano, who is currently the director general of the Defense Ministry, to be in charge of the chief of staff temporarily. According to the new authorities in Fort Tiuna, the abrupt departure of the old top command members has really created problems, certain traumas, which can be overcome.
