Meri, denying allegations by some leading politicians, said there was no constitutional crisis in Estonia. Meri said he as the country's president had based his actions on the president's rights and responsibilities, as stipulated by the Constitution. He quoted the Constitution's Article 90, which says that no minister can be relieved of duties or appointed to office without a presidential ruling, which in turn has to be preceded by a formal proposal by the prime minister. The choice between approval or non- approval of the candidate is left with the president, Meri says in the statement. "The proposal concerning changes in the Cabinet, submitted by the prime minister on Jan. 6, was a rather large-scale one: the proposal suggested the replacement of the foreign minister, the economics, the finance minister and the defense minister; the defense minister was to replace the foreign minister, the rest of the vacant ministerial positions were to be given to three members of the parliament. The President of the Republic, taking as basis the prime minister's proposal, made a decision in a smaller scale than what was suggested. With this ruling from Jan. 7, 1994, the president didn't create a constitutional crisis. On the contrary, while making my decision I proceeded from the presidential oath: to faithfully fulfil my duties with all my abilities and to the best of my judgement for the good of the Estonian people and the Republic," the president said. Meri said he had talked with Prime Minister Mart Laar about the possibilities to more effectively organize the state leadership work already in September. The prime minister then had considered it unnecessary to make changes in the Cabinet. "The outcome of the local elections, which were held after that, showed that power relations between the political forces in Estonia had changed during the year. The prime minister made his conclusions and decided on Cabinet changes, for which purpose he started to resolve the crisis emerged in the Pro Patria (party). International developments went their own way, which was not quite favorable for Estonia. Therefore I suggested to the prime minister and the foreign minister on Dec. 22 to postpone making changes in the Cabinet until late February, so that we could realistically take into account the new power relations in Europe. /--/ These arguments, which directly concern Estonia's security policy, were not taken into account and the proposed Cabinet changes regrettably have coincided with crucial foreign political events," the president's statement reads. Meri says no concrete shortcomings were pointed at in the work of Economics Minister Toomas Sildmae. He says Sildmae also enjoys the trust of many Cabinet members. The president says he has met Heiki Kranich, candidate for the post of the finance minister, only twice so far, and economics minister nominee Toivo Jurgenson, only once. "Under such circumstances it would have been irresponsible of me to approve the candidates. I once more say: I have sworn to the State Assembly and to the people to fulfil my duties to the best of my judgement. Therefore please allow me to once again emphasize that in a democratic practice of state leadership the advisability of decisions by the head of the government has to be clear to the Estonian citizens, the State Assembly and the president," Meri says. The president said he had made a decision to some extent different from what had been suggested, thus giving the prime minister the opportunity to once again and with full seriousness wage giving or not giving the control levers of the country's economy into the hands of the best experts. "I regret that the government has interpreted my position from a one-sided point of view and presented the problem in a different light, in order to exert pressure on me by referring to a constitutional crisis. I am particularly worried by the time-point. At present we should concentrate our forces on the most critical section of the front -- on the foreign policy, on ensuring Estonia's security. The head of the government has chosen the wrong time and the wrong way," the president says.
