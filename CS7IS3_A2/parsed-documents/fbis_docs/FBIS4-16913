Nothing, Actually"] [Text] On the evening of 15 April the presidents of Russia and Ukraine signed an agreement on a phased settlement of Black Sea Fleet problems. Moscow's and Kiev's subsequent "explanations," however, suggest that Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk not only spoke different languages but also signed something quite different. The agreement has left more questions than answers. For instance, the decision to divide the basing of the Ukrainian Navy and the Black Sea Fleet does not even approximately define the location of Russia's naval base in Ukraine. Kiev maintains that this is a subject of future negotiations. The statement by Ukraine Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk that the base may be leased to Russia to a term of up to five years appears puzzling. There is no answer to the logical question: What next? The fleet's redeployment to bases in the Pacific or the Arctic Ocean, or its sinking, the third in its history? Kravchuk's "promising" judgment about the need for the Ukrainian parliament to ratify the leasing agreement renders any accords senseless. The deputies will "sink" them anyway. Kravchuk assures that he and Yeltsin have "defined the parameters and percentage ratio of the Black Sea Fleet division" and that all that remains to be done is to work out mechanisms to implement the accords. Yeltsin's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov is somewhat more specific on this question: According to him, Kiev is to have 15 to 20 percent of the Black Sea Fleet. The Ukrainian side has its own interpretation of the accords: According to Ukraine Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy, the Black Sea Fleet is to be split in half, and from its half Ukraine will sell Russia the 30 to 35 percent it does not need. Which is not at all identical to what Moscow understands as a "percentage ratio:" Pavel Grachev completely rejects his Ukrainian counterpart's approach. Now Kostikov has not only accused Kiev of a "unilateral interpretation" but also recalled that in talking about such a "nationally sacred thing" as the Black Sea Fleet, there is no room for bargaining. The presidents have given their governments 10 days to finalize the division agreement. During this time the Black Sea Fleet is to be fully inventoried. And this involves 390 battleships and a still unknown number of coastal installations, from Izmamil to Kerch. Yet it appears that even these "10 days" are understood differently in Moscow and in Kiev. Kravchuk links coordination of the Black Sea Fleet division not with a term of 10 days but with "a full-scale treaty on friendship and cooperation." This will take two to three months at the very least. Furthermore, coordination of "friendship" conditions is likely to proceed in a strained situation. Kravchuk makes no secret of his discontent with Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin. According to Leonid Makarovich, he is ready to recall his signature under his appointment and will do so if "the negotiating process drags out." He does not specify the meaning of "dragging out." Admiral Aleksey Kalinin, former Black Sea Fleet commander, who is not bound by diplomatic etiquette, assessed the agreement as "a palliative option, preserving tension in the south of Ukraine and in Crimea" and beneficial to Kravchuk. Judging by first reactions from Black Sea Fleet representatives (in conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondents), there is a restrained attitude to the "strange agreement" in the fleet, and no one there believes in the success of negotiations between Moscow and Kiev officials. The impression is that many Black Sea Fleet servicemen today are inclined to cut the "Gordian marine knot" military-style. That is to say, on the spur of the moment [splecha].
