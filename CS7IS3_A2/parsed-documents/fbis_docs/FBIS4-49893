The island is being imported for the Ezhou Power Station, 30 km east of Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province. The power station, composed of two sets of turbogenerators with a capacity of 300,000 kilowatts each, is the first thermal power plant built with part of the third batch of loans from the Japanese Government. The station is made up of a boiler island, turbine island and a electrical equipment island. Last March, CNTIC signed contracts with Japan's Itochu Corporation and ABB Ltd. to import a turbine island and an electrical equipment island worth 130 million U.S. dollars. Last year, the Foster Wheeler Energy Company exported a boiler island to Zouxian Power Station in east China's Shandong Province. The construction of the Ezhou Power Station will help ease electricity shortages in Hubei Province, CNTIC sources said.
