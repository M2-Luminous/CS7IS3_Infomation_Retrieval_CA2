Listen to Francois Reichmans's report from Kigali. He is a colleague with Belgian Radio-Television: [Reichmans] The vehicles of humanitarian organizations can be seen in the Rwandan capital, as well as the jeeps and the light armored vehicles of UN soldiers. There are night patrols, a curfew is in force, the town is anxious. Weapons and grenades are changing hands. Districts have set up militias armed with bows and arrows, as well as bludgeons. There will soon be 2,500 UN soldiers in Rwanda, including 450 Belgians who have already been here for four months. The UN mission in Rwanda [MINUAR] is an operation aiming at maintaining peace. The UN soldiers have been deployed to contribute to the implementation of the Arusha peace accords. Things are now at a total standstill: There is still no parliament and no broad-based government, but a political vacuum and rumors that the war has resumed. The UN representative in Rwanda, Cameroonian Jacques-Rene Booh-Booh, issued another warning on Friday: The UN soldiers may leave: [Booh-Booh] I would like to remind you that the MINUAR is saying quite simply that the economic and social situation in the country is worsening; that famine is killing large numbers of people; that insecurity is taking a firm hold; and that at the end of the day, the signatory countries of the Arusha peace accord have not yet honored their commitments. The peace process is at a standstill. The specter of a new war is persisting. I would like you to remember that the MINUAR can only enjoy continuing support if parties implement quickly all the Arusha peace accords. On 4 or 5 April, if there has not been substantial progress in the implementation of the Arusha peace accord, we may not continue our activities. This was said on several occasions by the Security Council and, only recently, by the Security Council chairman. [Reichmans] The outgoing Rwandan prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyamana, came from the main opposition party, the Republican Democratic Movement [MDR]. Her successor has already been appointed, but he has not yet taken up office. The Rwandan prime minister has denounced the paralysis, while the situation in the country is worrying: [Uwiliniyamana] We have security problems. Almost every day, people are killed, whether they are poor peasants or political leaders. Famine is raging in the country. In almost every part of our country, people die of hunger every day. People die of diseases such as dysentery and malaria. You see, we do not have institutions capable of negotiating with our donors, our backers, in order to solve these problems. The Rwandan people want peace. They can no longer bear waiting for the institutions to be set up. The Rwandan people believe that this is their only salvation. The setting up of the broad-based transitional government means the end of the war, it means peace. [Reichmans] Rwanda is stifling under the weight of refugees. Those from the north, after the war; those from the south, those from Burundi, who came in October. People were traumatized by the coup and the massacres in Burundi, the sister country. Two officials of political parties were assassinated a fortnight ago, and this caused concern. Several attempts to mend the accords turned out to be a failure. Political maneuvers led to radicalization on both sides. The political center has been weakened. The Rwandan prime minister has condemned President Habyarimana's division tactics: [Uwilingiyamana] Some political leaders are showing a lack of goodwill, irresponsibility even. We have my own political party, the MDR, and the Liberal Party. In both parties, there have been different tendencies, but at some stage, the president started supporting one of the tendencies in his party. Division, confusion within both parties has prevented the establishment of the institutions. I believe that ethnic differences were used. This is more obvious as far as the Liberal Party is concerned: They believe that there is a Tutsi faction and a Hutu faction. The Rwandan people are not ready to give themselves over to this extremism. Extremists will always be wrong, whatever their ethnic origins.
