Ukraine thereby became the first CIS state to initial this document with the EU. What we have managed to do so far, said Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Danilovich Makarenko after returning from Brussels, even according to their estimates, represents a revolutionary breakthrough. The point is that formally this is an agreement "On Partnership and Cooperation With the EU," while in essence this is an agreement on associate membership in the EU. Similar agreements have been signed with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The difference between our agreement and their's is that their negotiations on setting up a free-trade zone with the EU will be finished in eight years, while similar negotiations with Ukraine will begin on 31 December 1998. Nevertheless, according to Oleksandr Danilovich, all quantitative and qualitative restrictions on trade between Ukraine and the EU have been lifted. Though there are some exceptions on a group of goods including textiles, metals, and nuclear material. These restrictions will be valid until 31 December 1998, and they will later be rescinded. It is up to us how far we should be able to move forward in signing separate accords. Negotiations on agreements for textiles and metals are approaching their conclusion, and we believe that we will conclude them in the immediate future. [Mostovaya] However, Oleksandr Danilovich, the export of metals is of a priority for Ukraine.... [Makarenko] You are right. However, Europe has never been a priority market for selling our metal. There are other markets in the world, and they are rather vast. I refer of course to the states of Southeast Asia, where we could export 3-4 million tonnes of steel a year. [end Makarenko] Next, Oleksandr Danilovich said that the document was initialed after four rounds of talks, the first of which was held in March of last year and the last one -- in March of this year. Russia has already held eight rounds of talks, but the text of the agreement is not yet ready. At the same time, we have managed to enlarge the scope of our mandate. Moreover, the preamble states that the EU supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine because this will promote stability in both Central and East Europe, and on the continent in general. This represents very valuable and timely political support from the states of West Europe. By the way, the clause on political consultations between the EU and Ukraine has been considerably expanded. All disagreements over mutual cooperation in transportation and sea navigation have been surmounted. It is impossible to overestimate the importance of initialing this document, said O. Makarenko. We managed to refute the viewpoint of those who were skeptical about cooperation with the EU, as well as Europe's interest in cooperating with us. We have many such people, including those at the top. The fact that this agreement was initialed in its present form gives us the answer to the question: Where should Ukraine move? Toward our past in the East, or our future in the West? We are facing a choice: Either to speed up reforms and take advantage of the West's proposal, which opened its doors to us, or forget about this agreement, put it aside, face the East and move eastward. In my opinion, there are strategical and tactical issues that cannot be confused. From a strategical point of view, Ukraine is by all means a European state. Therefore, according to the Rome Declaration, it has every reason to unite with free and democratic Europe. We understand that this is a lengthy and difficult path, but we have to do it. When Franco died in Spain, nobody thought that Spain would ever become an EU member.... From the viewpoint of tactics and the survival of our state, we should restore economic relations with Russia. However, our goal should be staunch. [Mostovaya] Do you think that Ukraine -- stemming from tactical considerations -- should sign the CIS economic pact? [Makarenko] I participated in every round of negotiations on this issue. The Foreign Ministry and I are convinced that Ukraine should become an associate CIS member, because full membership would delay our EU membership. [Mostovaya] Well, in general, can Russia let Ukraine out of its sphere of influence? [Makarenko] Everything depends on how strong willed we are, on how a new government will be committed to our sovereignty and independence. We should think about this already today, on the eve of Supreme Council elections, because a voter should decide with what he is concerned: Either go forward toward Europe or backward toward the empire.
