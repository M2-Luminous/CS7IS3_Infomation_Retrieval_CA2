The device standing on it is scarcely larger than a packet of cigarettes, but all attention is focused on it. The lack of a cover reveals an 8-mm-format video cassette. The electronics surrounding it would seem bare to anyone who has ever taken apart a home video recorder. Behind the plinth is a television. A man in a white coat standing in front of it operates the remote control. The screen shows successive clips of a Brazilian sitcom, the latest UB40 video, a cartoon, etc. At first glance, this is nothing extraordinary. Closer examination reveals, however, that the television is not plugged into any antenna, satellite dish, or cable network. The only wire coming out of the set runs into the curious device on show on its silver plinth. The engineer is flicking channels...on a video tape. This kind of luxury may appear banal to blase consumers, but it is a real technological miracle. The device, a high-density video player and recorder, is capable of storing -- on the smallest video cassette on the market, the Hi8 -- as much data as can be contained on 50,000 computer diskettes, 200 compact disks, or a semitrailer crammed with encyclopedias. The small marvel can also read one or more channels and simultaneously record about 10 others. Great, I will have one, you might say. Not so fast. The product is still kept under lock and key in Thomson CSF's Central Research Laboratory (LCR). Located in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, between the Chevreuse and Bievre valleys, the world detection specialist's research and development sector employs 330 people. Everyday work here includes logical constraint programming, the study of submicron structures, and the design of millimetric transistors. Video cassette channel hopping was designed by the Magnetism Group, one of the laboratory's seven branches. Normally, this team works on applications closer to Thomson CSF's main sectors of activity, such as high-temperature superconductors, one of the most promising electromagnetic detection technologies. Research sometimes finds openings on the consumer electronics market. Thanks to the Magnetism Group, Thomson already receives royalties each time a CD player is sold somewhere. This is because the two inventors of the compact disk, Philips and Sony, used some Thomson patents in the laser read head. The new video recorder falls into much the same mold. It is of interest to all sectors that need small-size mass memory storage devices, whether for the on-board electronics of a fighter plane or the space shuttle, in a desktop computer, or simply in the home. Indeed, ordinary TV lies at the root of the research project, with much speculation surrounding its future. In the hubbub of possibilities for the future, one thing is certain: Consumers always want more TV programs. Another certainty is that TV of tomorrow (or the day after tomorrow) will be digital. Video signals will be recorded, carried, and read as data bits, with sound and picture converted into huge packets of noughts and ones. In this way, picture quality should be improved and its format enlarged. All this assumes that giant storage media are required to store the mass of data contained in a film, for example. A three-hour, high-definition, wide-screen feature film requires 10 to the power of 12 bits (one terabit). To fit this 1 terabit of data onto a small, already-marketed storage medium was the challenge taken up by the Thomson CSF researchers. They selected the Hi8 video cassette. Jean-Paul Castera, manager of LCR's Magnetism Group stated: "We are convinced that the future does not belong to optical film, whose recording capacity is limited by the laser wavelengths, but to magnetic tape." Conventional video systems use recording heads attached to the periphery of a drum that revolves at high speed. This enables the data to be recorded on thin tracks laid out across the tape, and the relative speed between the head and the tape to be increased. Both aspects have considerably increased the recording capacity of video tape. In VHS, the track is 49 microns wide and the drum speed is 4.8 m/s [meters per second]. With the Hi8 system, the track width has been reduced to 18 microns for a speed of about 3 m/s. However, with drum-based technologies, even if the track width were reduced to 5 microns, high-definition recordings would still require speeds in excess of 30 m/s. To follow such a thin magnetic track at a cruising speed of 108 km/h [kilometers per hour] would require extremely precise and difficult-to-manufacture mechanics (drum and loading system). Jean-Paul Castera stressed: "Not only does the revolving drum pose a big headache at very high speeds, but it also generates major maintenance and vibration resistance problems for the on-board electronics." His team quickly fell back on a fixed head system, as used in tape recorders. This choice meant that a number of other decisions also had to be made. Whereas conventional video recorders use a single drum to read from and write to a tape, LCR separated these two functions. The high-density device has two heads, one for recording and one for playback. Splitting these two tasks had two advantages. The first is of particular interest to film professionals who are today forced, once footage has been shot, to rewind the tape and play it back to check on the quality of the recording. With the Thomson system, the cameraman can check the recording "live." The second advantage is that a different technology can be used for each of the two functions. This is the aspect that researchers hastened to make use of. While the principle is simple, it nonetheless took LCR three years to manufacture the matrix head. Recording so many gaps [preceding word in English] on such a small area is really quite an exploit. The result is there for all to see, however: LCR researchers have fitted 384 gaps in an area 8 millimeters wide and just a little longer, each one of which writes a track 18 microns wide. Now the new model, designed for VHS-type tape, is capable of recording 1,000 tracks 10 micron wide. This is enough to give a data transfer rate of 500 megabits per second, whereas the existing digital TV standard, MPEG [Moving Picture Expert Group], requires a throughput of 1.5 megabits per second. From a recording point of view, that is enough to store 333 films on one VHS videotape. That is not all. It is not enough to simply record -- the new system has to maintain the rate during playback. To meet this second challenge, the Thomson researchers invented a device that combined optical and magnetic modes. Jean-Paul Castera revealed: "Actually, we were lucky enough to find two conventional microelectronic components that corresponded exactly to what we were looking for: The laser diode and the charge coupled device (CCD). The former is widely used in compact disk drives and the latter is used in camcorders." By combining these modestly priced and now common-technology components, the LCR team reached its goal of storing on one of today's conventional video cassettes a data transfer rate suitable for use with the television of tomorrow. In 1989, a demonstration device was presented at the Geneva physics fair. With electronics reduced for budgetary reasons to one-third of the capacity of the heads, it was already capable of recording three TV channels in a digital format on a Hi8 cassette. With the new 1,000-track matrix head, this prototype is already something of an ancestor. This could be the start of a beautiful story. However, while the LCR researchers continue with their work, marketing constraints give them little hope of gaining their reward. While recognizing the merits of the high-speed device, Thomson's consumer electronics branch believes it to be a professional "niche" product (detection, aviation, electronic document management, etc.), rather than one destined for the vast home video market. The arguments put forward are that the system is not yet completely ready, optical memory has yet to show all its potential, and, above all, the standards set for the end of the nineties will very probably be for rotating head technology. Forty million VHS machines are sold in the world each year. In this context it is difficult to impose a standard which, even if it uses the storage media available on the market, is not compatible with any other existing equipment. Moreover, Japanese researchers have not given up trying to improve the data transfer rate of VHS and other Hi8's. All this explains why Thomson Consumer Electronics is taking a cautious stance, although it continues to finance part of Jean-Paul Castera's work. It is also true what they say about once bitten, twice shy. The European electronics industry has just come out of a bruising encounter with high-definition television [HDTV], and certainly does not want a repeat of the D2Mac [European transitional analog HDTV standard] syndrome. The little technological miracle risks spending a long time confined to those confidential places like the central computing system of an aircraft, a submarine, or the space shuttle. Patience is required. How It Works Matrix Writing The gaps are laid out in a grid like the pixels of a CCD. To eliminate parasitic interference from neighboring points, the data comes from two sources. The current passed through air gap is the sum of the current coming down a column and the current coming along a row. The magnetic field generated by a gap is the sum of fields generated by these two currents. The field then writes a data bit if its value is greater than the minimum recording threshold for the tape. The trick lies in setting the two currents to values separately less than this threshold but whose sum exceeds it. Thus they leave no parasitic trace on the neighboring heads when their sums record the piece of data on the required place on the gap. This is the principle of "multiplexed addressing." Read Process The CCD consists of a grid of thousands of small pixels. These pixels convert light into electricity. A device regularly collects the electrical signals coming from each pixel. The optical image is in this way converted into an electrical signal. To adapt this technique to magnetic reading, Thomson made use of the Kerr effect. Take laser light, for instance. It is polarized, meaning that all the vibrations making it up are synchronized and are moving in the same direction, unlike sunlight. This is a bit like the difference between a well-aligned battalion of soldiers marching in step and the chaotic movement of the crowd in the subway. When laser light is reflected off the tape through a Kerr effect transducer, the polarization of the rays changes depending on the magnetic orientation written onto each point on the tape. The soldiers are still marching in step and in line, but some are leaning forward and others are leaning back. Then all that remains is to send the laser beam back to the CCD sensor by placing a polarizing filter in its path. The battalion's final destination is a large grid where each soldier has his precisely assigned position -- but the ones that are leaning backward are intercepted and sent down a hole. As a result, the grid is an image of the magnetic signals recorded on the tape. The operation is repeated several tens of times per second. Once they have been decoded these signals represent images and sounds.
