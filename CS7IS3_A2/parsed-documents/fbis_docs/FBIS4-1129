We approached him for his response to this development: [Ramodike] The leader of COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], Mr. Sam Shilowa, approached me over the weekend and we had a private talk at the ranch hotel, and he requested me to withdraw from the national list of the African National Congress because the ANC regional executive council under the chairmanship of the premier candidate of the African National Congress, Mr. Ngoako Ramatlhodi, said their followers are not satisfied that my name is placed on the national list. He accused me of having allowed my colleague, Mr. Lawrence Mokhudu Ledwaba, to register United People's Front [UPF] for election purposes. I explained that it is my profound policy, and it is on the other hand a democratic right for each and every person, each and every political party, to take part in the elections. [Correspondent Angie Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, but at this stage, you are apparently going to be taken off the list. What are your plans now? [Ramodike] Well, my party, the United People's Front, has already demanded that I should come back and we forge ahead together for campaigns in the Northern Tranvaal region. [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, I take it then that you intend returning to the UPF? [Ramodike] Well, that is a demand and the request by our political organization, that if the ANC followers in the Northern Transvaal are not satisfied with me for problems that are here in the Northern Transvaal, especially administrative problems, then they are welcoming me back to United People's Front. [Diedrichs] Mr. Ramodike, looking at administrative problems, the TEC also announced today that it was going to appoint two executive directors to govern Lebowa before and during the elections. What are your reactions to that? [Ramodike] I rejoice; the people of Lebowa rejoice. The cabinet of Lebowa welcome the decision taken by the TEC upon our request, and we indeed feel very much gratified that Mr. Fourie should pull out of Lebowa and in his place, or in the place of task teams, the executive directors be appointed.
