According to the plan, Tianjin Municipal Government will concentrate on the construction of ten commercial streets, 18 shopping centers, five large department stores and six wholesale markets, which are expected to extend for a dozen kilometers. According to a municipal official, a number of foreign investors have shown keen interest in investing in such construction. Shopping facilities with two million square meters in total floor space like the Huaxing Shopping Building, Fuyu Plaza and Olympic Building are being built with overseas investment. Tianjin's large-scale construction of shopping facilities has offered an excellent opportunity for foreign investment, said an official from the Municipal Planning Bureau. He said Tianjin has a number of golden shopping areas which remain undeveloped. Tianjin has stipulated a series of preferential policies for foreign investment to develop these areas, he said.
