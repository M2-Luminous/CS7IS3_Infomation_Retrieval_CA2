FR940628-1-00039 FR940628-1-00007 The SIP revision must demonstrate that the performance standard in either 40 CFR 53.351 or 51.352 will be met using an evaluation date (rounded to the nearest January for carbon monoxide and July for hydrocarbons) seven years after the trigger date. Emission standards for vehicles subject to an IM240 test may be phased in during the program but full standards must be in effect for at least one complete test cycle before the end of the five year period. All other requirements shall take effect within 24 months of the trigger date. Furthermore, a state may not discontinue implementation of an I/M program until the redesignation request and maintenance plan (that does not rely on reductions from I/M) are finally approved. If the redesignation request is approved, any sanctions already imposed, or any sanctions clock already triggered, would be terminated. There are four possible scenarios under which an area might present a redesignation request. 1. Areas Without Operating I/M Programs_Section 182(b)(4) of the Act expanded the requirement for submission of a schedule for a basic I/M program to all moderate ozone nonattainment areas. As a result, about 25 new cities were affected by the I/M requirement. Since passage of the Act however, some of these areas have experienced no violation of the standard and are in a position to submit a request to redesignate. Some of these areas may be able to demonstrate maintenance of the standards without implementation of an I/M program. The proposed changes to Subpart S would allow a state to avoid having to prepare a detailed I/M plan and adopt regulations at this time. EPA would require a detailed implementation plan and regulations would be required by EPA to be submitted and incorporated into the previous SIP within 12 months and implemented within 24 months from the triggering event as specified by the State. Section 175A(d) requires that each maintenance plan revision contain contingency provisions necessary to assure that the State will ``promptly correct'' any violation of the standard which occurs after the redesignation of an area to attainment. Given the time needed for states to submit and incorporate these measures into the previous SIP and then implement them, EPA believes that these 12 and 24 month time periods are the minimum amount of time in which states can ``promptly correct'' the violation which triggered the contingency measure. These time periods are based on EPA's interpretation of a reasonable amount of time to allow the State to submit and implement a new SIP after the triggering event. 2. Basic areas With Operating I/M Programs_Continued Operation Without Upgrades. Section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act requires EPA to ``review, revise, update, and republish'' I/M guidance. EPA did so on November 5, 1992 (as reflected in subpart S) and established new requirements for basic and enhanced I/M programs. These regulations require improved administration of the I/M program in a variety of ways and to meet the performance standard established for basic programs. Some of these areas may be in a position to redesignate to attainment based on a maintenance plan which does not implement these upgrades. EPA believes that its broad authority under section 182(a)(2)(B)(ii) of the Act to revise the guidance for basic I/M areas allows it to structure subpart S such that a redesignation request could be approved for such areas that continue to operate I/M programs provided that the state has the legal authority and regulations necessary to make the upgrade, and submits as a contingency measure a commitment to implement the upgrade in the event of a violation, according to an enforceable schedule, including milestones. The maintenance plan could not, however, claim the full credit provided by the MOBILE model unless the upgrade was implemented. The purpose of the upgrade is to ensure that the emission reduction benefits projected by the MOBILE model are in fact achieved in practice. The MOBILE model is used to determine emission level targets and whether the local I/M program design meets the performance standard as described in 40 CFR 51.351 or 51.352 of subpart S. Areas which continue operation of I/M programs as part of their maintenance plan without an implemented upgrade shall be assumed to be 80% as effective as an implemented upgraded version of the same I/M program design, unless a state can demonstrate using operating information that the I/M program alone is more effective than the implemented upgraded version. The 80% benefit assumption is based on a 20% discount for the lack of administrative requirements, especially quality assurance and quality control, not modeling factors. The model does not include inputs for quality control and quality assurance.
