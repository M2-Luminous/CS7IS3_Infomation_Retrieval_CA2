FR940524-0-00010 FR940524-0-00005 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Care Financing Administration 42 CFR Part 424 [BPD&hyph;610&hyph;CN] RIN 0938&hyph;AEO6 Medicare Program; Diagnosis Codes on Physician Bills; Correction AGENCY: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), HHS. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: In the March 4, 1994, issue of the Federal Register (FR Doc. 94&hyph;4900) (59 FR 10290), we implemented certain provisions of section 1842(p) of the Social Security Act, which require that each bill or request for payment for a service furnished by a physician under Medicare Part B include appropriate diagnostic coding for the diagnosis or the symptoms of the illness or injury for which the Medicare beneficiary received care. This notice corrects an error made in that document. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pat Brooks, R.R.A. (410) 966&hyph;5318. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the March 4, 1994 final rule, we inadvertently failed to revise the regulations text to remove a parenthetical reference to bills for ambulance services. The requirement for diagnostic coding does not apply to bills for ambulance services. Therefore, we are making the following correction to the March 4, 1994 final rule: ยง424.34 [Corrected] On page 10299, in the first column, in ยง424.34(b)(4), the last sentence of the paragraph, ``(For example, a bill for ambulance service must specify the pick-up and delivery points.)'', is removed.
