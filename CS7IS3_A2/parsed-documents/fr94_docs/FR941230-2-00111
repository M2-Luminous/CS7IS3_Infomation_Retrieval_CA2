FR941230-2-00111 FR941230-2-00066 [Release No. 34&hyph;35144; File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;29] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Relating to Amendment of its Minor Rule Plan and Recommended Fine Schedule With Respect to Options Floor Decorum and Other Minor Trading Rule Violations December 23, 1994. I. Introduction On October 14, 1994, the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend PSE Rule 10.13(h) of its Minor Rule Plan (``MRP''): Options Floor Decorum and Other Minor Trading Rule Violations, and to revise its Recommended Fine Schedule relating to Options Floor Decorum and Minor Trading Rule Violations. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 Rule 19d&hyph;1(c)(2) under the Act, 17 CFR 240.19d&hyph;1(c)(2), authorizes national securities exchanges to adopt minor rule violation plans for the summary discipline and abbreviated reporting of minor rule violations by exchange members and member organizations. The Exchange's MRP initially was approved by the Commission in 1985. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22654 (November 21, 1985), 50 FR 48853. The proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register on November 14, 1994. 4 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34944 (November 4, 1994), 59 FR 56563. II. Description of the Proposal The Exchange's proposal effects three changes to the MRP. First, references in Rules 10.13(h)(10) and (11) to ``ten-up'' and ``Ten-Up Rule'' are eliminated because such references no longer are applicable in light of two recently approved rule changes. 5 Second, the proposal adds a reference to the MRP that addresses violations of Rule 6.82(c)(2), which requires Lead Market Makers to honor their guaranteed markets. The Exchange believes that violations of Rule 6.82(c)(2) already are provided for in the MRP by cross-reference, and this change merely serves to eliminate any ambiguity. Third, the proposal amends the MRP to add a reference to new Rule 6.66(c), which provides for the identification of broker-dealer orders on the Options Floor. 6 The Exchange believes that such a disclosure requirement is similar to that of Rule 6.86, also referred to in the MRP. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34891 (October 25, 1994), 59 FR 54653 (approving 20-up rule); and 34946 (November 7, 1994), 59 FR 59265 (expanding Auto-Ex system capacity to 20 contracts). 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34426 (July 21, 1994), 59 FR 38497 (approving Rule 6.66(c)). The Exchange's proposal also increases the recommended fines found in the Recommended Fine Schedule for Option Floor Decorum and Minor Trading Rule Violations. 7 These infractions currently are listed in the Exchange's MRP, codified as PSE Rule 10.13. Specifically, the Exchange proposes to increase the recommended fines for the violations specified in the following rules: 10.13(h)(2)_(4), (h)(7)_(9), (h)(11), (h)(13)_(23), and (h)(26). 8 The Commission has previously approved these rules for inclusion in the MRP. 9 7 PSE Rule 10.13(f) states that the Exchange shall maintain a Recommended Fine Schedule setting forth the recommended fines for each rule listed in the MRP, and that any changes to the Recommended Fine Schedule shall be subject to the approval of the Commission. 8 These rules denote the following Exchange Rule violations with respect to options trading: failing to properly record the time of receipt, change in limit, or increase in size of an order [(h)(2)]; improper execution of a cross transaction [(h)(3)]; violation of procedures concerning a Market Maker's use of a Floor Broker to effect transactions [(h)(4)]; failure to give up the name of a clearing member by public outcry when requesting a quote and size of the market or after effecting a trade [(h)(7)]; inadvertently placing a non-public order in the book [(h)(8)]; failing to remain for a specified amount of time after trade processing [(h)(9)]; failure to honor a guaranteed market [(h)(10)]; failure to identify an order as for a broker-dealer [(h)[11)]; improper communication by use of hand signals or other means or devices [(h)(12)]; improper vocalization of a trade [(h)(13)]' violating a standard of conduct or dress [(h)(14)]; disruptive action [(h)(15)]; disruptive action involving physical contact [(h)(16)]; failing to act in a professional manner [(h)(17)]; use of abusive language [(h)(18)]; time stamping [(h)(19)]; position and exercise limit violations [(h)(20)&hyph;(21)]; acting as both Floor Broker and Market Maker and trading in excess of 100 contracts per month as a Market Maker [(h)(22)]; failing to request a market to be removed from the screen when leaving a trading crowd [(h)(23)]; and unauthorized use of telephones in trading post areas [(h)(26)]. 9 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 22654 (November 21, 1985), 50 FR 48853; 32510 (June 24, 1993), 58 FR 35491; and 34322 (July 6, 1994), 59 FR 35958.
