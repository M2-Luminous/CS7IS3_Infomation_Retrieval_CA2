The targets of the survey were either heads of households or the persons who decide family economic behavior, and among them 67.6 percent had a junior middle school education or higher. The results of the final collection and summing up reflected the typical attitudes and real opinions of these peasant households after they first entered the market. When asked for their attitude to the putting into practice of the market economy in the rural areas, 67.8 percent of the peasants approved, but 35 percent took an indifferent attitude, the main reason being because they didn't know what the market economy was and also did not know, in the final analysis, what economic system would be most advantageous for them; 34 percent of the peasants thought that it was a matter of indifference whether or not contract orders were placed for grain, cotton, and edible oil, because contracts only had a binding force on the peasants; 26.1 percent of the peasants thought that it was a matter of indifference whether or not the purchasing prices of grain, cotton, and edible oil were released or not, because the existing market prices are very little different from the state's fixed purchasing prices, and in any case both are fairly low. With regard to the main ways that peasants now get information on production and management, the survey (multiple choice) showed: In first place was television (74.3 percent), next came radio (60.7 percent), and in third place was information passed on by relatives and friends (38.4 percent); the rest in descending order were newspapers (27.7 percent), rumors (21.9 percent), wired broadcasting (20.7 percent), meetings (11.5 percent), and local information service organizations accounted for only 3.6 percent. This year was the first one in which Henan Province completely abolished the command-type planting plan, so on what arrangements for production did the peasants depend? In the course of the survey, 29 percent of the peasants estimated what agricultural products after being harvested would sell well and then, reckoning up the prices, planted them; 28 percent of the peasants arranged their planting according to the market quotations before sowing and the market quotations in the previous year; 20.5 percent of the peasants planted by habit; 19.1 percent of the peasants followed the mainstream by planting what they saw other peasants planting; and only 2.3 percent of the peasants planted in accordance with the contracts they had signed with the relevant departments. Among the "vexations" reported by the surveyed peasants in chief place was that there were many witholdings and apportionments, which made their burdens heavy and hard to bear (81.8 percent); next was that the agricultural funds market was disorderly, with false goods being sold and prices being raised arbitrarily (80 percent); in third place was that public order was bad (68.1 percent); in fourth place was a lack of information, with the peasants not knowing what to plant and what to do to make money (65.9 percent); and in fifth place was that it was thought that rural cadres took wages and subsidies, but provided the peasansts with few services (50.5 percent). With regard to the peasants' expectations for government, the survey results showed that 90.1 percent of the peasants strongly demanded that the government crack down severely on enterprises and individuals that manufacture and sell fake, false, bogus, or inferior pesticides and chemical fertilizers; 80.2 percent of the peasants hoped for stable policy that would let the peasants "take a pill that sets the mind at ease"; 66.7 percent of the peasants hoped that technicians would be enlisted to go into the countryside and popularize advanced techniques in agricultural production; 56 percent of the peasants hoped that there would be a severe crackdown on crime and that public order would be maintained in the rural areas; and 49.9 percent of the peasants hoped that a feasible measure would be formulated to prevent bedrock low prices from harming the peasants and soaring agricultural funds from harming agiculture.
