He laments the abject decline of the British media, registers injury to his own interests, sympathy for the innocent bystander -- Malaysia, and the sinking feeling that a lot of hard work has been blown away by the grubby scandalmongers of the British press. It is the conduct and content of the painstaking effort at repairing economic relations with Malaysia that has been impugned and now stands poised to come to nought. The British businessman knows this better than any other and has the biggest cause for regret. Right through the 1980s and particularly following the Buy British Last policy, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher headed a diplomatic onslaught at the highest levels -- including frequent meetings with Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed -- to rebuild and restore Britain's commercial esteem in this country. She had a big job in her hands -- not only were British interests in the rear of a superior queue of foreign investment, they were also, as part of Britain's waning industrial efficiency overall, severely handicapped in their competitive ability. She had also been rather desperate -- her country was in recession and unemployment was growing. It was then that, while chasing a considerable defence deal with Kuala Lumpur aid and arms sales "became incorrectly entangled for a few months in 1988". This lapse, according to British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd testifying in parliament last Wednesday, was hastily corrected afterwards, and the whole package eventually went through. Malaysia, as fastidious customer, made its choice after intense lobbying and considerable "sweetening", including tie-up's as well as cheap credits and aid, swung its appraisal in favour of British products. Such government-to-government dealmaking goes on worldwide and, in democratic countries, is accountable in parliament. At no time were individual Malaysian decisionmakers greased over the composition of the eventual contracts and supply package -- that was left to the wisdom of the British Government, and its enthusiasm to help its own industries. Aid-donating countries, including Britain, have been in the habit of "tying" aid-for-trade deals for years, often diluting the benefit of the aid to the recipient country. That Whitehall had fixed things in order to put together a winnable tender bid ought not to have been so grudgingly divulged upon inquiry as to whet the appetite of a vulturous press. [passage omitted] Malaysia wishes to protect its integrity against such defamations of a blimpish, contemptuous foreign press as well as against a government which curiously chooses to remain apathetic to the dignity of nation it so avidly desires to deal with. The Malaysian Government cannot pretend business-as-usual with regard to a fellow governnent which is almost certain to leave every business deal prone to calumny at some time to come.
