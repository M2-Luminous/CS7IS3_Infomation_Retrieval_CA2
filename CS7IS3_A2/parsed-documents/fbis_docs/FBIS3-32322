The leaders of the party are calling for a demonstration demanding the lifting of the embargo. [Begin Emmanuel Constant recording, in Creole] We in FRAPH are calling for a demonstration to ask the international community to lift the embargo that is causing the Haitian people to groan. Not many Haitians know how Aristide lives abroad. He lives like a human being while we in FRAPH, who are living here, we know the sufferings that the Haitian people are facing: Food is expensive, there is no gasoline, the business sector has stopped, there is no transportation, the hospitals are closed. In a word, national life is blocked. Who is the cause of that? We say aloud: It is Aristide, who is living the good life with no thought of the sufferings of the Haitians who voted for him. Today, we are standing up and are asking for lifting the embargo because Aristide does not have a feather [as heard] in Haiti; he does not have a child. We in FRAPH are asking everyone: Who is not affected by the embargo? Therefore, everyone, come to Colon Square on 4 February at 1000 so that we can say that we are tired of the embargo; please lift it for us. [end recording]. This initiative is supported by PDCH [Haitian Christian Democratic Party], MDN [Mobilization for National Development] and PARADI [Haitian Party Of God] as well as by the Capois La Mort organization. On the other hand, a people's organization of the Bel-Air district is against this demonstration.
