Zuganov mentioned the issue of non-payment to enterprises, unpreparedness for the cold weather, the reorganization of the power structures of the defense and former security ministries, and attempts to hinder the State Duma's activities among the factors deteriorating the situation. According to Zuganov, the recently signed Russian-Georgian Treaty, which was not coordinated with the North Caucasian republics, was one of the most significant destabilizing factors. This treaty might stir up mass disturbances in North Caucasus, Zuganov pointed out.
