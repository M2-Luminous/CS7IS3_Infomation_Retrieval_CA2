[Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I think that all Polish banks should be both consolidated and privatized. Both these processes are truly necessary. Our banks, even the state-owned ones, are only small financial institutions compared to the big European banks. [Maciag] Is it easier to privatize or to consolidate? Which should come first? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] If one wants to create one big bank out of several smaller banks, then indeed consolidation is more advantageous. Then, when individual banks are on the stock market, any mergers among them are less likely. For the time being, the role of the giant, but only on the domestic market, is played by Bank Handlowy. Other banks are much smaller. I believe that it would be good if several banks with really strong capital reserves were established. For me, as president of the National Bank of Poland [NBP], it does not make any difference whether I supervise the activity of one bank or the activities of several banks. The important thing is that they are in good financial condition. I am more interested in the problems of small privately owned banks, threatened with bankruptcy, than the problems of state-owned banks, whose functioning is supervised by the owner--that is, by the Finance Ministry. [Maciag] The authors of "Strategy for Poland" stress that ownership transformations in the banking sector will be perceived by the government as an instrument that enables efficient allocation of resources. In this context, the choice between the form of ownership and efficiency, if such a choice emerges, will be a foregone conclusion: Efficiency will be chosen. Such an approach may mean that it is not worth privatizing any more state-owned banks because right now their efficiency indexes are much better than those of privately owned banks. What do you think of it? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] In the long run, the condition of state-owned banks will deteriorate. The experiences of other countries, such as Italy, Austria, and France, show that these banks achieve definitely poorer financial results than their privately owned competitors. For the time being, state-owned banks are characterized by a lower cost of obtaining money. If we take into account the huge turnover and the large number of accounts, this is perfectly understandable. The costs of obtaining money in privately owned banks are incomparably higher. These banks must attract customers with higher interest rates of deposits, which costs money. However, in a few years' time, state-owned banks would be bound to achieve poorer results than privately owned ones. Such phenomena have been observed to take place in many market economy states. The correct conclusions must be drawn from these experiences. [Maciag] The first version of "Strategy for Poland" included the suggestion that banking supervision should no longer be exercised by the NBP. The suggestion was later removed. Did it happen at your request? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Yes, it did. There is no reason that this supervision should function outside the NBP. Of the 12 states in the European Union [EU], only in four of them is supervision exercised outside the central bank; however, this is only to a certain degree because, in France, supervision is exercised by a special banking commission; its head is the president of the central bank of this country and his inspectors are the employees. [passage omitted] [Maciag] The economic program presented by Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is critical of the activity of the NBP. It accuses the bank of combining the functions of issuing, supervisory functions, and ownership functions, which is not conducive to the proper fulfillment of any of them. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] I do not agree with this thesis; it is not really tenable. If we take into account the financial policy, it is the central bank that forces the government to limit the budget deficit, inflation. The fact that the members of the supervision team presented deputies with a good diagnosis of the situation in the banking sectors proves that they stopped pretending that nothing is happening to it. But, if the state budget is willing to take over banks being supervised by the NBP--for instance, Prosper Bank or Pierwszy Komercyjny Bank in Lublin--I will gladly give them up. The NBP does not have to perform the ownership function. I have suggested many times in the past to the finance minister that state-owned banks, of which he is the owner, should take over trouble-stricken privately owned banks. [Maciag] Was the NBP consulted over that part of the "Strategy for Poland" program that pertains to reforming the banking sector? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] No, it was not. Apparently, one of our departments is said to have been contacted, but there was neither any team formed nor was there an exchange of official letters on the topic. I received the final draft of the program right before a session of the Council of Ministers, and I was asked to take a position on it. [Maciag] The program's authors announced a gradual reduction in the rate of mandatory reserves. When can the central bank make the first step in that direction? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] We must wait for economic figures from the first six months of the year. The inflation level compared with the forecast for the end of 1994 will have a decisive impact. If inflation is low, we will think whether to decrease mandatory reserves and whether to keep reducing interest rates. For the time being, we are not planning on making such decisions. Still, the trend is correct: Along with falling inflation, there should occur a decrease in mandatory reserves and interest rates. [Maciag] Is it realistic to expect inflation to fall below 10 percent by 1997? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Achieving a singe-digit inflation figure within three years is possible, but it will require tremendous financial discipline. First of all, one must control salaries in the state-owned sector very tightly, regardless of whether we decide to adopt the British or the French model. We cannot allow for an increase in the budget deficit. On the contrary, one must strive to limit its size. That is because a high budget deficit limits the possibilities of financing investments. The central bank's role in financing the budget deficit cannot be significant because that would cause an increase in inflation. Personally, I think we will manage to decrease inflation to below 10 percent, but not before 1998. I presented such a forecast at a meeting of EU representatives in Brussels. At the meeting, West European experts stated that, according to their calculations, we will achieve a single-digit inflation figure in 1998. [Maciag] Banks have been devoting too much money for financing the budget deficit. What should one do to increase the number of credits for the economy and for individual enterprises over the next few years? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] From the standpoint of monetary policies, credit measures by banks are perhaps insufficient. But, in our country, there is the habit of treating credits as something that is given away and that people deserve to get. That is wrong. If there are good projects, banks will finance them. Decreased inflation is bound to decrease the profitability of investing in Treasury bills, and, thus, it will increase the interest banks charge on credits. [Maciag] For the moment, however, banks prefer to make money on security transactions rather than on providing credits. [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] By purchasing Treasury bills, banks take a smaller risk. We are not the only country with a budget deficit. The Treasury bills market is developed in many countries with market economies. Naturally, it is competition--banks prefer to buy secure, state-owned securities rather then financing risky ventures. That is why a persistent reduction of the budget deficit is necessary. [Maciag] How should one encourage the Polish people to save money? Is it possible to have a slower rate of falling interest rates on deposits compared with the rate falling interest rates on credits? [Gronkiewicz-Waltz] Banks make their living by price margins. We cannot expect them to deliberately decrease their profits. In my view, the Polish zloty should be continuously overvalued, if I may say so. That means that creeping devaluation should be lower than inflation. Then we will make sure that it will be profitable to save in zlotys. The central bank has been trying to conduct such a policy. Last year, it was profitable to have zloty deposits in banks, even though not as much as we initially planned. We had to devalue the national currency because of the deepening payment deficit. This year, we will do everything not to allow those who have deposited money in Polish banks to suffer losses. [passage omitted]
