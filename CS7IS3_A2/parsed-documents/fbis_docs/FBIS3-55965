They have been organized under the aegis of the UN with Russia's assistance. The possibility of concluding an agreement is being discussed, reflecting the key areas of a settlement, especially the resolution of the problem of refugees and the future political status of Abkhazia. The Georgian delegation is headed by Jaba Ioseliani, chairman of the Provisional Committee for the State of Emergency. The Abkhaz delegation is headed by Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, chairman of Abkhazia's Council of Ministers. Taking part in the consultations are special representative of the UN Secretary General Edouard Brunner and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Pastukhov. Mikhail Ukleba, Georgian deputy foreign minister and member of the Georgian delegation, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that several draft agreements presented by the delegations have been submitted for examination. The participants are also discussing the proposals of the Russian delegation and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, OHCR, on the return of the refugees to Abkhazia. M. Ukleba said that on the first day of the talks, 11 January, it was decided that on 8 February a group of experts, which is engaged in drawing up proposals on the political status of Abkhazia, would meet again in Moscow. The first sitting of this group took place in Moscow on 15-16 December. In a conversation with the ITAR-TASS correspondent, S. Dzhindzholiya said: "The main question is strengthening peace. We therefore propose the creation of a disengagement corridor along the Inguri river and and the introduction of peacekeeping forces there. We say -- and the Georgian side agrees with this -- that Russian troops could fulfill the role of peacekeeping forces." The second issue of the talks, the political status of Abkhazia, "is so complicated that it is impossible to expect any decision to be taken today." Its discussion will be continued by experts in Moscow. S. Dzhindzholiya said the participants in the round are devoting a great deal of attention to the problem of refugees. It is not ruled out that as a first step, recommendations will be drawn up for the return of the refugees to one area of Abkhazia. It is intended that discussions on this matter will be continued in Moscow in February by the representatives of the sides within the framework of the working group with the participation of OHCR specialists.
