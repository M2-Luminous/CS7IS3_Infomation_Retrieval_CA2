In a revised position paper on Taiwan-mainland direct links, the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Taiwan will not consider initiating direct air and sea links with the mainland before its security wariness is soothed. The paper says transportation links cannot be achieved before Beijing renounces its threat of force against Taiwan, lest Taiwan be lulled into thinking the links would remove that threat, thus sharply weakening Taiwan's ability to defend itself. The paper said achieving direct links would be difficult anyway, given the political, legal and security barriers that the mainland has thrown up. It disagreed with the proposal by the mainland that if cross-strait transport links proceed, ships from either side would not be allowed to hoist their national flags. It said that doing so would not eliminate the political, legal and security problems existing between the two sides, and in addition would be against both the International Civil Aviation Agreement and ROC civil aviation laws. Underlining its much more vigilant attitude toward the mainland, the MAC added in the paper a survey of practices adopted by countries separated after World War II in regard to direct transportation links. It said East and West Germany and South and North Koreas did not begin direct transport links before hostilities between them were officially brought to an end. Meanwhile, the paper asserted that Hong Kong will remain a "special territory" in ROC jurisdictional terms after the British colony is turned over to communist China in 1997, but added that direct air and sea links between Taiwan and Hong Kong will be sustained.
