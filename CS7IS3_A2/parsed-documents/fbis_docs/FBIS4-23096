FBIS TRENDS-08JUN94-Ukraine SUMMARY SUMMARY In the wake of their victory in the March-April Supreme Soviet election, Communists and their leftist allies have taken control of the new legislature, greatly diminishing the influence of the Government establishment, the socalled "party of power" led by President Leonid Kravchuk and Supreme Soviet Chairman Ivan Plyushch. Although Kravchuk and Plyushch joined forces with the nationalists to prevent the leftists from gaining control of parliament, they failed in their efforts to put together a strong enough coalition to block the election of Socialist-Communist candidate Oleksandr Moroz as Supreme Soviet chairman. As the June presidential election approaches, the nationalists have decided to back Kravchuk or Plyushch rather than to run their own candidate. With seven candidates in the race there will probably be a runoff. If they make the runoff, Kravchuk or Plyushch would still face a strong challenge from leftists, who are united behind Moroz, and from former Premier Leonid Kuchma, who has strong support in east Ukraine and leads in the early polls. END SUMMARY Communists and Allies Take Control of New Parliament The new parliament has been harder for Kravchuk and Plyushch to influence because it contains fewer deputies linked to the government than the old parliament did and far more deputies affiliated with parties, particularly the leftist parties. Even though the government establishment had drawn up the election law to discourage parties and aid the election of nonparty candidates representing or favored by the government, the majority of Supreme Soviet members elected in the 27 March-1O April parliamentary elections, 169 of the 338 seats filled, according to election officials (UNIAR, 13 April), and as many as 242 (according to the 28 April Narodna Armiya), are linked to parties. The Communist Party (CPU) won by far the most seats- -86--and, with its allies, the 14 Socialists (SPU) and 18 Peasant Party (SelPU), forms a leftist bloc of over one-third of the Supreme Soviet. Rukh won only 20, 26, or 30 seats (depending on which source is doing the counting), and other nationalists did worse, while non-nationalist democrats--including the Interregional Bloc for Reforms (MBR) of Kuchma and former Supreme Soviet Deputy Chairman Volodymyr Hrynyov--also won few seats. In the face of the CPU victory, the Kravchuk-Plyushch forces took steps to attempt to retain control of the Supreme Soviet against the leftist challenge. Incumbent Chairman Plyushch, whose prospects for reelection as chairman appeared dim anyhow (Post- Postup, 22-28 April), announced he would not run for reelection because he was running for president (Kyivska Pravda, 26 April), and First Deputy Chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Vasyl Durdynets, viewed by many as most likely to become new Supreme Soviet chairman (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 May), took over leadership of the establishment forces in parliament. Durdynets led the group of oblast and party representatives that conducted the preparatory work for organizing the new Supreme Soviet during April and early May (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 12 May) and initiated the founding of a new "Center" group of deputies (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May), aimed at uniting deputies of what he called a "constructive centrist orientation" (Holos Ukrainy, 26 April). At a 6 May meeting, the group elected Durdynets its "coordinator" and claimed to have registered 59 members (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May). The Center is composed largely of government officials, although the leader of the DemPU (Democratic Party of Ukraine)- -the party closest to the government--is also a member (See Box One). As factions began organizing in the new Supreme Soviet (See Box Two), the centrist bloc formed by the "party of power" reached out to form an alliance with Rukh and other democratic factions. Durdynets' Center at a 6 May meeting appealed to other factions to create a bloc of centrists entitled "For Accord and Joint Work" (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May) and at a 10 May meeting appealed to other factions to create a "bloc of centrist orientation" (Kiev radio, 11 May). Rukh Chairman Vyacheslav Chornovil also favored creation of a mechanism for working with the Center and other factions to counter the left (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May) and on 10 May announced that leaders of the Center, Rukh, Derzhavnist (Statehood), and Za Reformy Dlya Narodu (For Reforms for the People) factions had agreed to form a "centrist bloc" (Kiev radio, 10 May). On 17 May the Center, "Reforms," Rukh, Yednist (Unity), and Derzhavnist factions, and some Agrarians and MDF- Center met and formed a bloc aimed at countering leftists and "becoming the parliamentary majority" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May). Derzhavnist leader Mykola Porovskyy contended that if Derzhavnist, Rukh, Reforms, DemPU, and Center got together, they could form a bloc of 130-140 (Kyivska Pravda, 24 May). Election of Chairman The centrist bloc at its 17 May meeting agreed to unite behind Durdynets in the election of a new Supreme Soviet chairman (Post- Postup, 19-25 May), but when the election was held by secret ballot on 18 May they failed to come up with enough votes to block the election of a leftist. The CPU, SPU, and Agrarians united behind SPU Chairman Moroz, while the MBR nominated nonparty Kharkiv historian Oleksandr Karpov (Silski Visti, 19 May; 20 May), and the ultranationalistic UNA-UNSO backed nonparty Ternopil teacher Yuriy Tyma (Silski Visti, 19 May, 20 May). Moroz managed to attract just enough to win on the first ballot- -171, (See Note 1) while Durdynets got 103, Karpov 14, and Tyma 9 (Kiev radio, 18 May). Elected largely by CPU votes and with his own SPU only able to contribute 14 votes, Moroz is largely beholden to the CPU and will probably have to bow to the CPU's wishes on most occasions. (Note 1) The number of votes needed to win was reduced from 170 to 169 when the Supreme Soviet invalidated the election of Hrynyov and Odesa deputy Pavlo Kudyukin because their opponents in the runoffs had withdrawn leaving them unopposed (ITAR-TASS, 12 May). Their exclusion reduced. the membership from 338 to 336. The election of Moroz as chairman apparently stunned many of his opponents, who immediately began accusing each other of selling out to the leftists. Moroz was able to garner a considerable number of votes beyond the roughly 120-145 of the CPU, SPU, and Agrarians, apparently attracting independents and even some supposed Durdynets supporters. Nationalists, who had apparently calculated that Moroz could not attract enough votes for a majority on the first ballot and had expected a chance to eventually push through a compromise candidate, began speculating that some Center deputies had swung to Moroz in return for promises of jobs (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 20 May). Even though Moroz's election, by putting the Supreine Soviet in the hands of the leftists, would appear to be a setback for Kravchuk, Chornovil and some of his colleagues immediately after the election charged that Kravchuk himself had engineered Moroz's election in order to destroy his rival Plyushch as a presidential candidate. Chornovil argued that Moroz's victory was mainly a victory for Kravchuk since Moroz would now drop out of the presidential race to retain the post of head of parliament (in fact, Moroz did not drop out) and Plyushch would be weakened as a rival to Kravchuk presumably because Durdynets' defeat deprives Plyushch of his base as Supreme Soviet leader (Nezavisimost, 20 May; Silski Visti, 20 May). Environmental Minister Kostenko, a Rukh leader, also categorized the Moroz election as a Kravchuk maneuver, alleging that the Center, "supposedly set up to support V. Durdynets, secretly voted for A. Moroz" in order to weaken Plyushch's presidential campaign (Nezavisimost, 20 May). Later, democrats assailed Yednist, which had joined the Durdynets bloc, for acting as a "Trojan horse" and helping elect Moroz (Nezavisimost, 27 May) and accused leftists of favoring Yednist in distribution of Supreme Soviet Presidium seats (UNIAN, 31 May). Election of Deputy Chairmen The election of deputy chairmen of the Supreme Soviet further enhanced the dominance of leftists and easterners over the establishment and nationalists. The Center proposed Durdynets for first deputy chairman to "halt the diktat of leftwing forces" (UNIAN, 20 May), but Moroz declared Durdynets had no chance of election and proposed Agrarian leader Oleksandr Tkachenko for deputy chairman (UNIAN, 19 May). CPU First Secretary Petro Symonenko also backed Tkachenko. Upset by the prospect of another leftist being elected, Rukh, Reforms, Derzhavnist, and some Center deputies called a boycott, refusing to register as present and thereby temporarily preventing a quorum and blocking the scheduled election of a deputy chairman on 19 and 20 May (UNIAN, 19 May; Demokratychna Ukraina, 21 May; Silski Visti, 24 May). Moroz eventually offered a compromise to centrists: Durdynets as first deputy chairman and Tkachenko as deputy chairman. But this was voted down by the Supreme Soviet on 24-25 May when it voted on several such combinations and gave the largest vote to a team of two leftists--Tkachenko and Vice President of the Ukrainian-Siberian Investment Corporation Oleh Dyomin. (See Note 2) They received 181 votes, compared to only 92 for a Durdynets-Tkachenko combination (Vecherniy Kiev, 26 May). Furious democrats felt cheated (Silski Visti, 27 May), and Chornovil called the election of Tkachenko and Dyomin a "communist coup carried out under Oleksandr Moroz's leadership" and accused the Yednist faction of joining the CPU-SPU-SelPU bloc in carrying out this "coup" (Nezavisimost, 27 May). (Note 2) Dyomin was long a CPU leader but recently has been a businessman and a defender of Kharkiv regional interests and the Russian language (Khreshchatyk, 1 June). He was Kharkiv CPU secretary until the party was banned in 1991, after which he says he was unemployed for a while (Khreshchatyk, 1 June). He ran for the Supreme Soviet as a nonparty candidate but had links to Kuchma's MBR (Silski Visti, 26 May; Molod Ukrainy, 27 May) and spent heavily to defeat a CPU candidate in the runoff (Khreshchatyk, 1 June). Leftists further extended their control over the leadership of the Supreme Soviet by dominating the allocation of seats in the Presidium and committee chairmanships, prompting sharp complaints from democrats. Leaders of Derzhavnist, Reforms, Rukh, and the Center claimed that Agrarians and Yednist (which apparently joined the leftists) had each received an extra seat in the Presidium, while Reforms and Derzhavnist received only one seat apiece, instead of the two they are entitled to (UNIAN, 31 May). When the Supreme Soviet on 31 May approved the naming of 22 committee chairmen, the CPU got 6, Agrarians 3, Yednist 2, while the Center got 4, MDF-Center 2, and Rukh, Derzhavnist, Reforms, and SPU one each, and the foreign affairs committee went to a Communist, defense to a Socialist, economic policy to Yednist, budget to the MDF-Center, and finance to an Agrarian (UNIAR, 31 May). Leaders of Rukh and Reforms prQtested some of the choices (UNIAN, 31 May), and Rukh's Ivan Zayets complained that Communists were taking over the main committees (UNIAR, 30 May). Rukh tried to boycott again in protest, but, according to Chornovil, "the Center betrayed us" and only 99 joined the boycott (Vybir News Agency, 3 June). Kuchma's Role While Kuchma and his faction did not clearly ally with the leftists, they lined up openly against Kravchuk, the Center, and the nationalists. Kuchma openly rejected Durdynets (UNIAN, 6 May), although he probably did not vote for Moroz. The MDF- Center nominated Karpov for chairman (Silski Visti, 19 May, 20 May), and the 20 May Ukraina Moloda said that Karpov got the Kuchma-Hrynyov votes. Karpov in fact was listed as one of the leaders of the MDF-Center in the official list of factions (UNIAR, 27 May) and therefore probably received its votes. Although probably not voting for Moroz, Kuchma did have kind words for him after the election, saying that Moroz is becoming more moderate and does not make "excessively leftist" statements (Nezavisimost, 20 May). Kuchma did not participate in the democrats' 19 May boycott protesting Moroz's nomination of Tkachenko for first deputy chairman (judging by a 21 May Demokratychna Ukraina list of those registering and not registering). When the Supreme Soviet deputy chairmen were elected, an apparent associate of Kuchma's faction, Dyomin, won the No. 3 post in the parliament's leadership. Moreover, the Kuchma camp and the nationalists have been attacking each other vigorously. Chornovil recently declared Kuchma's MBR "our biggest enemy" (Nezavisimost, 22 April) and said that the MBR is a bigger threat to Ukrainian statehood than the leftists because the demands of Kuchma's supporters "threaten our independence" (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May). Even though it was leftists' leadership and votes that apparently caused the Supreme Soviet to declare Hrynyov's election invalid, Kuchuma and Hrynyov blamed the nationalists for Hrynyov's exclusion. At a press conference after the Supreme Soviet vote, Kuchma and Hrynyov accused the nationalist democrats of tricking the "less experienced communists" into this decision, which they apparently felt was aimed at weakening support for Kuchma as the presidential race began (Silski Visti, 17 May). Hrynyov especially blamed former Rukh leader Holovatiy for raising the credentials case (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May). In fact, it appears that the leftists had played the main role in Hrynyov's exclusion. Nezavisimaya Gazeta said that it was the CPU and SPU that had voted to unseat Hrynyov (29 May) and that Moroz had acted "in a partisan manner" against Hrynyov and Kudyukin during the Supreme Soviet discussion of their cases (21 May). Moroz had presided when the credentials of seven deputies came under discussion and he proposed separate votes on each case; CPU leader Symonenko presided during the vote and also insisted on separate votes. Although most of the cases involved alleged violations of the same rule involved in Hrynyov's exclusion, the separate votes resulted in declaring the election of some deputies valid but that of Hrynyov and Kudyukin invalid (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 14 May), apparently on partisan bases. The Supreme Soviet voted 178 to 95 against Hrynyov (Vysokyy Zamok, 14 May). According to the 19-25 May Post-Postup, Communists and nationalists united to vote to unseat Hrynyov because one side disliked his pro-capitalist views and the other his pro-Russian views. Kuchma said he angrily walked out of the Supreme Soviet after it voted to unseat Hrynyov (Kievskiye Novosti, 20 May). Crowded Field Likely To Force Runoffs in Presidential Race The establishment and nationalists continue to work together as the presidential election set for 26 June approaches, both in the attempt to postpone the election and in opposing Kuchma and Moroz. Kravchuk, who at first said he would not run for reelection (ITAR-TASS, 25 April), has urged postponing the election (Demokratychna Ukraina, 29 April) but eventually filed as a candidate. His call to postpone the election won support from most nationalists--Rukh and Christian Democrats (ITAR-TASS, 25 April), the URP (Molod Ukrainy, 26 April), and DemPU (Ratusha, 26 April). A petition signed by 122 Supreme Soviet members (including Chornovil, according to the 18 May Za Vilnu Ukrainu) called for postponement (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May), but Plyushch (Pravda Ukrainy, 5 April), SPU Chairman Moroz (Interfax, 29 April; ITAR-TASS, 1 May), CPU First Secretary Symonenko (Interfax, 6 May), Kuchma and Hrynyov (Vysokyy Zamok, 14 May), and even ultranationalist Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party Chairman Khmara (Interfax, 12 May) announced opposition to postponement. It would take a two-thirds vote of the total membership of the new Supreme Soviet (300 out of 450) to change a decision by the previous Supreme Soviet (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May). Such an action is virtually impossible, especially with only 336 members seated in the Supreme Soviet at present. When Kravchuk formally asked the Supreme Soviet to postpone the election, it turned him down on 2 June, with 201 voting to go ahead with the election (UNIAN, 2 June). Since a majority of votes cast is needed to win the presidential election, the current field of seven candidates will probably splinter the votes and force a runoff. While Kravchuk, Plyushch, Kuchma, Moroz, director of the Center for Market Reforms Volodymyr Lanovyy, President of the "Ukrainian Financial Group" Valeriy Babych, and Education Minister Petro Talanchuk are all registered candidates (Kiev radio, 26 May), the contest appears likely to boil down to Kuchma and Moroz competing for eastern and communist-conservative votes and Kravchuk and Plyushch competing for western-central and nationalist votes. Among minor candidates, Lanovyy is an outspoken economic reformer who was fired by Kravchuk as deputy premier and minister of the economy in mid-1992. Although a New Ukraine leader in the past and now listed as nonparty, he was backed by Rukh in his successful campaign for election to the Supreme Soviet in Kiev. Babych heads the Yednist faction which has apparently left the Center- nationalist bloc of parties formed just before the opening of the Supreme Soviet session and joined the leftists, but an analysis of candidates in the 26 May Demokratychna Ukraina contended that Babych has long been pro-Kravchuk and will be helpful to Kravchuk in debating economic policy against Kuchma and Lanovyy. Kravchuk and Plyushch The pro-Russian stance of of Kuchma and Moroz and their apparent strength have frightened nationalists into rallying behind Kravchuk and Plyushch. Rukh, after doing poorly in the parliamentary election, decided that there was no prospect for electing Chornovil or any other nationalist as president. Chornovil declared that nomination of a Rukh candidate would only help Kuchma and Moroz (ITAR-TASS, 18 April). With Chornovil declining to run, the west has no one to support except Kravchuk and Plyushch. In collecting signatures to qualify for the presidential ballot, Kravchuk led all candidates in Lviv, getting 51,748, while Plyushch (backed by many Rukh leaders) got 20,669, and Kuchma and Moroz got few (Nezavisimost, 25 May). As between Kravchuk and Plyushch, Plyushch appears weaker, especially after losing his base as Supreme Soviet chairman. Kuchma earlier had said that Plyushch had the best chance to become president because as Supreme Soviet chairman he was "holding all power in Ukraine" (Interfax, 26 April). Despite losing the chairmanship, Plyushch still has a base in the relatively conservative agrarian lobby of kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders, according to Nezavisimost editor Vladimir Kuleba (Nezavisimost, 29 April). Moreover, he has won support among some nationalists disillusioned with Kravchuk's inaction. Democratic bloc leader Levko Lukyanenko, although usually pro- Kravchuk, has declared his preference for Plyushch over Kravchuk, calling the president too "indecisive" (Samostiyna Ukraina, 1-7 May) and arguing that Plyushch would better protect the state (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 13 May). Stories are circulating that Chornovil also prefers Plyushch as the standardbearer against Kuchma and Moroz, but he denied this and insisted he was not taking sides between Kravchuk and Plyushch (UNIAR, 21 April; Nezavisimost, 22 April). At a 30 May press conference he said that "personally I will vote for Lanovyy" (Robitnycha Hazeta, 1 June). Unable to choose between Kravchuk, Plyushch, and Lanovyy, Rukh's leadership on 6 June decided not to back any of the candidates in the first round (UNIAR, 6 June). Moroz Moroz has not dropped out of the presidential race following his election as Supreme Soviet chairman and in fact has reaffirmed his intention to continue his presidential bid (UNIAN, Interfax, 23 May; Silski Visti, 26 May). His position was strengthened by the decision of CPU First Secretary Symonenko to drop out of the race (ITAR-TASS, 1 May) and endorse him (Interfax, 6 May), forming a united left behind the Socialist leader. Given the leftists' striking strength in the Supreme Soviet election, Moroz will probably run a strong race. Kuchma Kuchma, however, may be the biggest threat to Kravchuk and Plyushch, even though his MBR won few seats in the Supreme Soviet. Recent polls have usually shown him running ahead of others. A nationwide poll of 1,200 people in April showed that 18 percent favor Kuchma, while 11 percent back Kravchuk and 10 percent Chornovil (Interfax, 30 April). He has strength in his home base of Dnipropetrovsk, where he was elected to the Supreme Soviet with 90 percent of the vote (Post-Inform, 28 March). His popularity in the south was reflected in a recent Odesa poll that showed 18 percent for Kuchma versus only 6 percent for Kravchuk (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 April). Kravchuk himself at a 2 June meeting categorized Kuchma as his main rival in the election (Interfax, 3 June; Izvestiya, 4 June). Prospects Supreme Soviet maneuvering and the presidential race are shaping up as a struggle between Kravchuk, Plyushch, nationalists, and democrats against the more pro-Russian Kuchma, Moroz, and the CPU--the present establishment versus the "outsiders" from the east and leftist camp. After the first round of the presidential election, Kravchuk will probably emerge as the standardbearer for Ukrainian nationalists against Kuchma, who is backed by the populous east and south, making the election more of a referendum on whether or not to draw closer to Russia, rather than on economic or political reform. With the strong CPU showing in the Supreme Soviet election and leftists taking control of parliament, a victory by Kuchma or Moroz in the presidential race would put the east in control and swing Ukraine away from the nationalist course it has followed since independence, a change likely to cause further tension between Ukraine's east and west regions. Box One Members of Durdynets' Center The Center is largely a collection of of government officials, who comprise over half of the 27 Center members listed in the 5 May Uryadovyy Kuryer. Several Supreme Soviet officials, DemPU Chairman Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, New Wave leader Ihor Yukhnovskyy, and one Rukh member (Myroslav Horbatyuk) also belong. Only two government ministers elected to the Supreme Soviet did not join- -Environmental Minister Yuriy Kostenko (a Rukh candidate) and Agriculture Minister Yuriy Karasyk (a nonparty candidate but probably close to the agrarians). No pro-Kravchuk URP (Ukrainian Republican Party) members apparently joined, much less any leftists, Kuchma backers, New Ukraine, ultranationalists, or well-known Rukh leaders. The following members of the Center were identified in the 5 May Uryadovyy Kuryer or 24 May Holos Ukrainy: Oleksandr Bandurka--MVD chief for Kharkiv oblast, no party Volodymyr Bortnik--chairman of an agricultural equipment company, no party Anton Buteyko--director of Kravchuk's Service of Administration, no party Volodymyr Butkevich--head of department of international law at Kiev State University, no party Valeriy Cherep--chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Construction, Architecture and Housing and Communal Economy, no party Anatoliy Dron--chairman of the State Committee for Housing and Communal Economy, no party Vasyl Durdynets--first deputy chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Anatoliy Holubchenko--industry minister, no party Myroslav Horbatyuk--engineer at institute, Rukh Viktor Kalnyk--deputy minister of economy, no party Olymp Klympush--transport minister, no party Valeriy Kolomoytsev--director of a small enterprise, no party Mykhaylo Kovalko--chairman of State Committee for Oil and Gas, no party Vasyl Kostytskyy--department head at juridical faculty of Pricarpathian University, no party Mykhaylo Kostytskyy--dean of juridical faculty at Lviv State University, no party Valentyn Landyk--deputy premier, nonparty Kostyantyn Piskunovskyy--director of Ukrainian Oil Products Association, no party Vadym Plotkin--director of an industrial enterprise, no party Ivan Plyushch--chairman of the old Supreme Soviet, no party Volodymyr Pylypchuk--Chairman of the old Supreme Soviet Commission for Questions of Economic Reform and Managment of Economy, listed as nonparty in Uryadovyy Kuryer, but elected as a democratic bloc candidate, one of Rukh's main economists in past Petro Sheyko--president's representative in a rayon in Chernihiv, no party Roman Shpek--economy minister, no party Yuriy Spizhenko--health minister, no party Mykola Surhay--chairman of the State Committee for the Coal Industry, no party Viktor Suslov--adviser to the premier, listed as nonparty in Uryadovyy Kuryer, but later listed as Agrarian when named chairman of the finance commission (UNIAR, 31 May) Serhiy Ustych--deputy head of. Zakarpatsk 0blast State Administration, no party Volodymyr Yavorivskyy--Chairman of old Supreme Soviet Commission on Questions of Chernobyl Disaster, DemPU chairman Ihor Yukhnovskyy--member of old Supreme Soviet Presidium, former First deputy premier, listed as no party by Uryadovyy Kuryer but ran on New Wave ticket in Lviv Mykola Zhulynskyy--deputy premier, no party Yukhym Zvyahilskyy--acting premier, no party End Box One Box Two Factions in the New Supreme Soviet When the Supreme Soviet opened in mid-May, it decided after considerable debate that 25 members would be required to register as an official faction with the right of representation in the Supreme Soviet's Presidium and other advantages (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 20 May; Post-Postup, 19-25 May). This forced small groups such as the URP, DemPU, and MDF-Center to consider combining with others to meet this requirement (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May). As the eclectic membership of the factions demonstrates, deputies elected on a party ticket sometimes did not join their parties' Supreme Soviet factions and factions sometimes took names other than that of the parties they are based on. In an effort to discourage separatism, the rules adopted by the parliament banned factions formed on regional bases, a move angering some southern and Donbass deputies who wanted to form regional blocs (Robitnycha Hazeta, 13 May). Leftists: The CPU formed the biggest faction, named "For Social Justice and People's Power" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May) and initially including 95 members (Silski Visti, 19 May). Since only 86 deputies were elected on the CPU ticket, this indicates that some non-CPU deputies have joined up with the victorious faction. The CPU had so many members that it reportedly sent 11 to join the SPU's 14 to help the SPU reach the 25 minimum (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 20 May). SelPU formed an "Agrarians of Ukraine" faction consisting of 37 members (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 20 May), with former Agriculture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko as its organizer (Post-Postup, 22-28 April). Nationalist Democrats: Nationalist democrats decided not to revive the umbrella Narodna Rada group that had united most nationalists and democrats in the old Supreme Soviet. Narodna Rada Chairman Ivan Zayets argued for renewing the coalition, but Chornovil preferred to create a mechanism for working with the Center and other factions to counter the left (Molod Ukrainy, 13 May) and also argued that having several reform factions would be better than just one because each would have a representative in the Supreme Soviet Presidium (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May). Rukh formed a faction of 32, including members of the Christian Democratic Party and DemPU, but not the URP (Ukrainian Weekly, 1 May). A Derzhavnist (Statehood) faction was formed by the URP's 9 elected members, according to its leader Mykola Porovskyy (Kyivska Pravda, 24 May), but has only reached 16 members (according to the 19-25 May Post-Postup) or 19 members (according to the 12 May Interfax). A "Faction of Reforms" was formed by representatives of Lviv's New Wave and former Rukh leader Serhiy Holovatiy (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 18 May).* According to another account, "Reforms" was formed by rival economic reformers Volodymyr Lanovyy and Viktor Pynzenyk, and joined by Holovatiy, PDVU (Party of Democratic Revival of Ukraine) leader Taras Stetskiv, Union of Officers of Ukraine leader Hryhoriy Omelchenko, and some KUN (Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists) members, and Serhiy Sobolev became its "coordinator" (Post- Postup, 19-25 May). Molod Ukrainy on 13 May reported that Lanovyy had formed a faction of entrepreneurs. *Holovatiy was excluded from Rukh's leadership by Chornovil at Rukh's mid-April congress (Za Vilnu Ukrainu, 21 April). Non-Nationalistic Democrats: The Interregional Bloc for Reform (MBR) led by Kuchma and Hrynyov formed a faction also calling itself the "Center"-- the "Interregional Deputies Faction (MDF)- Center" (Vecherniy Kiev, 28 April). At a 5 May meeting of this group, Kuchma announced that he would not support Durdynets for chairmanship of the Supreme Soviet, and the faction decided to put off a decision until MBR Co-Chairman Hrynyov decided whether to run for this post (UNIAN, 6 May). The group is small, although various numbers have been cited for its size. Hrynyov in a 11 May Holos Ukrainy interview said it had 21 members, Vecherniy Kiev on 28 April said 21, Vysokyy Zamok on 14 May said 20, UNIAN on 20 April said 26, but Chornovil claimed it is less than 12 (Holos Ukrainy, 11 May). A group of industrialists formed Yednist (Unity) under the nonparty deputy Valeriy Babych, president of the "Ukrainian Financial Group" (Post-Postup, 19-25 May) and appeared to play a devious role in the struggle between the Center and the leftists. Although they joined the Center-nationalist bloc formed to back Durdynets (Post-Postup, 19-25 May), Yednist members may have actually voted for the leftist candidates for Supreme Soviet chairman and deputy chairmen. Rukh on 25 May declared that Yednist had joined the CPU-SPU-Agrarian bloc (Vecherniy Kiev, 27 May) and bitterly assailed it for helping lead a "communist coup" (Nezavisimost, 27 May); a 27 May Nezavisimost account called Yednist a "Trojan horse" that helped elect Socialist Oleksandr Moroz chairman; and democrats complained that Yednist had been shown special favor by the newly-elected leftist leadership, receiving one more seat in the Presidium than it was entitled to (UNIAN, 31 May). Rightists: Ultranationalists--Stepan Khmara's Ukrainian Conservative Republican Party, the Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA), and KUN--won too few seats to quality for a 25-member faction, even assuming they could agree to work together (Post- Postup, 19-25 May). KUN, which had managed to elect 6 or 8 members,** announced that it would form its own faction of 16 (Kievskiye Vedomosti, 11 May). **See the Trends of 20 April 1994, page 18. The figures for the size of various factions announced by the Supreme Soviet leadership have been going up and down. On 17 May Moroz announced that the CPU faction had 95 members, the Center 31, Rukh 27, and Yednist 27 (Interfax report in Krymskaya Pravda, 19 May). On 26 May he declared that the CPU faction had 87 members, the Center 43, Agrarians 33, Yednist 27, Reforms 26, Derzhavnist 26, and Socialists 25, while 41 were independents (Interfax, 26 May). This time he did not mention Rukh. On 27 May the Supreme Soviet Secretariat listed factions as of that day: Communists for Social Justice and Democracy 86, Center 38, Agrarians 33, Rukh 27, Reforms 27, "Interregional Deputies Group" 27, Derzhavnist 26, Yednist 26, Socialists 25 (UNIAR, 27 May).
