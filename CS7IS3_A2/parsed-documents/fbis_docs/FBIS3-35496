The prime minister and defense minister, the government ministers, and the citizens of the State of Israel strongly condemn the horrendous murder which struck innocent people and led to the shedding of blood of blameless human beings who were offering their prayers on the occasion of the Ramadan fast. On my and the government's behalf, we express our sorrow and send our sincere condolences to the families of the victims and the Palestinian people, and we wish a speedy recovery to the wounded. We call on everybody, both Arabs and Jews, to evince restraint and not to get dragged into actions which might worsen the situation. The members of the political-security Inner Cabinet have been summoned to a meeting at noon today to discuss the situation in the wake of this evil incident. The prime minister goes on to say: This is a tough day for peace-loving people, both Arabs and Jews, but the demented actions of psychopaths will not prevent reconciliation and the making of peace between the citizens of the State of Israel and the Palestinian people. We will do everything necessary -- and the deliberations on the making of peace may be accelerated -- to prevent misunderstandings, remove obstacles, and together arrive at the day of peace, the day when extremists on both sides will lose all hope of harming the peace process from which we do not want to retreat. In his statement, the prime minister makes clear that instructions have been issued to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and other security forces to do whatever is permitted and possible within the framework of the law to uphold public order and to prevent incidents and bloodshed.
