A universal view in the West is that this program has been set out as NATO's new strategy, which aims at dealing with the new challenges facing European security in the wake of the Cold War. The so-called new strategy is that NATO will establish peaceful bilateral relations with partnership countries to gradually expand NATO to the eastern part of Europe, thus establishing a new European security system with NATO as its core. This new strategy has been developed on the basis of the two previous NATO summits that determined changes in military strategy and expanding dialogue and realms of cooperation; it involves NATO's role and all aspects of the new structure of European security under the new situation. Viewing the summit communique and President Clinton's speech, the main contents include the following: 1. The United States is determined to play a new leading role in a historic turning point for NATO to revitalize the organization; 2. NATO's gate will be open to East Europe, the CIS, and other West European countries; NATO will decide whether or not to accept their membership depending on military conditions and political cooperation between the two sides; 3. As a means of military intervention, it will organize and establish a multinational joint task force comprising NATO and non-NATO member countries; this task force will be under the command of the Western European Union, with access to NATO's communications, equipment, and logistics forces; 4. Under the conditions of a termination of the "common enemy," NATO's chief target is to deal with "common dangers," and presently the emphasis is being laid on dealing with existing border and ethnic contradictions and the conflicts arising therein, such as the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and 5. NATO is to accelerate its conversion from a military- political organization to a political-military organization so that it can safeguard European security and stability more effectively. To promote NATO's new strategy, the United States has presented a new attitude of improving relations with closer ties to its European allies. President Clinton called for joint U.S.-European efforts to restructure European security, and said that the United States would continue to carry out its obligations in Europe. Clinton pledged before the leaders of the 15 member countries that his administration would be different from that of his predecessor and that he "will support European efforts to promote its own security and interests." The United States wants to exercise leadership over NATO, but is unwilling to get too involved in European conflicts; it can openly allow Europe to "play a greater role," with its European allies taking a greater responsibility for defense. Another cause in which the United States finds the assistance of its European allies indispensable is if it wants to "merge" East European countries with the West; everyone knows that some East European countries have long expressed the hope to join NATO. Viewing actual conditions, Western Europe also has aspirations to strengthen security, but its unity on defense remains quite fragile. On the security issue, Europe will have to continue to rely on the United States. The strongest voice for U.S. assistance to resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina came from France, which has always advocated independent defense; this serves as a very good example. The prerequisites for expanding NATO and realizing European security are U.S.-European solidarity and cooperation. However, viewing the present situation, the United States needs to handle well its relations with Russia. Some people believe that the most significant symbol of President Clinton's European trip was the U.S.-Russian summit. Those observers who show concern for NATO, whether in favor or not of NATO pushing eastward, "consider Moscow with anxiety." Those who are in favor of this worry that they will be labeled as "opposing" Moscow, and those who oppose it are not without misgivings about "isolating" Moscow. It was by no means accidental that the United States did not dare to present a list of countries included in a plan to push NATO eastward. Clinton had to go to Prague to remove some of the leading contenders misgivings; more importantly, he had to go to Moscow personally to weigh the pros and cons of the issue. Two points of major U.S. concern are, namely, first, whether or not Russia's political stability and economic reform are on the right track; and second, what is really in Yeltsin's mind about the expansion of NATO, and whether or not Russia insists on possessing a "particular position" and "leadership" in security arrangements involving Eastern Europe and within the CIS. In Moscow, Clinton stated that he would continue to support Yeltsin, and, giving much food for thought, the two sides announced that no new dividing line should be drawn in Europe. It seems that this proves the fact that in pushing NATO's new strategy, the United States has continued to adopt the cautious policy of giving "priority to Moscow." Although the United States has repeatedly stated that East European security and U.S.-European interests are linked as one, and that it is ready to implement the "partnership for peace" program, nevertheless, all this cannot affect U.S.-Russian relations. It seems that it will not be easy for the United States to realize NATO's new strategy. Let alone the Russian factor, viewing the West, we find that it will be very difficult to unify the differences which exist in understanding between the United States and Europe and within Western Europe. As for Eastern Europe and the CIS states, their reaction to NATO's new strategy has been different. Under such circumstances, it is still hard to tell what the bottom line is in pushing NATO eastward, which country will be the first to be absorbed, what the effects and results will be, and what a future European security structure will look like. In commenting on the results of the current summit, REUTER said: "The problems caused by NATO's role in Eastern Europe and other regions will be more numerous and more serious." That is not an exaggeration.
