[Kozyrev] It took a step in the right direction; that is, the idea of Partnership for Peace has been approved, something which essentially is based also on our proposals. The effect is that now, instead of a quantitative membership expansion of NATO eastward, one should be occupied with the practical aspects of interaction, both between Russia and NATO, and between the Central European states and NATO, within the context, say, of joint maneuvers, practicing peacekeeping operations in areas of conflicts, programs of converting military production. This is practical work instead of membership. Of course, there is a small difference of emphasis. NATO looks at things from its own viewpoint [NATO smotrit ot sebya] -- NATO-centrism--and they say this will be a period of preparation for joining NATO. Perhaps that will be the case. Let us see at the end of this period, which will be a fairly long and eventful one. It is perfectly possible that Russia will also decide, in the end, to join NATO. Another scenario is possible, that NATO will be modified and merged into some broader European structure.
