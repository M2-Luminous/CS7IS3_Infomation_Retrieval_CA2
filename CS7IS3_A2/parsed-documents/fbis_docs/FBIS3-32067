In the letter addressed to LA JORNADA newspaper in Mexico City, "Subcommander Marcos," the Zapatist National Liberation Army's (EZLN) spokesman, revealed that the so-called Clandestine Indian Revolutionary Committee [Comite Clandestino Revolucionario Indigena] had recently met to appoint its delegates to the meeting. At San Cristobal de las Casas yesterday Camacho Solis announced his formal acceptance of the negotiation agenda proposed by the guerrilla movement. The agenda includes the assessment of the economic, social, and political problems that prompted the Indian revolt, a search for solutions, and a permanent cessation of hostilities. The peace commissioner, who was appointed by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, also stated that he is willing to negotiate with the guerrillas as a "political force in the process of being organized" in response to the rebels' request that they be accepted as a "belligerent force." In his letter dated 26 January, "Subcommander Marcos" reveals that in the past few days the top rebel directorate discussed the appointment of its delegates to the meeting with Camacho Solis, which indicates their willingness to hold a dialogue even prior to Commissioner Camacho's announcement. "The conditions for the dialogue have been given," Camacho Solis stated yesterday. He also warned the guerrillas that the current "dilemma" is to "agree to peace with democracy" or suffer the consequences of a "toughening" of the conflict. In a confidential letter, Camacho Solis had already proposed to the EZLN the possible cites, established guarantees, and necessary logistics for the meeting. There is still no date for the meeting, but, according to Mexico City media, it is imminent. Meanwhile, General Miguel Angel Godinez, commander of the counter insurgency troops in Chiapas, reiterated today his support for the Army and the negotiation policy implemented by the Salinas de Gortari administration. "When we received the order to stop (the unilateral cease-fire), we did so immediately because we understand that we are fighting Mexicans who are our brothers. It's good that the cease-fire happened, and it opened the door to negotiation," he told a Mexico City newspaper. It is also good that those people (the EZLN) accepted the dialogue and that our top authorities have decided all the necessary measures to further this dialogue and obtain peace through political means and not with weapons," he emphasized. He added that when the rebel leaders and Camacho Solis -- whom he called "a very brave man" -- meet, Army planes will not overfly the area to avoid misunderstandings and to contribute to "holding the dialogue in a clean and above-board manner."
