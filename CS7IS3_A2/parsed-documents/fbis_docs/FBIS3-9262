It harbingers the division of the former Yugoslavia into western and eastern spheres of influence, but also opens another possibility, Vuk Draskovic said at the news conference of the Serbian Renewal Movement. Radovan Pantovic has the details. [Begin recording] [Pantovic] Neither the West or Russia are in favor of a Yalta-like division. It is for Belgrade to decide whether it shall be Yalta or an establishment of a certain union, that is, a reintegration on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Vuk Draskovic says. If the first option is decided on, the Serbs in Bosnia will get international recognition, but will have to concede one-third of territories and will probably not be able to join Yugoslavia except in a confederal form. As an alternative to this arrangement, interpreting the Washington agreement Draskovic mentioned the possibility for the Serbs to join a federal or a similar union [savez] with the Muslims and the Croats. This would enable Serbian cantons to join a confederation with Serbia and Montenegro. If they join a federal arrangement with Croats and Muslims, considerably smaller territorial concessions would be demanded of the Serbs. The Serbian cantons would be equal users of all international funds for renewal and development of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbia could also reckon with the economic aid that had been promised to Croatia for signing the peace, something that would mean the lifting of sanctions. In conformity with this, the Serbian Krajina would establish three-fold connections, and would do so as a state: with Croatia, the Serbian cantons in Bosnia, and Yugoslavia. According to Draskovic's interpretation of the Washington document, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] would also join a confederation with Yugoslavia in this case. Therefore.... [Draskovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement is against Yalta. From the very beginning, as regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbian Renewal Movement is in favor of a cantonal setup. The Serbian Renewal Movement favors this second solution. [Pantovic] The Serbian Renewal Movement demands a firm international guarantee that the return of refugees to their homes would be secured. Draskovic condemned, as he put it, Belgrade's silence, because in his opinion, the fate of Serbs and the Serbian people must not be decided upon by the Pale top military political leadership alone.
