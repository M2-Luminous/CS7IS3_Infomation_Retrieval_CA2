In informing CTK about the letter, however, the chairman of the party's deputies group, Vaclav Exner, said it would have been better if more deputies had signed it. "A number of deputies from the Social Democratic, Liberal Social Union and Left Bloc deputies groups have expressed their view that in essence they support ending the blockade of Cuba," Exner said. "But it bothers them to a certain extent that the suggestion came from our group." The Congressional initiative is being led by Representative Charles Rangel, who is expected to present it formally this week.
