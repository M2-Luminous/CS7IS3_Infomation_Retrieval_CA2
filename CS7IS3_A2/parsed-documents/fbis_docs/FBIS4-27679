FBIS4-27679 "dreas107_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea 20,000 Foreign Workers To Alleviate Shortage 20,000 Foreign Workers To Alleviate Shortage SK0106082794 Seoul YONHAP in English 0620 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0106082794 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 1 (YONHAP) -- Starting with the 33 Nepalese workers who arrived in South Korea Tuesday, some 20,000 foreign trainees will be supplied to small manufacturing companies across the country by early August to ease a manpower shortage. The foreign workers will undergo a one-year apprenticeship and they can prolong their stay by another year if they or their employers request an extension. The workers, allowed in by the government to alleviate the worsening manpower shortage at small- and medium-sized manufacturing firms, hail from 11 countries. Among these nations, China is sending the largest number of workers with 8,000 including ethnic Koreans, followed by 3,000 Filipinos, 2,400 Vietnamese and 1,600 Bangladeshis. Myanmar [Burma] and Sri Lanka will dispatch 1,000 workers apiece while Nepal, Indonesia and Pakistan are each sending 800, trailed by Thailand and Iran with 300 apiece. The Korea Federation of Small Business (KFSB) has voiced concern about possible social problems caused by foreign workers deserting their places of employment. The KFSB is in charge of overall management of their introduction to domestic enterprises. Previously, the Ministries of Labor and Justice opposed the introduction of foreign laborers amid a controversy over the issue at the end of last year, citing a possible rise in domestic unemployment, worsening labor conditions, an upsurge in crime, and the possibility of the workers overstaying. In an effort to ease such worries, the KFSB has made the manpower agencies and manufacturers responsible for the workers to lessen the chances of any untoward incidents during the training period. The manpower companies and manufacturers employing the foreign workers must deposit 100 U.S. dollars and 300,000 won, respectively, for each foreign trainee to guarantee performance of contract. This guarantee money will be collected as a penalty if the workers desert their workplaces due to an employer's illegal treatment or a supplier's negligence in management. At the same time, they are obliged to be insured against accidents so that the workers can be compensated for any industrial mishaps. However, small- and medium-sized companies insist the 20,000 workers "officially permitted" are insufficient to solve the labor shortage, noting that many other businesses are paying high commissions to manpower agencies or brokers in search of illegal foreign workers. According to the Justice Ministry, an estimated 70,000 to 80,000 foreigners are working illegally in Korea. That being the case, smaller businesses insist that an additional 30,000 to 40,000 foreign workers be allowed to come to Korea under strict controls to prevent the spread of illegal laborers.
