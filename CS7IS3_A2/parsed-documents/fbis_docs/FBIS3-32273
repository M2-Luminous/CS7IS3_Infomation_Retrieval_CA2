The Colombian Government has decided to cut its 1994 budget by 369.8 billion pesos in order to stop the revaluation of the peso and to ease the achievement of keeping the inflation under the 19-percent mark. Finance Minister Rudolf Hommes has said this will cause the budget deficit to drop to only .16 percent of the gross domestic product. The government will subtract 171.8 billion pesos from operation costs; 50 billion pesos will be saved in foreign debt payments and 98 billion pesos in investment.

Imports amounted to $8.08 billion, compared to $5.403 billion over the same period in 1992. The increase in imports was due mainly to the boom in the construction sector; coal was the only traditional export product that achieved a growth. Coal exports grew from $429 million over the first 10 months of 1992 to $463 million in 1993. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 27 Jan 94, p 1B) Antonio Pretelt Emiliani, president of the Colombian Coal Enterprise (Carbocol), announced on 27 January that Carbocol will be put on sale this year and that, although the evaluation that will allow the authorities to set its minimum price is yet to be carried out, its approximate value is $1 billion. Pretelt confirmed the government is willing to privatize the state-owned portion of the Cerrejon coal mining complex, which includes part of the railroad and the port. He also said the enterprise has reduced its liabilities by $900 million and now has only $800 million in debts. The Cerrejon Mine exported 13.8 million tons of coal during 1993 for an amount of 371.570 billion pesos ($464 million).
