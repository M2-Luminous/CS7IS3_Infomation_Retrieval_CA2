"On the contrary, our bilateral relations are getting better and better every day through cooperation agreements," he said. He also pointed out the fact that Paraguay has decided to open an embassy in Israel is a demonstration of the excellent bilateral relations. "With this, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy has kept his word," Merom stressed. The diplomat also indicated that the probable closure of his country's embassy is being evaluated by an Embassy Section Commission and that within two weeks a final decision will be made, and he emphatically rejected the fact that the decision could be linked to alleged Israeli "irritation" over military matters, as it had been given to understand. Merom also indicated that there is not a large Jewish colony in Paraguay, some 900 people. He also mentioned that his country's important decisions were made in Jerusalem, the capital, and not Tel Aviv. He reiterated that if the embassy's closure is approved, the appropriate steps will be followed and the announcement will be made in the formal manner. He pointed out that cultural and other types of cooperation agreements will follow their normal courses through a concurrent ambassador or a permanent one in Asuncion. "The current excellent relations between Paraguay and Israel will continue to progress for the satisfaction of both parties," the ambassador said. Merom also clarified that an eventual decision by his government has nothing to do with the United States, and he also denied that his government is an "unconditional ally" of the United States.
