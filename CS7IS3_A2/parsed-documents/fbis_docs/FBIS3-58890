Concerning the opening of the Community market to products from East Europe, however, he stressed that this must be a gradual process as "we cannot afford to get into a major economic and social crisis by opening up completely our trade to East European countries just as the United States cannot afford to do so." Mr. Cot feels that Europe has already "done more than its share and the American side could do a bit more."
