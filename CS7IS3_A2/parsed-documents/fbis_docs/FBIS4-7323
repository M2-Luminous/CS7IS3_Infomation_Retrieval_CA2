This development follows Mongolian Prime Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray's refusal to sign with the activists the document they had insisted upon. At his meeting with the hunger strikers he justified his refusal by saying that neither the country's Constitution nor the law on government contained any provisions about prior conclusion of agreements with individuals or organizations on the resignation of the cabinet of ministers. The prime minister urged the hunger strikers to respect the stand taken by the president, the recommendations brought by the National Security Council, and the decision passed by parliament, who all asked them to end their action. At the same time the government pledged to take into consideration a number of demands issued by the hunger strikers. Laws on press freedom and on the struggle against corruption are to be drafted in the near future.
