Anderson, Belizean ambassador to Guatemala, yesterday said his government is prepared to begin negotiations on the territorial dispute with Guatemala; adding that a commission has been created for this purpose and only the final details must be settled. The Guatemalan Government has recognized Belize's independence; therefore, we have accepted the fact that a border dispute prevails between the two countries, a situation we hope will be handled cordially, he said. Regarding the organization of a Belizean Council, the ambassador said this is considered positive because it is a sign the Guatemalan Government is prepared to begin negotiations to settle the dispute. Belize is interested in establishing trade, cultural, and sports relations, not only with Guatemala but with all of Central America; and that is one of the reasons that prompt us to be prepared to negotiate what is negotiable, Anderson said. The ambassador also said he cannot release the names of the persons who make up the Belizean commission that will participate in the negotiations, because he does not have them. He also referred to the role played by the media in the case, which is important, to establish the objective atmosphere necessary to settle relations between the States of Guatemala and Belize. The diplomat added that Belize's recognition as an independent state by the media, and the illustration of this on the region's maps, will represent a great step forward.
