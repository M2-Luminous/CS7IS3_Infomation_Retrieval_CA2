FR940513-2-00158 FR940513-2-00080 A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change (1) Purpose Pursuant to recent amendments to Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1, 6 on April 1, 1994, the Exchange's equity specialists became subject to the Commission's net capital rule. 7 Accordingly, the Exchange is proposing to amend its rules to reflect the elimination of exemption from that Rule. 8 The Exchange is also proposing to establish an additional requirement that its equity specialist firms that are subject to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement under Rule 15c3&hyph;1 must maintain a minimum net capital of $200,000. Equity specialist firms subject to the Alternative Net Capital Requirement would be required to comply with subsection (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 15c3&hyph;1. 9 The Exchange is also proposing further amendments to clarify these new requirements and to establish related procedures for specialist firms whose net capital falls below certain levels. The Exchange believes that the proposed amendments are appropriate to assure that the customers and creditors of its equity specialists are protected from monetary losses and delays in the event of a specialist's failure. 6 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1 (1993). 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737 (August 11, 1993), 58 FR 43555 (August 17, 1993). 8 On August 11, 1993, the Commission amended Rule 15c3&hyph;1, in part, to make the Commission's net capital rule applicable to certain specialists that are currently exempt from the rule (the amended Rule makes the Commission's net capital rule applicable to all specialists other than options market makers). See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 7. 9 As of April 1, 1994, the Commission's net capital rule requires the Exchange's equity specialists to maintain net capital, under the aggregate indebtedness method, equal to a minimum of $100,000 ($75,000 until June 30, 1994) and, under the alternative method, equal to a minimum of $250,000 ($200,000 until July 1, 1994). See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 7. Rule 15c3&hyph;1(a)(1)(ii) contains the Alternative Standard, which states in part, that a broker or dealer shall not permit its net capital to be less than the greater of $250,000 or 2 percent of aggregate debit items computed in accordance with Exhibit A to Rule 15c3&hyph;3. See 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1(a)(1)(ii) (1993). (a) Elimination of specialist exemption. The Exchange is proposing to amend PSE Rule 1.8(a), which currently identifies the following members as exempt from the Exchange's net capital rule: any floor broker, market maker in listed options, or specialist, registered with the Exchange in any such capacity, who is exempt from the minimum net capital requirements prescribed by Rule 2.1 (Capital Requirements). The Exchange is proposing to delete ``specialists'' from this list and to add ``lead market makers in listed options'' to the list. 10 This amendment is intended to make the Exchange's rules conform to the recent amendments to the Commission's net capital rule. 11 10 In the Commission's release adopting amendments to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 (the net capital rule), the Commission stated that it does not believe that it is necessary to apply the net capital rule to options market makers because, on an individual basis, they are not as integral to the proper functioning of the markets in their securities. The release further states that specialists other than options market makers perform several functions that options market makers do not, including the maintenance of a specialist's book containing a listing of all orders away from the current market price and the dissemination of accurate quotations in their speciality securities. Moreover, the exchanges that use options specialists look to a single specialist or specialist unit to handle all trade whereas options market makers compete with other market makers. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 7. Options lead market makers on the Exchange floor compete with other market makers for orders and do not maintain a specialist book containing a list of all orders away from the current market price. Accordingly, the Exchange believes that options lead market makers should be treated as options market makers that are exempt from Commission Rule 15c3&hyph;1 and therefore, have been exempted from the Exchange capital regulations. 11 The proposal also adds Commentary .04 to Rule 2.1, which states that members exempt from the provisions of subsections (b), (c) and (d) of Rule 2.1 are set forth in Rule 2.8(a). (b) Specialist subject to aggregate indebtedness requirement. The Exchange is proposing to adopt a rule that, notwithstanding the requirements of the Commission's net capital rule, would require each of its specialist firms that are subject to the Aggregate Indebtedness Requirement of Rule 15c3&hyph;1 to maintain a minimum net capital of not less than $200,000. The proposed rule further provides that if at any time a specialist firm's net capital falls below $200,000, such firm shall promptly notify the Financial Compliance Department of the Exchange and, in addition, such firm shall not operate as a specialist with net capital of between $150,000 and $199,999 for more than 60 days unless such firm (a) obtains from the Vice President, Regulation, or a senior officer of the Exchange written consent to continue to operate as a specialist; and (b) takes corrective action including, but not limited to, actively seeking financing to correct its net capital deficiency. 12 12 Pursuant to amendments to the Commission's net capital rule, effective April 1, 1994, Exchange equity specialists became subject to the Commission's net capital rule. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32737, supra note 7. As a result, Exchange equity specialists are required to comply generally with the provisions of the Commission's early warning notification procedures as codified in Section 17a&hyph;11 under the Act.
