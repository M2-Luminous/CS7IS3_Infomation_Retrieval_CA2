Maglaj correspondent Hajrudin Sermic reports that "the fighting on the Maglaj front has been escalating minute by minute since the early morning hours. The chetniks are relentlessly carrying on with their attacks on the free territory and its defenders. At the moment, all types of artillery and antiaircraft weapon shells are pounding the positions of the 201st Chivalrous Brigade and other [Bosnia-Herzegovina Army] units and are an introduction to infantry attacks on the (?Hedrovace)-Siprage-(?Tresjiste) line and the region of Nekolj. Civilian targets in the town and surrounding villages are also not spared. Dozens of howitzer and mortar shells have already hit and destroyed residential and business buildings. This is the tenth day that the population has been in shelters." Hamid Deronjic reports from Brcko and says that "the shelling of the free Brcko territory defense lines continued overnight. Vranovaca, Djukici, and Kladje were targeted by 80-mm and 82-mm enemy mortars. From the direction of Brod, the chetniks opened fierce Praga and machine gun fire at the defenders' positions on the central sector of the front. Overnight, all the free Brcko territory defense positions came under intensified fire from enemy infantry weapons. The air corridor over the temporarily occupied Brcko continues to be used in the continuing aggression on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Between 1800 [1700 GMT] and 1900 last night, three overflights of enemy transport helicopters were registered on the Brcko-Kicevo route; at 2045, another chetnik helicopter was sighted flying the same route." Reporting from the Bosna Operative Group Press Center in Zavidovici, correspondent Viktor Boban says that "it seems that the Washington agreement is taking hold in the Bosna Operative Group operational zone, because the confrontation lines with the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] have been mostly calm, which is not the case with the lines facing the Serbian aggressor. The defenders at Mahoje were the target of small arms and antiaircraft machine guns, and some time after 1200, 10 82-mm mortar shells fell in the wider area of Hajdarevici. The night was calm, with only sporadic small arms fire. The exception was the area of Hajdarevici, where several 82-mm mortar shells landed before midnight. Minor chetnik regrouping and movements of heavy armored combat vehicles from Mt. Ozren have been sighted. It is quiet this morning on all the stable defense lines in the Bosna Operative Group operational zone." Enes Rastusic reports from the 4th Corps Information Center on the situation on the Mostar front. He says that the "past 24 hours in the 4th Corps operational zone were marked by sporadic small arms and antiaircraft provocations along all defense lines. The cease-fire was particularly violated in the southern parts of the Mostar Commune, the free Prozor territories, and in Konjic. Our defenders are consistently observing the cease-fire and did not respond to enemy provocations. Personnel of the 4th Corps thwarted an attempt to infiltrate a [word indistinct] reconnaissance and subversion group in the region of (?Bijelimic). The demarcation lines remain unchanged and under the control of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units."
