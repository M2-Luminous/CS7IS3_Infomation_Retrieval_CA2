During a news conference following the meeting, he opposed the pilot study for a resolution that is currently under discussion in the Security Council. As I see it, he said, it is a bad project, adding that he discussed the project on 1 March in Paris with the head of French diplomacy Alain Juppe and with President Francois Mitterrand. I came out totally satisfied with those talks, said President Aristide. In its current form, according to informed sources, the pilot study to the Security Council for a resolution does not provide a date for the return to Port-au-Prince of President Aristide and will make the imposition of new sanctions depend on an active search for a settlement by President Aristide. On Saturday [5 March], Aristide is due to go to New York, where he will hold talks with UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. He indicated that he is expecting from the secretary general specifications on the points the secretary intends to discuss in the interview. Aristide added that he would promote discussions of Haiti in the Security Council. President Aristide continues to insist that General Cedras' resignation precede the nomination of a prime minister in Port-au-Prince. He did his best to minimize his divergences with the United States, which are the source of the resolution now being studied. During his news conference this morning, Father Aristide stated that the United States and France were playing a positive role in enforcing the return of democracy in Haiti. He also stated that he was totally satisfied with the talk that he held a few days ago with U.S. ambassador to the Vatican Raymond Flynn, but he recognizes that Washington sometimes speaks with forked tongue.
