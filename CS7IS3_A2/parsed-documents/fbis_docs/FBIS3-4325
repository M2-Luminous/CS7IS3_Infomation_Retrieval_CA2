Following the reform of the foreign exchange system, China clearly stipulated that foreign currencies are not to be circulated on the mainland. As the New Taiwan dollar is foreign currency, even the Xiamen special economic zone, which has independent right to legislation, will not be allowed to legislate on the circulation of foreign currency. Similarly, the circulation of Hong Kong dollar in Shenzhen and Zhuhai will be gradually ended. Chen Yuan pointed out on 25 March: The detailed rules for implementation of the regulations on management of foreign-funded financial organizations, which will be promulgated before 1 April, focus on convergence between the old and new regulations. Three state policy banks will be established in the latter half of the year, and the headquarters of the State Development and Import and Export Credit Bank will be set up in Beijing. As the mainland's agriculture is widely spread, the location of the headquarters for the Agricultural Development Bank is not yet determined. The People's Bank of China invited officials responsible for foreign-funded banks and financial organizations in China to a "Forum of Presidents of Foreign-Funded Banks" held at the Beijing Capital Guesthouse on 25 March. Chen Yuan; Zhu Xiaohua, another president of the People's Bank of China; and Luo Bochuan, deputy director of the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau, gave accounts of the mainland's financial and foreign exchange structural reform. The officials of the foreign-funded banks raised questions on relevant issues. Chen Yuan said that the regulations on management of foreign- funded financial organizations promulgated by the People's Bank of China will come into effect on 1 April. The regulations synthesize the management method for sino-foreign financial organizations, the management method for foreign-funded banks in special economic zones, and the management method for foreign-funded banks in Shanghai. When the regulations go into effect, it will bring operation of the foreign-funded banks under supervision. Detailed rules for implementation which are now being drafted by the People's Bank of China and which are expected to be promulgated before 1 April, stipulate the convergence between the old and new regulations, which will enable foreign-funded banks to readjust their businesses. When mainland China's special banks are changed to state commercial banks, the representative of the Standard Chartered Bank branch in Xiamen asked, will foreign banks be allowed to deal in renminbi business? Has the experiment of renminbi business started? Chen Yuan said that the opinions of various fields are being solicited and experiment will be conducted first. However, this does not mean that the restrictions on foreign banks dealing in renminbi business will be lifted only after the state's special banks are changed to commercial banks. The representative of the Dresdner Bank branch in Shanghai asked: The new regulations for management of foreign-funded banks allow these banks to engage in securities transactions. In fact, such a business is stated in the management regulations for foreign-funded banks and financial organizations in Shanghai. However, the competent departments in Shanghai have never approved it. Would it be the same case in the new regulations? Chen Yuan replied that the detailed rules will make further stipulations on securities transactions. But the range will be limited, which is different from the wide range of businesses that can be done abroad. The new regulations actually stipulate that foreign-funded financial organizations may engage in approved securities transactions. Mainland decrees are usually made on a long-term basis. As for the actual situation, ratification is made by the competent unit in light of needs. By the end of last year, Chen Yuan pointed out, foreign-funded financial organizations had established 302 representative offices in 193 cities and set up 98 business offices in 13 cities, with the volume of business increasing. With assets totaling $8.1 billion last year, the foreign-funded banks granted $4 billion of loans, of which 77 percent were granted to domestic enterprises, and received $4.2 billion of savings deposits. Foreign-funded banks now constitute an important component part of mainland's financial system.
