Like President Radovan Karadzic, he has had a strenuous day today, a day without a break. Professor Koljevic, you did not even have time for a break. You are waiting to join the deputies in the assembly hall any minute now. We should clarify a couple of things first. We are interested in new details regarding the talks with the UN special envoy Akashi. We informed the listeners of Belgrade Radio in the main newscast that all problems, misunderstandings, all Muslims' tricks about his arrival in Sarajevo were clarified at the very beginning of the meeting. [Koljevic] Yes, this moment is exceptionally dramatic, especially regarding foreign affairs. I think that it would not be an exaggeration to say that we are indeed dealing with war and peace, with the issue of war and peace. How important Mr. Akashi's visit is is evident from several details. He landed yesterday, not at Sarajevo airport, but at another place, because he was prevented. The airport runway was damaged by a Muslim shell. Despite this he came here. You see that he considered this very important. Second, he has assumed an extremely important role in relieving Mr. Stoltenberg of the burden of civilian matters in this sector of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. Third, he arrived in Pale today and brought us a very encouraging piece of news, namely that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] is currently engaged in civilian administration to a significantly greater degree, at least in the Sarajevo region. Therefore, the military option is further and further away. It is increasingly more a matter of individual irresponsible politicians from, I would say, Europe. Regarding the United Nations, we were today given firm guarantees that there will be no military interference, military intervention without their permission, that they are not in favor of it at all, and that they expect a peace agreement. Finally, he also brought us news from Bonn that the talks between [Bosnian President] Izetbegovic and [Croatian President] Tudjman continued, that they had a long dispute about central Bosnia last night, about the enclaves of Travnik, Vitez, and the Lasva valley, that these differences have probably been overcome today, and that some progress has been made in Bonn. Regarding the Serbian side, we gave him guarantees that we are ready to sign peace, that we will adopt a platform on that today, that under certain conditions we are ready to place some communes of former Sarajevo, excluding Pale, under UN administration. Therefore, things are moving in a positive direction, although they do not look all that great in reality. As you know, there has been some heavy fighting, some strong attacks, especially on Grbavica in Sarajevo and fierce clashes in central Bosnia. [passage omitted] [Kovacevic] Professor Koljevic, can you give us some other details. How successful were the talks that were conducted during the first visit by the new UN coordinator Akashi? [Koljevic] Relatively speaking -- everything is relative and can only be compared with what happened in the past -- the talks were exceptionally successful. We received the news today from the Croatian media and from Bonn that there is a possibility of a Muslim-Croatian union being created. We are not opposed to this at all, because we consider this to be a democratic right of both the Croatian and the Muslim peoples. Of course, we retain the right for the Serbian people to democratically decide in what way they want to be linked with these two republics of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. We here even considered a wider, more global approach. We considered offering to the European Union a possibility of creating a confederation on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, in which all individual regions that have separated themselves could freely and democratically chose the way they want to participate in an association or a confederation of Yugoslav states. Therefore, everyone would be able to decide democratically whether he wants a monetary union, or only a customs union, whether he wants firm federal links. This would be a completely democratic solution in line with the current European trend of integration of certain regions and, of course, their free choice regarding their political sovereignty. [passage omitted] [Kovacevic] As we said, in about half an hour you will join the deputies in the assembly hall to discuss the platform for the continuation of the Geneva talks. You resolutely said that if there is no real wish for peace, if the so-called Geneva peace remained here in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, nothing will come of Geneva. [Koljevic] We think that we should decidedly demonstrate to Europe, which saw how much we favor peace, that we want peace, if such peace can be established. If peace cannot be established, we can no longer fool our own people. The Serbs will not agree to the further procrastination of a solution. The Serbs can decide to fight to the end, but would much prefer an end to the fighting. However, people are not prepared for a third alternative, as could have been seen in the assembly today. I think that a platform will be adopted today, although it is difficult to predict things. I think that it will be peaceful and constructive. I think that demands set to us so far will also be discussed. I hope that under certain conditions the deputies will accept the postponement of the solution, that is, accept the UN protectorate in Sarajevo for two years at the most. Third, I think that a very important thing for us in the platform, after percentages, would be the make possible the exchange of quality for quantity, something we insisted on in the past. We think that other parties are also interested in it. Regarding other matters, it remains to be seen what will happen because the deputies will voting on them.
