Liu Chi Keung, chairman of the Flow Chart International Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, said that if effective measures are formulated to cope with changes in these factors, "Hong Kong's economy will be able to maintain its stability." The China factor is the most important one for maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity, said Liu, who is here attending the ongoing session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He said, "I think that as long as the Chinese mainland continues to implement the policy of reform and opening up and maintains the momentum of its robust economic growth, Hong Kong's economy will have a powerful backing and its market will continue to prosper." The formulation and readjustment of the mainland's economic policies will have a significant impact on Hong Kong's economic expansion, he noted. To this end, he said, the mainland should maintain the continuity of its policies, and take into consideration the interests of both big and small businesses in Hong Kong so that they will be able to gain good returns on their investment in, and trade between, the mainland and Hong Kong. Speaking of the factor within Hong Kong's own economy, he said that this is crucial to Hong Kong's continued prosperity and stability. Several big projects being undertaken in Hong Kong are, in a sense, spurring economic growth there during the present transitional period, he said. But, he added, therein also lie a number of hidden problems. He said that under the pretext of "returning wealth to the people," Hong Kong's budget unveiled recently by its finance secretary has caused a sharp rise in the prices of buildings and high inflation as well. Consequently, the future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) might face an economic slide when it takes over the management of Hong Kong's economy, he noted. He expressed the hope that relevant mainland government departments should beware of man-made chaos in Hong Kong in the financial sector during the transitional period. The future Hong Kong SAR Government should tighten control over the financial market in Hong Kong to enable the factor within Hong Kong's economy to be "sound and orderly." As for the international factor, he said that Hong Kong's economy has become a component of the global economy. Therefore, changes in the international economic environment will produce a major impact on Hong Kong's smooth transition and prosperity, he said. So far as the Hong Kong stock exchange is concerned, hundreds of millions of investment dollars from Britain, Japan, the United States and the rest of the world are often traded there daily, resulting in steep ups and downs in stock prices. "Such ups and downs will also have a tremendous impact on Hong Kong's economic growth," he pointed out. For this reason, efforts should be made to prevent international consortiums from causing man-made fluctuations in stock prices, he said. Furthermore, protectionism pursued by some countries, China's most-favored-nation trading status with the U.S., the resumption of China's membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and entrepot trade will also affect Hong Kong's economic development, he said. Counter-measures should be taken promptly to reduce the adverse effects of these factors to a minimum, he said in conclusion.
