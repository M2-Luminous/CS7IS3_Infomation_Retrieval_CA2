Nor is it necessary to explain that our standard of living increasingly depends upon the cost of electric energy, coal, gas, and fuel oil. The conference of heads of Ukraine's basic industries -- power engineering, metallurgy, and coal industry -- that was recently held at the Cabinet of Ministers showed that there will be no easy decisions. Although there was consensus on the need to reasonably restrain prices of products, the very approaches to the forming of the tariffs were not responded to unanimously. This is how deputy chairman of Ukraine's State Committee for the Utilization of Nuclear Energy Vasyl Kotko explains the position of atomic power engineers. Kotko: Atomic power engineering is perhaps the only branch of Ukraine's national economy that finished the year 1993 with a marked growth in the volume of production. However, the situation that has presently taken shape in the industry, is not simply difficult, but, one can say, catastrophic. All of the AES's [atomic electric power plants] are in an extremely difficult economic situation. Due to lack of funds, starting from the second part of 1993, virtually no fuel has been purchased. In 1993, the amount of fuel purchased was half that in 1990. Also, due to lack of funds, used nuclear fuel has not been taken out for long-term storage. Contractual relations with regard to equipment, spare parts, and scientific servicing of nuclear installations between the AES's and many suppliers have practically been severed.... Rozsokha: However, our atomic power engineering is fully cost accountable and depends upon the electric energy it produces. How could it happen that a branch with such growth in production volume has now almost become a financial bankrupt? Kotko: The explanation here is in that the atomic power engineers have produced the electric energy and sold it to the state, but the state has not paid for it. There are two reasons here. An apparent reason lies in the fact that our main and only consumer -- the National Dispatcher Center at Ukraine's Ministry of Power Engineering -- does not pay at all or does not pay regularly for the electric energy received from us. The ministry's debt to the atomic plants is presently about 550 billion karbovantsi [K], or approximately the cost of our month's operation. However, this is how the matter appears. The main cause lies in our government's policy with regard to tariffs. By fixing the prices of electric energy, coal, and gas, it is trying to curb the total growth of prices in all branches of the national economy, more specifically, to curb inflation. I will point out that, from the beginning of 1993, the tariff for the AES's remained unchanged for almost half a year. The putting into effect of every new tariff was delayed by one or two months. As a result, inflation was not stopped, but power engineering resources were strongly depleted. It is even difficult to estimate the losses. Rozsokha: What is today's rate of the electric energy produced by atomic plants? Kotko: It is presently K118 per kilowatt/hour. However, on the whole, throughout last year, our rate was at least one-half that at thermal plants. AES's represent effective power engineering. Rozsokha: Why then, in such an economic situation, can you not convince the government of the need to change the policy regarding tariffs? Kotko: The government has officially recognized the need to change the tariffs policy. Moreover, it pointed out in its resolution that the prices of electric energy must change automatically only in those cases when the prices of energy sources increase by more than 20 percent. Rozsokha: However, the Cabinet of Ministers does not fulfill its own decision. Why? Kotko: Because it realizes that an increase in the prices of energy sources will lead to an increase of prices of everything else. That is why it is trying to maintain the previously set prices as long as possible. It goes without saying that nobody -- either the population or the government -- wants to have the prices of bread, butter, and that same electric energy raised. However, this unpopular decision will later have to be adopted, but with more serious consequences. Rozsokha: How much longer can the AES's persevere if this policy with regard to tariffs continues? Kotko: I believe that we have now reached the limit and have exhausted the resources of the branch and, if such a policy continues, irreversible processes may start. I think that if the situation does not change now, we will, tomorrow, find ourselves in a situation in which stoppages of some power units and possibly also of all atomic plants successively, will be inevitable. We now need to urgently revise our tariff, which must be at least K300 per kilowatt/hour. It must change with the rate of inflation. These are two minimum mandatory conditions.
