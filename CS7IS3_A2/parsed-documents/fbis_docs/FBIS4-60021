FBIS4-60021 "drnes098dd_94004" FBIS-NES-94-098 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Palestinian Affairs Police Chief: Armed Jews Not To Enter Synagogue Police Chief: Armed Jews Not To Enter Synagogue TA1905181594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew 1505 GMT 19 May 94 TA1905181594 Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el Hebrew BFN [Text] The Palestinian police will not permit armed Jews to enter the ancient synagogue in Jericho. This was stated today by the Palestinian police commander during a visit to the site. The supreme coordinating committee on security affairs visited Jericho today to get a first-hand impression of the problems at the ancient Shalom 'Al Yisra'el synagogue. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports: [Begin recording] [Amir] The Palestinian police have so far been unsuccessful in carrying out their duties in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. This was reported this evening by security sources. The sources assert that the situation is far more serious in the Gaza Strip. In addition to the security problems, the area is also in the midst of a crime wave with the victims being the Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip and Israeli citizens inside the Green Line. The situation is far from satisfactory in Jericho either. The supreme coordinating committee on security affairs headed by Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami' and General Ziyad al-Atrash held a meeting at the coordinating committee offices near the entrance to Jericho. They were accompanied by the commander in chief of the Palestinian police, Nasr Yusuf, who, speaking near the ancient synagogue in Jericho, said that his men would not permit armed Jews to enter the synagogue because according to the Cairo agreement the Palestinians were responsible for security in the vicinity of the synagogue. The Cairo agreement does not permit armed people to visit the area. We are responsible for security in this area, Nasr Yusuf stressed. We will protect anyone visiting this place, he said. While Nasr Yusuf was speaking, armed yeshiva students were inside the synagogue. The Palestinian police commander was apparently expressing his opinion on the matter and it will be brought up for discussion before the coordinating committee on security affairs. It should be noted that since the entry of the Palestinian police force into Jericho on 13 May, several disagreements have arisen between them and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] representatives on the coordinating committee with regard to the routes followed by the joint patrols and the interpretation of the Cairo agreement with regard to responsibility for the ancient synagogue. Joint patrols have deviated from their scheduled routes. Stationary patrols, which were meant to intervene only in specially defined cases, drove up to the gates of Jewish settlements such as Elisha' and Na'ama. Jordan Valley settlers have complained that since the inception of Palestinian Autonomy there has been a wave of thefts of agricultural equipment and produce, a mini-tractor, and even an Uzi submachine gun was stolen from the home of a resident of Tomer. Palestinian Police Commander Nasr Yusuf appealed to the residents of the Jericho autonomous area and asked them to help the Palestinian policemen to uphold law and order now that the Israeli occupation has ended forever.

For example, four days ago, someone broke into a house in the settlement of Tomer, stole the owner's Uzi submachine gun, and fled on a mini-tractor that had been parked nearby. The settlers claim that an IDF jeep pursued the thief up to the entrance to the village of al-'Awja'. Since this village is situated inside the Palestinian autonomy, the IDF soldiers broke off the chase at the village gates." The report notes that "the IDF takes a grave view of this phenomena. The local commanders, during a vociferous meeting two days ago, promised the settlers that they would take action to resolve the problem."]
