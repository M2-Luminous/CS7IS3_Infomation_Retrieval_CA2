"We are preparing our negotiations with Geest and the government intends to get more active in the negotiations with Geest in the future," he said. "We can't leave it entirely up to the (Banana Growers) Association because they do not have the expertise to deal with this critical issue." Mitchell was providing an update on the government's position on bananas and the outcome of recent discussions with Phillipe Darmuzey, the European delegate to the Caribbean. He said action was to be taken on three fronts as far as the european union was concerned. Efforts are to be made to access Stabex [expansion not given] funds provided under the Lome Convention as compensation for loss of earnings on exports of bananas. The possibility of accessing funds under the Lome VI regional indicative programme for agricultural assistance and bananas particularly was also addressed, Mitchell said. Funds under this programme were recently dislodged following discussions with European officials in Brussels, he said. "Now that the Greek presidency is taking certain initiatives in the European Union we discussed how we could assist the process in lobbying or by any other activity in ensuring we have a special assistance fund developed for assistance of the banana industry," Mitchell reported. On the question of a reported proposal by the U.S. company Chiquita to purchase bananas from the Windward Islands, Mitchell said no proposal had been put forward. "We are prepared to look at all the options but I would not want to interfere with the long-standing understanding relationship with geest unless I were to see something substantial," Mitchell said. A one-year interim contract with geest expired at the end of 1993 and the Governments of Grenada, Dominica, St Lucia and St Vincent and the Grenadines and banana officials are preparing to re-negotiate. Officials of the Windward Islands Banana Association (Winban) have prepared a document for perusal by governments and industry officials going into the negotiations. Sources said the removal of a clause which binds the Windward Islands to selling bananas exclusively to Geest is among the proposals which Winban has made.
