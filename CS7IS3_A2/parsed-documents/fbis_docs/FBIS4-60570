He described the statement as being one of a string of lies, and as being totally unsupported by the facts. He stressed that harbors and airports in the DRY were safe. He said: We take full responsibility for protecting ships and aircraft using these ports. The deputy chairman also stated: We are capable, with the help of almighty God, and by virtue of the power of our Naval and Air Forces, of maintaining total control of the Republic's waters and airspace. Brother 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri warned the Sanaa regime against attempting to attack DRY ports, as a gamble of this sort would result in a decisive response. He said: Were it not but for our concern for the interests and resources of our people in the north, we would be capable of imposing a total maritime blockade on al-Hudaydah (?and al-Mukha). The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council warned the regime in Sanaa against exploiting our spirit of responsibility by issuing inane statements during the weak and chaotic situation that that regime is currently experiencing.
