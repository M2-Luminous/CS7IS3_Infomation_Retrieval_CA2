What will happen afterwards? Most likely, after exhibiting affecting manners, Denktas will reply to Butrus-Ghali on blank paper or even orally. And of course, he will tell him what he said in his second negative letter. That is, he will reply semi-positively to Butrus-Ghali's question of whether he agrees to discuss the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. Therefore, the ball will be in our court again. We cannot throw it back, so we will start playing. That is, we will begin discussing the CBM's. This is approximately how ?hings will develop and this is why we must stop having illusions: We either participate in such a discussion or we do not. And if Kliridhis' stance so far has been to discuss the CBM's, then we must make preparations now. We must not lose any more time.
