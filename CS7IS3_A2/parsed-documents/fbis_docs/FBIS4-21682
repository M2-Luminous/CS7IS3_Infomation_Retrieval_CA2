"The adoption of a presidential statement focusing on dialogue has helped to ease tension and gives the countries and organizations concerned some time leeway," Qian told a delegation of Japan's Social Democratic Party (SDP). The SDP is the largest group in Japan's seven-party coalition. After one week of diplomatic bargaining with China, which firmly opposed the adoption of any resolution against its longtime ally North Korea, the 15-member Security Council on Thursday issued a nonbinding presidential statement urging Pyongyang to allow the completion of international inspections of its nuclear facilities. The statement did not include a threat of sanctions should North Korea continue to refuse the inspections, but said "further Security Council consideration will take place if necessary in order to achieve full implementation" of nuclear safeguards Pyongyang signed with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Noting that the statement has nonbinding character, Qian said, however, he hopes "that it can be avoided that such a situation occurs." He suggested that the IAEA explain to Pyongyang why inspections carried out over two weeks in March are considered inadequate to decide whether Pyongyang has diverted nuclear material for weapon purposes. Pyongyang, while maintaining that its nuclear program serves strictly civilian purposes, contends it fully complied with the IAEA inspection demands. The SDP delegation headed by Issei Inoue arrived on Friday for talks with Chinese leaders and representatives of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). In a meeting with Li Shuzheng, head of the International Liaison Department of the party's Central Committee, on Friday both sides agreed to dispatch another SDP delegation to China in mid-May to mark the 10th anniversary of relations between their parties, SDP officials said.
