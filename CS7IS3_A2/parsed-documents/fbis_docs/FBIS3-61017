Maucharov and Candidate of Technical Sciences A. Lapin under the rubric "The Floor to the Test Pilots": "A Good Aircraft Means a Well-Tested One"] [Text] The flight testing of the latest combat aircraft is one of the most labor-intensive and crucial stages in the overall process of realizing the program of equipping the Air Forces and naval aviation of the Russian Federation with them. It is namely at that stage, after all, that an objective evaluation is made of the new ideas and engineering solutions made inherent by the designers in their aircraft, and the fine tuning of the whole aircraft system is performed. The suitability of a prototype for the performance of the combat tasks that define its purpose is evaluated, and recommendations on the possibility of putting the aircraft system into service and beginning series production are made, only according to the results of full-scale ground and flight check-out and testing under conditions that approximate operational ones. Flight testing itself, including the preparations for it, makes up more than half of the amount and duration of the time and financial resources allocated for the creation of an aircraft system. A good aircraft means a well-tested one. This exceedingly topical subject has already been raised in the article by test pilot A. Akimenkov, "What Keeps Our Aircraft From Being Better" (AVIATSIYA I KOSMONAVTIKA No. 7, 1990). The author invited interested readers to discuss it. We would thus like to dwell, relying on many years of personal experience in participating in the testing and refinement of new aircraft systems, on the principal shortcomings that are characteristic of the process of creating and adopting aircraft hardware in the field, and try to determine ways of eliminating them. We would note, first and foremost, that the amount and duration of flight testing and its quality and effectiveness depend on many factors, some of which are fundamental. We will thus begin the process with an analysis of the process of formulating the preliminary specifications (TTZ). These are traditionally prepared on the basis of the results of scientific research and experimental inquiry that are performed at the corresponding institutions of the customer and the principal executor, a comprehensive and objective analysis of the conceptual framework of the combat aircraft from the standpoint of its feasibility, the effective utilization of world scientific and technical achievements and actual capabilities for the creation of the new aircraft system with the assigned characteristics within the stipulated time frame. All of the enumerated conditions are unfortunately far from fulfilled in domestic practice. And the point is not, as Akimenkov asserts, that the lead executor taking part in the formulation of the conceptual framework of a combat aircraft system supposedly "possesses every reason both to force his point of view onto the problem and to defend his own interests first and foremost," or even that "by the moment of write-up of the TTZ the final decision, as a rule, has been made." These assertions do not conform to reality. The chief reason, in our opinion, is the fact that the realization of the TTZ in experimental design is not supported by the requisite scientific, engineering and production potential in industry; the full set of equipment and assemblies for the aircraft system reaches flight testing, as a rule, without proper autonomous and comprehensive working out owing to the restricted operating capabilities of the test-bench and modeling bases, means of preliminary assessment of the operability of aircraft systems in the course of physical testing (using flying laboratories and models and flight-modeling systems) and other reasons that are sometimes of a purely organizational nature. The results of the fulfillment of the comprehensive program of testing of an aircraft system depend, to no small extent, on the technology for performing the flight testing that was formulated at the stage of preliminary design engineering of the new aircraft, the completeness of the implementation of measures within the framework of preparing the airfield technical gear of the test bases, the test-track equipment and the flight-control and target-guidance systems, the degree of simulation of hypothetical operation, the quality of the target equipment on the test range etc. The arrival of the prototypes for the performance of ground and flight testing according to plan is also an exceedingly material factor. The resolution of all of these issues is largely conditioned by the organizational structure of the testing process--the principles for its planning, control and monitoring, the forms of interaction between the general customer and the principal executor and between military scientific institutions and organizations within those agencies, the clear-cut division of responsibilities (including financial) for the quality and deadlines for support and the performance of concrete types of ground and flight operations. We cite as confirmation summary indicators of the flight testing (its overall duration, the number of flights within a fixed calendar period, the quantity and rate of deliveries of prototypes for testing) of the Su-24, MiG-25, MiG-23, MiG-31 domestic combat aircraft and the analogous American F-111, F-15C/D, F-14 and F-16. We will moreover proceed from the fact that we, as well as our colleagues across the ocean, adhere to the following conceptual model for the performance of flight testing: the realization of a comprehensive program should be fit into a stipulated time period, with the achievement of more complete conformity of the characteristics of the aircraft prototype to the requirements of the TTZ, and the expenditures should not exceed the amount of financing allocated. The duration of the testing of domestic prototypes of aircraft, with virtually the identical number of aircraft (14) submitted for flight and ground operations, proved to be almost twice that of the foreign ones (6 and 3.5 years respectively). This is despite the fact that flight programs in the United States exceed our analogous ones by 70--80 percent, since the Americans conduct testing across a broader range of conditions for the combat application of the aircraft (this pertains to the target and jamming environments on the test ranges, and climate and other conditions). Their program moreover includes all the types of field (operational) testing necessary to resolve the the issue of putting the prototype into service. The markedly longer period for the testing of domestic aircraft systems compared to the United States is connected with the low rate of test flights (350 and 850 a year respectively); the average annual flying time of our experimental aircraft is thus 2.5 times less than the American ones. Such a large difference in the flight utilization of the aircraft being tested is in this case the consequence of a number of reasons: --first, the low level of finishing of the individual constituent elements that are installed in domestic experimental aircraft, and the incompleteness of equipment ready for operation in the prototypes being tested; --second, the greater losses of flight time caused, in turn, by the necessity of eliminating design and production shortcomings and defects that are revealed and the performance of finishing and reconditioning work, as well as the imposition of a number of restrictions for weather conditions and bans on flights; --third, the insufficiently broad scope of the concurrent testing and refinement of experimental prototypes of scientific-research and experimental work on test benches, modeling systems and flying laboratories; --fourth, the poor incorporation into flight-test practice of automated systems for the processing and analysis of flight information in real time, as well as the control of the flight experiment from a joint command post. More than 70 percent of the calendar year here, all in all, is not spent for conducting test flights. Roughly half of them (by and large in the initial stages) moreover do not work through their flight assignments fully for various reasons (poor reliability of the physical equipment, prevailing test conditions etc.). This naturally requires that they be repeated, leading to a significant increase in the time and material expenditures relegated for the realization of the whole program. The rate of delivery of aircraft prototypes is an extremely important factor affecting the duration of aircraft testing. A procedure has been established in the United States, for example, under which all prototypes arrive for testing by and large within the first two years of its start. A broad range of work to finish up and refine constituent elements and the aircraft system as a whole is thus ensured thereby. The principal delivery of aircraft here, on the contrary, is made during the second half of the testing period, which leads to the inefficient utilization of the inventory and, as a result, to poor results in the realization of the overall program. The average statistical data cited pertain chiefly to fourth-generation fighters whose testing was conducted in the 1970s. Let us now compare the testing of the latest F-15E and Su-27 fighters. The characteristic features of the F-15E that represent a profound modification of the F-15C/D aircraft are the efficient utilization of organic systems of on-board equipment and weaponry that have acquitted themselves well; their modification and modernization in accordance with the high requirements posed for tactical and combat performance characteristics of the aircraft system, reliability and operational service life; and, the limited incorporation of fundamentally new engineering that nonetheless ensures the fulfillment of the requirements posed for the aircraft prototype as a whole in the TTZ. The program of creating a new combat fighter and equipping it for the Air Force, in accordance with the practice that has taken shape in the United States over the last decade, was entrusted to a supervisor who possessed broad authority and the corresponding staff apparatus, including a joint testing team. The composition of that team included representatives of the testing and operational subunits of the Air Force and the developer firms. The testing was conducted according to uniform plans, programs and techniques for flight and ground operations with overall technical and economic support. The course of the operations and the results of testing were moreover under the constant observation and monitoring of the customer from the very start. The composite schedule for the flight testing of the F-15E envisaged gradually bringing its individual constituent elements, and the aircraft as a whole, to the assigned parameters. The comprehensive plan encompassed an eight-year period, the first half of which (from 1983 through 1986) was devoted to conducting ground and flight operations before the experimental prototypes arrived for flight testing. The power plant, external fuel tanks, on-board radar set, digital flight control system etc. were all finished up during that time. The whole program, proceeding from dedicated tasks, was subdivided into stages. Responsibility was divided in clear-cut fashion between the customer and the principal developer firm in each of the stages (depending on the content of the operations, the tasks that faced the testing team and specific organizational and departmental features), both on questions of both logistical and metrological support and in the performance of concrete experimental research. Questions of a financial and economic nature were comprehensively discussed therein. The dedicated planning of operations was furthermore oriented first and foremost toward the widespread utilization of supermodern computers, providing for the processing and analysis of information in real time; toward modeling and the active management of the flight experiment in conjunction with the testing, which made it possible to obtain more complete data promptly; and, toward reducing risks when making the test flights. The program envisaged, aside form this, the separate finishing up and comprehensive check-out of the functionality of various systems of the aircraft system depending on the degree of their completion. It must be noted that the start of the next stage of the operations did not depend on the completion times of the prior one. Most of the types of testing were conducted in parallel, with a regard for the planned delivery of experimental aircraft and their constituent elements. This procedure made it possible to augment the quality of the constituent systems and the aircraft as a whole as early as during the course of the testing itself, in essence realizing the principle of "separate start--simultaneous finish." The first experimental F-15E was officially turned over to the Air Force Flight Center for further testing just two months after making its first flight (it was required by the developer to clarify the allowable flight modes). The preliminary refinement testing of the principal constituent parts of the aircraft system was started at once at the flight center in accordance with the procedure stipulated by the U.S. Department of Defense. The autonomous and comprehensive verification of the functionality of the on-board electronics equipment, navigational and flight-control gear and weapons systems was accomplished chiefly using flying laboratories and specialized land bases. The effectiveness of the new combat aircraft as a whole was subsequently evaluated. Field testing was conducted, in parallel with the pursuit of this set of measures, by the corresponding subunits of the Air Force under a so-called accelerated program--the combat qualities and operational suitability of the aircraft were comprehensively evaluated, overall guidelines for raising them were devised and the retraining of flight, engineering and technical personnel was conducted. The initial combat flight of the F-15E was thus provided for, as was planned, in the middle of 1990. The performance of testing and refinement of the aircraft in such a short time (just four years) was largely facilitated by the observance of the optimal schedule for the delivery of experimental prototypes (three the first year, two the second and one the third) and the high rate of test flights (an average of ten per aircraft per month). The latter was achieved thanks to the efficient utilization of those airfield means that supported the possibility of the safe performance of flights virtually around the clock and under any weather conditions, the efficient management of the flight experiment from the ground, the processing and analysis of flight information in real time, the aerial refueling of the aircraft while performing individual tasks and a host of other measures, including some of an organizational-technical nature. A large proportionate share of new structural and design ideas being embodied for the first time in the aerodynamic configuration, aircraft and weapons control systems, piloting and navigational equipment and on-board defensive systems was typical of the Su-27, as opposed to the F-15E. The testing of the Su-27 was conducted in accordance with the practices of many years that have taken shape here, which are based to a certain extent on prevailing statutes on the procedure for creating aircraft for military purposes. The fulfillment of the whole flight program, according to the results of which the decision was made to put the aircraft system into service, required about 13 (!) years--three times more than the Americans needed to test and adopt the F-15E. Such a prolonged period for the testing of the Su-27 by today's standards, aside from the other reasons indicated, was also connected with the poor flight return on the inventory of experimental aircraft (an average of four flights a month per aircraft). The following should be kept in mind first and foremost in discussing the quality of the latest domestic combat aircraft. The look of the "standard" prototype, as well as recommendations pertaining to the procedure for putting it into service and submitting it for series production, was formulated according to the results of state testing--which does not include, as has already been emphasized, specific questions of field testing--in accordance with prevailing directive documents governing the course of testing and the adoption of combat aircraft into service. The final decision is made by the government, as represented by the Ministry of Defense. State interests, connected first and foremost with the plans for equipping the Air Forces (or Navy) with a combat aircraft system, the process of assimilating new production technologies and the functional aging of the aircraft, and conditioned in particular by the duration of the period of its creation, are entirely naturally taken into account therein. This, and a host of other aspects, could have a marked impact on the decision on the fate of a prototype even before its field testing, during which experience in the operation and combat application of the new aircraft is accumulated. The elimination of a number of shortcomings revealed in the course of that testing and the making of the necessary refinements to individual constituent parts of the aircraft system, under the procedure that exists here, are accomplished in the stage of series production, which slows the process of the entry of the new aircraft into service as a result. In order for this not to happen, it is essential, in our opinion, to make a fundamental review ahead of time of the basic principles for the organization of operations in the creation of new combat aircraft with an orientation toward foreign experience (and first and foremost the United States). And we would like to single out the basic steps aimed at reducing the time frames and material expenditures in developing aviation hardware, as well as increasing its quality, in this regard. The program for the creation and field adoption of combat aircraft, it seems to us, should be formulated and realized by a collegial body of the type of a state interagency council, headed by a supervisor of the program (named either by the general customer or the lead executor) who would exercise overall leadership and coordination of the work, answer for its performance in the required amount and be given the powers of a legal person to conclude contracts, expend financial resources, perform monitoring, employ sanctions etc. A comprehensive program containing all the types of operations and the measures supporting them that are required for the scientific and technical substantiation of the TTZ and the performance of experimental design (design engineering, manufacture and testing), in an amount necessary for the evaluation of the constituent elements and the prototype as a whole in accordance with the preliminary specifications and the overall technical requirements of the Ministry of Defense, should be at the foundation of the activity of the council. A joint testing team, composed of representatives of the corresponding organizations of the customer and the executor, should be one of the principal structural subdivisions of the council. Its direct participation in operations at all stages of the creation of an aircraft system--from the formulation of the TTZ right through to its adoption in line units--is mandatory therein. The testing team should become the principal executor of the schedule of flight testing, which envisages a whole set of operations to refine the prototype as well as to perform field testing, according to a program whose fulfillment would make it possible to draw fully substantiated conclusions on the expediency of putting the aircraft into service and starting its series production. The combat aircraft systems being created should complete joint (with the simultaneous participation of the executor and the customer) state testing (SGI). SGI, as compared to the flight-design or state testing that is currently conducted by these agencies independently, has the following advantages: --the overall organization of the planning, management and monitoring of the preparation and performance of flight and ground operations would undoubtedly lead to a reduction in the expenditures of time and material resources, including through an increase in the rate and efficacy of test flights; --the implementation of flexible planning would provide an opportunity to adjust the course of operations at various stages in the creation of an aircraft system, and to make timely decisions in that regard; --uniform requirements would finally be devised for test-track complexes, target equipment at test ranges, the technological support of operations and the techniques for evaluating the characteristics of a prototype being tested; --a real opportunity would appear for the clear-cut delimitation of functions and responsibility among all of the testing participants on questions of coordination, the efficient utilization of the testing physical plant, the experimental and auxiliary aircraft inventory, airfield and test-range equipment, systems of automated information processing and databases for the management of flight experiments that are common to all parties; --a unification of the efforts of the highly skilled engineering and flight personnel of the testers and the military specialists in the operational subunits would certainly have an effect on raising the scientific and technical level of operations and the safety of the test flights, make it possible to resolve issues of the refinement of aircraft systems promptly and reduce to a minimum the expenditures of time and the consumption of material resources during the period of assimilation of series production of the new hardware and the start of its entry into service with line units; --SGI, as opposed to the program of aircraft testing being practiced today in which the principle of its division according to departmental traits is inherent, would envisage its realization depending on the requirements for the stage-by-stage refinement of the constituent elements of the aircraft system; --a separate stage of SGI could be allotted to measures (carried out with the aim of issuing findings for the production of a limited lot of the aircraft) whose results would make it possible to determine the range of fulfillment of work operations projected earlier, and to evaluate in comprehensive fashion the conditions for its full-scale series production and successful assimilation in line units; --special testing could also be performed (as one of the stages in the overall program), by decision of the program supervisor, to reveal the specific features of the field operation of the prototype and further improvements in its combat characteristics. The following must also be noted: preliminary (plant) flight testing of the aircraft should be conducted--during the process of which it would be possible to evaluate the functionality of all systems and, if necessary, bring them to a level that reliably supports the safe performance of flights under SGI--before beginning SGI. We would like to hope that these recommendations will be taken into account to a certain extent when the conceptual framework for a new statute on the creation of aircraft for military purposes is formulated under today's difficult economic conditions.
