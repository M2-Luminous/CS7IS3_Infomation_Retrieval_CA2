Nateq-Nuri underscored the need for promotion of political and economic cooperation between the two Muslim countries. He also condemned the UN secretary general's indifference towards the rights of the Bosnian Muslims and suggested that Muslim countries should mobilize their forces to defend them. Mohamed termed as "successful" the visit to Malaysia of Nateq-Nuri and said that such visits provide most suitable opportunities for making decision on broadening bilateral ties. He said that his country was interested in enhancing relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and that he had issued necessary orders in this regards after he returned from a recent official visit to Tehran. Touching on the status quo in Bosnia-Herzegovina [B-H], he said the UN opposed despatch of the Iranian forces to that country under the pretext of their siding with the Bosnian Muslims, while it allowed pro-Serb Russians to be present there. "The UN is responsible in this connection and we condem the UN secretary general for his action," Malaysian prime minister said. He called on Muslims to patch up their differences and instead adopt a unified decision to solve the problems of the Muslim world. The two sides also discussed exports of the Iranian non-oil commodities to Malaysia, and implementation of joint projects.
