The 1997 meeting will be the 30th anniversary of the bank's founding. Fujii made the invitation in a speech before the ADB's 27th Annual General Meeting that opened in Nice on Tuesday for a three-day run as the Manila-based financial institution faces the task of raising its capital base. If the proposal is accepted, it would be the first in 10 years and the third time for Japan to host an ADB annual meeting following the 20th meeting held in Osaka in 1987. Fujii said the Japanese city has played an historical role in promoting ties with the Asia-Pacific region and its importance will be greater in the region. Turning to the issue of raising the bank's capital, Fujii appealed for endorsing a bank proposal to double the capital to smooth disbursement of bank loans to meet growing funding needs in the Asia-Pacific region, whose economy is expected to grow faster than any other region. A vote on the capital increase is scheduled for May 22. Fujii also pointed to the need for the bank to shift away from development-oriented financial help to fighting poverty and developing social infrastructures such as health and medical facilities and protecting the environment. He also pointed to difficult fiscal conditions in member countries and called for the bank to provide funds in an efficient manner. Before giving the speech, Fujii met with U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman to discuss pending bilateral economic issues, according to Japanese officials. Fujii told Altman that Japan has not changed its policy of promoting economic reforms and deregulation despite a recent cabinet reshuffle and is ready to pass the overdue fiscal 1994 national budget as early as possible while carrying out tax reforms, they said. The issue of how to stabilize exchange rates was also on the agenda, they said.
