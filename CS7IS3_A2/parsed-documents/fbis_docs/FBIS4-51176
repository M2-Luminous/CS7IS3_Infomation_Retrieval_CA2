Hong Kong and Macao reporters must first be approved by the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and invited by local authorities before they can go to the mainland to cover relevant news. Reporters not passing such procedures must not be received. HSIN PAO was told by officials of the relevant departments in a number of provinces and municipalities that in the past although there were regulations controlling activities of reporters from outside the mainland, many provinces and municipalities were still willing to receive such reporters and arrange news covering activities in order to give broader publicity to the local investment environment. The local authorities did not care whether the reporters came with the approval of the authorities concerned. However, after the Xi Yang incident, the external propaganda departments of all provinces and municipalities received a central instruction which required them to strictly enforce regulations on activities of reporters from outside the mainland. Hong Kong and Macao reporters should first achieve the approval of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch and the invitation of the local authorities before they can cover news inside the mainland. If any Hong Kong and Macao reporters conduct news covering without such approval, their activities are illegal and must be banned. Mainland officials also indicated that the number of Hong Kong and Macao reporters who applied to cover news on the mainland recently decreased obviously. In particular, after Xi Yang was sentenced to imprisonment, many provinces and municipalities received almost no applications to cover news from Hong Kong and Macao reporters. As for some Hong Kong reporters' boycott of covering news on the mainland, some local officials there said that the Hong Kong reporters should not take such action, which would certainly affect their future work inside the mainland. In the past, when the local governments of the mainland invited Hong Kong reporters to cover news, they often named the institutions and the reporters being invited. If reporters who were invited refused to go or if the mass media organs changed people, the mainland institutions that issued the invitations would have to seek endorsement from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch again. Now, as some Hong Kong reporters openly signed the boycott statement, it is believed that they will be facing more restrictions from the mainland authorities concerned in the future if they are still invited or if they themselves take the initiative in applying to cover news inside the mainland. Officials in some south China cities said that because Hong Kong people viewed the case of Xi Yang from an angle different from the viewpoint of mainland people, they quite understood why Hong Kong reporters signed the boycott statement. However, they also hoped that Hong Kong reporters would act more sensibly and would not affect their future work. So far, many provinces and cities have not received the namelist of the reporters involved in the boycott from the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch.
