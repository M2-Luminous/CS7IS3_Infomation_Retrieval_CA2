To this end, Malaysia has exerted efforts to make its presence felt. The principle of opening one's door to the outside world without losing one's own traits is strictly applied to everyday activities in Malaysia. The country consists of people of different races with Malaysians accounting for 53 percent of the population and Chinese, Indians, and other foreign nationals representing the rest of the population. Although Malaysians belong to different religions, they all get along very well. Malaysians regard Vietnam as a true friend. Therefore, on the very first day of their visit, General Secretary Do Muoi and other Vietnamese guests were invited to attend the 10th General Meeting of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. Reporting on this event, major newspapers in Malaysia carried headlines saying that this was a unique dialogue. At that meeting, General Secretary Do Muoi answered many questions raised by the delegates. In response to a question posed by a famous British film producer as to whether Vietnam, while implementing its open-door policy, is worried about the influence of foreign cultures on its national traits, General Secretary Do Muoi emphatically said: We welcome mankind's cultural quintessence and cultural activities that help promote friendship, enrich the sense of aesthetics, and perfect the good personality of the Vietnamese people. Before leaving Malaysia, General Secretary Do Muoi granted an interview to correspondents of the Voice of Vietnam and the Vietnam Television Network on the results of his visit to Malaysia. He said: [Begin Do Muoi recording] It can be said that my visit has yielded very encouraging results. Our Malaysian friends have accorded the Vietnamese delegation a very warm welcome. We witnessed many building projects everywhere we went. I am convinced that by the year 2020, Malaysia will achieve its economic objectives of turning itself into a developed industrialized country. Our Malaysian friends highly value the renovation process in Vietnam and hope that our country will reach a relatively quick growth rate within a short period of time. His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed and I are pleased to note that so far, the friendship and cooperation between the two countries have developed very well. Both of us hope that together with the recent visits by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed, my current visit will contribute to consolidating and strengthening bilateral cooperative ties a step further. His Excellency Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed said: It is necessary for Vietnam to move forward, effect changes for the better, and enrich itself, thereby helping create conditions for Malaysia and other neighboring countries to score better development results.
