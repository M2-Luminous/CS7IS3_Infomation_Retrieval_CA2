Interfax has learned that this decision was adopted at a conference chaired by Russia's First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets on Friday. The Finance Ministry was proposed to foresee an appropriate level of military order financing before sending the state budget to the State Duma. Conference participants pointed out that a sharp reduction of defense order would result in unrecoverable consequences for the country's defense potential and would necessitate social compensation payments in accordance with the legislature. As participants of the conference note, they will exceed possible economy from the reduction of the defense order planned earlier by Rbs [Rubles] 2-3 Tn (Trillion]. The conference particularly considered the proposal of the First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin on the mechanism to end the crisis in defense enterprises, which also produce civilian products.
