According to eyewitnesses, when the director of one of the best health resorts in the republic told his staff that the seminar participants would be staying there, many of the staff cried for joy. The patients, upon hearing the news, "themselves packed their belongings and went home, saying that they would finish their treatment later, and many of them were crying for joy and praying" (only the most seriously ill stayed). The guests, who despite the fears of the organizing committee came not only from the Northern Caucasus republics but also from the United States, Syria, Kazakhstan, the Crimea, Moscow and Lithuania, were received with hospitality that exceeded the wildest expectations. On the first evening the road-weary visitors were placed in mud baths, sulfur baths and other therapeutic baths, anyone who wanted got a special water massage, and then all were given showered with food and drink. Furthermore, as later became known, it was not just female attendants and nurses who smilingly carried away dirty plates and glasses and attended to the guests' every whim, but also an anesthesiologist, surgeons and even the head of the surgical department. The visitors were somewhat confused to see the pistols hanging from the belts of the health resort's director and several conference participants, something that was particularly noticeable when they were dancing the lezginka with their jackets off, as well as automatic weapons in the hands of numerous young people, both in uniform and in civilian clothing. However, local residents assured them that "this was the custom" and that the young people were presidential guards assigned to protect the guests. It should be noted that the only shooting on the streets was at weddings, in honor of the brides, something that has been done in Chechnya since time immemorial. The streets themselves were cleaner than in Moscow, and new paving machines purchased in the FRG (for $6,000,000) have already begun repairing road surfaces. The conference was opened by Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, who immediately set the mood among those attending. Since, he said, previous crimes against humanity have gone unpunished, genocide is now on the rise. The U.N., said the president, "on which the citizens of the USSR pinned their hopes, has usurped the right to human life." In his opinion, in Russia there are no democrats, the West's human rights activism is a mere "fig leaf," and as a result genocide is becoming ever more refined and overt: "Russia's troops and armored units are cavorting across the entire USSR, showing off their might," said Mr. Dudayev. Incidentally, the zealousness of many speakers at the conference is not without justification -- in the period between 1792 and 1943-44 the Chechen people were removed from their homeland six times. Eyewitnesses to the deportation of the Chechens during the Great Patriotic War tell how NKVD troops shot down or burned alive the disabled, the sick and children, hunted down in the mountains those who managed to escape, mined their homes, and left poisoned food scattered about in the forests. The story of the life and death of many Chechen people in exile is a story worthy of respect. Also known to us are the suffering of the Shapsug people, who for many years have been attempting to establish an ethnic territory near Sochi, of the Crimean Tatars, who have returned home and have had to spend four years living outside Simferopol in tents and houses hastily pieced together out of any materials available, and of the Ingush, who dream of returning to their homes in North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon. However, despite the fact that virtually every speaker declared that he did not in any way blame the Russian people as a whole, and that "those to blame for the genocide were the rulers of the time," a general anti-Russia sentiment could clearly be felt. Russia was accused of "considering the Chechen an inferior people incapable of governing a state," and of intentionally preventing the Chechen people from obtaining education. A former republic procurator read an entire treatise on persecution suffered by the Chechens in the Russian Federation in 1993-94, about how they were beaten and convicted, how people's assemblies forced them to move. Incidentally, these new facts were not accompanied by any information as to why the Chechen are still being subjected to persecutions that are not always unfounded (unless one counts the decree by Yuriy Luzhkov, which has been condemned by the world community). However, one should not think that now Russians are being subjected to physical violence by of the Chechens: Dzhokhar Dudayev warned that "any violence against the Russian-speaking population will be regarded on a par with the most serious crime" and, as one Russian resident of Groznyy said, "it is much safer for Russians to live here than it is for the Chechens." Speakers addressing the conference accused Russia of great-power chauvinism, demanded that it give a legal, political and moral assessment of "cases of genocide," and that it make compensation for damages suffered by Chechnya during the last deportation (according to estimates by Chechen experts, a total of R522 billion [rubles]). In the opinion of a majority of those attending the conference, all "of Russia's crimes against humanity from the 17th century up to the present day" should be considered and condemned by the International Court and Tribunal. Russian recognition of Chechnya's sovereignty, speakers stated, is "the only real guarantee there will be no more deportations." For fairness' sake it should be noted that not everyone in the ChRI [Chechen Republic of Ichkeria] defends its sovereignty so resolutely. Many people I spoke with would prefer for the republic to remain a part of Russia, though on certain conditions. Ruslan Khasbulatov, former speaker of the Russian Federation parliament, is very popular among the Chechens, and many people dream of seeing him as head of state, because "he is a real politician, whereas Dzhokhar Dudayev is more practically oriented and has a poor understanding of foreign policy." On 21 May, in honor of the end of the Russian-Caucasus War, ChRI President Dzhokhar Dudayev issued an edict declaring that from that time forward the day would be celebrated as the republic's national holiday: the Day of the Beginning of Caucasian Peoples' Rebirth. In addition he decided to delight those attending the conference and apparently at the same time demonstrate to them his firm decision to create an independent state with all the appropriate attributes. He issued an edict awarding banners to the republic's armed forces. Banners were received by 12 units of Chechnya's regular army: the presidential guard, the military college, the special operations regiment (formerly the Abkhazian Regiment), the assault brigade, the Shalinskiy Armor Regiment, the internal troops, the firefighting troops, the border brigade, the missile and artillery unit, the air force, the airborne troops, and the aviation school. Then, to the tune of a military march and the roar of low-flying fighter jets, the troops passed in review before the generals and the president on Freedom Square. The president was dressed in military uniform and was wearing all of his USSR decorations and medals. The president of the ChRI, accompanied by the vice-president, attended the conference all three days it was in session, speaking twice. The second time was to deliver a report in which he praised the democratic system of Chechnya, in the language of which there is no word meaning "to order," and express sympathy for the Russian people, whose tragedy, according to Mr. Dudayev, lies in the fact that "atrocities have been elevated to the level of a state program." In the opinion of Dzhokhar Dudayev, today religion is emerging as the trump card, and it is time for the Islamic peoples to establish a world religious center, either in Chechnya, or in Tibet, or in Jerusalem. In addition, he proposed the establishment of a Caucasian home "without slaves and masters," as well as Baltic and Central Asian homes, all of which would then be united on a peaceful basis. The conference included in its final resolution the idea of establishing a World Islamic Center either in the Caucasus or in Jerusalem. From Russia it demanded legal recognition that genocide has been committed, recognition of the ChRI's independence, and the immediate commencement of negotiations. The U.N. Security Council, the resolution stated, should be stripped of its special powers and the international organization that guarantees the rights and freedoms of people's "radically reformed."
