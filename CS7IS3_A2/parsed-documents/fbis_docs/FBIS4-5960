The ties between the peoples of the two countries had begun centuries ago. The relations have always been cordial. In Dr. Mahathir's words, Malaysia will take every means to improve the existing interaction. Cambodia has always remained close to the hearts of Malaysians. The civil war that had raged in that country with the government facing the lots of the three guerrilla factions had been a matter of deep concern for the Malaysian Government and people. Malaysia was in the forefront among countries that wanted Cambodia to return to a peaceful era. Malaysia played a leading role in the Cambodian peace process and in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia or UNTAC. Malaysia has always felt that peace in Cambodia is vital for the stability and prosperity of the Southeast Asian region. In his talks with the Cambodian president [as heard], Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and co-prime ministers, Prince Ranarridh and Mr. Hun Sen, Dr. Mahathir invited Cambodia to consider becoming a member of the ASEAN family. With the participation of Cambodia and possibly Vietnam and Laos, ASEAN can turn into a vital organization for regional cooperation. A more united Southeast Asia will make countries of the region stronger and more capable of facing the challenges of the future in a world that is becoming increasingly competitive. The Malaysian premier expressed his hope that ASEAN with the participation of all the ten countries of the region, including Myanmar [Burma] can work with the other countries of East Asia to develop a more resilient and progressive pattern of prosperity in the region. Already, Southeast Asia is now acknowledged as one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world. With the entry of the other four countries, ASEAN can become an entity that will be looked upon with awe and admiration. A fruitful outcome of the Malaysian premier's visit to Cambodia is the agreement between the two countries to set up a joint commission to enhance bilateral cooperation. Cambodia is already benefiting from the Malaysian technical assistance program. It has also requested Malaysia's help in the areas of training, rural development, oil refinery and exploration, forest management, and the rehabilitation of its palm oil and rubber plantations. Cambodia has also sought Malaysia's advice on the setting up of free trade zones. Malaysia is ready to send its officers to conduct seminars and training courses for their Cambodian counterparts. Cambodia has opened its doors to foreign business investment. The large number of businessmen and entrepreneurs in Dr. Mahathir's delegation is reflective of Malaysia's keen interest in that country's economic reconstruction and development program.
