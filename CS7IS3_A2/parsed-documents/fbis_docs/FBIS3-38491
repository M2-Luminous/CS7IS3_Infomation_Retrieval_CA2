Papoulias returned today to Athens and detailed the U.S. Government's position regarding the Skopje issue. [Begin Papoulias recording] The United States is more interested in the normalization of relations between Greece and Skopje than in upgrading diplomatic relations between itself and Skopje. I think that we should move in this direction. Therefore, the normalization of Greek-Skopjean relations will depend on the acceptance of the conditions we set by [Macedonian President] Kiro Gligorov so that we can proceed with a dialogue on the name issue. The Greek position on the issue is known. In the meantime, we should try to create a better climate in the relations between the two countries. [end recording] Papoulias also referred to yesterday's statement by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York that the UN hopes for a meeting between Greek and Skopjean experts. [Begin Papoulias recording] I have no information on what Butrus-Ghali said. [end recording] Regarding his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the Greek foreign minister also said that the U.S. Government holds positions on the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina that will be developed in the coming weeks. He added that both the EU and the United States insist on the promotion of a peace plan and reject military interventions. [In the same newscast, Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio Network carries the following dispatch by correspondent Nikolaos Meletis on Foreign Minister Papoulias' remarks before his departure from Washington: "During a friendly talk with Greek correspondents, Foreign Minister Papoulias also said that Gligorov appears tough, encouraged by diplomatic recognitions, and seeks to gain something more. Papoulias said that Gligorov does not realize that the most important thing is to establish good relations with Greece, which is the only regional country that guarantees the borders and future of his country." [In a recorded statement Papoulias commented "I do not understand why he does not proceed with something which, as they say, he had agreed to during talks with Former Greek Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis. ["The foreign minister stressed that negotiations on the name will be difficult, as our country insists on the historically justified position not to accept a name that contains the term Macedonia or its derivatives. ["Referring to the Cyprus issue, Foreign Minister Papoulias stressed that the confidence-building measures do not touch the substance of the issue. He also expressed his concern over the possibility that Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas will use the confidence-building measures to prolong a fruitless dialogue. ["Commenting on the U.S. State Department's human rights report, the foreign minister stressed that this report does not have anything to add or take away and that it is repetition. The report contains information that the Americans have, and one can agree or disagree with them, the minister said. Papoulias concluded by expressing concern about the credibility of the sources used to formulate the report."]
