He will again reject a ban of the Republikaner. The information that has been gathered is allegedly not sufficient to substantiate the suspicion of right-wing extremism against Schoenhuber's party. Meanwhile, neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists have offered the Republikaner "sensible action alliances" and "active election support" for the Bundestag elections. In a strategy document of the right-wing extremist National List (NL), the brown ideologists propose "organized comrade circles" for a "basic unity among the `national opposition,' which should also include the most radical fringes." The document reads: "We believe that this might and should one day develop into a `right-wing popular front....'" First of all, however, the slogan is "Republikaner into the Bundestag." According to the analysis by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, the National List has for a long time been trying to "mobilize supporters of different neo-Nazi and other right-wing extremist groups to form an action committee out of all organizations." In its strategic considerations, the National List is not impressed by the fact that Schoenhuber has distanced himself from the NL and called for its ban. The neo-Nazis believe that the entry of the Republikaner into the Bundestag would be "quite useful for us." They give the following reason: Media campaigns and the military actions of antifascist groups would concentrate to a greater extent on this bourgeois-rightist group. Moreover, "if Schoenhuber receives 30 seats in the Bundestag with 5 percent of the vote, there will be the one or the other extremist deviationist. Even a single (autonomous) ultraradical nationalist deputy in the Bundestag would be a similar advantage for the `National Opposition' like the deputy of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], Krause, who joined the Republikaner." The NL strategists are convinced that a success of the Republikaner would cost Kohl his chancellorship. Over the medium term, the CDU could no longer try to win votes "on the right fringe" and maintain the "bourgeois center" at the same time. This would lead to a leeway on the right fringe of the spectrum, as has existed for a long time on the left fringe because of the Greens and recently also because of the Party of Democratic Socialism that exists in "central Germany."
