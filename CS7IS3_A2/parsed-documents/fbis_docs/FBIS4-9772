Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban Workers Federation, stated in Havana that the traditional Revolution Square rally and parade will not be held this May Day. Ross added that the occasion will be observed by means of ceremonies in the provinces and workplaces in keeping with the characteristics and resources of the different individual regions. These ceremonies will be held on 30 April because a special session of the National Assembly of the People's Government is scheduled for 1 May. Ross added that this is the result of a desire to keep May Day alive, as well as keeping alive, above all, the spirit of the workers assemblies recently held thoroughout Cuba and described by Fidel as a tremendous process by Cuba's union movement. Ross stressed that one can pay no greater homage to Cuba's workers than to discuss, on May Day, their suggestions on how to streamline the nation's finances, since the workers will be responsible for implementing the economic measures to be adopted in Cuba.
