The soldiers are in the Zimbabwean capital, Harare, where they are being trained for their incorporation in the South African Defense Force with the knowledge of the South African Government. This report from the BBC in Harare. [Begin recording] [BBC announcer] In the bush of Zimbabwe, this is the kind of training given to the future members of South Africa's unified defense force. Five-hundred men and women have been transformed from the guerrillas of yesterday to the regular soldiers of tomorrow. Bush fighters who spent their lives executing hit-and-run raids into South Africa have been taught how to foil their acts of sabotage which were their stock and trade. Members of the rival African National Congress and Pan Africanist Congress have buried their differences to train side by side. [MK Commander Siphiwe Nyanda] Well, it's not easy, but it's something we have to do. At the political level there is reconciliation, and at the military level as well. We have to work with our former adversaries. We found that in discussions, which have been going on up to now, that it's possible that they are also officers and professionals, and in the near future we will have to form one defense force. [APLA Commander David Romero] Yes, there is political will, more especially on the part of the PAC, and I believe on the part of the ANC there's also that political will. That's why we are confident that we will ultimately reach a solution in our country. [BBC announcer] They graduated early. Four months' training was squeezed into three to be ready in time for the elections. These are the elite -- future senior officers who will command key posts and confront the difficult task of integrating soldiers, their former enemies. [Constantine Chiwange of the Zimbabwe Defense Force] Working with members of the past regime is not a problem, as long as they have accepted change, and they accept the fact that a black majority rule is inevitable. That is not a problem at all. And of course, once they have outgrown racism, that's not a problem. [BBC announcer] Many white Zimbabwean soldiers fled their ranks after independence in 1980, taking their valuable experience with them. One lesson the Zimbabwean trainers have taught the South Africans is how to rebuild that knowledge. [end recording]
