Kabale--"To my knowledge, no weapons have been sent from Uganda to Rwanda since the deployment of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] in August 1993," declares Bangladeshi Colonel Asnar, military head of UNAMIR. He adds: "We have monitoring posts on all the roads leading to Rwanda, and our foot patrols put up mobile roadblocks. Also, ground operations are supported by helicopters providing aerial surveillance." Are 80 observers really enough to watch over 170 km of border winding through hills, forests, and swamps? In private, UN officials readily admit the border cannot be hermetically sealed with such a small contingent, however well equipped. Moreover, UN observers run up against perplexing snags from time to time. For example, the fact that sometimes they must wait for days before getting approval from Ugandan forces, the National Resistance Army (NRA), to inspect a new zone; Colonel Asnar blandly calls them "procedural delays." In 1993, UNAMIR personnel had to wait for two weeks for permission to monitor the environs of the Kakitumba border post, across which all provisions for the Rwanda Patriotic Front [RPF] allegedly passed on their way into Rwanda (according to rumors never confirmed), and until 16 June humanitarian convoys were not allowed to use the asphalt road leading down from Kakitumba, though it is the most direct route for getting emergency aid to the RPF zone. These questions remain unanswered, and one has the impression that neither the RPF nor Ugandan authorities are being completely candid. Of course, President Museveni tells anyone willing to listen that it is no difficult feat to transport arms clandestinely in that region. He can (and does) testify eloquently on that score from his own experience: When he was chief of a small rebel band in central Uganda, in the early 1980's, his men traveled to Bujumbura to pick up Libyan arms at the Islamic Cultural Center there, bringing them back by truck across Rwanda and Milton Obote's Uganda and presenting false documents at every checkpoint describing the cargo as Burundian tea! Clandestine Networks To diplomats posted in Kampala, it seems clear the Ugandan Army could seal the border "with 20 men per kilometer" if only the political will existed. While some observers concede that arms may also be coming in over the Zairian border, Uganda appears in reality to be the sole conduit through which supplies are reaching the rebels, the lifeline of the RPF, and the means by which the latter easily circumvents the embargo decreed by the UN Security Council. The provenance of the arms also raises a number of questions. It is difficult to account, for example, for all the movements of the Nigerian airplane that was held up several days in Cyprus after a stopover in Israel last month and ultimately landed at Entebbe. But it is possible some of the arms, destined for rebels in south Sudan, were diverted to resupply the RPF. In the Ugandan capital, debate continues over the extent to which Yoweri Museveni is implicated in Uganda's support for the RPF, a support that seems only logical given the large number of Rwandan exiles who joined Museveni's guerrillas and helped him take power in January 1986. Those who discount his involvement put most of the blame on members of his entourage (both in the military and in government political circles) who collaborate closely, unbeknownst to the president, with RPF leaders, either because they are ethnically Tutsi or Hima (Museveni's ethnic group, the Ugandan tribe closest to the Tutsi), or because of the help they received during their own guerrilla years. No one here doubts the Rwandan rebels, when they launched their first attacks in northern Rwanda (in October 1990), were equipped with Ugandan military materiel, but was it slipped covertly to them or openly proffered? UN officials at Kabale believe arms were transferred continously (i.e., in a series of deliveries) from Uganda to Rwanda between October 1990 and August 1993, when UNAMIR was deployed. Presumably, the RPF is profiting handsomely from the downsizing of the NRA, which is demobilizing nearly one-third of its 90,000 soldiers at the "suggestion" of the World Bank. The downsizing has freed up a considerable amount of "surplus" equipment, and some demobilized soldiers might be tempted to join the Rwandan rebels. Another source of provisions: supplies captured from the enemy, especially munitions stores and heavy weapons of French origin seen in rebel convoys headed for the front. The RPF has built up a substantial "war chest" of funds collected from a Rwandan diaspora that is very supportive of "the cause," i.e., the return to Rwanda. Finally, it is even possible the rebels are receiving support from the predominantly Tutsi Burundian Army, which turns a blind eye to quasi-overt RPF recruiting efforts among Rwandans and Burundians in the refugee camps. Such support, though understandable, makes it possible for the RPF to persevere in its offensive. "The RPF's clandestine arms network has been in place a long time," says one Rwandan diplomat, "while we ourselves must rush around to find new suppliers. Our normal suppliers, like South Africa, have been told to respect the embargo." Is Uganda's at least tacit support for the RPF intended to repay the debt Mr. Museveni owes the Rwandan refugees? Or is he attempting, as the interim Rwandan government claims, to "create a Tutsi empire in the region"? "The president has other concerns," explains one Western diplomat, "beginning with the south Sudan problem." The imminent arrival of Sudanese Army units on Uganda's northern border--up to now in the hands of south Sudan rebels backed by Kampala--may well accelerate destabilization of the north at the hands of Khartoum, which already is arming a small group of guerrillas there who are little more than bandits. Uganda's president is reportedly eager to "dispose" of the Rwandan exiles by sending them back home. "Back in 1988, I told Habyarimana (the Rwandan president killed on 6 April, whose death triggered resumption of the civil war) that he should let the refugees go back," says Mr. Museveni, probably worried lest the opposition capitalize politically on anti-Rwandan xenophobia. In fact, Rwandan refugees (the first of whom arrived in 1959) have done quite well for themselves in Uganda and have often served as scapegoats, notably in 1982 when they were literally expelled by then-President Obote to Rwanda, which adamantly refused to accept them. The "Banyarwandans" then gave their support to Mr. Museveni, who launched his rebellion. But after the NRA captured Kampala, anti-Tutsi feeling exacerbated the emergence of a veritable "Rwandan mafia" that Ugandans have sorely resented. Ever since the start of the conflict, Yoweri Museveni has said the Tutsi insurgency was an internal Rwandan problem, and he rarely used to criticize the RPF; but recently he has changed his tune. Following the massacre of the bishops in Kabgayi, with the Ugandan press reporting survivors' accounts of killings attributed to the RPF, Museveni has been harshly critical of the rebels. The Ugandan head of state seems now to be distancing himself from them, and calls publicly on the RPF to accept a cease-fire, since "it lacks the means to win the war rapidly." He also insists on the need for changes in the current government, as envisioned in the Arusha accords and to remove those responsible for the massacres. It is said that Mr. Museveni left the OAU summit in Tunis in some haste, irritated as he was by criticism from his peers over his support for the rebels at a time when he was making an all-out effort to help, meeting on a regular basis in Kampala with a "crisis committee" composed of the ambassadors of neighboring countries and U.S., French, and British representatives. While it is obvious in Kampala that UNAMIR enjoys cordial relations with the RPF, the same cannot be said for the humanitarian organizations clamoring to get into the rebel zone. The RPF wants to maintain tight control over the organization of emergency assistance to the "600,000 displaced persons in camps in the liberated zone," and humanitarian organizations are raising a hue and cry about these constraints. Other problems have also surfaced, such as the temporary ban on access to some camps, which is still controlled jointly by two officials, one political and the other military. For "security reasons," it is difficult or impossible to leave these camps, where observers have raised questions about "educational meetings" which rightly or wrongly, are being described as "reminiscent of Cambodia."
