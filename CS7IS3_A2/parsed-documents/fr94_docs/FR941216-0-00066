FR941216-0-00066 FR941216-0-00016 II. Purpose and Implementation of the NPL III. Contents of This Final Rule IV. Executive Order 12866 V. Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis I. Introduction Background In 1980, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601&hyph;9675 (``CERCLA'' or ``the Act''), in response to the dangers of uncontrolled hazardous waste sites. CERCLA was amended on October 17, 1986, by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``SARA''), Public Law No. 99&hyph;499, stat. 1613 et seq. To implement CERCLA, EPA promulgated the revised National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (``NCP''), 40 CFR Part 300, on July 16, 1982 (47 FR 31180), pursuant to CERCLA section 105 and Executive Order 12316 (46 FR 42237, August 20, 1981). The NCP sets forth the guidelines and procedures needed to respond under CERCLA to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. EPA has revised the NCP on several occasions, most recently on March 8, 1990 (55 FR 8666). Section 105(a)(8)(A) of CERCLA requires that the NCP include ``criteria for determining priorities among releases or threatened releases throughout the United States for the purpose of taking remedial action *␣*␣* and, to the extent practicable taking into account the potential urgency of such action, for the purpose of taking removal action.'' Removal action involves cleanup or other actions that are taken in response to releases or threats of releases on a short-term or temporary basis (CERCLA section 101(23)). Remedial action tends to be long-term in nature and involves response actions that are consistent with a permanent remedy for a release (CERCLA section 101(24)). Pursuant to section 105(a)(8)(B) of CERCLA, as amended by SARA, EPA has promulgated a list of national priorities among the known or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the United States. That list, which is Appendix B of 40 CFR Part 300, is the National Priorities List (``NPL''). CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) defines the NPL as a list of ``releases'' and as a list of the highest priority ``facilities.'' The discussion below may refer to the ``releases or threatened releases'' that are included on the NPL interchangeably as ``releases,'' ``facilities,'' or ``sites.'' CERCLA section 105(a)(8)(B) also requires that the NPL be revised at least annually. A site may undergo remedial action financed by the Trust Fund established under CERCLA (commonly referred to as the ``Superfund'') only after it is placed on the NPL, as provided in the NCP at 40 CFR 300.425(b)(1). However, under 40 CFR 300.425(b)(2) placing a site on the NPL ``does not imply that monies will be expended.'' EPA may pursue other appropriate authorities to remedy the releases, including enforcement action under CERCLA and other laws.
