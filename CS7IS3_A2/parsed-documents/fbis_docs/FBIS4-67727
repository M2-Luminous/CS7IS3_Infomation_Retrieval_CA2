The Helsinki City Council asked the police, social service and public health officials to comment on the problem. One worrisome aspect they noted was the influx of prostitutes from Russia and Estonia over the last few years. The council accepted the argument from social workers that criminalizing prostitution would make especially alien prostitutes more reluctant to visit physicians, and that the whole problem of prostitution could be more effectively dealt with through "social policy measures." Reduction in Venereal Disease Cases Despite the appearance of open prostitution -- something which was virtually nonexistent in postwar Finland until the current recession started in 1990 -- the STD incidence has steadily decreased. Statistics from the National Health Public Health Service, for example, show that registered gonorrhea cases declined from 645 in 1990 to 141 in 1993, and chalmydia cases from 2,150 in 1990 to 1,607 in 1993. What was remarkable to the author, however, was that 54 percent of those diagnosed with gonorrhea in 1993 had been infected abroad. The corresponding figure for 1990 was 15 percent. Of those who had been infected abroad, 39 percent had gotten the disease in Russia and 37 percent in Estonia. The incidence of AIDS is continuing to increase. At the end of 1992 the HIV/AIDS treatment hospital in Helsinki had 180 HIV positive patients. By the end of last year this figure had risen to 211. Given the inverse trend between Helsinki prostitution and STD's, however, the Public Health Service joined other offices in only adopting a policy of careful monitoring the situation.
