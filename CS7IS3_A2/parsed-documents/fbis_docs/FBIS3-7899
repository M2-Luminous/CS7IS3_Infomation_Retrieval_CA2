"In keeping with the deep sympathy expressed by the Hungarian general public, we wish to express our condolence to the victims' relatives," the statement says. Concerning the February 25 massacre, the document says: "The Hungarian Foreign Ministry sees the event as a common tragedy for both peoples, the direct consequences of which may unfortunately affect, but hopefully not deadlock, the promising Middle East peace talks. "However, it is a necessity for the peace process to continue with success, so that in the future there should be no similarly senseless acts of violence aimed at putting an end to negotiations based on common will." "It is cause for concern that there is a dangerous escalation of violent reactionary actions and vengeances being committed by both opposing sides in the area under Israeli occupation." "The Hungarian Foreign Ministry holds the position that in this painful hour all sides involved in the peace talks should display increased self-restraint." "It is particularly important that both the PLO and the Israeli Government should spare no effort to control extremist organizations and persons prepared to commit similar acts of violence. They should be neutralized as soon as possible in a form coordinated and accepted by both sides." "We are convinced that the extremely complex Mideast issue can only be solved through compromise and negotiations aimed at creating peace, security, cooperation and peaceful coexistence in the region. "We hope that the peace process will put an end to the decades-long conflict, create stability in the region, and enforce both the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people and the right to security for the State of Israel."
