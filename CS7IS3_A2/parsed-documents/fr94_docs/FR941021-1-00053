FR941021-1-00053 FR941021-1-00009 Alleged Discrimination Against Older Pilots Several commenters allege that the AMA recommendations discriminate against older pilots in favor of younger ones, since many of the tests recommended become critical for pilots after the age of 40 or 50. Air transport pilots who commented argue that, if adopted, the recommendations might prohibit some older and more experienced pilots from flying. According to these commenters, older pilots represent a high percentage of the highly competent and seasoned professional pilots. FAA Response: Any medical standards necessarily have a greater effect on older persons since many disorders occur more frequently with advancing age, especially after age 40. The FAA contracted with Johns Hopkins University to prepare a detailed statistical analysis of computerized medical information collected by the FAA from examination of approximately 31,000 air traffic controllers over a 15-year period. The study sample was demographically comparable to the private pilot population and the examinations were similar to airman medical examinations. The analysis shows that the incidence of pathology recorded at periodic examinations increases with age; the prevalence of pathology in individuals over the age of 50 was greater than in those under the age of 40. The AMA recommendations and the FAA proposed rule focus on those disorders most likely to result in reduced performance or to incapacitate a pilot. They provide for more relevant, more thorough, and more predictive evaluations after age 40 or 50, particularly for those persons seeking first-class medical certification. Proposed changes in this category relate to vision; electrocardiograms; and blood cholesterol determinations. The proposed standards will permit the identification of risk factors and encourage pilots to maintain better control over those conditions which eventually could lead to disqualification. Those AMA recommendations included in the FAA proposal should serve, in the long term, to increase the pool of experienced, professional, and medically eligible pilots. AME's or Private Physicians Several commenters raise issues about the role of AME's and the role of private physicians in the maintenance of a pilot's health. Two flight instructor pilots state that mistrust exists between pilots and medical examiners caused by pilots' fear of losing their medical certification and their careers as pilots. More stringent rules, as recommended by the AMA, will increase pilots' concerns and mistrust. Commenters also believe that some of the recommendations concerning family history, for example, should be the domain of a pilot's personal physician and that in some instances personal physicians could supply the information required by the recommended standards. FAA Response: Both current and proposed standards permit the use of test results provided by personal physicians, such as ECG's and X-rays. However, the historical and legal role of the AME as a designee of the FAA is to conduct a medical examination to determine the fitness of the pilot to exercise the privileges of his or her certificate without endangering public safety. The proposed standards in no way are intended to interfere with or replace a pilot's use of a personal physician. Experience, however, indicates that the FAA's statutory responsibility to ensure that an airman is medically fit to perform his or her duties cannot be delegated to any personal physician. The proposed changes, however, should not affect the relationship between pilots and AME's. Specific Standards Several commenters object to one or more specific recommendations in the AMA Report. Objections to cardiovascular and vision standards are the most frequent. Some of these commenters express concern that the recommended standards will serve to discourage good health practices through fear of denial. For example, commenters who objected to the AMA recommendation for a blood pressure standard particularly object to the AMA recommendation that an applicant shall have no established medical history of use of antihypertensive medication within the last year. Commenters who use antihypertensive medication said they would either stop taking the medication (which they need) or be denied. FAA Response: The proposed standards do not specify that individuals using antihypertensive medication shall be denied certification. If antihypertensive medication is used or is needed to meet the blood pressure requirement, a person may be issued a certificate only after a current, satisfactory medical assessment, prescribed by the Federal Air Surgeon. In this case as in some others, the FAA has not followed the AMA recommendation. However, the comments indicate a misunderstanding. A medical history of a disqualifying condition, whatever that condition is, does not necessarily mean that a person will be denied certification absolutely. It may mean that additional evaluation may be required before the FAA can determine if certification is appropriate. This may require additional time and some expense for additional tests, but, for most of the proposed standards, the added inconvenience is minimal compared to the improvement in safety. Regulatory Evaluation Summary Introduction Three requirements pertain to economic impacts of regulatory changes to the FAR. First, Executive Order 12291 directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations or modify existing regulations only if the potential benefits to society outweigh the potential costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic impact of regulatory changes on small entities. Finally, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule:
