FR940830-1-00045 FR940830-1-00006 (b) Requesting deferred vested pension benefit information from SSA files. Section 1131 of the Act also requires SSA to provide available pension benefit information on request. SSA will provide this pension benefit information only to the individual who has the pension coverage (or a legal guardian or parent, in the case of a minor, on the individual's behalf). However, if the individual is deceased, the information may be provided to someone who would be eligible for any underpayment of benefits that might be due the individual under ยง404.503(b) of part 404 of this chapter. All requests for such information must be in writing and should contain the following information: the individual's name, social security number, date of birth, and parent's names; any information the requester may have concerning the name of the pension plan involved and the month and year coverage under the plan ended; the name and address of the person to whom the information is to be sent; and the requester's signature under the following statement: ``I am the individual to whom the information applies (or ``I am related to the individual as his or her XXX ''). I know that if I make any representation which I know is false to obtain information from Social Security records, I could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both.'' Such requests should be sent to: Social Security Administration, Office of Central Records Operations, P.O. Box 17055, Baltimore, Maryland 21235.
