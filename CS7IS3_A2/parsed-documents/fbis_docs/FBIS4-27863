In an interview with Washington-based ROK correspondents held in Washington, Ambassador Kim pointed out that adoption of a resolution on sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security Council is the most important issue at present. He stressed, however, that if North Korea allows a special inspection of two undeclared nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], it would be a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear problem, although the issue on fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor has not been resolved satisfactorily. The interview follows: [Question] What is the purpose of your visit to Washington? [Kim Sam-hun] My purpose is to discuss the positions on the North Korean nuclear issue by the ROK and the United States in the UN Security Council, as well as that between the ROK, the United States, and Japan; and to discuss sanctions against North Korea by the UN Security Council with its Standing Committee member states. I had consultations on measures of the ROK and the United States with Robert Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state and coordinator of the North Korean nuclear issue, on the morning of 3 June. On 4 June, I will have working-level consultations with the United States and Japan. [Question] What was the content of discussion with Assistant Secretary Gallucci? [Kim Sam-hun] We discussed various steps and a broad range of issues regarding sanctions by the UN Security Council against North Korea. There was no difference in views between the ROK and the United States during the discussion. [Question] What is the purpose of sanctions against North Korea? [Kim Sam-hun] The sanctions are aimed at removing nuclear suspicion of North Korea and ensuring nuclear transparency. The purpose is to ultimately resolve the North Korean nuclear problem. The ROK Government made efforts to resolve the problem through dialogue to the end. However, the IAEA decided that its future measurement of used nuclear fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor is now impossible. As a result, the basis for dialogue has collapsed and sanctions have become inevitable. Even if sanctions are imposed, we will not renounce dialogue with North Korea if nuclear suspicion is removed and nuclear transparency is ensured. [Question] Is there any other way to examine North Korea's diversion of nuclear material, other than by the fuel rods in the five-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon? [Kim Sam-hun] Even without the fuel rods in the Yongbyon reactor, there is room for examining the history of North Korean nuclear development provided that an inspection is allowed of the two undeclared nuclear facilities that North Korea omitted from the list when it reported its 16 nuclear facilities to the IAEA. Therefore, the inspection of two undeclared facilities, which are known to store nuclear waste after reprocessing, will become an important issue in the future. Since the accuracy of measurement of used fuel rods from the reactor is higher than any other method, the IAEA demanded this measurement from North Korea. North Korea has persistently refused the IAEA's special inspection of its two undeclared facilities since March 1993. Because of this, the North Korean nuclear issue has reached the sanctions stage. [Question] What is the extent of the U.S. and ROK attitude regarding sanctions against North Korea? [Kim Sam-hun] IAEA Secretary-General Hans Blix's report to the UN Security Council is an important momentum for sanctions against North Korea. We must not lose this momentum. It is not desirable to miss the opportunity by wasting time. The issue of sanctions is still in the discussion stage. However, if sanctions against North Korea are approved by the UN Security Council, they should contain practical consequences. The sanctions this time should not merely be a statement-like warning, as the recent presidential statement of UN Security Council. [Question] Is there any change in China's attitude, which is a Standing Committee member state of the Security Council? [Kim Sam-hun] I cannot say at this moment that there is a change. I may point out, however, that the ROK and the United States has made all possible efforts to include China in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, and has tried to create conditions for China to do so. [Question] What if North Korea declares its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] before the UN Security Council puts sanctions to a vote, and what would be your reaction if North Korea declares that it possesses nuclear armament? [Kim Sam-hun] The North Korean nuclear problem began in 1992, and has been a full-scale international issue since March 1993. The international community will never tolerate North Korea's declaring its withdrawal from the NPT or that it is a nuclear-state. As the North Korean nuclear problem has been discussed by the UN Security Council on many occasions, there will be no problem in imposing sanctions even if North Korea carries out such an act.
