The Yemeni source said that these forces launched a large-scale offensive with various types of weapons against the 2nd Armored Brigade, deployed in 'Imran, which receives its orders from the defense minister. The source added that pitched battles involving the use of heavy weapons are still raging this afternoon. The source said that the aggression against the southern brigade took place directly after President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih delivered a speech in al-Sab'ayn Square in Sanaa today to mark the 27 April occasion. In his speech, he called for removing the YSP from power. The source noted that the military escalation of the situation on this large a scale throughout Yemen will block the success of the mediation efforts being made to resolve the crisis peacefully. The YSP holds President Salih personally, and members of his family who occupy important posts in the military establishment, as the source put it, responsible for the grave consequences that may result from this offensive.
