The Czech Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Social National Party are also positive about the project. All of the above consider this project to be, first of all, the first step to the desirable cooperation of the Czech Republic with NATO. The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and the Left Bloc disagree with this opinion. They warn against our joining NATO because they see a possible isolation in relation to the remaining partners within the Visegrad Four, as well as the threat of cutting down on our sovereignty.
