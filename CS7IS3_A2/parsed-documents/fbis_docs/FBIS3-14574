Why was this decision made? What effects will it have on the oil market? [Aqazadeh] Fortunately, this year the Majles and the government had predicted from the start that the current situation would continue. Therefore, in the government's proposal, a considerable reduction of income from oil had been predicted, and the Majles reduced the government's proposal. The figure this year is less than the figure for last year. Hence, the concerns that the government and Majles had in mind the situation of the market.... [pauses] They made the required decisions regarding this situation. Of course, on the other hand, with the commissioning of certain major projects in the country, the demand for currency has been reduced. For example, our own ministry -- which was a major consumer -- our demand for currency has fallen considerably compared to previous years. We hope that the changes in the oil market will not affect our macroeconomics [eqtesad-e kalan] too much. What has upset us, however, is that oil is being sold at an unrealistic price. This, on the whole, is not to the benefit of oil producers. [Correspondent] Mr. Engineer, considering the OPEC decision and your remarks, the price of oil will probably either remain the same or go down. What is your prediction for the second quarter of the year about the price of oil, taking into account that summer is approaching and there will less domestic demand? [Aqazadeh] Yes. Let me say that when we faced the non-reduction in production in OPEC, a number of ministers proposed that the same production ceiling should be kept for the third and fourth quarter of the Christian year. Our decision is for nine months [sentence as heard]. This decision was made because our current difficulty is the second quarter. In the third and fourth quarters, demand will go up automatically, and the production ceiling can be in balance with the demand of that time.
