The National Treasury's revenues and expenditures will total $88.8 billion. Raul Jungman, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning, points out that the bill will become effective only if approved by Congress. "The congressmen share responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and it will be up to them to say whether we will have a balanced budget with no deficit." The total budget, including debt rollovers, comes to $280 billion. The tough budget bill says that the government will spend only what it collects in 1994 and that public debt instruments will be issued only to roll over the domestic and foreign floating debt that already exists. According to economist Edmar Bacha, special adviser to Minister of Finance Fernando Henrique Cardoso, that budget balance is the foundation stone for adoption of the second and third stages of the economic stabilization program. Those stages call for adopting the URV [Real Value Unit] and subsequently making it a strong currency. "We are freeing ourselves of the need to use inflation and corruption to balance the budget. We are exchanging those instruments for negotiation, which is the only alternative we have left, since the other choice would be dictatorship." Surrealism--Bacha explained that in previous years, the Executive Branch would send Congress an "unrealistic" budget and get back a "surrealistic" law. Since it was impossible to execute the expenditures called for in that law, the administration would guarantee those expenditures, wait for inflation to erode values, and make the money available. The result of that game has been the increase in inflation. In its budget revision, the government is working with real interest rates of 15 percent for 1994, since there will be no more indebtedness. That will help reduce debt service, which should decline from $8.7 billion in 1993 to $7.7 billion in 1994. "That drop is feasible, since we will no longer have a deficit of $22 billion to finance," says Bacha. Effort However, the Legislative and Judicial Branches are not making the same effort as the Executive Branch to cut spending. The Chamber of Deputies, the Senate, and the National Accounting Office will receive about $305 million for investment and operations in 1993 [as published]--51 percent more than their probable actual spending level in 1993 (expenditures included in the original 1993 budget or in supplemental budgets passed during the year). The courts will receive $699.6 million, or 42 percent more than the $470 million they received in 1993. For its part, the Executive Branch will receive $43.1 billion, or 17 percent less than the $52.1 billion received in 1993. A number of ministries have been given special treatment, however, examples being the military ministries (EMFA [Armed Forces General Staff], Army, Navy, and Air), which will receive $2.2 billion for operations and investment. That is an increase of 48 percent over 1993 and the result of tough negotiating with the economic area. Administration Expects To Collect $84 Billion The administration expects to achieve record collections of $84.6 billion in taxes, compulsory contributions, and fees in 1994. Those revenues, the largest in the country's history, will consist of the following: Import tax (II): This tax is imposed on Brazilian imports and will bring in $2.12 billion, or 0.47 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), in 1994. Industrialized products tax (IPI): The administration expects this tax to yield $10.94 billion, or 2.41 percent of GDP. Income tax (on individuals and corporations): This is the federal tax that brings in the most money. The administration expects it to provide $17.54 billion, or 3.87 percent of GDP, in 1994. Financial operations tax (IOF): Estimated IOF receipts for 1994 total $3.7 billion, or 0.82 percent of GDP. Provisional tax on financial operations (IPMF): Collection of this tax will begin next Monday, with an expected yield in 1994 of $4.8 billion, or 1.06 percent of GDP. Some congressmen believe that the administration is underestimating revenues from this tax. Social investment contribution (Cofins): Now that the Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the collection of Cofins is constitutional, the administration expects it to yield $8.06 billion, or 1.78 percent of GDP. The administration has not included in these revenues the money deposited in a Cofins account with the courts by businessmen. PIS [Social Integration Program]/Pasep [Government Employees Welfare Fund] contribution: The administration expects to collect $5.22 billion in PIS/Pasep contributions in 1994. That is the equivalent of 1.1 percent of GDP. Social contribution based on net profit: Revenues from this contribution are expected to total $3.74 billion, or 0.83 percent of GDP. Employers' and employees' social security contribution: Here the administration estimates that revenues will total $20.6 billion, or 4.55 percent of GDP. Government employees' social security contribution: Government employees are expected to contribute $2.05 billion, or 0.45 percent of GDP, in 1994. Other (including supplemental port fees, military pensions, contributions to the training wage, amounts due from the freight supplement and modernization of the merchant marine, and so on): Revenues from these taxes are estimated at $4.03 billion, or 0.89 percent of GDP. Other revenues (including the contribution based on lottery revenues): The administration expects to obtain $1.5 billion, or 0.35 percent of GDP, from this type of collection. Bill Predicts 4-Percent Rise in GDP The administration is expecting GDP to be about 4 percent higher in 1994 than in 1993. "Studies conducted by the administration, backed by indications relative to the basic parameters for projecting national accounts, suggest the advisability of adopting a forecast to the effect that GDP in 1994 will increase by about 4 percent compared to 1993," the administration has announced in a message sent to Congress with the budget for 1994. The message sent by President Itamar Franco regarding the General Budget of the Union supports the economic team's position that it is necessary "to restore normal operating conditions in the Brazilian state so that it will be possible to stabilize the economy and guarantee social justice." And for that very reason, it says that the administration and various segments of society must be prepared to carry out the difficult task "of balancing the national accounts." "To do that, decisions by the National Congress are essentially and fundamentally necessary in order to provide the Executive Branch with the tools making it possible to overcome the difficult situation we find ourselves in today." Wages--The administration also expects to spend 681 billion cruzeiros, or 5.3 percent of GDP, on personnel expenditures and charges (including both active and retired personnel). Those projections, contained in the message sent to Congress along with the budget bill for 1994, were made, the administration says, in accordance with the prime rule that the government's basic payroll in 1994 cannot exceed the 1993 payroll. On the basis of its analysis of the current economic situation and the macroeconomic scenario for 1994, the administration announces in its budget bill that "the main problem in the Brazilian economy continues to be inflation, which, while not threatening to begin any rapid upward movement, has been exhibiting remarkable resistance to a decline." Prices--According to the administration, "the predominant diagnosis of Brazilian inflation points to the fiscal crisis as reflected in individual defensive postures by those responsible for price formation, whose practices are affected basically by their perceptions of the state's fiscal difficulties." And it adds: "In that context, stabilization of the economy presupposes implementation of a prior agreement aimed at reversing people's expectations and establishment of the basic preconditions for the desired economic stabilization." The administration says in connection with its budget bill for 1994 that "as 1993 comes to a close, the Brazilian economy has been continuing the recovery begun in September 1992." Ministries Most Affected The Federal Government's budget for 1994 will include cuts of up to $12 billion compared to what was spent in 1993. About $8.7 billion of that will come out of the operating and investment budgets of the ministries. Those most affected will be the Ministries of Social Welfare and Regional Integration, whose budgets will be cut by nearly 70 percent, and the Ministries of Agriculture, Health, Education, and Mines and Energy, which have lost an average of 40 percent of what they had in 1993. The Ministry of Navy plans to spend nearly 300 percent more than it did this year. The Judicial and Legislative Branches and the Strategic Affairs Secretariat expect to spend 50 percent more. The budget still has to be debated in Congress by the congressmen, who are expected to submit amendments affecting the amounts proposed by the Executive Branch. The above figures are part of the Budget of the Union for 1994--one of the pillars of the Ministry of Finance's economic adjustment program--and they were announced yesterday by Raul Jungmann, executive secretary of the Ministry of Planning; Edmar Bacha, special adviser to the Ministry of Finance; and Luis Carlos Nerosky, secretary of federal budgets. Deficit: The cuts announced today, added to the expected increase in revenues, mean that the administration is eliminating the $22 billion deficit included in the first budget bill, which was sent to Congress in August. A comparison of the funds allocated to the ministries in the budget submitted in August with those in the final version announced yesterday shows that the reductions are impressive: nearly $20 billion. In fact, that figure represents the difference between what the ministries wanted to spend and what the economic team actually authorized.
