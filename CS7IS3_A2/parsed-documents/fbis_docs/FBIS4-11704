The delegation is headed by Shlomo Gur, political adviser to the deputy foreign minister. He is accompanied by the technical team which prepares for Israel's participation in the multinational conference on water issues. In an exclusive interview with MABAT, Yusuf Bin-'Alawi, Oman's minister of state for foreign affairs, said in Cairo that there is nothing wrong with inviting Israeli representatives to his country: [Begin recording] [Bin-'Alawi] Israel has been attending all the multinational talks, whether they were held in Arab countries or in non-Arab countries. That is why one cannot give up on Israel's participation in such a conference. Israel's presence at the water conference does not affect the importance of the goal which, we hope, would serve the best interests of the Arab nation. [Correspondent] What do you think about solving the Palestinian and Syrian water problem with countries such as Turkey and Israel? [Bin-'Alawi] The issue must be studied and discussed by all the countries who will enjoy the arrangement, and those in which territory the water sources are, where the rivers run. [end recording]
