The source added that there are plans to drastically reduce the debt by an estimated 70 percent next year. This plan implies the exclusion of treasury bonds as a financing mechanism and the refinancing of the debt owed to multilateral organizations. It was reported that World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank financing will be limited to projects liable to be carried out. This is part of the new administration's policy of reducing the debt to its barest minimum. The estimated price of a barrel of oil, production figures, and rate of exchange were not reported. Several options are being studied, but the Council of Ministers will make the final decision. The new public administration employees' salary classifications, which were approved by the government of Ramon J. Velasquez and which will go into effect this year, were incorporated into the next year's budget. Although not yet signed into legislation, the revenue from the Value-Added Tax [VAT] applied on wholesalers, luxury taxes, and higher income taxes were included in the 1995 budget after the reforms were introduced at the Congress. In this regard, it has been reported that negotiations will be held with the Legislative Branch because these are proposals not yet passed into law. It is worthwhile mentioning that VAT was included in the 1993 budget when the tax had not yet been approved and that, for this reason, the budget was turned down by the Congress. At the time, the Congress decided to substitute the anticipated revenue from VAT for treasury bonds, thus balancing the budget. According to the Budget Law, the 1995 budget should be presented to the Congress in the second half of April. Therefore, it is expected to be presented between 15 and 20 April. The finance minister had previously considered the possibility of asking Congress for an extension to present the budget in June. The idea, however, was dismissed for political reasons and it was decided to stick to the deadline stipulated by law.
