FBIS4-7016 "dreas080_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 North Korea U.S. `Pressure' in Philippines Condemned U.S. `Pressure' in Philippines Condemned SK2304110894 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1030 GMT 23 Apr 94 SK2304110894 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A Japanese newspaper April 21 quoted sources of the Foreign Ministry of the Philippines as saying on April 19 that the U.S. ambassador to the Philippines was putting pressure through President Fidel Ramos on Filipino Foreign Minister Roberto Romulo to refrain from remarks critical of the U.S. policy toward the Korean peninsula. The foreign minister criticized the U.S. policy, saying that the strong hope of the United States for quick satisfaction cannot be said to be a diplomatic policy and that the U.S. needs to relax its confrontational attitude toward North Korea and must continue to work for a peaceful settlement. The U.S. ambassador expressed disappointment at this criticism and complained that he did not expect such criticism from an ally. The ambassador, impudently enough, urged Filipino President Fidel Ramos to order the foreign minister to stop such remarks as putting the U.S. in an awkward position in the discourse about the Korean peninsula. This is an infringement on the sovereignty of the Philippines.
