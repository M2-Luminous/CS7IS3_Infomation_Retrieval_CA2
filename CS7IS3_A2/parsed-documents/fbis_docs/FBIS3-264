The ANC has threatened that the new government will probably not be able to honor the contracts. This evening National Housing Minister Louis Shill spoke to Ed Herbst about it: [Shill, in English] I think that's a very intimidating attitude. I cannot believe that any organization that believes they have a part to play in the future South Africa -- and that part is going to be played from May month onward -- would want to prevent the building of houses. Many of the grounds which we are doing under this present scheme -- and which was evolved together with the forum in which the ANC plays a very major role -- are only going to be developed into houses from May, June and July month onward. They would be cutting off their noses to spite their face. My appearing at the TEC [Transitional Executive Committee] yesterday was meeting my responsibilities as a minister in this government to provide information to the organization like the TEC of my own volition. They have no right to summons me, and they will have no right to summons me for next Tuesday either. And the fact that I will be turning up there is because I would like to have clarity on this matter and I am sure the forum would like it as well. Maybe we can help sort the matter out and get back to a normal keel and have the politicians out of the business of housing.
