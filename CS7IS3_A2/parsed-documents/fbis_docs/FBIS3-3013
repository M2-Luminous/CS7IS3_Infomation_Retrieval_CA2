"The central and western regions have great potential for development," Zhu said. "How to develop their economies, how to feed and clothe the poor there, how to help the local people get rid of poverty, and how to realize common prosperity for them all are important issues attracting world attention." Zhu expressed the view when he joined deputies to the National People's Congress from Shaanxi Province in a group discussion on premier Li Peng's government work report. Achievement of common prosperity and development of central and western regions are an important component of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Zhu said. With continued national economic growth and more revenues for the central government, he said, the central authorities will increase investment in the central and western regions and accelerate development there, he said. Zhu called on the regions to continue developing their agriculture as the foundation of their economies. In developing their industry, he said, the regions should not "give up" on agriculture, in which he said they have a comparative advantage. The central authorities are adopting measures to narrow "price scissors" between industrial and farm products to increase peasants' income, he said. "As prices for farm produce rise, the central and western regions will get prosperous," he said. The central and western regions should develop water conservancy projects and infrastructure, especially transport facilities for shipping their rich natural resources to the rest of the country and onto the world market, he pointed out.
