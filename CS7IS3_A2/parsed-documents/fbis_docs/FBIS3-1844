Hu Angang, and Kang Xiaoguang, two young or middle-aged scholars from mainland China recently presented this updated "report on national conditions," which focuses on analyzing the current corruption issue and sets out the original idea of creating new systems to eradicate corruption. Last year, the report on national conditions set out by Hu Angang and Wang Shaoguang [3769 4801 0342] dealt with augmenting the central government's guidance in the conversion of the market economy and many of their suggestions in the report have been adopted by the CPC top echelon and became the contents in the plan for improvement, of which the most popular was the "tax-sharing system." Likewise, the new report on national conditions aims at the malpractice of the day, by making in-depth and incisive analysis, and embodies the courage and vision of intellectuals of a new generation on the mainland. In their analysis, the 4 June incident was under reexamination. It has not been long since the report was presented and the reaction by the CPC top echelon is still unknown; however, when some intellectuals read the report in question, they shared the "heavy hearts" of the authors in their reaction. Beginning today, this paper will carry excerpts of this report in three installments. The report analyzes the present conditions and causes of corruption, and boldly explores measures to achieve a radical cure. The academic discussions are deleted because of a limit in space without the authors permission. [end editor's note] The Extent of Corruption Has Become Cancerous It is not exaggerating to say that the extent of corruption in mainland China has already become cancerous and is rapidly spreading throughout the society. Any government whcih is incapable of fighting corruption will be an incompetent one. All such governments are destined to collapse. It is impossible for a corrupt and incompetent government to carry out modernization. The inevitable ending is that the people will overthrow the corrupt government. It does not matter whether or not the government collapses; nevertheless, modernization will vanish like soap bubbles and the goal of catching up with the world advanced countries, for which several generations have strived, will be out of the question. This report proceeds from the institutional factor to analyze the root cause of corruption in China and to explore and discuss the channels for eradicating corruption. A basic viewpoint of this report is that it is imperative to create new systems to eradicate corruption and to guarantee reform, opening up, and development by fighting corruption. The report comprises of five parts. The authors devote the first part to analyzing the institutional root cause of corruption during the period of conversion to the market economy. The authors define corruption as being rent-seeking [xun zu 1416 4436] activity. The essence of corruption in China is precisely the fact that officials from the top down are vying for acting as ones seeking leases and motivated by personal gain under the role of stimulating mechanism. In the second part, the authors brief on several kinds of the most common rent-seeking activities, including the dual-price system, special economic privileges, high tariffs, and import quotas, and the "preferential policies" for some regions or groups. The authors believe that the government's excessive intervention and a distorted market will provide monopoly for particular interest groups and the cause for rent-seeking activities taking on a vicious cycle. The third part sets out the concept that "development is the last word as is fighting corruption" [fa zhan si yin dao li, fan fu bai ye si yin dao li 4099 1455 2508 4289 6670 3810 0646 5201 2408 0048 2508 4289 6670 3810] and indicate the imperativeness of holding aloft the banner of reform and opening and the banner of fighting corruption simultaneously, to create new systems to eradicate corruption and guarantee reform and opening by fighting corruption. The fourth part sets out the concept that creating new systems is the basic channel for fighting corruption; it is necessary to do away with or cut back rent [zu jin 4436 6855] and restrict rent-seekers as well as special privilege groups through institutions. In creating new systems, it is unnecessary to launch mass campaigns to avoid anticorruption struggle evolving into a "Great Cultural Revolution." And the last part focuses on designing major measures for creating new systems to eradicate corruption, such as lifting controls over loan interest rates, while including them on the track of the market interest rates, and advocating the concept of "everyone being equal before interest rates"; lifting control over foreign exchange rates, while merging them with the market exchange rates; removing nontariff trade walls and lowering tariff rates by a wide margin; publicly auctioning import licenses and delegating the powers of direct imports and exports to enterprises in various categories; abolishing industrial administrative departments and commissions and establishing trades associations; strictly restricting monopoly and unfair competition and guaranteeing enterprises in all categories can freely join or withdraw from the trade to participate in competition; strictly banning party and government organizations from running companies, reducing the scope of administrative officials, raising their salaries by a wide margin, while "supporting the government with normal taxes"; and, at the same time, strictly banning the Army from participating in business, while "supporting the Army with normal taxes" to increase military expenditure by a wide margin. I. The Institutional Root Cause of Corruption: Economic Rent True, the atmosphere of corruption in society is related to the ideology, morals, and style of some party and government cadres. However, should the atmosphere of corruption remain despite repeated banning and rage with ever greater ferocity, that must be highly connected with the system. Today, our anticorruption struggle is to a large extent a moral practice; in actual fact, the corruption today is mainly institutional corruption. The major root cause of the phenomena of corruption lies chiefly in institutional shortcomings, namely, the institutional shortcomings in the period of converting to the market economy. With such a system, even those straight and honest people would soon degenerate and join the rank and file of corruption, becoming captives of institutional corruption as soon as they have power in their hands. Rent-Seeking Activities Lead To Worsening of Corruption Let us take a look at an example of "lobbying a ministry for allotment of funds." Suppose a certain central department has 10 million yuan of financial allotment of funds or for project investment and 10 provinces would like to acquire the monetary resources. Because of the limitation in funds, it is impossible for every province to get them, thus competition between them takes shape. The representative of every province is ready to spend 1 million yuan to openly, or semi-openly, "bribe" the department in question in order to obtain a monetary resource that is 10 times the cost of the bribe. Suppose some province has succeeded in obtaining the allotment with a bribery cost greater than 1 million yuan. When the present value of the monopoly after discount is 10 million yuan, with the general volume of the resource remaining unchanged, the resource will flow from nine losers to one successful province. This is like gambling, with many people buying lottery tickets and only one or two lucky ones hitting the jackpot. Rent-seeking activities have exemplary effects which lead to the worsening of corruption. Because rent-seekers can easily obtain huge or super high profits without going through market competition and technical renovation, this provides a strong stimulation to them while attracting more people to participate in rent-seeking activities, resulting in the spread of corruption on a still wider scope. Rent-seeking does not lead to an increase in social wealth; on the contrary, it leads to low efficiency in resource allocation and a grave waste of resources. To Find a Radical Cure for Corruption, the "Rent" Must Be Abolished In the course of converting to the market economy, the dual-price system is the root cause leading to extensive rent-seeking activities. Economic rent equates the difference between the market and official prices. Here, prices are referred to in a broad sense, including commodity prices, capital prices (interest rates), foreign exchange prices (exchange rates), and prices for imports (quotas and permits.) So long as the two-track price system exists, economic rent will surface, stimulating officials with power and rent-seekers with money to participate and share the economic rent and the phenomena of corruption will grow increasingly serious. That is precisely the institutional root cause for the phenomena of corruption in China. In reality, officials are economic bodies and have motives of personal gain. Under certain restrictions, (such as institutional and moral restrictions) their behavioral criterion is to seek their own maximum interest. It is not abnormal for officials to have motives of personal gain. In China, an official's objective function can possibly be: The expansion of the economic strength of his own unit or locality, an expression to his accomplishments in government, his promotion, increase in actual or invisible income, a say in distributing resources, and consideration for his children, friends, and relatives. Because officials have motives of personal gain, they must be restricted with institutions. The crux lies in the system that shapes the "economic rent." When someone has "something for rent," people will bribe him for that something and will he turn down the bribe when there is no institutional restriction? Whoever is in that position will have the chance to seek something for rent and be stimulated by such rent-seeking activities. So long as such "rents" exist in the system, corruption will be bred. The only solution to it is to create new systems, build new-type modern systems, abolish such "rents," and create new systems to eradicate corruption. II. The Most Common Rent-Seeking Activities Rent-seeking activities are connected with the government's excessive intervention in the market; without such intervention, and the particular monopoly provided by such intervention, there would be no way to seek such rent. Here, a point needs be explained, namely, there are two sides to government's intervention in the market economy. When the government's intervention creates conditions for fair competition in the market economy, implements the unified taxation system and tax rates, builds a unified market system to prevent the shaping of monopoly by some interest groups, such intervention is effective and falls in the category of proper intervention. When the government's intervention results in a distorted market, jeopardizing the fairness in market competition while providing some interest groups with preferential policies and implementing discriminatory policies for other interest groups, such intervention will be ineffective and fall in the category of excessive intervention. This being the case, the excessive government intervention has provided legitimacy for rent-seeking activities, whereas many rent-seekers have conveniently found grounds for legitimate rent-seeking from government policies, institutions, and regulations. That is the fundamental cause for the worsening of rent-seeking activities. Worsening of Rent-seeking Activities Because of Intervention In the course of converting to the market economy, the most common rent-seeking activities are: First, the dual-price system. Excessive government intervention results in price distortion. For example, when the government controls the prices of certain commodities, because of great demand, market prices are far higher than official prices and the price differences shape into economic rent. For another example, the government controls the volume of bank loans and interest rates and the market interest rates are twice the official interest rates. The bank directors, clerks in charge of loans, and the rent-seekers share the "interest rent." Take still another example, the government controls the volume of foreign exchange as well as exchange rates, with the market exchange rates far higher than official ones. Those officials who have the power to examine and approve foreign exchanges are those who enjoy the "exchange rate rent." Here, a point that needs be explained is that since reform, the degree of marketization in China has rapidly expanded and the dual- price system tends to transit in the direction of the one-track market price system. Presently, prices of farm and sideline produce, retail prices of commodities in society, and prices for production materials under the state's direct control or planning guidance account for a very small proportion. Although the rent in this area remains, it is taking on a tendency to wane or disappear. Likewise, the dual-track system of foreign exchange rates is moving toward a merger between the two and the bulk of foreign exchanges are transacted according to the market exchange rates. Likewise, rent in this area is waning or disappearing. Presently, the largest rent comes from the banks loans and interest rates. The government continues to intervene in bulk in the volume of loans and compulsively stipulates interest rates. Although the official interest rates have risen somewhat they are still far lower than the market interest rates. With a special permit from the state, the bank, this particular interest group, shares the greatest rent by monopolizing the use of the rarest resource--capital. A glance at the most luxurious bank buildings that have risen up in many large cities, including many counties and towns, serves as evidence to prove this point. They are just part of the rent and have a very close resemblance to the external characteristic of major banks all over the United States. Second, special economic privileges. Primarily this refers to privileges beyond the law and institutions and second, it refers to special economic permits which have violated the principle of fair competition and which the law and institutions have failed to restrict. For example, the trade's monopoly in operation, allowing only state-owned enterprises the power to monopolize the operation in some trades, while barring enterprises in other categories to freely enter and participate in competition; protecting the essential income of a small number of state-owned enterprises which is higher than the essential income of other industries. A typical example is the petrochemical industry, with the entire industry monopolized by a single company. Consequently, this special interest group enjoys the economic rent all by itself. Take for another example, the special permit for producing or marketing certain categories of commodities. The exclusive possession of the trade in tobacco, or in the operation of telephone and telegram services are on lease with a special permit issued by the government. When those enterprises acquire the monopoly, they willreceive monopolized profits, namely profits exceeding the normal level. When the government allows some special interest groups to have an industrial monopoly and a special permit in operation, the unhealthy atmosphere in the trade will remain stubbornly despite repeated bans. On the other hand, those interest groups will draw a portion from their monopolized profits to bribe government officials so that the latter can come out in the open to intervene and impede other enterprises from participating in competition to protect their monopoly status and guarantee that their industrial economic rent will not be expanded and shared by others. This being the case, to abolish those special economic privileges and allow other enterprises to participate in fair competition is the way to radically cure the unhealthy atmosphere in trades. Third, high tariffs for imports and import quotas. There are both advantages and disadvantages in high tariffs to the development of national industry. From the angle of advantages, high tariffs serve to protect the infantile national industry from international competition and enable it to develop rapidly. From the angle of disadvantages, when the industry is to transcend the infantile phase and is monopolized by a small number of enterprises, those enterprises will give up their efforts to improve technology and quality and augment their market competitiveness with the protection of high tariffs. They enjoy the same essential income far higher than other industries. The control over import quotas and import permits has become the major source, as well as chief characteristic, of rent-seeking by foreign trade departments and companies. A foreign trade company general manager said publicly: "If we delegate power of imports and exports to enterprises, who then will support us?" Obviously, to artificially set up a tariff wall, implementoing an operational monopoly in foreign trade is actually protecting the vested interests of those government-run organizations and monopoly groups under the pretext of protecting national interest. And fourth, the government's "preferential policies" for certain regions or groups. Everyone knows that "preferential policy" is not a mere scrap of paper but has a great content of gold, which equates providing certain monopoly to a certain province or trade. For example, regarding the implementation of "tax reduction or exemption" over a certain province, the conversion of resources takes the form of handing over less taxes to the state; the province or trade that succeeds in acquiring such "preferential policy" is always the one that pays the least tax (referring to ratio), and which equates with enjoying a "blood transfusion" from other provinces and regions, thus indirectly acquiring a sort of economic rent. Special Groups Monopolize Huge Profits Aside from the aforesaid rent-seeking activities, there are stil other types of such activities which, in essence, are all utilizing institutional shortcomings and enabling a small number of special interest groups to resort to means of unfair competition to acquire tremendous profits through monopoly. In a nutshell, the government's excessive intervention has shifted market distortion which, in turn, gives rise to economic rent and stimulates rent-seekers' corruption. The greater the extent of the government's excessive intervention, the more obvious is market extortion and the higher the economic rent will be. That is the main cause for the increasingly intense corruption in Chinese society today. However, there are two sides in government intervention. If government intervention is capable of readjusting and correcting market distortion, economic rent will be reduced, as will the phenomena of corruption. Obviously, such intervention does not mean to change the market economic mechanism and restore the planned economic structure; on the contrary, it is to make full use of the market economic mechanism and cure corruption through creating new systems. III. Development Is the Last Word, As Is Anticorruption "Development is the last word." Without development, there would be no way out for China. Development has always been China's most important economic goal. However, development involves some conditions and corruption should not be the price nor the lubricant for development. To engage in corruption is doubtlessly suicidal and is sure to jeopardize development, lose opportunities, and interrupt the process of modernization in China. The "4 June" incident is a typical example that gave us much food for thought. In analyzing the causes of the incident, Deng Xiaoping said: "One of the causes is the breeding of corruption phenomena which has made some of the masses lose faith in the party and government." In addition, he said: "No slogans on opposing reform and opening have surfaced in the recent incident and the slogans focused on fighting corruption. Of course, to some people, such slogans are just a background and aimed at bewildering people's minds with anticorruption." That showed the breeding of corruption had roused complaints from the broad masses, which was an important cause that sparked the "4 June" incident. Otherwise, there would not have been a million people taking to the street demonstrating in Beijing. History is our best teacher. However, times have passed and circumstances changed and few people would think today: What suddenly sparked the "4 June" incident? And still fewer people would care: Would such an incident repeat itself from now on? Nevertheless, should a nation lack profound reviewing and serious understanding such an incident, it could hardly avoid a repetition of the historical tragedy. Five Types of Periodical Shock and Social Instability Reviewing the more than 40 year's historical progress, we find two outstanding characteristics in the social development of China: First, a considerably high economic growth rate; and second, the instability of economic and social development, accompanied by five types of periodical shock, namely, periods of economic fluctuations, structural change, political struggle, mass campaigns, and student movements. Such instability finds root in the economic system within the Chinese Government. Despite the fact that great changes have taken place in various systems in China since reform, such instability can still be very keenly felt. Regarding the relations and causes for these five types of cycles, the authors will discuss this further in another article. Here we shall do some analysis centering around the issue of the rise of corruption and anticorruption. The CPC as a party in office since the PRC's founding has controlled the bulk of economic resources of the whole society, with a huge state organ controlling those resources. (Explanation: The words bureaucrat and bureaucracy are used neutrally in the following.) Simultaneously, two issues surface; first, the flooding of bureaucratism and low work efficiency and second, the malpractice of acting the high and mighty official and corruption. Because of the lack of an external force to restrict power, as well as an independent supervising system, those two issues have always awaited a solution and perplexed the leading members. Mao Zedong's way was precisely to frequently unfold political struggles and launch mass campaigns. The movement against the three evils [corruption, waste, and bureaucracy], the movement against the five evils [bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cheating on government contracts, and stealing economic information as practiced by owners of private industrial and commercial enterprises], and also the "four clean-up movements" were all to conduct periodical purges of corrupt elements and the opposition inside the bureaucratic system; however, he believed that all those movements had failed to resolve the problems. Hence, the imperativeness of the "Great Cultural Revolution," namely, relying on the masses outside the bureaucratic system to launch a noninstitutional purge on a still wider scope. During the period of the "Cultural Revolution," Mao Zedong landed himself in a "dilemma": On the one hand, he wanted to do all he could to destroy the huge bureaucratic organ which he had personally founded; on the other, he had to rebuild another bureaucratic organ, which a modern country must rely on for its operation. However, he refused to resign to such a situation and, before he passed away, he was determined to carry the "Great Cultural Revolution" through to the end. The tragedy of Mao Zedong in his later years was very complicated. We have to acknowledge that his stubbornness in fighting bureaucratism and corruption represented the aspirations of the broadest masses; nevertheless, when he resorted to noninstitutional means (such as class struggle, political struggle, and mass campaign,) we cannot evade the fact that he committed fatal mistakes and eventually dragged the entire nation into an abyss of turmoil. In the course of rebuilding the state bureaucratic organ since reform, the planned economic structure characterized by centralization has gradually been broken up, with the market economic mechanism characterized by decentralization in decisionmaking; at the same time, organizations of legislation, supervision, and law enforcement have gradually been set up, completed, and perfected. This shows that China has made substantial progress in the development toward marketization economically and legalization socially. However, the issues of bureaucratism and corruption have not been settled, because of the aforesaid cause of institutional shortcomings and the surfacing of special interest groups, which will be discussed later in this article, corruption has become the greatest social pollution in China in the conversion to the market economy and is continuously worsening the social environment. Corruption Inside the Party Might Interrupt Reform Corruption has always been the gravedigger for the government. We are anxious that the vicious corruption inside the party is the most likely factor which will interrupt the course of reform and modernization from now on. The man in the street outspokenly refers to some cadres as "corrupt officials" and "local tyrants and evil gentry." Inner-party corruption will lead to the Communist Party and its government losing the foundation of their legitimacy, namely, the people's approval of the party and government is reducing. That is one of the expressions that the national strength of Chain is universally waning. Some scholars have noticed that corruption has politically endangered the prestige and strength of the party and the state political power, resulting in the people's doubts about the political authority of the Communist Party and the state. The corruption of the rank and file of cadres of the party and state will eventually shake the foundations of the party and state power as well as the entire social system, hence social instability. "Water may allow a vessel to float on it and it can also upset it." Should we allow corruption to spread unchecked, while failing to thoroughly resolve corruption, especially, the high-ranking tier inside the party, it is not impossible for the Communist Party to collapse because of institutional corruption. In actual fact, the party leaders are aware of this possibility.
