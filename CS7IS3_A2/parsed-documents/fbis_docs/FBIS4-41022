This was stated at a briefing at the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Deputy Foreign Minister Oleksandr Makarenko. He explained that the reason for this was that Russia had 48 exemptions from a list of goods that Ukraine imported. These were goods that were of vital importance to Ukraine such as energy sources and timber. In the view of the deputy minister, the creation of the CIS economic community and Ukraine's associate membership of this union should remove these discriminatory restrictions. Oleksandr Makarenko acquainted journalists with the results of President Leonid Kravchuk's visit to Luxembourg and the signing of an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union. The deputy minister assessed the signing of this agreement as the beginning of Ukraine's entry into a united Europe. He in particular stressed that the political part of this document which acknowledges the European Union's interest in seeing Ukraine as a sovereign, independent and territorially integrated state, was of great importance to Ukraine. Regarding essential economic issues, Oleksandr Makarenko said the agreement envisaged the removal of any restrictions on trade between Ukraine and European Union member states. At the same time he noted that although Europe had opened the door with this agreement, the speed with which Ukraine would join it depended on the speed of reforms in Ukraine.
