The president also urged the people of Mindanao to unite and work hard to help achieve the government's objective of transforming the country into a newly industrialized nation by year 2000. "Let us do our jobs and create a momentum so that the younger Filipinos will have a better future and more prosperous life," the president said during a multi-sectoral meeting to launch projects and services for the region. The infrastructure facilities include the P300 million Davao-Digos Road; the P400 million Digos-General Santos Road; the P11.7 million water impounding system for Digos; a P115 million fund for the province for various development projects; and, a P44 million housing project for low-salaried government employees. Ramos said the construction would be completed soonest, adding that funds had been made available so that builders could immediately start constructing the facilities. Bidding for the projects will be finished in two months time, he said. Ramos also released to the province P97 million representing its share of the internal revenue allotment for the first four months of the year. He said the province's allotment for the rest of the year could be released on time by the budget department. Aside from this, the president released P18.5 million representing funds for pet projects of lawmakers from the Davao provinces which are included in the budget law. These projects include the construction of a tourism complex and the improvement of the police headquarters. Other projects given funding commitments were: -- Concreting of the Mati Coastal Road; -- Rehabilitation of numerous farm-to-market roads; and, -- Completion of the unfinished Tandag-Bislig Road in Surigao Del Sur. The housing project, undertaken by the National Housing Authority will benefit some 116 homeless families. The president said his administration was determined to improve the economy of southeastern Mindanao, seen as a major player in implementing the EAGA with provinces of Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The general thrust is to make the country, through the economic development of sub-regions, more competitive in the global trade, tourism, and investment market, he said.
