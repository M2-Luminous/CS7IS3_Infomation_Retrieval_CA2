The blockage impeded the transit of shipments of medicine and food destined for communities negatively affected by conflicts, because the protesters denied passage to all kinds of vehicles. A commission of deputies this afternoon traveled to the area to talk with the protesters. Meanwhile, the Chiapas State government and the Banrural [Rural Bank] General Directorate agreed to increase the support recently authorized for the coastal zone to prevent a decapitalization to include all Chiapas State producers. Ricardo Lecumberri Lopez, Banrural delegate for Chiapas and Oaxaca States, said the measure will benefit all the agrarian and livestock producers accredited to the organization. He explained the agreements foresee the pardon of accrued interests, provisional suspension of all sequestration trials, creation of a fund to renegotiate past due debts, and channeling of new credit resources. Lecumberri Lopez said the support will be granted through Banrural's 12 branches in the state.
