The Wang-Koo Talks last April, involving the heads of the non- governmental Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) of the mainland and the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan (SEF), ushered in a new era in the relations between the two sides. At the end of last year, a break-through was made when leading negotiators from ARATS arrived in Taiwan and talked with their counterparts with the SEF. It was the first time since the People's Republic was founded in 1949 that members of the mainland non-governmental organization landed on the island, bringing a New Year gift to compatriots across the Taiwan Strait as well as overseas Chinese. Even before the political detente, economic ties between the two sides were improve greatly. Taiwan businessmen are running about 10,000 companies and enterprises on the mainland with a contract value of $10 billion. By the end of 1992, bilateral trade amounted to $29 billion. Other kinds of exchanges have also become more frequent, ending the grievous situation of no communication due to military confrontation 15 years ago. Over the years, 1 million people have crossed the Strait. Relaxation of tension across the Strait began with the mainland's publication of the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" on January 1, 1979. At that time, the mainland had shifted its main task to economic development. And the international status of China had been greatly improved as the country set up diplomatic relations with the United States on January 1, 1979. The message says the Chinese mainland is trying to solve the reunification issue by peaceful measures rather than by military force. The strategic message has formed the basis for establishing a new type of relation between the mainland and Taiwan, said Tang Shubei, Vice-Chairman of ARATS, in the weekly magazine Outlook. The mainland advocated direct exchanges of mail, trade, and air and shipping services as well as those of personnel, culture and sports across the Strait. These proposals met the needs of compatriots across the Strait and were welcomed by them, Tang said. Jiang Dianming, from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, shares Tang's view. He said that publication of the message showed the practical attitude of the mainland on the issue of reunification. Also, the message showed that the mainland respected the status quo of the island and the will of its people. And the mainland guaranteed that Taiwan would not suffer economically after reunification, Jiang said. Great changes have taken place in the relations across the Taiwan Strait since the publication of the message. In 1981, Ye Jianying, then Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, reiterated the mainland's policy on Taiwan, stressing that Taiwan would enjoy high autonomy as a special administrative zone of the People's Republic after reunification. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping perfected the policy with his "one country, two systems" composition in 1984. Within his framework, once the country is unified the mainland would continue its socialist system while Taiwan maintains its capitalism. In response to the mainland's flexible measures, Taiwan authorities announced in August 1987 that residents of the island would be allowed to visit their relatives on the mainland. It was a positive step, further relaxing the confrontation across the Strait. Since then, thousands of Taiwan residents have been swarming to the mainland to visit relatives or tour places of interest. Such visits have promoted indirect trade and investment across the Strait. To reduce friction and disputes, the non-governmental SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 and 1991, opening a high-level negotiation channel across the Strait. However, problems still hamper the growth of co-operation. The indirect exchanges have proven time-consuming. And the Taiwan authorities have placed many obstacles and restrictions in the way of exchanges. Another common task for both sides is to unswervingly oppose those advocating the "independence of Taiwan" and oppose any activities aimed at undermining the country's sovereignty. The two sides should sit down to hold more talks concerning issues related to reunification, Tang Shubei said. On the premise of the one-China principle and on the basis of equality and common ground while reserving differences, there are always solutions to the problems, said Tang. Further contacts across the Taiwan Strait in the new year are needed to promote the progress of the peaceful reunification of the country. Lu Jiaxi, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC, has urged the two sides to strengthen scientific co-operation, especially in high and new technology. This will be helpful for reunification and will benefit the world on the whole, Lu said.
