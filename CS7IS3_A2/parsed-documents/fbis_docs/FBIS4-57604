The charge was voiced this Sunday by UN leader Delfin Vasquez, who accused Ambassador Pastorino of favoring opposition presidential candidate Jose Francisco Pena Gomez in the middle of a postelectoral crisis following the controversial elections last Monday. According to the UN, Pastorino spearheads a plan to destabilize the Dominican Republic and begin an "intervention" that would culminate with a plan to "merge" this nation and Haiti into a single nation. Velasquez said a UN delegation will travel to the United States soon to protest Pastorino's actions before the Department of State, and to tell the people of the United States about the plan to merge the two nations. These two countries share the island known as Hispanola during colonial times. A radio and television campaign intensified over the weekend reporting that France and the United States intend to solve the Haitian crisis by unifying it with the Dominican Republic. The opposition Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD), however, said the UN seeks to distract the people's attention from the "outrageous fraud" reportedly perpetrated during the 16 May general elections. The PRD links the UN with President Joaquin Balaguer. As of Sunday 22 May, the Central Electoral Board had not yet announced the winner of the election, whose main contenders were Balaguer and Pena Gomez.
