FR941206-1-00027 FR941206-1-00002 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Ch. 1 [Docket No. 93N&hyph;0178] RIN 0905&hyph;AD90 Regulation of Dietary Supplements; Withdrawal of Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS. ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking; withdrawal. SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is announcing that it is withdrawing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) on the regulation of dietary supplements that it published in the Federal Register of June 18, 1993 (58 FR 33690) (hereinafter referred to as the June 18, 1993, ANPRM). This action is necessary because of recently enacted legislation and terminates the rulemaking initiated by the ANPRM. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Judith S. Kraus, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (HFS&hyph;456), Food and Drug Administration, 200 C St. SW., Washington, DC 20204, 202&hyph;205&hyph;5372. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the June 18, 1993, ANPRM, FDA requested public comment on approaches, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, for assuring the safety of products offered for sale as dietary supplements. In particular, the ANPRM requested information on the safety and use of amino acids, or combinations of amino acids, as ingredients in dietary supplements. Additionally, FDA announced the availability of a report entitled ``Task Force on Dietary Supplements Final Report'' and requested comments on the recommendations made in the report. FDA received over 6,000 comments to the ANPRM. While some of these comments expressed concern about the safety of dietary supplement products, most strongly objected to many of the possible courses of action that the agency outlined in the ANPRM. On October 25, 1994, President Clinton signed into law the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;417). Section 11 of this act declares the June 18, 1993, ANPRM to be null and void and of no force and effect. It also directs the Secretary (and by delegation, FDA) to publish notice to this effect in the Federal Register . After consideration of the comments received, and in light of section 11 of the new law, FDA has decided to withdraw the June 18, 1993, ANPRM. Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq ), the agency hereby withdraws the ANPRM that it published in the Federal Register of June 18,1993 (58 FR 33690), on the regulation of dietary supplements. Dated: November 30, 1994. William K. Hubbard, Interim Deputy Commissioner for Policy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29988 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4160&hyph;01&hyph;F
