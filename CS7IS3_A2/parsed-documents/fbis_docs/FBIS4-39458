"Certainly, corresponding issues should be settled with due account of our essential stand on recognition of territorial integrity of the Georgian republic," said Karasin. In his words, the United Nations Security Council's secretariat held consultations on cooperation in peace-keeping in Abkhazia late in May in New York. The consultations were held in the presence of Russia. "Their main result is the end to watchfulness as regards the Commonwealth plans of a peace-keeping operation in Abkhazia, and understanding of the need for close interaction between our peace- makers and the U.N. mission in the conflict zone," said the Russian Foreign Ministry's representative.
