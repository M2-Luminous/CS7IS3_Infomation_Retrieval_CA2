V. Mikhlyayev; UDC 535.317:681.7.012] [Abstract] Geometric aberrations of a lightguide because of a nonparallel orientation of its walls have been examined. The lightguide consists of a transparent medium bound by two planes. The lower plane coincides with the XY plane, the Z axis is directed normal to this surface. The upper plane is oriented at an angle to the lower, so that it intersects planes ZY and ZX at angles _a_ and _g_. The incident light beam lies in a plane x=constant, and forms an angle _b_ with the normal to the lower plane. If the walls are not parallel, when _a_ and _b_ are not equal to zero, geometric aberrations are produced, which are deviations _D_x[.sup]i[/], _D_y[.sub]i[/] of the coordinates of the beam intersection points with the lower plane from their value, compared to the ideal case. Computations of _D_x, as a function of the number of reflections N for different values of parameters _a_ and _g_ were made and the results are shown in the graphs. Cases of the light beam propagation through a quasi-plane light guide and a case of the coordinates deviations _D_x, _D_y from N because of the light beam divergence were also examined and the results are provided.
