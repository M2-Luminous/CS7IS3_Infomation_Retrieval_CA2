Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev Has Held His Traditional Meeting With Journalists"] [Text] As KRASNAYA ZVEZDA has already reported, this was the final meeting of the current year. So there was frank discussion about practically all questions of the life and daily activity of the Russian Armed Forces. First of all the defense minister stressed that the outgoing year of 1993 has certainly been extremely complex for the Army from all viewpoints. It has been a year whose lessons require the most serious analysis. The most important point is that this year the Army has played an important role in preserving Russia's integrity and security. Metaphorically speaking, it has had to clear away the obstructions created as a result of the political confrontation in the country. The Army, Pavel Grachev stressed, wants just one thing: the maximum harmony in society and state stability. Any other speculations regarding its role in society are impermissible and extremely dangerous. In what kind of shape is the Russian Army as it prepares to enter the new year of 1994? It is more cohesive and stronger than ever. In the outgoing year it proved possible to put a stop once and for all to many negative trends and to create good groundwork for the future. The reform of the Army, the minister stressed, is going according to plan, in a calm workmanlike atmosphere. The Russian Army currently has 2.3 million men. Over the last 18 months it has decreased by almost 0.5 million. This process will continue, but there will be no precipitate [obvalnyy] reduction, Grachev stressed. He also advocated that the size of the Russian Army be kept at approximately the current level, since the earlier parliamentary decision on an Army of 1.5 million is clearly at odds with the scale of the tasks that it is resolving. This year around 640,000 servicemen, over 30,000 tanks, 9,000 artillery systems, over 4,000 aircraft and helicopters, 46 divisions, 64 brigades, and 90 air regiments have been withdrawn from the East European countries and nearby foreign lands. The withdrawal of troops from Czechoslovakia [as published], Hungary, Poland, Mongolia, Lithuania, and Cuba has been completed. This process took place within an extremely tight time frame, the minister stressed. Concerning questions of troop combat training, Pavel Grachev stressed that, despite many difficulties, here too it has been possible to retain a planned and systematic approach. The necessary training exercises for command personnel have been held and command-staff and regional exercises have taken place. These showed that the troops are at an adequate level of combat readiness and can resolve all the tasks entrusted to them. Of course, the most painful questions in the Army and in society as a whole are problems of social protection. But even in these conditions, when the Defense Ministry is literally having to "fight" to secure everything necessary for the needs of the Army and servicemen, it has been possible to do a considerable amount. The most important thing is housing, of course. Some 120,000 servicemen currently need a roof over their heads. The Defense Ministry channels 75 percent of the money allocated for capital construction into the construction of housing. Through its own efforts around 62,000 apartments were constructed in 1993. This figure will go up by a further 30 percent in the new year. In addition, Pavel Grachev named yet another reason why it has so far not been possible to solve this extremely acute social problem. Local administrations have allocated only 12 percent of the planned volume of housing. The defense minister devoted much attention to questions of manpower acquisition for the forces. After noting the difficulties with the draft at the start of this year, he stressed that the situation is now more stable. There is still a shortage in many units, but the measures that have been taken have made it possible to avoid the worst-case forecasts. He noted the improvement in the work of military commissariats and local administrations in the Transbaykal, Far Eastern, North Caucasus, and Volga Military Districts. As of now draft manpower levels are 60 percent of what is required. Concerning contract service, the defense minister noted a number of difficulties. In his view, it is worrying that contract servicemen are more willing to accept posts in the rear while there are far fewer who want to go to the front line and join combat units. Nevertheless, 123,000 servicemen have now signed contracts. This figure will certainly increase in the new year. Journalists also wanted to know about Russia's relations with NATO. "Our relations," the defense minister stressed, "must be more meaningful and develop across a broad spectrum of collaboration." He also announced the creation of a group of experts which is to submit as early as the beginning of 1994 a joint plan for military-political and military cooperation between Russia and NATO. Army General Pavel Grachev answered many questions from journalists during the press conference. The frankness of the answers, including those to so-called "awkward" questions, should be emphasized. However, the minister did not duck these questions; what is more, he not only gave clear and precise answers but also found the opportunity for a broader and franker exchange of opinions. In conclusion Army General Pavel Grachev addressed new year greetings to all servicemen, members of their families, and veterans: "I would sincerely like to express the wish that you will feel confidence in the future in the new year. May peace and tranquillity come to every home. May all the hopes of people in uniform for a better, quieter, worthier, and happier life come true."
