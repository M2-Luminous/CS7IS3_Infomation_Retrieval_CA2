On the one hand there are the "guardians" of the state budget -- led by the treasury minister, and including the League's ministers -- who want an immediate substantial economic package. And they are not afraid to talk in terms of new taxes to compensate for overspending. On the other hand, however, there are those who are promising to reduce the public deficit miraculously without any cuts or new taxes. This team is headed by Transportation Minister Publio Fiori. It seems that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi himself also belongs to this band of "optimists." Yesterday the two alignments engaged in an open confrontation, brandishing their weapons. After a very heated day on the financial markets, Treasury Minister Lamberto Dini -- who is officially responsible for drawing up the economic package -- issued a note in an attempt to calm the atmosphere. Dini stated clearly that the package will be a substantial one and will affect this year's budget. The treasury minister does not intend to allow the deficit to exceed the established limit by a single lira. How does he intend to do this? Very likely, by bringing forward a large part of the 1995 Finance Bill, making some of its measures effective this year. This will deal a blow to pensions and health provisions in the second half of this year. Dini was very explicit: He wants to prevent a currency crisis from overwhelming the lira and the Italian Stock Exchange. Be that as it may, the treasury minister interprets current events on the financial markets as a temporary phenomenon. Short-lived turbulence, Dini said, is inevitable in strongly integrated markets, and sometimes leads to unjustified "excessive" movements. The treasury minister warned, however, that people must not have any illusions: Unjustified increases in public expenditure "will be counterbalanced by specific measures to increase public revenue." By so saying Dini reaffirmed that the Constitutional Court's ruling on pensions will be complied by means of ad hoc measures. But any other possible overspends will also be counterbalanced by taxation. This, starting with the 4-5 trillion lire needed this year to limit the deficit to 154 trillion lire. So Dini considers any unrest and tension with regard to government bonds unjustified. "The behavior of the international financial markets," the treasury minister wrote, "has been countered in recent weeks. There have been substantial increases in interest rates on government bonds in all the major industrial countries, accompanied by considerable fluctuations in the exchange rate of the dollar against other currencies. Short-term fluctuations," the minister explained, "are inevitable in strongly integrated markets that interact and sometimes produce excessive movements in the exchange rates themselves.. Indeed, the major rise in interest rates on long-term stock is neither explained nor justified by the current or expected rate of inflation. The lira and interest rates on government bonds," the treasury minister continued, "have suffered as a result of these disturbances. Apart from this, there have been a number of internal developments liable to increase public spending that will be counterbalanced by specific measures to increase revenue." This was an unmistakable reference to the ruling on pensions. The new taxes will not only serve to fill the 30 trillion lire INPS [National Social Security Institute] gap. "The work on reforming public finance will continue," the minister added, "through a corrective measure with respect to the deficit for the current year and more especially for1995." So Dini is clearly calling loudly for a substantial and rapid action including measures that will hit Italians in their pockets in the coming months. The League's Vito Gnutti, the industry minister, spoke in a similar vein yesterday: "If there is any overspending," he said in Bologna, "the response in terms of the need for an economic package would be obvious." A very different plan for public finances is being put forward by the other side, which we could call the government's optimists. "I have in mind," Fiori said, "a plan for 50 trillion lire involving no cuts and no new taxes. It will will bring in the 50 trillion lire that we need to fill the INPS gap and to resolve the most immediate public finance problems." The transportation minister declined to say any more about his plan to reform public finances. But he did issue this sharp verdict on the treasury minister's plan: "I disagree with Minister Dini about the need for an immediate package; we won the elections on the basis of a distinct policy and we have never considered constituting a second Ciampi government. I have clear ideas about the Finance Bill. I expect," Dini went on, "not a drastic bill, but a sensible one that will not misrepresent the situation but that will aim to develop and revive the economy." What is the nature of this plan? We will hear it from Fiori in a few days' time. Fortunately, yesterday ended with some wise remarks from Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio. We must beware, he said, not to try to stray from the path of economic reform with "coercive measures" affecting the public debt. It is a long road, Fazio warned, and the only way to go is "an incisive and gradual reduction of spending requirements."
