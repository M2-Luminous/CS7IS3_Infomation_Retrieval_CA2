FR940713-2-00026 FR940713-2-00021 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;631&hyph;000] National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation and Laurel Fields Storage Company; Notice of Application July 7, 1994. Take notice that on June 28, 1994, National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National) 10 Lafayette Square, Buffalo, New York 14203, and Laurel Fields Storage Company (Laurel Fields), a partnership to be formed by National or its affiliate and other equity participants following the receipt of Securities and Exchange Commission approval, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;631&hyph;000, a joint application, pursuant to Sections 7(b) and 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act and Subpart A of Part 157 and Subpart G of Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations, for a certificate of public convenience and necessity, blanket certificates, and abandonment authorization. Specifically, Laurel Fields seeks a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing: (1) Conversion of the Callen Run production field, located in Jefferson County, Pennsylvania, to an interstate natural gas storage field; (2) the acquisition of the Limestone Storage Field (formally the Allegheny State Park storage field) located in Cattaraugas County, New York, from National; (3) the construction and operation of the necessary facilities to develop the Callen Run Storage Field and to expand the capacity of the Limestone Storage Field; (4) participation in a no-fee exchange with National solely for the purpose of maintaining gas service to four retail customers who now receive gas off production lines in the Callen Run field that will be replaced by new storage pipelines; and (5) the abandonment of existing pipelines and a compressor facility that will be replaced with new facilities at the Limestone Storage Field. Laurel Fields also seeks blanket certificates under Subpart F, Part 157 and Subpart G, Part 284 of the Commission's Regulations. Laurel Fields has proposed to develop the Callen Run field into an underground natural gas storage field with 12.1 Bcf of working gas capacity and states that the injection of an estimated 10.3 Bcf of base gas will be required, and that the field will yield an estimated 130 MMcf per day of peak withdrawal deliverability. The total cost of the Callen Run facilities is estimated to be $76,043,000. It also has proposed to further develop the Limestone Storage Field and expand its working gas capacity to 7 Bcf, which will require the injection of an estimated 3.5 Bcf of additional base gas, and will yield a total peak withdrawal deliverability of 77 MMcf per day. The estimated cost of facilities for the Limestone Storage Field is $48,687,000. Thus, the entire Laurel Fields Storage Project will have a working gas storage capacity of 19.1 Bcf with a peak withdrawal rate of approximately 207 MMcf per day with a total estimated cost of $124,730,000. Laurel Fields intend to offer firm and interruptible storage services on an open access, non-discriminatory basis in compliance with the Commission's blanket certificate regulations at Section 284.221. Laurel Fields proposes two firm storage services, Rate Schedules SS&hyph;110 and SS&hyph;60, and one interruptible storage service, Rate Schedule SSI. The rates proposed to be charged are cost-based in nature. Laurel Fields has filed a pro forma tariff consisting of the aforementioned rate schedules, General Terms and Conditions, and forms of service agreements. National seeks permission and approval to (1) abandon its interests in the Limestone Storage Field, by assignment to Laurel Fields; (2) abandon four delivery points and to relocate one delivery point off production pipelines located in the Callen Run Storage Field that will be abandoned during the development of the field; and (3) to participate in the no-fee exchange with Laurel Fields; as previously described. In addition, National and Laurel Fields seek any authorizations required from the Commission to effectuate a lease of the storage capacity (including injection and withdrawal deliverability) in the Limestone Storage Field from Laurel Fields to National during the construction phase of the project, which is proposed to commence during the Spring of 1996. It is also stated that National will require the capacity in the Limestone Storage Field until April 15, 1996, in order to meet existing contractual service obligations. The applicants will be conducting an open season beginning August 1, 1994 and ending September 1, 1994, during which it will accept nominations for firm storage service. The application includes one (1) precedent agreement for 2.5 MMDth of long-term storage service with National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before July 28, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to jurisdiction conferred upon the Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the NGA and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for National and Laurel Fields to appear or be represented at the hearing. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
