The projects have brought about "remarkable changes" in rural development in this region, the provincial authorities said. The Guanchuan river valley in Gansu was notorious for its arid land, scarce vegetation, suffering from constant soil erosion and frequent natural disasters. The World Bank extended a low interest loan of 7 million U.S. dollars in 1987 to help this place. Now 73 percent less sand and soil is deposited into the already silty Huanghe river by the Guanchuan river, thanks to the cooperation projects with the bank. Forestry and grass cover 42.5 percent of the land in this region today, up from 8.5 percent in 1986. And grain production is increasing 4.5 million kilograms every year. A local official said, "the rural population in this river valley have almost ended poverty." The UN World Food Program provided 61.18 million U.S. dollars in aid to help construct six large irrigation projects along the Huanghe river. The former drought-stricken highland has been turned into a grain production base. In 1987, the World Bank also financed what has been called China's most difficult and costly water diversion project with a loan of 123 million U.S. dollars, relieving the repeated interruptions caused by a shortage of funds and complicated geological conditions. Italian and Japanese companies are participating in the construction. It is expected to be finished this year and to irrigate 13,000 hectares of land this winter. To further alleviate the water problem in Gansu, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the European Community offered aid packages of 200,000 U.S. dollars and 3.58 million European currency units respectively to set up two hi-tech water-saving irrigation experimental zones. Promoting social development has also been an important aspect of cooperation with world organizations in Gansu. Medical bodies in the countryside in 15 counties have been receiving aid from the UN Population Fund, children's fund and some Canadian institutions. Many rural clinics have been set up under the aid program. The World Bank loaned Gansu 20 million U.S. dollars to improve rural education in some poverty-stricken areas in 1987. China's first pilot center aided by foreign funds to wipe out rural illiteracy was established in Longxi county recently. The UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization provided 25,000 U.S. dollars in aid for the center.
