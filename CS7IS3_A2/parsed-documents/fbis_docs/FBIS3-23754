The organizing body consisting of eight people, which includes young workers, students, and even one unemployed person, was headed by Aleksey Larionov, a 28-year-old watchman at a genetic clinic. On the local political scene, as he himself has admitted, he is no newcomer: as long ago as the early 1980's he was given "prophylactic treatment" by the KGB and removed from the school Komsomol organization for having prepared leaflets containing excerpts from Voice of America broadcasts. Four years later he was an activist in the local organization of DemSoyuz [Democratic Union], maintaining contacts also with representatives of the NTS (National Labor Union). In and of itself, the conversion of what used to be an ultra-democrat into the initiator of the creation of an LDPR "cell" appears to be a tremendous political somersault. Because literally a few days ago the leader of the previously mentioned DemSoyuz, Valeriya Novodvorskaya compared Zhirinovskiy to Hitler, and she promised the Russians that, if the Communist Party merged with the LDPR, they could expect gas chambers, crematoriums, and torture chambers. But what is interesting today is not so much a change in the "political face" of one of the Sakhaliners, as the immediate plans of Zhirinovskiy's supporters on the island. That was specifically the topic of the conversation with Aleksey Larionov. [Saktaganov] To begin with, I would like to know what forced you to reject so sharply your previous political views. Because, judging from the results of the recent election, the same thing occurred with many Sakhaliners... [Larionov] My views did not change. The organizations changed. And just as I became an anti-Communist in the tenth grade, I have remained one. Incidentally, Vladimir Volfovich is also an anti-Communist, and during this transitional period it is only he who can stop the "Red wave" that is in motion... [Saktaganov] But aren't you embarrassed by the fact that, at a party-wide banquet that the political leaders held in Moscow to celebrate the election results, Zhirinovskiy ostentatiously shook the hand of the "chief" Russian Communist Zyuganov? True, he emphasized that this was only "a handshake between Slavs,"but it was extremely symbolic... [Larionov] During all these years I realized that politics is actually dirty business. People do not engage in politics in white gloves. If we want to put an end to Communism, this must be achieved by democratic means. But from tactical considerations it is possible to shake Zyuganov's hand. It is also possible today to walk alongside of him in parliament to a definite coalition. But the necessity of this kind of alliance exists only in the State Duma, where Vladimir Volfovich does not have enough votes. In the outlying areas, in the regions, we shall not take the step of entering an alliance with the local Communist Party organizations, or with this Paramoshkin. We always are well aware that the Communists are our enemies. When Zhirinovskiy comes to power, the Communists -- if we can express it this way -- will be the first to suffer. If they do not understand this, this is all the worse for them. [Saktaganov] If it is not a secret, how will they suffer? Will they "sit" [that is, be imprisoned]? Will they be given "prophylactic treatment," as you were at one time by the KGB? [Larionov] Our leader will decide that. Our job is to carry out his orders. But from my point of view it will be necessary to take drastic measures. [Saktaganov] If you are a supporter of strict party discipline, how do you intend to carry out Vladimir Volfovich's policy in the territorial question? After all, Zhirinovskiy, speaking, in particular, in Novosibirsk, stated that for him the Kurile problem does not exist, and it is very simple to resolve the frictions with Japan: just aim the big guns at Japan and demand... Hokkaido. Will your organization in Sakhalin boycott the Japanese delegations, arm itself with those big guns, and protest against humanitarian aid from a neighboring country? [Larionov] I shall say immediately that we shall not arm ourselves, because we are supporters of legal methods of taking action But, obviously, we shall boycott any Japanese representatives and measures with which they are linked. So I agree with our leader in his view of the territorial question --and not only with regard to Hokkaido or the Kuriles, but also with regard to Poland, Finland, and Alaska. First Russia must stand on its feet, but the time will come when it will be necessary to resolve the question concerning its borders from a position of strength. [Saktaganov] Zhirinovskiy have repeatedly stated in public that, when he comes to power, all the Jews will be exiled from Russia. What is your attitude toward them and, in general, people of other nationalities who are living on the territory of the oblast? [Larionov] There are two questions here, because it is necessary to isolate the Jews from all the other nationalities. Vladimir Volfovich is right: they are a people who, by their mentality, are committed to world domination. The history not only of Russia, but also of all other countries, indicates that it is impossible to get along peaceably with this nation, but we do not want to take any extreme measures against them. Therefore it would be best for themselves if they just leave. As for other nationalities -- the Tatars, for example, or the Mordvinians -- they must recognize the values of Russia and the Russians, and, in that case, they can continue to live here. But there will not be any union republics. There will be guberniyas where the local population -- for example, Uzbeks -- will have complete cultural autonomy, their own language and traditions, but they will also be subjects of the Russian empire. [Saktaganov] One of the most brilliant figures among the LDPR candidates was Kashpirovskiy. Do you also plan to bring into your ranks the Sakhalin "extrasensory perceptionists" or people who feel that they are somehow linked with cosmic energy --followers of yoga, soothsayers, shamans?... [Larionov] It's still too early to talk about this. But I feel that, with time, everyone will be with us. Including the extrasensory perceptionists, if they prove to be beneficial in the political struggle. Incidentally, Kashpirovskiy is doing a lot not only for Vladimir Volfovich, but also for the entire party... [Saktaganov] What social segments do you plan to rely on in our oblast? [Larionov] On all of them except the intelligentsia. Vladimir Volfovich was right a year ago, when he said that the intelligentsia would not understand us. And we put a very low evaluation on the intelligentsia, inasmuch as the Russian intelligentsia always played a fatal role in our country's history. [Saktaganov] I am, of course, somewhat upset by such a stern sentence pronounced on the intelligentsia.. But you, as a public and political figure, will still have to deal with it. Or at least with those journalists. For example, which of the oblast newspapers, in your opinion, is close to the LDPR in spirit? [Larionov] The one that is probably closest in spirit is GUBERNSKIYE VEDOMOSTI. [Saktaganov] What will be your tactics in the 6 March election to the oblast parliament? Are there any possible allies among the local politicians? [Larionov] First of all we are counting on the ordinary people. But we also intend to work with the military and with the law-enforcement agencies. But we completely reject the current political establishment -- Krasnoyarov, Fedorov, Feoktistov, Mikhaylov, etc. If, in January, we succeed in forming an able-bodied organization, we shall put our candidates to the oblast parliament in contact with the local branch of the Russian National Council, where Gennadiy Semenov is the chairman. [Saktaganov] Would you like to take this opportunity to say anything to the readers? [Larionov] I would like to thank the Sakhaliners for having made this choice. They have proven to be wiser than many Russians: our oblast occupies one of the first places with regard to the number of votes cast for the LDPR. And I would call upon the inhabitants of the island to unite with our organization. If possible, I would like you give the telephone number where I can be contacted: 3-24-02... [Editor's note] We would like to emphasize immediately that our newspaper will never be "close in spirit" to the Zhirinovskiy supporters. And the sentence pronounced by them on the Russian intelligentsia pertains literally to each of the SVOBODNYY SAKHALIN journalists. But, unlike the LDPR activists who are proceeding along the path that has already been well-trodden by the political-investigation workers -- the path of giving "prophylactic treatment" to dissenters and persons of other nationalities, we are ready to give the floor to any of the political opponents, if, of course, he operates within the confines of the law. And there is something else. We hope that the Sakhaliners who voted for Zhirinovskiy in the recent election, after receiving more detailed information about the LDPR, so to speak, first-hand, will finally understand precisely what is approaching Russia. A person with ears will hear, and a person with eyes will see...
