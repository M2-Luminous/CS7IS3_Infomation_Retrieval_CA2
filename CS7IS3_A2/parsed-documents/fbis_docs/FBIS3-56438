The "White House" is deserted. There is a small number of people in the Blue Room, where Gaydar's letter has been disseminated and where he is giving a short news conference. "When I accepted the offer of the president and the premier to resume my work in the government in September 1993, it was clear to me that, while being responsible, of course, for everything happening in the economy and with the economic reform, I would have only a limited range of tools for influencing the shaping of current policy. Nevertheless, mindful of the tense situation, I remained convinced that the government would be able to rally around the president and nonetheless pursue a sufficiently responsible policy of stabilizing the situation in the economy...." In his opinion, some things have been done: The rate of inflation fell sharply from 26 percent in August to 13 percent in December; the economy has been opened up; a whole package of documents has been adopted to ensure the start of reforms in the housing sphere; on the whole, a certain movement toward general economic stabilization has been begun. At the same time, with increasing frequency decisions have been made in the government with which either the first vice premier was not familiar or objected to them categorically. Deeming it not possible under these conditions to be responsible for other people's decisions, Yegor Gaydar is leaving the government. Ella Pamfilova is leaving too. I put several questions to Gaydar: "Have you weighed the consequences of your step insofar as your places and positions may be taken by directly opposite figures and directly opposite positions?" "Yes, of course. Naturally, we hope that the government's course will still not be radically changed. But there is a rigid logic of life here. It makes sense to hold some position for as long as you can operate from this position. Or at least block actions with which you disagree. Otherwise you simply make common cause with decisions you consider harmful and irresponsible." Earlier Gaydar had cited two examples. The decision on a joint monetary system with Belarus, which is possible in principle if it is clearly formulated and if control systems are defined. In fact the ill-conceived version of the signed bank agreement will reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere and unlimited subsidizing of Belarus at the expense of Russian citizens -- something that we were getting away from with tremendous difficulty during 1992. The second was the decision to construct the Parliamentary Center at a cost of $500 million, which Gaydar calls immoral. The former vice premier was slow to answer my question as to whether Gaydar had already met with the president and what Yeltsin's emotional reaction was, but the expression on his face caused the assembled people to laugh in concert. Gaydar hastened to remark that the president understands the situation perfectly and that they had spoken calmly. "Are you shifting the center of your work to the parliament?" I asked. Gaydar replied in the affirmative. In all cases, he remarked, we will struggle to ensure that the key committees -- defense, security, and international policy -- do not pass into the hands of our opponents; here we adhere to firm ultimatum-like positions, and our civilized, considered policy will be aimed at keeping out of power adventurists capable of drawing the country into war. "Are you thinking of working with society and winning it over more intelligently than you have done before?" "Yes, we will endeavor to work by rectifying all our serious mistakes which were undoubtedly made." Asked when he felt himself to be the leader of the democratic movement, Gaydar replied that he still does not feel himself to be this, although maybe this happened on the night of 3-4 October, unexpectedly, which was a rather unpleasant surprise. In the end I asked: "What mood are you in? Do you regard what has happened in terms of a 'defeat' or in some other terms?" "I would say this: We have lost a battle, but I certainly do not believe that we have lost the war. Moreover, we are simply obliged to win it. Our departure marks not the end but the continuation of the struggle. The logic of 'the worse, the better' is categorically unaccaptable to us." One way or another, we have gotten a new political quality, whose further development is hard to predict today.
