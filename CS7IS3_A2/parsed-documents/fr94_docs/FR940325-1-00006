FR940325-1-00006 FR940325-1-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 166 [CGD 94&hyph;023] Port Access Routes; Approaches to Delaware Bay AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of study. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is conducting a port access route study to evaluate the need for changes to the vessel routing measures in the approaches to Delaware Bay. Due to a number of near collisions, and at least one collision between an outbound tug-barge and an inbound deep draft ship, the Mariner's Advisory Committee of the Bay and River Delaware has requested that the eastern approach lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) be adjusted and that an inshore traffic zone be established for coastwise traffic. This port access route study will determine what, if any, changes to the vessel routing measures are needed in the approaches to Delaware Bay. As a result of the study, a new or modified TSS may be proposed in the Federal Register. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be mailed to Commander (oan), Fifth Coast Guard District, 431 Crawford Street, Portsmouth, VA 23704&hyph;5004.

Normal office hours are between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Comments may also be hand delivered to this address.
