FBIS4-57631 "drlat099_m_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-099 Daily Report 19 May 1994 Brazil ESG Commander Endorses PT's Economic Ideas ESG Commander Endorses PT's Economic Ideas PY2005024294 Sao Paulo AE in Portuguese 2140 GMT 19 May 94 PY2005024294 Sao Paulo AE Portuguese BFN [Report by Ricardo Lessa] [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 19 May (AE) -- In a lecture given at the Heavy Construction Association, the War College [ESG] commander, Brigadier Sergio Xavier Ferolla, today defended several points of the Workers Party [PT] program. Among these points are the expansion of the domestic market and the state monopoly over strategic economic areas. Endorsing the PT line, Ferolla attacked economic neoliberal proposals and privatization. Attending the lecture were some heavy construction heavyweights such as Emilio Odebrecht and Sergio Andrade. The latter is director of the Andrade Gutierrez company. Ferolla said that, taking into account the Armed Forces' viewpoint, he endorses many points of the PT program. "In general, the program is correct," he said. He denied, however, that he is going to support the PT. He said: "My party is Brazil." He added that "there can be no problems if they are defending sound ideas." He noted that the party that best reflects his own ideas is the Communist Party of Brazil. "This is what democracy is all about," he said. Ferolla provoked surprise among the businessmen when he made a historical correction. He said: "Many people believe the ESG was responsible for the 1964 military movement, but that was not the case at all." He noted that former President Castello Branco, who took courses at the ESG when he was a colonel, was an advocate of democracy. He also denied allegations that the ESG's creation had been inspired by the United States. He said: "We always have been concerned about formulating a national plan." In defending the domestic market's expansion, Ferolla said he is not among the 10 million Brazilians who can afford to buy a new car. "Just think that if we could increase this figure by a factor of seven we would have a market equal to that of Japan," he said. "Our main strength lies in the size of our market." Ferolla criticized the opening of the economy to foreign capital and the Argentine privatization program. He said: "They sold Argentine Airlines to the Spanish airline Iberia and the Argentine telephone company to Italian and French state-owned companies. If we applied legislation here similar to that enacted by the United States to protect its economy, they would characterize us as xenophobes."
