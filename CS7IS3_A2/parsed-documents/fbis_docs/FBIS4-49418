He added that the authorities should strengthen control on prices. Mr. Xu Rongchang said that the marcoeconomic situation was generally sound during the first quarter of this year but the prices growth continued to climb based on a rather high figure of last year. National retail prices rose by 20.1 percent during the first quarter over the same period last year, a gain exceeding the prices growth registered in 1988. Mr. Xu said he was convinced that inflation had just about reached the limits of endurance for a large number of residents. In rural areas, gains in income earned by peasants was lower than that by urban workers for the sixth consecutive year. The endurance of peasants has become so fragile when taking into consideration a total of 85 million people who have not yet solved their food and clothing problems, in addition to peasants in disaster areas. In urban areas, with the problems of inflation and unfair distribution prevailing, an increasing number of workers have seen their income cut and they have tended to have a strong response to the price hikes. The researcher called for an immediate strengthening of macroeconomic regulation to prevent economic overheating. He also appealed for the making use of a prime chance to push forward price reform. The food package project should be properly carried out while at the same time prices should be put under control in order to keep prices growth at the set target of not more than 10 percent.
