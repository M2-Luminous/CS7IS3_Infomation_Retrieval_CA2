Experiments to verify the principles of these technologies are conducted in the Spacelab. Since electric power used for spacecraft operation is eventually converted to unnecessary heat, it is necessary to remove the heat from the spacecraft to space through radiators. The size and electric power consumption of future spacecraft are expected to enlarge significantly. The distance between the heat source and the radiators will then lengthen, and unnecessary heat to be radiated will also increase. Accordingly, fluid loops (called two-phase fluid loops) utilizing latent heat of vaporization of liquid (heat absorbed from the surroundings when a matter changes its phase from liquid to vapor; the heat is ejected when the phase changes from vapor to liquid) have been proposed for the temperature control inside spacecraft and heat transport from the heat sources inside spacecraft to radiators. Japan, Europe, and the U.S. started to conduct fluid loop research since 1980's. A two-phase fluid loop is outlined in Figure 1. The two-phase fluid loop consists of the following components: (1) Cold Plate (CP) for absorbing heat and vaporizing the fluid; (2) Pump to send the liquid to Radiator CP in order to emit the heat to space and condense the vapor; (3) Accumulator to control the inner pressure of the two-phase fluid loop; (4) Liquid and vapor paths connecting the above; (5) Control system. Figure 1. Flow Pattern in Residual Gravity The CP receives heat from the equipment installed on it from a pump and uses the heat to vaporize the liquid sent to it. The vapor absorbs unnecessary heat as latent heat of vaporization, is transported to the radiator, and condensed by radiating heat to space. The vapor then returns to the liquid phase. The CP temperature approaches the liquid vaporization temperature which in turn depends on the inner pressure of the two-phase fluid loop. Accordingly, the CP temperature can be managed by controlling the inner pressure of the loop with the accumulator. The accumulator controls the inner pressure of the two-phase fluid loop by transferring the liquid to or from the two-phase fluid loop. A thermally driven accumulator will be used in the two-phase fluid loop undergoing research by the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA). The liquid inlet and outlet section have a capillary structure and are designed to collect only liquid there. Fine grooves are engraved on the accumulator's inner wall to help form a thin liquid film. Vaporization of the liquid film or condensation of the vapor on the grooved section can be accomplished by heating or cooling the accumulator. This controls the inner pressure of the accumulator, and the liquid in the accumulator is driven. The experiment in IML-2 is to verify the principle of thermal drive using the principle model of the accumulator called the Thermally Driven Flow Unit (TDFU). The principle of the TDFU is shown in Figure 2. The TDFU consists of two steel vessels with an observation window, two thermoelectric elements (elements for converting electric energy to thermal energy and vice versa; they are heated or cooled depending on the direction of electric current) for heating and cooling the vessels, and a heat sink which smooths heat input to and output from the thermoelectric elements. The inner wall of each vessel is grooved, and the two vessels are connected with a tube to facilitate liquid movement. The inner part of the vessel consists of two sections. One section is the capillary structure on the connecting tube side of the vessel; the other is the hollow section on the opposite side. Distilled water is used as the working fluid. The gas and liquid in the vessel are separated due to the higher affinity of the vessel inner surface for gas than for liquid (difference of wettability) and tendency of liquid of larger surface tension to collect in the capillary structure section. In microgravity, wettability and capillary force play important roles in controlling liquids in gas-liquid separation. Figure 2. Experiment Vessel of CDU When an electric current is applied to the thermoelectric elements, one vessel is heated while the other is cooled. The inner pressure of the vessel heated increases due to the vaporization of liquid, and the inner pressure of the vessel cooled decreases due to the condensation of the vapor. The liquid moves from the heated side to the cooled side due to the pressure difference thus produced. The experiment is conducted with the VIBES's vibration isolation mechanism on and off. The gas and liquid conditions in the vessels are observed and recorded to understand and confirm the principle of thermally driven flow. The results obtained from this experiment will not only be reflected in the design of two-phase fluid loop accumulators but is also expected to be applicable to fundamental technology for space development, such as energy technology, thermal control technology, environmental control technology, and liquid transport.
