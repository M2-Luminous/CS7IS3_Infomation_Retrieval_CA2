Mr. Mandela said once the ANC took countermeasures against the right wing, both blacks and whites would die, and innocent people would be sacrificed. He said the ANC did not want to retaliate against the right wing, and he added that the organization was still prepared to meet right-wing leaders and talk some sense into them, as he put it. Mr. Mandela said there is no possibility of the establishment of a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland], but added that he was prepared to discuss a compromise, although this would take a long time.
