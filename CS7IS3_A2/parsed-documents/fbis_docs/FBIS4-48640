In fact, one of the most important cases on detention and government powers to infringe individual rights, bears his name. In 1985, while he was still a member of the Cape Bar, Mr Omar was detained under the State of Emergency and brought an unsuccessful application for his release. The resulting Appeal Court judgment in Omar vs the State President was one of the low points in Emergency case law. However, when the Cape Supreme Court first heard the case, Cape Judge President Gerald Friedman dissented from his two fellow judges. He filed a decision which human rights lawyers say will go down as one of the great judgments in a particularly dark period for the rule of law in this country. Following the Appellate Division decision against him, Mr Omar spent two months in emergency detention. Earlier that year he had already been detained for two months under security laws, with only 10 days' freedom before being detained a second time. The experience has left him a fierce opponent of detention. He says it has a devastating effect on detainees and their families and dehumanises those who "do the detaining". Mr Omar wants to use his portfolio to transform the justice system, making it respectable and legitimate in the eyes of society, so that it can help create and maintain a human rights culture. "The first priority in achieving this aim is to implement the new constitution. The Judicial Service Commission and the Constitutional Court must be set up, along with the Human Rights Commission, the Commission on Gender Equality and the public protector's office. All are urgent and we must help get them going." "Fortunately, the department began working on these matters even before I got here, so we will be able later this month to present to the first sitting of Parliament any legislation needed to establish these bodies." Giving his personal view on capital punishment, he says that as a member of the ANC and the National Association of Democratic Lawyers, he has long been opposed to the death penalty. On the problem of how to make the judiciary better reflect society's composition, he hints that he might consider borrowing from the Continental system, in which potential judges are selected early in their career and given specialist training. Mr Omar was admitted as an attorney in 1960 and as an advocate in 1982 and he has previously gone on record supporting fusion of the two professions. In his new capacity, however, he wants any decision on this issue to be taken with community needs in mind. "The yardstick is improved access to justice and reduced expense for people who need to go to court." He wants lawyers countrywide to become involved in deciding the issue. But not only lawyers. "It is important that the public also participates in this debate." On the relationship between government and the Constitutional Court, he says that since World War 2 similar courts in Europe have played a "politico-constitutional" role. "But that does not mean they must descend into the political arena, and political parties must ensure that they respect the position of the Constitutional Court as standing above party politics." All judicial officers, from magistrates to judges of the highest court, must take a new oath of office. Some legal activists have long supported the idea, saying it might help keep out judges or magistrates unable to identify with the values of a democratic society. The oath, however, is still a controversial issue with argument in legal circles both for and against. But Mr Omar favours the idea. He says taking the oath implies "the values underpinning the new constitution are part of your approach". "This is exciting. It means that irrespective of the past, everybody is given an opportunity to become part of the new human rights culture and help promote it in their work." His political life began at Trafalgar High School in Cape Town, when he joined a boycott of the Republic Festival in 1952. Eight years later, he had hardly opened the doors of his new legal practice when the whole PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] executive walked in and asked whether he would act for them. The next day they were all arrested. That started a legal career acting for political trialists, and for prisoners on Robben Island which he visited several times a week to see clients. For many years he was a staunch member of the Unity Movement, only quitting at the time the United Democratic Front was formed. His decision to join the Congress movement was partly influenced by President Nelson Mandela whose attorney he had become by that stage.
