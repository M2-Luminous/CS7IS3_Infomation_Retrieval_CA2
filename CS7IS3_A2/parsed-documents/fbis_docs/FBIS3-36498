Welcoming the French defence minister, Kozyrev pointed out that Russia and France, the military and the diplomats of the two countries, had traditionally maintained close ties. The Russian Foreign Ministry is maintaining the same relations with the Russian Defence Ministry and Minister Pavel Grachev. "We even agreed with our minister to create `allied military-diplomatic troops'," Kozyrev joked. This does not mean, however, that Russian imperialism is being revived, he continued and urged not to believe such allegations. "What is being revived is the normal statehood of Russia," Kozyrev stressed. "Our talks in Moscow are an integral part of the overall efforts, aimed at the development of bilateral relations and cooperation and the revival of the Russian-French alliance in a new setting," he said. The ministers discussed problems dealing with the strengthening of stability on the European continent, the Bosnian settlement and the staging of peace-keeping operations, including on the territory of the former USSR. The conversation was held in an atmosphere, which reflected the relations of partnership taking shape between Russia and France.
