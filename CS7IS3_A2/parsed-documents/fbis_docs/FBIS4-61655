[Hurynovich] As is known, at the first stage, initiating groups in charge of collecting signatures for their candidates tried to register with the Central Commission. The number of those groups alone shows that the presidential campaign is going to be hot. At that time, the organization of the city and district electoral commissions was initiated, the participation in which was sought by different political organizations and working teams. Their reasons are only too clear: With our thus far very weak democratic traditions, every political force wants to have its "eye" there. To maintain popular trust in those commissions, we admitted a broad circle of political parties. The commissions have been set up by now, and their personal line-up was made public. Now, as you know, the initiating groups have begun collecting signatures for their candidates. [Klaskowskaya] Do you have any more observations regarding this first presidential campaign held in Belarus? [Hurynovich] First, the electoral law, which was hastily adopted, is not perfect. It failed to sufficiently specify the election procedures in the military and in restricted-admittance medical institutions. Poorly thought out is a provision saying that under certain circumstance, citizens may vote within 10 days [as published]. There will be problems with putting together electorate lists. In addition, we are concerned about the prospective turnout. The election day, 23 January, is Thursday, which is one day before the weekend. You cannot guarantee that people will not grab all four days to leave for their suburban land plots. [Klaskowskaya] The presidential campaign promises to be exhausting both for the candidates and their teams. What difficulties do you and the structures that will be created on the city and district levels anticipate in ensuring smooth elections? [Hurynovich] I had a meeting with deputy chairmen and administration heads at the Minsk city districts council the other day. They were surprised that the draft electoral law was not published in the press. People who, as they say, cut their teeth on this, could have helped make this law more accomplished. The main burden is now carried by the city districts. Top priority issues include staking out boundaries of constituencies and setting up electoral commissions there. In addition, time is pressing. [Klaskowskaya] The law guarantees equal rights and conditions for each contender for the presidential post. But we all know just how it is in real life. What are the illegal campaigning methods that we will have to weed out? [Hurynovich] Due to a rudimentary political culture and a lack of basic ethics, the campaign will surely provide us with many surprises. There can be no equal opportunities for all presidential candidates at a time when all media are monopolistically owned by the state. Evidence of this is already on hand. No sooner had the prime minister signed the monetary merger agreement (I personally view this fact as a propaganda ploy on the eve of the elections) than all the media exploded with reports touting the good that Kebich supposedly did for Belarus. Why weren't economists, independent experts, and politicians given an opportunity to present their educated and objective opinions about this treaty? This kind of political "game" will be very dangerous if played throughout the campaign. [Klaskowskaya] Your own experience has taught you many things... [Hurynovich] Running for a seat at the Minsk City Council, I myself experienced the foul methods of my political rivals. The mudslinging machine is well-maintained. One day they spread rumors that you were embracing... a fascist, but the next day, it suddenly turns out that you are not a fascist, but a good friend of Belarus. Such practices are still used today. Many people excelled especially well in this type of "campaigning." Some of them used to be highly-paid party hacks and came from Russia to install communism here and manipulate public opinion with Bolshevik tricks, mixing lies with a small dash of truth. Others, like a bureaucrat from the Cabinet of Ministers and the prime minister's press secretary, engage in political falsifications disparaging political opponents to their chiefs. If the prime minister is for a fair campaign, he should be the first to stop Mr. Zamyatalin. Officials and state institutions should not be allowed to participate in the campaign during working hours. One cannot tolerate a situation when the entire state administration machine, putting important matters aside, is engaged in an election campaign. There is evidence that emissaries traverse the entire Belarus during their working hours to coerce local leaders and the electorate into voting for their candidate. They also get people to participate in initiating groups contrary to their will. The government and the Central Electoral Commission has even issued rules for using mass media by presidential candidates. But look at item 9: Major media receive subsidies from the Cabinet of Ministers. He who pays orders the music, but the Cabinet of Ministers pays the money that comes from the electorate. What equal conditions can we talk about when the media work in favor of some candidate, and for our money at that? Incidentally, the democratically-oriented Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly, the United Democratic Party of Belarus, the Party of People's Accord, the National Democratic Party, and others signed an agreement on the joint political fight. And one more thing, only time will tell whether judicial institutions will impartially control implementation of the electoral law. [Klaskowskaya] It is said that the party of power will exert pressure on electoral commissions to neutralize its opponents. Do you agree that this is possible? [Hurynovich] Yes. However, I hope that the commissions are staffed with honest people who will strictly abide by the law, regardless of their political convictions. Besides, one should not forget that in the opposite case, they may face administrative and criminal charges. The presence of observers at the electoral districts is another condition for holding fair elections. The procedure for their appointment is quite democratic, and I think, there will be no problems here. [Klaskowskaya] But still, is it possible that a candidate, having garnered the required number of votes, might trip over some bureaucratic obstacles or hit some hidden snag? [Hurynovich] I see no such snags. Of course, if someone collects exactly 100,000 signatures, he might not be registered as a candidate. The district commissions are tasked with overseeing activities of initiating groups. In case of a violation on their part (for example, an individual signed for the same candidate on two different signature lists), all those 100,000 votes are gone. I would advise signature collectors to be cautions regarding provocations. [Klaskowskaya] In this situation, much depends on the electorate itself... [Hurynovich] I would ask all the voters to treat the presidential elections very seriously. At this point, many of them find it difficult to determine their own position. Let me remind them again that the electoral law allows one voter to sign for several contenders for the presidential post [previous sentence published in boldface]. After that, they will get a chance to read their programs and determine which one they would vote for on 23 June.
