Spain has decided to suspend all forms of aid to Equatorial Guinea effective immediately. Antonio Sibacha's exiled opposition Union for Democracy and Social Development is happy about this measure suspending aid to Malabo and urges donors, the United States, and the European countries to take a cue from Madrid as long as Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo's regime refuses to respect human rights and to democratize the country.
