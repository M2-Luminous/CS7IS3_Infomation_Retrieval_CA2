According to the branch secretary, Ephraim Motoko, said: "ISU members are harassing residents, kicking in doors, and searching their houses for stolen goods," Mr Motoko told SAPA. The ISU seem to be intent on recovering items removed from the massive and now burnt out Mega City shopping complex in three days of frenzied looting. The ANC is also complaining that the embassy staff, or the temporary administration is mainly white and want that issue addressed. "We are demanding the inclusion of blacks to neutralise the white staff," he said.
