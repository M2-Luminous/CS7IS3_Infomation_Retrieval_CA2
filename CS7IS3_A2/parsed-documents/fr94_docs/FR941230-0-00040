FR941230-0-00040 FR941230-0-00008 A new paragraph (e) is added to implement the amendment to 19 U.S.C. 1337(c) with regard to counterclaims. The rule requires that counterclaims be filed not later than ten business days before the commencement of the evidentiary hearing. This requirement should provide a respondent adequate discovery time to identify potential counterclaims while avoiding the distraction that might occur if counterclaims could be filed during (or after) the evidentiary hearing. For reasons of clarity, the rule requires counterclaims to be filed in a separate document. The statutory amendment makes clear that the new procedures with respect to counterclaims do not affect the ability of a respondent to present all legal or equitable defenses that may be available to it in a section 337 investigation. Action on the counterclaim will not delay or affect the Commission's proceeding. The Commission is not precluded from considering judicial rulings on counterclaims as part of the Commission's consideration of the effect of a remedial order on the public interest. See H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;826, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 141 (1994). Subpart D_Motions Section 210.16 Paragraph (c)(2) is revised to include by reference the requirements added to ยง210.50(c) below with regard to criteria that must be considered by the Commission before issuing a general exclusion order. Section 210.21 A new paragraph (d) is added to implement the amendment to 19 U.S.C. 1337(c) that permits the Commission to terminate an investigation on the basis of an agreement between the private parties to present the matter for arbitration, as well as the traditional settlement agreement. The procedures to be followed with respect to a motion to terminate on the basis of an arbitration agreement are similar to those pertaining to settlement agreements under paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (a)(2) is revised to include a reference to the new paragraph (d), and the previous paragraph (d) is redesignated (e). Section 210.22 Amendments to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b) eliminated time limits for concluding the permanent relief phase of an investigation under section 337. The provision for a ``more complicated'' designation resulting in an 18-month deadline was eliminated. Instead, the Commission is directed to establish a ``target date'' in each investigation. The procedure for establishing a target date is discussed with respect to ยง210.51 below. This section is amended by deleting paragraph (b) with respect to a ``more complicated'' designation of the permanent relief phase of an investigation. The previous paragraph (c) is redesignated (b) and is otherwise unchanged. This paragraph deals with declaring the temporary relief phase of an investigation ``more complicated,'' a procedure that was unchanged by the statutory amendments. Section 210.23 This section is revised to reflect amendments to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b)(1), which eliminate the authority of the Commission to suspend an investigation ``because of proceedings in a court or agency of the United States involving similar questions concerning the subject matter'' of the investigation. The Commission retains the authority to suspend an investigation pending review by the Department of Commerce of possible antidumping or countervailing duty matters referred to the Department of Commerce by the Commission pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1337(b)(3), and the rule is revised to reflect this retained authority. The need for an investigation to be suspended no longer exists insofar as the statutory deadline for concluding the permanent relief phase has been eliminated. Circumstances that would have warranted suspension under the old rules may warrant an extension of the target date for completing the investigation under these amendments. With respect to the temporary relief phase of an investigation, however, the elimination of authority to suspend is significant, because the strict statutory deadlines for deciding petitions for temporary relief have been retained. Temporary relief proceedings now must proceed to completion regardless of concurrent parallel proceedings in other courts or agencies (except for the rare proceeding at the Department of Commerce, referred to in the preceding paragraph). If a complainant pursues a motion for temporary relief under circumstances that would have resulted in suspension under the Commission's prior practice, there may be a basis for requiring a more substantial bond from the complainant before temporary relief is ordered. Section 210.24 Paragraph (a)(2) is deleted because ``more complicated'' designations have been eliminated with respect to permanent relief. Paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated (a)(2). Paragraph (b)(2) is revised to reflect the renumbering of the paragraphs in ยง210.5. Subpart F_Prehearing Conferences and Hearings Section 210.39 A new paragraph (b) is added and the succeeding paragraphs are redesignated. The addition outlines the circumstances in which the Commission's record, including the in camera record, may be transmitted to a federal district court, subject to such protective order as the district court determines necessary. As in ยง210.5, discussed above, this rule alerts the reader that treatment of confidential business information would be governed by the district court's protective order following transmittal of the Commission's record to the court.
