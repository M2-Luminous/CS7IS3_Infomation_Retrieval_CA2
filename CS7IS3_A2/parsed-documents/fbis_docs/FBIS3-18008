The guest had a meeting with President Guntis Ulmanis and also with representatives of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Saeima and its head, Aleksandrs Kirsteins. The Swedish prime minister emphasized that, in his opinion, the initialled agreements with Russia should be signed, because such a process of dealing with relations between neighboring states is strengthening Latvian ties with Western countries. The stability of Latvia is also important to the Nordic countries. Also, the United States has become morally involved in the forming of the agreements. This process has been internationalized, and with internationalization the process is significant to the entire Western world. The Swedish prime minister assessed positively the intention of Guntis Ulmanis to meet prominent European politicians in the nearest future. Quite probably official guarantees would not be given during these meetings, Bildt said. The talks, however, would assist foreigners in understanding better the difficulties connected with the signing of these agreements. Ulmanis told the Swedish prime minister that the inhabitants of Latvia have diverse attitudes toward the initialled agreements between Latvia and Russia. There is also opposition to the government's and the Saeima majority faction's standpoint. In the latest sociological poll, 52 percent of the participants have expressed themselves against the Skrunda radar station remaining in Latvia. The president, too, is receiving many letters from writers who are against the initialled agreements. The inhabitants are alarmed, most of all, over the social guarantees to former Soviet army officers that are envisaged in the agreement, because these will allow approximately 100,000 officers and their families to remain in Latvia. There is also no conviction that Russia will fulfill these agreements. The president emphasized that it is also not clear what kind of guarantees the Western countries could give to Latvia. It also cannot be forgotten that Latvia was occupied in 1940, which Russia should, after all, recognize. Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Saeima, in turn explained to the guest that the position of the State of Latvia on the question of signing the agreement must be coordinated with Estonia, because she does not initial agreements with Russia in the sphere of social guarantees to military pensioners. The prime ministers of Latvia and Estonia will meet on 7 April to discuss these questions. The talks are envisaged in Rujiena, and the press center of the Cabinet of Ministers organizes representatives of the press who would like to accompany those travelling there.
