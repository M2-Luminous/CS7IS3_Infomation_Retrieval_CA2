President of this chamber Mr. Vanazmi gave the opening speech. In his welcoming speech, he expressed pleasure at President Berisha's visit to the Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and stressed the possibilities of expanding economic relations between our two countries, the interest of Malaysian and foreign firms in the Albanian market, investments in Albania, and so on. In his speech, President Berisha stressed that his visit to Malaysia serves not only to expand relations at the political level, but economically as well. He also expressed his satisfaction over the great number of businessmen participating in this meeting and their interest in Albania. Later, President Berisha pointed out the arguments that favor foreign investors operating in Albania, and precisely the economic reform that destroyed the collective sector not only in the economy, but also in the collectivist mentality of the people in our country. He also mentioned the political stability created by the support of the majority of the population for the Meksi government and the new Albanian legislation, which offers absolutely attractive possibilities for foreign investors, such as the possibility of transferring capital and dividends, renting land, a free hand with labor, and a young population capable of work. In the meeting with the president, the managers of the best known Malaysian firms and foreign firms operating in Malaysia expressed their intention to come to Albania and get acquainted with the specific cooperation possibilities, especially now after the creation of the complete legal framework for economic cooperation between the two countries with the signing of five agreements that guarantee security. President Berisha also inaugurated the Center for Malaysian Promotion in Albania. This morning, President Berisha held separate meetings with Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed and His Majesty Sultan Azlan Shah, who guaranteed President Berisha the agreements and their application. They also told Berisha that the Malaysian Government will encourage investors and investments in Albania and promised to help in the construction of housing for the population, the education of students, cooperation between the Albanian and Malaysian telecommunications, and so on. This morning, too, President Berisha left Kuala Lumpur after ending his successful visit and departed for a one-day visit to the island of Langkawi. The country authorities organized a meeting at which the general region development manager gave a briefing on the island's development prospects.
