The United States is interested in having me removed from office because I demanded to know where the property and assets seized from drug traffickers ended up. I was against Supreme Decree 21060 because it was inhuman. I rejected Article 55 of that law, which supported private businessmen, enabling them to hire workers without due regard for their rights. I am a genuine member of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] Party, but of the historical and loyal MNR, not the MNR that lets its name be used so that the United States may govern our country through a gringo made in Bolivia. This trial is totally ridiculous. It is a political and biased trial. Nothing was proved against me. The Bolivian state is overburdened with corruption, so much so that corruption has become the property of the Bolivian Government. Corrupt practices are rampant in the three branches of government -- the Executive, the Legislative Branch, and lower levels of the judiciary. Malfeasance and corruption are prevalent in the judiciary because there are no mechanisms in force to prevent this, such as better salaries and wages, or increasing the number of judges to prevent the backlog of work.
