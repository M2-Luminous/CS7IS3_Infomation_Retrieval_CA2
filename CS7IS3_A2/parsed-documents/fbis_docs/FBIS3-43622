Mr. Ntibantunganya first presented the FRODEBU's candidate to the presidency of the republic. FRODEBU's candidate is Mr. Cyprien Ntaryamira, current Burundi minister of agriculture. He is an old companion of late President Melchior Ndadaye. According to an amendment to the constitution, which the National Assembly has analyzed upon request by the government, which in its turn has to ratify it, the unique candidate would be presented to the parliament to be elected. Today the National Assembly was due to elect him, but the proceedings could not take place because the government has not yet ratified the amendment. [passage omitted] In fact, Article 182 of the same constitution says that no amendment of the constitution can be undertaken when the nation is facing serious internal troubles. The opposition parties yesterday held a press conference to denounce this. They have even presented candidates to the presidential election stated by the law when the head of the state and the chairman of the National Assembly can no longer do their job. Two candidates already known are Dr. Jean Ndeberi from the Abasa [Burundi-African Alliance for Salvation] party and Mr. Joseph Nzeyimana from the RADDES [Rally for Democracy and Economic and Social Development] party.
