One of the leaders of the TOTs, Maro Shamsutdinov, acquainted journalists with the decisions of the last plenum of the social center, which openly proclaimed a new objective--coming to power. Moreover, it was emphasized: only by constitutional means. Up to the present TOTs had not put forth such a slogan, and has generally not engaged in the struggle for power. It also endeavored to resolve questions of the federalization of Russia. In the opinion of the organizers of the news conference there has been no real federalism in the Russian Federation, there is none, and it seems there will not be any; it has remained a unitary state. For this reason, the leaders of the national movement cannot concur with the fact of the signing of the treaty between Tatarstan and Russia, which preserves the centralized distribution of a planned economy. But what is dangerous, TOTs members think, is not the treaty, which actually is more of a political nature, but intergovernmental agreements that are reinforced by the treaty. TOTs cannot agree at all with the 12 agreements in which the direct implementation of the treaty is laid out. And it does not share the position of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan, which remains silent when the executive organs sign an interstate treaty. Early elections to parliament, TOTs representatives think, are simply necessary inasmuch as the legislative organ is not coping with its functions. In the opinion of the leaders of the national movement, the formation of a new personnel policy plays a not unimportant role. Up to now this question is being resolved in secrecy. But what is needed, first and foremost, is the appointment of heads of administration through elections. Otherwise they will remain officials with unlimited authority over which there is no control. The TOTs leaders intend also to engage in the destatization of the mass media, as they are convinced that they are strictly subordinated today to the power structures. Regarding the question of a split in the leadership of the national movement, Rashat Safin informed journalists of the decision of the plenum to declare a moratorium on criticism and fighting among themselves. "For the sake of the nation's interests, we must be together, especially since our views have never differed on the main thing."
