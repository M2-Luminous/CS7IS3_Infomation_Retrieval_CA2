Hirsch Ballin and Agriculture Minister P. Bukman lower down the list of parliamentary candidates than was proposed by the party committee. Economic Affairs State Secretary Y. van Rooy now has the second place after Brinkman, who is top of the list. CDA circles blame Bukman's drop from sixth to eleventh place on the problems encountered in convincing the rank and file of the need to modify agriculture policies. "The change shows the problems in farming and agriculture," a spokesman said. In the run-up to the decision on the candidates, it was long unclear whether the CDA Women's Council would succeed in placing its "candidate," State Secretary Y. Van Rooy, in second place. What could not be achieved at the party committee meeting in November -- Van Rooy got third place there -- has now been realized successfully. Other female candidates in the first 20 positions, like M. Soutendijk and A. Doelman-Pel, have climbed a few places as well. F. Walters, tipped as a possible leader of the parliamentary party, has dropped two places from five to seven. State Secretary Heerma, who has criticized the style of Brinkman, the leading candidate, has climbed three places and now has the fifth position. The party spokesman pointed out that the members had indicated their preferences before Heerma expressed his criticism in the VRIJ NEDERLAND weekly magazine. The leaking of the notorious letter from Bukman to Minister Andriessen on agricultural tariffs also dates from after that deadline.
