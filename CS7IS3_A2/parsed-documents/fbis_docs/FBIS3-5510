FBIS3-5510 "dreas045_a_94039" FBIS-EAS-94-045 Document Type:Daily Report 8 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Prosecutors To Ask for Diet Permit OW0803051594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0455 GMT 8 Mar 94 OW0803051594 Tokyo KYODO Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- Prosecutors are set to ask the Diet on Tuesday [8 March] to waive the parliamentary immunity which currently provides former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura with protection from arrest, investigative sources said. Nakamura, 44, currently a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) member in the House of Representatives, is suspected of taking 10 million yen from leading general contractor Kajima Corp. in January 1992, the sources said. Nakamura is also suspected of using his influence as a Diet member to head off a Fair Trade Commission (FTC) criminal complaint against major contractors over alleged bid-rigging, the sources said. At the time, Nakamura was the deputy chairman of the LDP's panel on the Antimonopoly Law. He served as construction minister from December 1992 to August 1993 under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. The prosecution's petition for Diet permission of arrest will mark the 15th time in postwar history that prosecutors have sought to arrest a legislator during a Diet session and the first since a 1967 scandal involving taxi operators in Osaka. The House of Representatives will decide on the request to arrest Nakamura after its steering committee considers whether to approve it. Investigators suspect Nakamura accepted the 10 million yen from contracting giant Kajima in return for his efforts to deflect the FTC complaint, which concerns a bid-rigging cartel in Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, the sources said. Nakamura has refused repeated requests by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to appear for questioning regarding his alleged receipt of the money, they said. Diet permission is required for the arrest of a parliamentarian while the legislature is in session. The Diet is currently in a 150-day ordinary session that started in late January. On Monday, Tokyo prosecutors met senior prosecutors of the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office and the Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office and decided to raid Nakamura's offices and the Tokyo headquarters of Kajima, the sources said. Prosecutors also plan to rearrest a former vice president of Kajima, Shinji Kiyoyama, on suspicion of involvement in delivering the money to Nakamura, they said. Investigations show Kiyoyama approached Nakamura in the summer of 1991, seeking his help in pressuring the FTC not to file an accusation against a cartel of 66 construction firms believed to have rigged bids on public works projects in Saitama Prefecture, the investigative sources said. Nakamura reportedly met then FTC Chairman Setsuo Umezawa, 62, several times from the end of 1991 to early 1992 to discuss the FTC's activities. The FTC, which investigated the Saitama Prefecture bid-rigging, announced in may 1992 it would not file an accusation with public prosecutors, and instead ordered the contractors to stop the bid-rigging. Nakamura's alleged receipt of the 10 million yen could constitute intermediary bribery under the penal code which says public officials cannot receive money for influencing other public officials, investigative sources said. Recipients of such a bribe can be punished with up to five years imprisonment, according to the penal code. Kajima's Kiyoyama, 67, has already been charged with giving a 20 million yen bribe to then Ibaraki Gov. Fujio Takeuchi in December 1992. A series of scandals involving major contractors has so far led to the arrest of two governors, two mayors and 29 leading executives of eight construction firms. The arrest in March 1993 of LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru led to the contractors' bribery scandal. Kanemaru has been charged with evading a huge amount of taxes on his undeclared incomes which were mainly secret donations from contractors.
