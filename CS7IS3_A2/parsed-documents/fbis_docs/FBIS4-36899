He said the Interior Ministry has worked out an integrated plan to besiege these organizations. The only aim of those groups, said al-Alfi, is to seize power for the funds they receive from abroad. In a conference held today by the Egyptian-French Businessmen Society to learn about the security situation in Egypt and its impact on investment, the interior minister said the ministry is using developed and modern methods, and arranging civilized and scientific training for personnel to confront the terrorist groups. Security agencies will never rest as long as a single terrorist remains on Egypt's soil, al-Alfi said. He stressed that the problem with the terrorist groups is not only a security one. All state institutions must contribute to the confrontation, and al-Azhar has a role to play in rectifying the extremist thought, he explained. Asked about the involvement of Muslim Brotherhood members in terrorism, the interior minister said certain acts and facts indicate that some Muslim Brotherhood members committed acts punishable by law. He said all facts and all emerging signs point to the involvement of those elements, who number more than 100 people, and are now being interrogated by the High State Security Prosecution. He said investigations have proved that there is coordination between terrorist groups at home and abroad. Al-Alfi also noted coordination between Egypt and other countries to confront terrorism and extradite criminals. He said: Training camps for terrorists do exist in some countries. We are not talking about a specific state, and it is in the interest of the investigations that everything is announced in due course.
