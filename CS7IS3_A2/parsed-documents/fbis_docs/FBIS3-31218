He was speaking after a meeting of the ambassadors to NATO of the 16 member countries, who fixed the deadline on February 9 after being asked by the United Nations to consider airstrikes following the massacre of 68 people by a mortar bomb in a Sarajevo market. The Bosnian Serbs have denied firing the bomb and a UN commission of inquiry said in Zagreb Wednesday it had failed to determine its origin. In Sarajevo the handing over of heavy weapons to UN control by both sides, an alternative to their withdrawal, has been proceeding at a snail's pace.
