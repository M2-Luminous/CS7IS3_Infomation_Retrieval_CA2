He said governing had been difficult so far and would continue to be so in the future. Boross described the present cabinet as kamikaze, due to the lack of adequate means for full accomplishment of its tasks. The government is now busy creating conditions for a smooth transfer of affairs, he said. Analysing the country's situation, the prime minister cited the consolidation of democratic institutions and the basic change in property relations as solid reserves for the future. Regarding first-round election results, he said his party, the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], acknowledges the potential Free Democrat-Socialist alliance. It is ready to assume the role of opposition, but, as he said, the number of seats they have in parliament will be of significance. Accordingly, he called upon national forces to coordinate their efforts, and electors to vote for candidates of the MDF, the Christian Democratic People's Party and the Independent Smallholders Party in the second round on May 29.
