FR940428-0-00020 FR940428-0-00006 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 33 CFR Part 100 [CGD07&hyph;94&hyph;049] RIN 2115&hyph;AE46 Special Local Regulations: Lake Worth, ICW, Mile 1022 AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: Special local regulations are being adopted for the Lake Worth Sunfest '94. This event will be held on April 27 through May 1, 1994; from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on April 27 and 28; from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 29; and, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 30 and May 1. The regulations are needed to provide for the safety of life on navigable waters during the event. EFFECTIVE DATES: These regulations become effective on April 27 through May 1, 1994; from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on April 27 and 28; from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 29; and, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 30 and May 1. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: ENS B. DAILEY, Coast Guard Group Miami, (305) 535&hyph;4492. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking has not been published for these regulations and good cause exists for making them effective in less than 30 days from the date of publication. Following normal rulemaking procedures would have been impracticable. The updated information to hold the event was not received until April 1994, and there was not sufficient time remaining to publish proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide for a delayed effective date. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are ENS B. DAILEY, Project Officer, Coast Guard Group Miami, and LT J. LOSEGO, Project Attorney, Seventh Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations There will be approximately 45 racers in race boats, ski boats, jet skis, and canoes, ranging in size from 12 to 17 feet, participating in the Palm Beach County Sunfest '94. High speed race boats traveling up to 120 m.p.h., and canoes, jet skis, and water skiers, require calm waters to perform and create an extra or unusual hazard in the navigable waters. As a result, there will be a no wake zone in the Lake Worth Intracoastal Waterway between the Royal Palm Bridge and the Flagler Memorial Bridge where the event will take place. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposal consistent with Section 2.B.2.08 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, and this proposal has been determined to be categorically excluded. Specifically, the Coast Guard has consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service regarding the environmental impact of this event, and it was determined that the event does not jeopardize the continued existence of protected species. As a condition to the permit, the applicant is required to educate the operators of spectator craft and parade participants regarding the possible presence of manatees and the appropriate precautions to take if the animals are sighted. List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 100 Marine safety, Navigation (water). Regulations In consideration of the foregoing, part 100 of title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows: 1. The authority citation for Part 100 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 1233; 49 CFR 1.46 and 33 CFR 100.35. 2. A temporary section 100.35T07&hyph;049 is added to read as follows: §100.35T07&hyph;049 Palm Beach Sunfest '94. (a) Regulated Area: A regulated area is established in the Lake Worth Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), between the Flagler Memorial Bridge and the Royal Palm Bridge, with the northern boundary formed by latitude 26 ○^42 ’^48 ’ ’, and the southern boundary formed by latitude 26 ○^42 ’^19 ’ ’. The eastern and western boundaries of the regulated area are formed by the shoreline of the ICW. (b) Special Local Regulations: (1) The regulated area is a no wake zone. All transiting vessels shall operate at a speed so as to not cause a wake or at five (5) knots, whichever is slower. (2) All vessels shall immediately follow any specific instructions given by event patrol craft and exercise extreme caution while operating in or near the regulated area. A succession of not fewer than 5 short whistle or horn blasts from a patrol vessel will be the signal for any nonparticipating vessel to take immediate action to avoid collision and avoid interference with event participants. The display of an orange distress smoke signal from a patrol vessel will be the signal for any and all vessels to stop immediately. (3) After the termination of the Sunfest '94 event on each respective day, all vessels may resume normal operations. (c) Effective dates: This section becomes effective on April 27 through May 1, 1994; from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. EDT (Eastern Daylight Time) on April 27 and 28; from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 29; and, from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. EDT on April 30 and May 1.
