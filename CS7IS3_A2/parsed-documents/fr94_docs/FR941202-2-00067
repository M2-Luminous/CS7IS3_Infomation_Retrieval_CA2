FR941202-2-00067 FR941202-2-00047 Employment and Training Administration [TA&hyph;W&hyph;28,997] AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc., Houston, TX; Notice of Revised Determination on Reconsideration The Department is revising its initial denial of eligibility for trade adjustment assistance (TAA) for workers of the subject firm as a result of a voluntary remand from the U.S. Court of International Trade in Former Employees of AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc ., v. Secretary of Labor (USCIT 94&hyph;01&hyph;00025). Investigation findings show AGIP Petroleum produced crude oil and natural gas in approximately the same dollar amount during the relevant period. The workers were denied TAA because the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally determined through a survey of the workers' firm's major declining customers. On reconsideration the Department obtained information not previously available regarding a major crude oil customer. The customer was a major importer of crude oil in 1993 who substantially increased its import purchases of crude oil in 1993 compared to 1992 while decreasing its purchases from AGIP Petroleum Company. U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased absolutely and relative to domestic shipments in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the latest 12-month period ending in June 1994. Investigation findings show that AGIP Petroleum had declining sales in the first six months of 1993 compared to the same period in 1992. Substantial worker separations occurred in 1993. Conclusion After careful review of the additional facts obtained on reconsideration, it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the crude oil and natural gas produced at AGIP Petroleum Company contributed importantly to the decline in sales and to the total or partial separation of workers at AGIP Petroleum Company in Houston, Texas. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination: ``All workers of AGIP Petroleum Company, Inc., Houston, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 20, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 17th day of November 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
