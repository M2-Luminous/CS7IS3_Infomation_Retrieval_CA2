Security Council decision to accept Turkish troops for the U.N. peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fire is not put out by petrol, the paper 24 HOURS writes, recalling that the decision is a "dangerous precedent, because a biased party to this two-year war cannot be a peacemaker." Under the headline "Turks Light Fire in Bosnia-Herzegovina Via the United Nations," the paper calls on great powers to think it over as to what is hiding behind Ankara's longstanding and persistent insistence to enter Bosnia-Herzegovina. A new Turkish presence in the Balkans is beginning, the paper DUMA writes on Thursday. DUMA insists that the United Nations should be energetically warned that neighbouring countries to the former Yugoslavia should not interfere in Bosnia-Herzegovina's conflict, especially Turkey, with a past heavily weighing down on it as regards the peoples of the former Yugoslavia. This message holds also for Germany, Austria and Italy, the paper writes. The daily adds that "Turkish troops will establish peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina today. Tomorrow, possibly in our country too." By sending Turkish troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina the United Nations has shown its true face, the commentator of the paper KONTINENT says. The world organization should safeguard world peace by political means. Military operations have prevailed instead, the Sofia paper sets out. Turkey has unequivocally taken the side of the Bosnian Moslems in the two-year civil war in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among the Islamic countries, Turkey has set an example in the sending of financial aid and mojahedin to Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as large quantities of weaponry, in defiance of a U.N-imposed arms embargo on the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia.
