Meanwhile, the opposition's National Front for the Salvation of Libya [NFSL], which these POW's subsequently joined, has decided to appoint Colonel Salih Muhammad al-Habbuni commander in chief of the Libyan National Army [LNA] (the NFSL's military arm) in place of Colonel Khalifah Haftar. [passage omitted] Yesterday the NFSL leadership issued a statement saying it had decided to appoint al-Habbuni commander in chief of the opposition army and Staff Lieutenant Colonel 'Abdallah al-Shaykhi deputy commander in chief. The statement said that the army represented the "NFSL's armed forces and was established by a decision of the Permanent Bureau 21 June 1988 after a large number of Libyan senior officers, warrant officers, and soldiers deployed in Chad announced that they were joining the NFSL." The statement also said that "Col. Haftar had held the post of commander in chief of that army by a decision of the NFSL's Executive Committee, until he announced his withdrawal from the NFSL" on 11 February 1994.
