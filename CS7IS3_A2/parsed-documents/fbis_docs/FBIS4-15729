The military losses and the number or existence of civilian casualties have not been reported. But the new facts, testifying to attempts to again fan up the conflict by means of armed force, have resounded with pain in the hearts of the Russian people. The arising situation gives food for various aspects of alarm: NATO has easily ignored not only the view of Russia, but also the achieved agreements; this threatens to ruin the process of the peaceful political settlement of the bloody knot of problems in Europe, begun with such hard efforts by the world community. Moreover, preventive blows, when people are killed on the grounds that a dangerous situation could have otherwise arisen, can far from always be justified from the moral point of view. The State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly, vested with the people's trust and expressing the view of the majority of the Russian nation, does not intend to assume the stand of a passive onlooker in the situation, which has arisen on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We demand an immediate end to the unilateral, unsanctioned use of military force by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and urge the parliaments of all the states of the world to actively contribute to the process of achieving a peaceful political settlement of the Yugoslavian crisis. [signed] Ivan Rybkin [dated] April 12, 1994"
