"There was sporadic firing during the night and a few rounds of artillery fire at five this morning (0300 GMT)," UN spokesman Pierre Mehu told AFP by telephone from Kigali. Mehu said the guns had fallen silent for about five hours on Wednesday afternoon after Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali announced at the end of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) summit in Tunis that Rwanda's government and rebels had agreed to an immediate ceasefire. Gunfire resumed at dusk, Mehu said. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe called in Paris Wednesday for western intervention to stop the ethnic bloodshed in Rwanda if the latest ceasefire there fails. He said he had suggested to UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that UN troops from the 18,000-strong force stationed in Somalia could be diverted to Rwanda, if fighting there continues. If the ceasefire is not respected and the massacres continue, "I say today that France would be ready to mount an intervention operation ... with its European partners or African countries to protect groups threatened with extermination," he said. "If we learn over the next few days that there are massacres of dozens, of hundreds of men, women and children, we will not be able to tolerate it for much longer. [passage omitted] Juppe, speaking after a cabinet meeting with French President Francois Mitterrand, said the situation in Rwanda was "already unacceptable and that could lead us to mobilize France's partners to intervene" without delay.
