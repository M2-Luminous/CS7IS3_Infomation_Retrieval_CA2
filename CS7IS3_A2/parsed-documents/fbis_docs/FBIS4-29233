FBIS4-29233 "dreas116_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 North Korea ROK's `Provocative Act' in DMZ Denounced ROK's `Provocative Act' in DMZ Denounced SK1506140694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1100 GMT 15 Jun 94 SK1506140694 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1100 GMT 15 Jun 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to military sources, on 14 June the South Korean puppets committed a provocative act of illegally bringing recoilless guns into the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. At around 09:15 [00:15 GMT] on 14 June, the puppet army's armed rascals brought in, and installed at an encampment, 90-mm recoilless guns inside the DMZ 600 meters south of the Military Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker No. 0412 in front of Kumsa-ri, Chorwon County. They took a firing position at our side, thereby gravely threatening the safety of our People's Army soldiers who were on routine duty at a guard post. At around 08:40 [23:40 GMT] on the same day, a numerous number of the puppet army soldiers equipped with automatic weapons were inciting a war atmosphere while touring about this area by sneaking into the DMZ area southeast of the MDL Marker Nos. 0140 and 0170 in front of (?Mt. Taedok) in Changpung County on the western frontline and--prior to this, at around 07:50 [22:50 GMT]--into the DMZ area south of the MDL Marker No. 0468 in front of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County on the central front line. This is the South Korean puppets' intentional and premeditated maneuverings aimed at artificially aggravating the situation inside the DMZ area on the MDL and arousing a North-South confrontation. The South Korean puppets should profoundly consider the grave consequences the rascals will cause by their reckless provocative acts and should not do rash and thoughtless acts.
