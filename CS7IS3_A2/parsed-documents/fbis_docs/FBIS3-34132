Our correspondent reports from Islamabad. [Unidentified correspondent] Kabul was relatively calm today with clouds, rain, and snow calming clashes between rival groups. Meanwhile a source close to the government of Borhanoddin Rabbani reported attacks by government fighter planes on the northern Afghan airport of Jozjan. The source who is close to Rabbani, also emphasized that forces supporting the president will not agree to a fresh temporary cease-fire in the current fighting. The coordination council in opposition to Rabbani's government announced last night that, following a request by the UN secretary general's special envoy in Afghan affairs, the opposition was ready to accept a four-day cease-fire on the condition that negotiations would concentrate on the resignation of Rabbani from his post. In reply to this suggestion by the opposition, the source, Seyyed Habib Shah Hamed, emphasized that Rabbani will hold the presidential post until the end of his term. Meanwhile the Kabul Jihadi commanders and a 100-strong mediation group from east Afghanistan, led by Maulawi Jallalulddin Haqani, who have spent three days in Kabul, continued their negotiations today with the representatives of President Rabbani and Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, and tried to prepare and propose a mediating plan that would be acceptable to both sides so as to prepare the grounds for negotiations and an understanding between the president and the prime minister of Afghanistan.
