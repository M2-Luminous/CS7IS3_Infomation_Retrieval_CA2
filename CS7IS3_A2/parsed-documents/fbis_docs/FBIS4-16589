Honest investors, for whom partnership with Belarus is a matter of economy, not politics, have already come to our country, and the unification of the Belarussian and Russian markets will not influence those relations," Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich said at a news conference. He pointed out that problems connected with relations between Belarus and third countries are not coordinated with Russia. This is why it is for Belarus to decide whether to take foreign credits or not. Responding to the question of journalists about the reaction of the International Monetary Fund to the signing of the agreement, Kebich said: "A letter that we received before the signing of the documents reaffirmed, that the IMF would continue to cooperate with us. Moreover, the letter asked to decide more quickly whether we join the rouble zone or not. So, our foreign partners were also waiting for an answer to the question: Shall we enter the rouble zone or not?"
