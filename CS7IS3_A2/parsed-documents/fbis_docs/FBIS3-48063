KNU president Gen Bo Mya told 500 guests, who attended his 67th birthday celebrations at his Manerplaw camp opposite Mae Sariang district, that the Karen always wanted national reconciliation but their three offers for peace talks had not received any response from SLORC. Gen Bo Mya criticised other minority groups for giving up their armed struggle against Rangoon. "The KNU will definitely conduct peace talks with SLORC if the negotiations are on equal terms to sincerely obtain rights and freedom in all economic, social and political fields for all Burmese groups. The peace agreement reached separately with various minority groups does not guarantee a true peace." Gen Bo Mya, who leads the strongest anti-Rangoon minority group, said the KNU would not join SLORC at the negotiating table until Rangoon accepted all these conditions. The truce talks, if agreed on, could be held in a third country such as Thailand which cherished "the constructive engagement" policy with SLORC, Gen Bo Mya said.
