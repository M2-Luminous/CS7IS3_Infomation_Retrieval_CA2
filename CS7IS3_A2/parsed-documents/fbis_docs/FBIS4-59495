These days, 'Arafat is busy setting up the council, which will probably be made of 25 members, 15 of which from the territories. Several PLO officials in Gaza and Jericho have recently approached Hamas notables with an offer to join the autonomy council. The ITIM reporter has learned that Hamas was offered three seats on the council and one executive post, and later the PLO expanded the offer to five council seats and two executive posts. The Hamas members rejected the offer, but announced they would be glad to participate in the elections, which are to be held several months after the autonomy is established. A senior PLO member in Gaza told the ITIM reporter that the Hamas response gives rise to optimism regarding their incorporation in the autonomy establishments -- which would force 'Arafat to call the for elections as soon as possible. The ITIM reporter says that the PLO members in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza favor early elections, often contrary to the stand of 'Arafat and his advisers in Tunis. [passage omitted]
