The Chongnyon's Central Committee issued a statement demanding that Japanese authorities immediately halt their alleged "political suppression" of Korean residents of Japan. Police raided Kyoto Chosen Gakuen, an educational foundation running schools for Korean students, on suspicion of illegally buying land without notifying Kyoto Municipal authorities of the intended use of the property. Among other locations searched by investigators was the Kyoto Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon. In April, police searched the Osaka headquarters of Chongnyon, on suspicion of disturbing a citizens' meeting that was held to urge North Korea to release political prisoners. North Korea's official media has since published almost daily condemnations of the "hostile acts" of Japanese authorities, charging that the police action has been timed to coincide with the aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula.
