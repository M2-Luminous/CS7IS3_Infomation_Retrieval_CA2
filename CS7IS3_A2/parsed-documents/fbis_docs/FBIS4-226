The president, who was opening the seventh Pan-African congress at the conference center in Kampala today, told the congress participants that in order to emancipate ourselves from foreign domination we as Africans must know what to do. He described the Kampala congress as a good moment to make a correct diagnosis so that Africa gets an answer. Mr. Museveni attributed Africa's problem to internal African weaknesses both now and in the past and to external greed by outside powers. He identified the main internal weaknesses of Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed the question of poor organization as having played the most crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia, and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend their sovereignty due to a high level of organization. Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most important factors to be independent is production, and yet African governments have continuously interfered with production by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and marketing monopolies. He said African governments have themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions. On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors. However he was of the view that compensation for the past injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our means to end domination. Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni categorized these as the black Africans on the African Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to draw ideology into the movement but to accept all Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of the movement. [passage omitted]
