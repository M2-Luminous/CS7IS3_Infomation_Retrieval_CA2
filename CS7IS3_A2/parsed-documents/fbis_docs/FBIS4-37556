However the jamming of some 30 European, American and Asian channels has not been publicly announced. Viewers said programs received via the Asia-Sat and Arab-Sat satellites had been garbled more or less depending on the district, with parallel lines appearing on TV screens. The jamming follows debate in Iran on whether or not to ban satellite dishes, which have mushroomed on rooftops in Tehran and other cities allowing up to two million people to view foreign broadcasts. Under pressure from Islamic conservatives and hardliners, parliament is soon to debate the issue as part of moves to check Western cultural influence. The jamming also came after Iranian state television announced it would broadcast the World Cup live from the United States in a bid to compete with the increasingly popular satellite programs. A newspaper reported here Thursday that in a crackdown on "social corruption," authorities in Iran had seized 1,965 television satellite dishes destined for Iranian consumers.
