The battle against Hizballah will continue, using all means available. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that on leaving the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee the chief of staff said there has been a real decline in terrorism and disturbances in the Gaza Strip, and a certain decline in Judaea and Samaria, but noted that he would not count on that in the long run. He believes terrorism and disturbances in the Gaza Strip will continue to be on a low level, but might grow in Judaea and Samaria.
