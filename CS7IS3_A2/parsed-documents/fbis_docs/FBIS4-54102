North Korea has reportedly planned to invite a Chinese delegation from Jilin Province, and businessmen of the ROK enterprises in China, to Pyongyang to discuss the Tumen River development project under the auspices of the Chongjin city development committee. It will hold another meeting with them in Beijing around the end of this month to discuss specific plans for joint cooperation regarding the project. It has not been learned if participants in the meeting would form an international cooperative system to promote their joint cooperation. According to some reports, however, North Korea and China have already exchanged a protocol regarding the Tumen River project. This project will likely be carried out in the following way: North Korea and China will be a key factor in carrying out the project, while welcoming ROK capital to it. This is the way North Korea has so far planned to implement the project. As we have mentioned over and over again, ROK enterprises should consult with the government about economic cooperation with North Korea, whether it is carried out in the form of the Tumen development project or the construction of a plant in the Nampo area. We stress once again that no civilian-level economic cooperation without the government's participation should be conducted. Also, our government and enterprises should not forget, even for a moment, that the North Korean system is an unreasonable and extreme communist regime, not found anywhere else in modern history. For over half a century, there have been no changes in the Kim Il- song dictatorial system. At the same time, the so-called chuche idea--which indicates that "Korea is one," and that "Korea is under the bosom and grace of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il"--is an absolute idea presently worshiped by all North Korea people throughout the country. In other words, if a South Korean businessman builds a plant in North Korea, this can be theoretically done under the guidance and grace of Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il. There are, however, some important points in carrying out the Tumen River development project. That is, by participating in it, we can lead North Korea to go from a closed society to an open one; we can form our business connections [yongogwon] on the area of the Tumen River in the initial stage of its development; and seek the balanced development of our land by promoting development in the most backward area of the country in preparation for the days after national reunification. Also, it is internationally very significant to build the free trade zone in the northeastern area because there is no multilateral cooperative system there. This project must not be, however, carried out as intended by North Korea. North Korea's hidden intention is to make foreign currency quickly, while trying to become the master of the northeast by inviting a considerable amount of the foreign capital, including from ROK enterprises, to the project. This is why the North Korean authorities are so interested. By properly meeting China's persistent desire to advance into Korea through the East Sea [Sea of Japan], North Korea has appropriately formulated plans to lead the ROK enterprises to participate in the Tumen project. When the Tumen River development project was first discussed, the six countries surrounding the area showed interest and tried to participate in it. They are South Korea, North Korea, China, Russia, Mongolia, and Japan. However, only North Korea and China are now interested in the project because North Korea refuses to open its doors. We hope that the government and our enterprises should not be entangled in North Korea's plot. They must not invest even a penny unless North Korea earnestly asks for it and make efforts for negotiations with South Korea. In particular, I would like to call on our businessmen to keep this in mind and be prudent in dealing with North Korea.
