'Arafat's envoy, who is a member of the PLO Executive Committee and who arrived unexpectedly in Damascus, returned without achieving anything because of the Syrian officials' refusal to receive him. It has been learned that 'Arafat's envoy met Khalid al-Fahum, head of the Salvation Front, but nothing has been reported about what transpired at this meeting. The PLO Executive Committee member who visited Damascus has reportedly said that he did not have a mission of reconciliation between the Syrian president and 'Arafat but that he traveled there "to perform a social duty."
