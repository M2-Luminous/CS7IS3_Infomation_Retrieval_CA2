The court initially sentenced Sun Naign to seven years but commuted the sentence because he had pleaded guilty. Sun Naign, 28, was among four Burmese arrested in November last year at a house in Bangkok's Ratthewi district. Police seized two sticks of TNT, two M-26 hand grenades, a detonator, electric wire and handgun cartridges in their rented house. The four said they had planned to use suicide bombs to assassinate Gen. Khin Nyunt, the chief of Burma's military State Law and Order Restoration Council (Slorc), on Burma's Independence Day on Feb 4. Following their arrest, Thai authorities have tightened enforcement of laws to try to control the large number of Burmese illegally in Thailand. The move has been criticized by the international community over the human rights issue. Sun Naign was previously arrested and imprisoned in 1989 after he and another Burmese student hijacked a Thai Airways International flight from Rangoon to U-Taphao, in an action he said was to raise international awareness of the suppression of the democracy movement in Burma.
