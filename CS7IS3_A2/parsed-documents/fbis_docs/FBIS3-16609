"Time has not come yet to speak about a full success, but this agreement opens the way we would like to follow", Andrejevs said in an interview with TASS. "As far as possible, we heeded to pieces of advice from across the world, above all from the United States. We know that this compromise version was worked out at the Moscow summit between Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton. Then came our visit to Washington. During this visit, we received necessary explanations about why we should not be scared with this version", the minister noted. Speaking about the Skrunda radar installation, which is to be kept by Russia for four years under the agreement, Andrejevs said: "Unfortunately, we have a bitter experience of 1993 related to military bases stationed in Latvia. It was not very long ago, however we need to change Latvian people's mentality. We should explain that times have changed, and Russia needs the Skrunda radar only as a means of obtaining information and not as a military installation. This was the issue that caused the main difficulties. There is quite a strong opposition in Latvia which demands a complete withdrawal of Russian troops in accordance with the Helsinki agreement. Nevertheless, we should display political realism in our onward advance", the Latvian minister stressed. In conclusion, Andrejevs expressed hope that a Russian-Latvian summit would take place as soon as in early April, and the drafted documents would be signed. "Relations between Russia and Latvia should be much better than both sides sometimes describe them. The truth is somewhere between, and we are quite able to develop friendly relations", the minister emphasised.
