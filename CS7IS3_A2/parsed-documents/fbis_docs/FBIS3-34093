Jordanian political sources said the government ordered out the Iranians because of their contacts with Islamic fundamentalists. The ministry informed the Iranian authorities about the move at the beginning of January, giving the diplomats two months to leave. The official reason was that Jordan wanted to reach a balance between the number of diplomats in each country, as Jordan had only two in Tehran. Jordan and Iran resumed diplomatic relations in January 1991 after a 10-year break. Tehran severed relations with Amman because of its support for Baghdad during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988. The Iranian embassy in Amman reopened in March 1991 and Jordan's embassy in Tehran soon after.
