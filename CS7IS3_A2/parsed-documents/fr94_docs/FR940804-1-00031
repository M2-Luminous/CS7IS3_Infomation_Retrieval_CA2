FR940804-1-00031 FR940804-1-00012 The quino checkerspot was first described in 1863 by Hans Herman Behr, an entomologist with the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, as Melitaea quino based on a specimen from coastal San Diego County, California. It was subsequently recognized by Comstock (1927) as a race of Euphydryas editha (Boisduval). For many years, E. e. quino was inappropriately recognized as E. e. wrightii. This error was rectified by J. Emmel based on a study of Behr's notes and available specimens (D. Murphy, Center for Conservation Biology, Stanford University, in litt. , 1988; Allen 1990). The genus Euphydryas, which is widely represented throughout North America, has been subdivided into closely related species groups (Scott 1986). The genus Euphydryas is also referred to as Occidryas, but many authors retain the former name (e.g., Scott 1986; Harrison et al 1988; Murphy 1990; Brown 1991). The quino checkerspot is restricted to sunny openings on clay soils formed from gabbro parent materials within shrubland habitats of the interior foothills of southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico (G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1991). Similar to the Laguna Mountains skipper and butterflies in general, its distribution is defined primarily by that of its larval host plant but is further restricted by other factors. The primary larval food plant of the quino checkerspot is Plantago erecta (dwarf plantain, family Plantaginaceae). However, the larvae may also use Plantago insularis and Orthocarpus purpurescens (owl's clover, family Scrophulariaceae) (White 1974; Greg Ballmer, University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1993). These plants grow in or near meadows, vernal pools, and lake margins in upland shrub communities including sparse chaparral, and chaparral mixed with coastal sage scrub. This butterfly is generally found at sites where high densities of the host plant occur (J. Johnson, in litt. , 1989; D. Hawks, University of California at Riverside, in litt. , 1992) and was found at a variety of elevations from about sea level to about 1200 m (4000 feet). Within these areas, the quino checkerspot may be preferentially selecting sites where exposure to winter sun is greatest (Allen 1990). These habitats, like the quino checkerspot butterfly, were once commonly found along coastal bluffs, mesas, and inland foothills (Brown and Faulkner 1984). The quino checkerspot may have been one of the most abundant butterflies in San Diego, Orange, and western Riverside Counties during the early part of the 20th century (Murphy 1990). The original range of the quino checkerspot extended as far south as Valle de la Trinidad in northwestern Baja California, Mexico, and as far north as Point Dume in Los Angeles County (Allen 1990). Currently, only six to seven small populations are known within the United States. Five to six populations occur near Vail Lake in southwestern Riverside and north-central San Diego Counties (G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1990 and 1991; David Hawks, entomologist, University of California at Riverside, pers. comm., 1993). One other population is known to occur (as of 1991) near Upper Otay Lake in San Diego County (Murphy, in litt. , 1991). Although the latter population has likely been extirpated (Murphy, pers. comm., 1994). At least one population exists in Mexico, in the Sierra Juarez near Tecate (Murphy, in litt. , 1991). Adult quino checkerspot butterflies were not seen at several historically occupied sites in Mexico during a survey in the spring of 1993 (unpubl. Service data). No estimates of population size for the quino checkerspot are currently available. Adult quino checkerspot butterflies live from 4 to 8 weeks. The flight season occurs from mid-January to late April, and peaks between March and April. The eggs hatch in about 10 days, and the larvae begin to feed immediately. Fourth instar (development stage) larvae enter an obligatory diapause, as summer approaches and their larval food plant senesces. Extended periods of diapause may occur during times of drought (G. Ballmer, in litt. , 1990). Post-diapause larvae develop through four more instars and then pupate to emerge as adults in the early spring (Murphy and White 1984). Previous Federal Action On June 3, 1991, the Service received a petition dated May 27, 1991, from Mr. David Hogan of the San Diego Biodiversity Project, to list four butterfly species as endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. ): the Laguna Mountains skipper ( Pyrgus ruralis lagunae ), Hermes copper ( Lycaena hermes ), Thorne's hairstreak ( Mitoura thornei ), and Harbison's dun skipper ( Euphyes vestris harbisoni ). The petition cited loss and degradation of habitat, through various causes, as the major threat to these butterflies. On July 12, 1993, the Service found that the petition contained substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted for the Laguna Mountains skipper, but not for the other three butterflies listed above. The latter finding was made because sufficient information was not available regarding the threats to and biological vulnerability of these taxa. An announcement of these findings were published in the Federal Register on July 19, 1993 (58 FR 38549). The Laguna Mountains skipper, Hermes copper, Thorne's hairstreak, and Harbison's dun skipper are currently classified as category 2 candidates for Federal listing (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804). Category 2 includes taxa for which information in the Service's possession indicates that listing is possibly appropriate but for which the Service lacks substantial information upon which to base a proposal to list as endangered or threatened. On September 30, 1988, the Service received a petition dated September 26, 1988, from Dr. Dennis Murphy of the Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology, to list the quino checkerspot butterfly ( Euphydryas editha quino ) as endangered under the Act. At the time this petition was submitted, this taxon had not been seen for several years and was thought to be extinct. Extant populations of the quino checkerspot were reported by Dr. Murphy in a letter dated August 1, 1991, which again requested the Service to consider the petitioned action. The status of the quino checkerspot has been under review by the Service since 1984 when it was classified as a category 2 candidate for Federal Listing (May 22, 1984; 50 FR 37958). This taxon is currently classified as a category 1 candidate (November 21, 1991; 56 FR 58804), meaning that information in the Service's possession is sufficient to support a proposal to list as endangered or threatened. This proposed rule constitutes the final finding for the petitioned action to list the Laguna Mountains skipper as warranted. In addition, this proposed rule constitutes the 90-day finding that the petition for the quino checkerspot butterfly presented substantial information that the action may be warranted and the final 12-month finding for this petition that the action is warranted. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species Section 4 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the Act set forth criteria and procedures for adding species to the Federal Lists. A species may be listed due to any one or a combination of the five factors listed in section 4(a)(1) of the Act. These factors and their application to the Laguna Mountains skipper ( Pyrgus ruralis lagunae ) and the quino checkerspot ( Euphydryas editha quino ) are as follows.
