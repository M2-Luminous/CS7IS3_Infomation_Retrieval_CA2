Eight hang out on the left, while eight others, who ran for parliament from various managerial entities, are on the right. It is an illusory right, and it is called so only because there is no real right wing in the Odessa delegation. This group includes many well-known names: Bodelan, Symonenko, Kudyukin, Plotkin, Hurvits, Hovorun, Popov and Honchar. Apart from them are the rest, the representatives of a Lawyer's Union: Shyskin, Evdokymov and Karmazin, who for the sake of speeding up reforms declared willingness to cooperate with all parties and movements. Two weeks after the fright caused by the first round of the election we can breathe easier. All of a sudden, Odessa residents voted with wonderful moderation. New Russian demagogues, the writer Vershynin and the television star Vaserman, as well as more noisy Leninists Pylypenko, Prokopets and Anyshchuk failed to get into parliament. Those Communists who won seats in the Supreme Council are at least distinguished by party work or are authorities in the world of business. The two representatives of the Countryside Party as not so much party activists as kolkhoz chairmen. Only the leader of the city's Social Democrats, now People's Deputy Rychagov, is one of those who only know how to talk. It is not even worth it to discuss the other eight. Almost all of them were early favorites and stuck in the memory of the people not so much by worlds but deeds. Maybe it was a mistake by Oleksiy Kostusev to stress the ephemeral "struggle against the mafia" and not his own practical activities in his election campaign. As a result, he suffered a defeat at the hands of the main object of his anti-mafia crusade, Yeduard Hurvits. Today, it is hard to tell where the Odessa delegation will steer its ship. But it is clear as day that not everything that the candidates promised before the election will become reality. Everything will depend on two factors. First, on the balance of forces in parliament itself and, second, on how the big cheeses of the Odessa delegation, Valentyn Symonenko and Ruslan Bodelan steer it. Competition, not to say cold war, has been going on between them for a good decade. But now they may well declare a truce in order to protect together their regional Odessa interests against the encroachment by the powers that be in Kiev. Yet, it is unlikely that they could remain neutral relative one another even for a short period of time. The elections for Odessa mayor and Odessa regional governor are approaching. Even though most likely neither Symonenko nor Bodelan want these posts, they will attempt to get their stand-ins elected to them. For the rest, a violator of peace on the Odessa team may become the colorful head of the Zhovtnevyy rayon council Yeduard Hurvits. But it is unlikely that he could enter the competition for leadership. He has already been the shadow of Symonenko and the shadow of Bodelan. More recently, Hurvits has found it safer to hide in the shadow of Leonid Kuchma.
