Government circles say the reshuffle will be selective. Theodhoros Pangalos, alternate foreign minister on European affairs, reportedly will remain in government but will move to another ministry. Dhimitrios Tsovolas [Panhellenic Socialist Movement member and former finance minister] will receive a ministerial portfolio. Correspondent Kostis Dhimtsas has the following report: [Begin Dhimtsas recording] According to close associates of Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, the reshuffle will take place within the first 10 days of July, probably on 6 July. The reshuffle will be selective, not wide as has been reported in the press. Karolos Papoulias will remain as foreign minister and Yerasimos Arsenis as national defense minister. Theodhoros Pangalos will leave the Foreign Ministry, but will remain in the government and assume another ministry. Pangalos expressed a desire to go to the Culture Ministry. As close associates of Papandreou said, however, the prime minister has not decided whether the ministers of culture and education will be replaced. The basic structure of the Ministry of National Economy and the Finance Ministry will not change, but secondary changes with the appointment of Dhimitrios Tsovolas and possibly Vaso Papandreou [former Greek commissioner at the EU] are not ruled out. Finally, and again according to close associates of the prime minister, there have been proposals to appoint deputy prime ministers. It appears that Papandreou has not adopted these proposals.
