The TNO's subsidy from the Ministry of Science and Education originally was supposed to have been reduced from one percent in 1994 to five percent in 1998. The one percent reduction slated for 1994 will be implemented. However, State Secretary Cohen is willing to look for other financial means to offset the reduced subsidies slated for 1995 to 1998 as follows: 1995, 1.335 million guilders (G); 1996, G2.671 million; 1997, G4.006 million; and 1998, G5.342 million. All of this was communicated in the annual subsidy letter, which explains the base subsidies as well as the target subsidies the TNO receives from different departments. The reduction was the result of a cabinet decision to diminish the number of subsidies. During the budget negotiations, the second Chamber made it clear that in this case the effect -- less investment in knowledge infrastructure -- would differ from the goal -- a reduction in subsidies.
