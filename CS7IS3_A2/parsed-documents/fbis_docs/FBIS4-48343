In exclusive statements to RDP1, Angolan Ambassador Rui Mingas assures that an agreement in Lusaka is very very near. This is a confirmation we had to try hard to extract from Rui Mingas: [Begin recording] [Mingas] I can confirm it. Yes, it is very close, but what remains for... [Unidentified correspondent, interrupting] An understanding between the two sides? [Mingas] I am not sure whether it is an understanding between the sides, or whether it a question of us obtaining concrete evidence that UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] will really accept what is being proposed. [Correspondent] It has been said in the past few days that an agreement in Lusaka is imminent. Can you confirm that information? Have you received reports of that happening? [Mingas] Yes. I am convinced that the problem will be overcome by the end of June. [Correspondent] Can you give us any details of the agreement? [Mingas] No, no, I cannot give you any details, but I can tell you that as far as we are concerned we feel very optimistic. [end recording] [Announcer] He did not reveal any secrets but it has all been said in Rui Mingas' silence.
