In that way he will eliminate devaluation, as he feels that cannot continue to be the tool used to reduce the cost of living. These are the main proposals of the economic program he will apply if elected president. Taxes It is overhasty, inconsistent, and populist to suggest a new tax reform to reduce the tax burden without knowing what the fiscal situation will be in the next few months. Revaluation A stable real rate of exchange will be a central goal. To achieve that, the support of the entire private sector is needed. Banking There will be no financial reform; on the contrary, there will be stability in regulations and minimal government intervention. There will be strict controls, but they will be highly technical in nature. Credit Commercial credit needs to reach more users and economic sectors. Industry An urban credit system will be established for small businesses and industries, supported by a rediscount fund (Finurbano [expansion not given]), sustained by external lines of credit and government and budget resources. In addition, there will be a rural savings and credit network similar to the English postal savings system. Agriculture Credit will be democratized and an ambitious land title program will be implemented. This will help a large number of campesinos who now have no formal property titles. That will make it easier for them to obtain commercial financing and use their assets in a modern productive system. Macroeconomy Stabilization of the real exchange rate will first of all require bringing inflationary pressures under control. In his opinion, exchange stability and control of inflation are interrelated goals. Fiscal Policy Controlling inflation will be helped by coordinating fiscal and monetary policy, which will avert demand-driven inflationary pressures. Cusiana Resources To handle the oil bonanza, an investment stabilization fund will be set up to manage part of the Cusiana resources. Capital He will propose to the stock exchanges the creation of a mixed corporation which will actively promote the development of the capital market. This agency will promote the stock market with businesses that are not listed on the stock exchange and the development of instruments like stock purchase programs and project financing. Security Efforts will be made to improve "peace management." All departments of the government will be involved in creating conditions that will make the return of the former armed rebels to society feasible. Economic Liberalization Colombia's closed domestic market will be eliminated in order to foster competitiveness, more exports, growth, and better jobs and salaries. A great deal of private investment will be stimulated.
