The two countries concluded a specific industrial cooperation accord, the first ever of this type signed by Russia and a western European country. Two cooperative projects out of a total of 20 projects under consideration are already the subject of close negotiations. The first project involves the modernization (radar, avionics, engine) of old-generation MiG fighters which are not considered competitors of French aircraft intended for exportation. The project will be conducted by SAGEM [Company for General Electricity and Mechanics Applications] and Dassault Electronique and will focus on MiG 21, 23, and 27 aircraft. The second project involves the construction of a future training aircraft for the Russians, who are currently using Czech aircraft for this purpose. The future aircraft will be named MiG AT (Advanced Trainer). Its frame will be built by the Russian Mikoyan [name as published] company, while the version destined for the Russian Air Force will be equipped with a Larzac engine manufactured by SNECMA [National Company for Aircraft Engine Studies and Construction] which is currently used on the French Alphajet. In addition, the export version of the training aircraft -- which is expected to open new markets for French companies -- will be equipped with an avionics system made by Sextant Avionique.
