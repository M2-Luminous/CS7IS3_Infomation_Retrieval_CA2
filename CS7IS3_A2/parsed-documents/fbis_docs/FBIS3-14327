Some observers see that as being tantamount to an appointment of Maj. Gen. Lemari as second defense minister. The matter seems to have caused sharp arguments at the military command's meetings last Wednesday and Thursday. Although Maj. Gen. Lemari rejected the post of defense minister when Zeroual became president and also objected to anyone else assuming that post, as a result of which President Zeroual himself assumed the post, giving the chief of staff this authorization now means that those opposed to President Zeroual's move toward political dialogue have scored an important point, particularly as it coincided with the partial acceptance of Maj. Gen. Lemari's call for a change of military district commanders. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that 5th Military District Commander Major General Abdelhamid Jouadi, First Military District (the capital) Commander Major General Jnouhat, and Land Army Command Major General Khalifah Rahim have been relieved of their posts. The names of the officers who will replace them have not been revealed yet but they may well be supporters of Maj. Gen. Lemari and the hard-line trend in the Army. Meanwhile, the military forces are launching attacks on the areas where fundamentalist gunmen are active. According to some sources, these attacks have resulted in a large number of victims described by the security authorities and the media as "terrorists." Maj. Gen. Lemari and the hard-line trend appear to be banking on achieving tangible results in the field of security that would provide the answer to those who claim that the regime has no option other than dialogue following the failure of the security option. In the capital, Algiers, yesterday there was a gathering of secular forces opposed to political dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front. Some 30,000 people, mostly women, attended.
