An aide to Khun Sa said one of the MTA's five sabotage units which infiltrated Tachilek was responsible for the explosion along the ridge of the dyke, about one kilometre southeast of Tachilek. The explosion took place at about noon Wednesday. The blast destroyed the dyke so that the reservoir drained into the Mae Sai River. The deputy governor of Chiang Rai who inspected the border opposite Tachilek, said the blast had caused water shortages in the town. The act of sabotage was apparently part of the resistance to the ongoing suppression drive by Rangoon forces against Khun Sa which has captured part of the Shan State. An MTA source said about 1,000 government troops from the 77th Division in Shan Tung and 55th Division in Mong Yawng had arrived in Tachilek on Wednesday night. They were expected to be despatched to Doi Kong Mon, about 20 kilometres southeast of Tachilek, which was captured by the MTA on April 18, in a bid to recapture it. Heavy fighting in the area is expected very soon said the source. Chao Klwan Muang, head of the political section of Khun Sa's MTA forces said at his command post at Doi Taw Kham near Doi Kong Mon that the Burmese people were disillusioned with the State Law and Order Restoration Council which took control of the country in 1989. He said the SLORC was nearing its end as the people had suffered enough under its administration. Chao Khwan Muang said government jet fighters had flown over Doi Kong Mon but no airstrikes had taken place because of bad weather On the Thai side of the border, government forces comprising rangers, border patrol police, provincial police and defence volunteers have been ordered on full alert along a 30-kilometre stretch opposite Burma to prevent soldiers from the two warring sides and villagers fleeing the fighting crossing into Thailand. Villagers in Mae Sai district said about 300-400 Burmese had already sneaked across the border to live with relatives in the district. A Border Patrol Police source said last night the border with Mae Sai was expected to be closed from today.
