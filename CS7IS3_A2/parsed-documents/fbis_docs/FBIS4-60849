"By all indications, organisers of oppositional manifestations are well aware that something more formidable than water hose can be used against demonstrators, and without any delay and hesitation," NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes. Although the mayor of Moscow talks about "contact-free" methods of dispersing manifestations, Deputy Chief of Agency of Moscow Militia Gennadiy Feklichev says that public order in Moscow on the May Day will be maintained by militia. A few days ago, soldiers of interior troops were trained in methods of dispersing demonstrations. Armoured equipment was present during the training. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries a statement by Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov who warns: "We are ready to cope with any changes of the situation in the capital. Sufficient measures will be taken and force used against those who want to clowd our holyday and violate law." KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Patriarch Alexey the Second of Moscow and all Russia. He said, specifically: "I believe that those who call us to the barricades, to separate tanks and the parliament house think in their mundane ways." NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA frontpages an item in which it is alleged that "the Interior Ministry recommended, after conversations with personnel, to select no less than 250 men to be sent, plain-clothed, to the site of mass actions in the Kaluzhskaya square. The newspaper notes that the Interior Ministry's directive suggests that these persons be inculcated among demonstrators to provoke disturbances. The newspaper asserts that sergeants will be paid for these services $250 and more, and officers even as much as $500. A number of newspapers carry interviews with Mikhail Shmakov, chairman of the Russian Federation of Independent Trade Unions. In an interview granted to TRUD he said that "the problem of peace in society equally concerns all the population of the country. Our state pays too dearly for strife on the political Olympus. Therefore, trade unions support the president's idea to press for overcoming the crisis in all areas in Russia on a basis of civic accord." In an interview with RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA Shmakov touched upon the socioeconomic situation in work collectives. He stressed that "the situation is desperate". Plants are stopped. Even such giants as the Likhachev auto works, the Volga auto works and the Gorkiy car factory may face this calamity." In an interview to PRAVDA Shmakov stated that trade unions at present are not rigidly oriented at any one party. "There is no party as yet that would fully correspond to trade union tasks. But we support parties and movements whose programmes contain ideas similar to ours." Regarding the meeting of the Latvian and Russian presidents planned for today, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that "coordinations are being made in the hours that remain to go before the presidential meeting. `Telephone diplomacy' on which Russia and Latvia have been heavily relying in the recent days is a way to resolve matters of principle but not particulars which, in the long run, determine the climate of bilateral relations." The same newspaper carries an interview with Anatoliy Kuntsevich, former chairman of the committee on conventional problems of chemical and biological weapons at the Russian president. He said "it is unrealistic to expect that any subject of the Federation would voluntarily accept chemical ammunition for destruction in their territory. Hardly any subject of the Federation will so much as permit the transportation of chemical ammunition over their territory. Therefore a system for weapons elimination in areas of their storage should be created. National unity is essential. All other subjects of the Federation should not remain indifferent observers as the timeframe for safe storage of chemical weapons is running out." The newspaper SEGODNYA touches upon the case of U.S. spy Ames. In this connection the newspaper writes that the possibility of the exchange of arrested agents of the U.S. and Russia should not be ruled out. Some experts say that potential candidatures for bargaining are former Colonel of the main intelligence agency Baranov and former Major of the first main agency of the KGB, now the External Intelligence Service, Motorin. KRASNAYA ZVEZDA carries an interview with chief of the Russian Armed Services Colonel-General Anatoliy Sitnov. He notes that if the defence budget is endorsed in its present form the Defence Ministry, repaying the debt for 1993 and for deliveries in 1994, will have to spend whatever funds are left on the ensurance of nuclear safety, preservation of ships and vessels of the navy now being built or repared and to finance work for maintenance of armements and military equipment. The agreements on the supply of all other armaments and military equipment commissioned by the state (over 80 per cent) will have to be disolved, with catastrophic consequences. The newspaper NEVSKOYE VREMYA reports that the unfavourable ecological situation in the Gulf of Finland will be the main cause of the spread of algae in the gulf in summer. The situation is aggravated by the unusually large influx to the Baltic Sea of saline waters from the north Atlantic and the lack of oxygen in benthic layers.
