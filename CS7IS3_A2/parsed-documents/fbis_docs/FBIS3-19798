According to the Social Democratic Party [SDP] chairman, Kinkel must "take along some putty" when he goes to Paris soon. Kinkel permitted his behavior toward the French ambassador last week to be determined solely by domestic policy reasons, Scharping said. FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer accused Scharping of the "foul creation of legends." The summons of the French envoy was "appropriate and necessary." It is dishonest that Scharping now tries to turn this into ammunition for the election campaign, Hoyer said.
