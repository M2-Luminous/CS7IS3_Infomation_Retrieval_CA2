Akayev said emphatically: In his important speech in Tashkent, Premier Li Peng set forth China's clear-cut principles for developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with Central Asian nations. These principles are of great significance to peace and stability in Kyrgyzstan and in the entire Central Asian region. He maintained that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, plays a special positive role in international affairs. Akayev noted: As a young country that became independent not long ago, Kyrgyzstan needs to learn from China's experiences, including those in international activities. He expressed the hope that diplomats from the two countries would maintain consultations and strengthen cooperation in international organizations. Premier Li Peng first conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial greetings to President Akayev. Li Peng said: China and Kyrgyzstan share a common border and a traditional friendship. Relations between the two countries have developed smoothly since Kyrgyzstan became independent. For its part, China is willing to work hard to deepen this friendship continuously. Akayev asked Li Peng to convey his regards to President Jiang Zemin, as well as his invitation to the latter to visit Kyrgyzstan. Akayev said: Strengthening cooperation with China in various fields -- political, economic, scientific and technological, and cultural -- is in the paramount interests of the Kyrgyz nation; it also represents a priority in Kyrgyzstan's foreign policy. President Akayev agreed with the idea proposed by Premier Li Peng for building a new silk road. He said: Kyrgyzstan will work toward this goal so that the new silk road will become a path of cooperation and friendship. He noted: Kyrgyzstan will always see China as a friendly neighbor of Central Asian nations, as well as a cooperative partner that inspires mutual trust. On the Sino-Kyrgyz border issue, the two sides maintained unanimously: At present, it is necessary to expeditiously turn previously concluded agreements into a legal form and implement them accordingly. Meanwhile, friendly negotiations on some remaining issues should be continued. In light of sincerity on both sides, it is believed that the border issue between the two countries will be successfully resolved in the not-too-distant future. Li Peng said: Reaching a border agreement at an early date will be of great significance to strengthening Sino-Kyrgyz relations. It is hoped that the border between the two countries will become a bond of peace and friendship, as well as a bridge leading to economic prosperity. Akayev said: Economic cooperation and trade between the two countries have shown strong momentum. China has become an important trade partner of Kyrgyzstan's. Kyrgyzstan hopes to raise economic relations and trade between the two countries to a new level. Chinese enterprises are welcome to invest in Kyrgyzstan. He noted: Some of the joint ventures that Kyrgyzstan set up along with China's Xinjiang region have yielded positive results; there is still vast potential in this regard. Akayev also spoke highly of fruitful cooperation between scientific and technological personnel from the two countries. Li Peng said: China and Kyrgyzstan should strengthen cooperation in such fields as economics, trade, science and technology, and culture. He noted: "Since Kyrgyzstan became independent, trade between the two countries, border trade in particular, has grown substantially. I agree that economic relations and trade should be further expanded on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese Government adopts a positive attitude toward investment by Chinese entrepreneurs in Kyrgyzstan." Premier Li Peng added: China supports the maintenance of friendly relations among Central Asian nations and between Central Asian nations and Russia. President Akayev said: The relations between Central Asian nations and Russia have been formed over the years, and it is very important to maintain good relations with each other.
