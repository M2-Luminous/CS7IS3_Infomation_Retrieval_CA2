Carlos Ferrer Argote, Caribbean Affairs director of the Foreign Relations Secretariat, pointed out that Mexico will not interfere in the conflict "because our constitutional principles on foreign affairs are based on self-determination and nonintervention." Nevertheless, he said the Mexican Government will in no way abstain from raising its voice in favor of the Haitian people's will being respected. Once the situation in Haiti has been normalized, the Mexican Government will direct its international cooperation efforts toward the reconstruction of the country. On 21 May, the United Nations implemented a complete embargo against Haiti after the expiration of the two-week deadline granted to coup leader Raoul Cedras to step down from power and allow the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The trade embargo is the most sweeping package of sanctions directed against any country on the continent. Within the framework of the 19th Caribbean Studies Association, Ferrer Argote stressed that Haiti's problems or the conflicts taking place in other countries in the region will undermine the integration of the Caribbean States Association. He also indicated that Mexico has "definitely" encouraged the integration of the Caribbean States Association because there must be an ever-growing sense of belonging to the region. The Caribbean Affairs director also recalled that 750 km of Mexico's coastline faces the Caribbean. The official concluded by indicating that the aforementioned integration process has traditionally been hampered by inadequate channels of communication. Moreover, he called for the construction of a deep draft port in the Caribbean to encourage the development of navigation, maritime activities, trade, and tourism.
