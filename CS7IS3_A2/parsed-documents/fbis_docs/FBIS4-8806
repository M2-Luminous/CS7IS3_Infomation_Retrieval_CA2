Milosevic said in a statement for the press following a two and a half-hour talk with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who unexpectedly arrived in Belgrade this evening, that the meeting on Gorazde would be held tomorrow morning and that the boundaries of the security zone would be determined in accordance with conclusions reached by a mixed commission composed of the representatives of the Bosnian Serbs, the Muslims, and the UN. Milosevic assessed this evening's talks with Kozyrev as very open. According to him, the talks were devoted to key issues pertaining to the crisis in the region, with special emphasis on the events in Bosnia. "I am pleased that we have very close, I would say identical, views on many aspects of this question," the Serbian president stressed. Speaking about the situation in Bosnia, Milosevic said: "The peace process in Bosnia is at a critical point, from where it could very easily escalate into war, but it could also very easily shift towards a final peace." "We believe that solutions involving small steps and the extinguishing of small fires is not a solution for Bosnia", Milosevic said, and added: "If things are tackled in this way we will constantly have a crisis in which only the geographical name would change, and the war would in this case be difficult to stop." According to Milosevic, the best solution for the Bosnian conflict would be to reach a comprehensive agreement on the cessation of all hostilities on the entire territory of Bosnia- Herzegovina as soon as possible, without prejudging a political solution, and then to negotiate a final settlement in conditions of peace. "I am very pleased to note that Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev shares our view that the issue of sanctions is directly linked to the establishment of peace in Bosnia and that Russia has a very objective and constructive approach in this regard," Milosevic said. Speaking about Gorazde, Milosevic said that the problem of that city should be resolved in conformity with the same principles that govern the global implementation of the project. "The Muslim side has avoided defining the border of the security zone and has from this area launched a big -- as they called it -- spring offensive. Later a very complicated situation came about after the collapse of this offensive and the successful counterattack by Serb forces, but also after the unfortunate intervention from the air. This has undoubtedly put back the peace process and to a certain extent compromised the behavior of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force]." Milosevic said that defining the borders of the safe zone of Gorazde would create the conditions for things to cool off there, and that this would be the "extinguishing of a very difficult and tragic hot spot, but in the context of a general agreement on a cease-fire throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina." "We will invest all our political influence to see that this is achieved and we hope that we will are successful in this," Milosevic said. Kozyrev agreed with Milosevic that the talks were very constructive and said he was leaving Belgrade "much more convinced that we shall achieve progress in the peace process." Kozyrev underlined in a talk with reporters that President Milosevic was involved in the efforts to revive the peace talks and added: "I am an optimist in this respect." Speaking about ways to resolve the Bosnian conflict, Kozyrev said that the European Union's plan remains on the table and that the United States, Russia, and the European Union were endeavoring to achieve peace on the basis of it. The Russian foreign minister confirmed that there had also been discussion this evening of the sanctions and said: "We considered the question of sanctions, and Ambassador Churkin prior to this set out the Russian Federation's standpoint on this. If we are partners in the peace process with the European Union and the United States, this partnership must be in the determining of the borders, as well as in relation to the question of the suspension of sanctions. The Russian standpoint must be considered both in the European Union and in the United States. The road to peace is the road to the lifting of sanctions". At the end, Kozyrev advocated that UNPROFOR representatives be sent to Gorazde and that the blockade of the Blue Helmets should be lifted "wherever and however they are being held." Thus, he said, the intervention from the air has proved to be ineffectual. During this evening's talks, it was assessed that the NATO air strikes against Serb positions on 10 and 11 April caused an exacerbation of the situation and brought into question the efforts to establish a full cessation of hostilities in this area. In this context, note was made in particular of the danger of such acts undermining the peace efforts directed towards the normalization of the situation and the creation of the necessary conditions for the resumption of the negotiating process. In this, Russia was directly and actively involved and, in the assessment of President Milosevic, participated in a constructive way. Taking into account that the peace process has found itself at a point where an escalation of the war and the establishment of peace were equally possible, Milosevic and Kozyrev agreed that forces should be joined in order to achive peace. It was noted that peace was undoubtedly in everybody's interest and that the only road to the establishment of a final peace in these regions led through the cessation of all hostilities. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic expressed his conviction that Russia's peace initiative and the efforts made to implement an overall cessation of hostilities would prevail over the war option, and that the United Nations bore the responsibility to exercise an unbiased approach to all the sides in the conflict. This evening's talks were also attended by Russian Ambassador in Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.
