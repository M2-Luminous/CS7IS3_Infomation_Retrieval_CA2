FR941005-1-00020 FR941005-1-00004 The FDIC fully appreciates the need to keep to a minimum any additional recordkeeping requirements. However, pursuant to section 7(b)(5) of the FDI Act, as amended by FDICIA, each insured depository institution must maintain all records the FDIC may require for verifying the correctness of the institution's assessments. Depending on how the assessment base is defined, additional recordkeeping might be necessary to allow for the verification of the assessment-related information reported by an institution. If, in responding to any portion of this Notice, a comment recommends a particular recordkeeping requirement, the commenter is requested to include an estimate of the amount of time it would take a reporting entity to meet the requirement. B. Questions for Comment Regarding the Criteria Response to the following questions is requested: 1. Are the definitions of the aforementioned criteria sufficient in terms of evaluating the various options for defining the assessment base? If not, provide suggested definitions. 2. Are there any other criteria that should be considered in evaluating the various options for defining the assessment base? If so, identify and define those criteria. IV. Alternative Assessment-Base Definitions This section presents several options for defining the assessment base. It does not attempt to address all possible options, but rather discusses those the FDIC has identified to date as the primary alternatives. Following a discussion of each of these options are several specific questions pertaining to that option. Response to these questions is requested from all interested persons. A. Status Quo Under this option, the assessment base would remain unchanged, and it would continue to be defined, broadly stated, as total domestic deposits. Because there would be no changes, the FDIC's existing assessment-base regulations would not be amended.
