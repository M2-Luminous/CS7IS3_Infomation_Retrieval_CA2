First of all, however, here is President Michal Kovac's answer to the question of what he expects from the new government. [Begin Kovac recording] The fact that this government was formed five days after a vote of no-confidence in the previous government was passed shows that Slovakia has capable politicians who have the will to cooperate in the interest of the state and in the national interests of the Slovak Republic. I expect that, during its term of office, this government will confirm and consolidate this and will also give citizens confidence that we are not such a wrangling nation as it might have seemed recently. Second, it is necessary that this government prepare the ground to ensure a calm course for the new elections that will most probably take place this fall. The government has very important tasks in the areas of the economy and social and foreign policy. In the economic and social areas, especially, it has to take measures to stop a further decline in the economy and the rise in unemployment. Measures need to be taken as well to increase the feeling of security among citizens who worry about their health and property, and about their social prospects. There are other tasks, as well, but the most important ones are those I have just mentioned here. [end recording]
