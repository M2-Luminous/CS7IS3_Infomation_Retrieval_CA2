Fullerene has been getting much attention recently as a new electronic material. A lcm x lcm single crystal thin film was produced by depositing ionized molecules on a substrate. The new thin film has high heat and radiation resistances and can be made into large scale integrated circuits, thus enabling development of a new semiconductor substrate. Si and GaAs semiconductors have been available up to now. MELCO expects the new single crystal thin film to be useful for more complex material research on fullerene which is still unknown in many respects. Mica (potashmica) at 200ï¿½C was used as the substrate material to develop a fullerene single crystal thin film. Fullerene molecules were deposited on this substrate by the ionized cluster beam (ICB) method. The ICB method calls for ionization of clusters such as molecules and atoms first, then accelerating the ion movement by applying voltage, and finally depositing the ionized clusters onto the substrate. Using this method, fullerene molecules can be uniformly aligned. Proper control of ionization and acceleration conditions made production of a large single crystal thin film possible, and this is the key to practical application for semiconductor materials. It was confirmed through transmission electron microscope (TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) that 15 nanometer thick single crystal thin film was formed on the entire mica substrate, lcm x lcm. It was also confirmed that fullerene molecules employed epitxial crystal growth, which is the formation process in which the film molecules are uniformly lined up according to the crystal orientation of the substrate. At present, the molecular beam deposition method is used mainly to form fullerene molecule film. However, this method is useful only for polycrystal thin film formation. Formation of single crystal thin films has been reported, but the size is limited to a little over 100 nanometer each side at a maximum. MELCO confirmed for the first time in 1992 that fullerene molecules can be used for semiconductor materials. Their Central Research Laboratory and Materials and Electronic Devices Laboratory have been jointly conducting research on commercially viable size single crystal thin film. MELCO will try to develop a transistor device using this single crystal thin film in the future. MELCO claims that this new single crystal thin film will be useful for more complex material research on fullerene. Polycrystal thin films turned out to be not as useful for this purpose. Wide Application Potential--Useful for Optical Material (Commentary) The history of research on fullerene is quite short. Up to now, research has been focused mainly on the search for new types of fullerene and basic properties. The newly achieved result not only contributes to proper measurement of fullerene molecule properties but also shows how they might be used in semiconductors. The research on new carbon materials has gone beyond the basic science stage and made progress in materials development which consciously aims at applications. ``Carbon nano tubes,'' ultra fine straw-like substances, have also been found. This is also a new kind of carbon material, which belongs to the same group as the fullerene molecules. The fullerene molecules are shaped like a hollow soccer ball, while carbon nano tubes are characterized by a tube-like shape with layers of carbon atom thin skins. R&D on the new carbon materials is still at the primary stage, but the application potential is already considered to be extremely high. In addition to semiconductor materials, optical materials, high performance catalysts, and micro machines are under consideration to name just a few. Because of their unique shapes, the new carbon materials are a big challenge for researchers.
