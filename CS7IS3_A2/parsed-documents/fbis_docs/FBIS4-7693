Our correspondent Milan Repka reports: Defense Minister Antonin Baudys has said that a fast deployment brigade will deal with, above all, the solution of sudden crisis situations at any place in the Czech Republic, including situations where the state is under threat. According to Baudys, this unit should have about 3,000 men and should represent some kind of model of the future Czech Army. The equipment of this brigade should be compatible with the equipment of NATO countries, both in the case of hand weapons and helicopters. As Baudys went on to say, he and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus agreed on putting domestic arms production first, while taking its quality strictly into account. Another step of the ministry within the framework of transformation of the Czech Army is the necessary reduction of a large number of commander posts. In this connection, Baudys designated the basic principle of this transformation--above all, orientation toward recruiting new officers to achieve the aim of the Army service having to become attractive for high quality people.
