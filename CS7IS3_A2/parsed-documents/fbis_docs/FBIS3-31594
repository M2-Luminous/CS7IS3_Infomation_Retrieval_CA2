Our colleague Marian Hudec reports: [Hudec] The beginning of the expected SNS congress has not attracted the attention of the Zilina population. At the very beginning SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and over 40 other delegates left the hall, allegedly as a protest against undemocratic practices in the form of manipulation of the congress deliberations beforehand. The delegates to the extraordinary congress expelled Cernak, Anton Hrnko, and Vladimir Miskovsky from the party. The other rebels still have a chance to rejoin the party, if they ask for their readmission in writing before a deadline. The chairman of the SNS parliamentary group announced a little while ago that Ludovit Cernak will be deprived of his post of deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic. This ensues from coalition talks. An SNS candidate will be appointed to the post. The delegates to the congress are electing a new party chairman now. There are four candidates for this post: Jozef Prokes, Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jan Slota. Cernak supporters are holding deliberations at the House of Technology in Zilina, probably about the formation of a new party.
