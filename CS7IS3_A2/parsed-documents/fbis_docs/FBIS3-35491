The authorities are currently investigating the assertions made earlier by a witness according to which additional Jews assisted the settler who opened fire. The defense establishment has no confirmation of this claim which is currently being investigated. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is now dispatching reinforcements to Judaea and Samaria. A curfew has been imposed on Hebron and there is a general closure on the Gaza Strip. Arab workers from the Gaza Strip are not being permitted to enter Israel. The IDF General Staff is calling on the Jewish and Arab residents of the territories and Israel to show restraint. A series of steps are being taken at this time in an attempt to prevent any exacerbation of tensions or a deterioration of the situation in the territories. Reports streaming in from Hebron, which as mentioned earlier is under curfew, indicate that there are small gatherings of Arab residents. Settlers reported stonethrowing incidents around Hebron and near Halhul. Nevertheless, three hours after the bloody incident at the Cave of the Patriarchs, the security forces seem to have the situation under control and there are no serious incidents. [Engel] You said that the initial investigation indicates that two weapons were used in the shooting. Do the results of the investigation also specify whether the man who committed the massacre used both weapons or did he have an accomplice? [Semrik] The current premise of the security forces is that the shooting was carried out by one man, a settler from Qiryat Arba' disguised in an IDF officer's uniform. As far as is known at the present time, he was carrying two firearms, an M-16 rifle and a revolver. We will have more accurate details later on. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0700 GMT on 25 February adds that "in the Gaza Strip this morning, tires are burning in many locations and stones are being hurled at the security forces. Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the residents of the strip are being updated in Hebron through loudspeakers in the mosques. From time to time, instigatory calls are heard from the mosques in between prayers being read from the Koran. There have so far not been any reports of serious clashes between the army and residents."]
