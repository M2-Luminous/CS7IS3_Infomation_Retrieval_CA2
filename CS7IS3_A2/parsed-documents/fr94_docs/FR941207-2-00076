FR941207-2-00076 FR941207-2-00058 8. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, which has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Fund that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Fund (which the Fund agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request to the Fund for such work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation,'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards (``SAS'') No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), and the ongoing reports will each be a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness,'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar accounting standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. 9. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value, dividends, and distributions of the classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses between the classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Expert in the initial report referred to in condition 8 above and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 8 above. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert. 10. The prospectus will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling or servicing shares in a Fund may receive different compensation with respect to one particular class of shares over another in the same Fund. 11. Applicants will cause the distributor, and any successor to the distributor, to adopt compliance standards which govern the circumstances under which each class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of a Fund to agree to conform to such standards. 12. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the trustees or directors of each Fund with respect to the multi-class distribution system will be set forth in guidelines which will be furnished to the trustees or directors. 13. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in every prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through each prospectus. The Fund will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to all classes of shares in every shareholder report. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to each Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to any class of shares, it will also disclose the respective expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of a Fund's net asset value and public offering price will present each class of shares separately. 14. The applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by this application will not imply SEC approval, authorization, or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Fund may make pursuant to its rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan or any shareholder services plan a Fund may adopt in the future in reliance on the exemptive order. 15. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, Investment Company Act Release No. 16619 (Nov. 2, 1988), as such rule is currently proposed and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended. 16. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class of shares (``Target Class'') on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion. 17. If a Fund implements any amendment to its rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans (or adopts or implements any amendment to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount of asset-based charges that may be borne by Target Class shares for distribution or shareholder services, existing Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless the Purchase Class shareholders, voting separately as a class, approve the proposal. The directors or trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the proposal, no later than such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the directors or trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that New Purchase Class shares will convert into New Target Class shares. New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares (as well as other future classes formed for other purposes) may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the directors or trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 4, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of New Target Class or New Purchase Class shares shall be borne solely by the adviser or distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal providing for the payment of higher distribution and shareholder servicing fees with respect to Target Class shares may convert to Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the proposal and the level of the higher distribution and shareholder servicing fees under the amended Target Class Plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class shares are disclosed in an effective registration statement. For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
