[Correspondent] Did he perhaps discuss the prime minister? [Djindjic] No, no. It was quite clearly stated during the conversation that the prime minister must be someone who can be a man of consensus. [Correspondent] On the basis of this conversation, do you expect that the assembly will be stabler than the former one? [Djinjdic] I believe that this idea of a government of national unity can have a very calming effect on all party conflicts, and on the balance of power generally. This is -- so to speak -- a strong point around which the parties can now gather, and every one of them can say what they are ready to invest into this, and what they expect in return. This is a very good start, and I believe that this can calm the situation both in the parliament and on our political scene. Therefore, this conclusion and the expressed desire to assemble all those who can contribute to the situation in one government in any case promise a stabler and calmer parliament and calmer work in this parliament, which will be dedicated to solving concrete existential issues rather than interparty conflicts. [Correspondent] In any event, are you optimistic? [Djindjic] Yes, in any event. [Draskovic] When it comes to fighting poverty, winning the battle against hunger and crime, lifting the sanctions, ending the war, and achieving economic recovery and progress, there can be no opposition and government. These must be the shared aims of everyone. These shared aims call for a political strategy that will be in accordance with all this. [Correspondent] Do you expect the new parliament to be stabler than the former one and will produce a stabler government? [Draskovic] Such a parliament could give us a stabler government only if the post of assembly chairman were given to the opposition, and of course, the Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos] is the strongest political group in the opposition. This would constitute a complete recognition of the electoral result. We have reached an agreement in principle, and I do not see that we could have disagreed in principle, that the parliament should be permeated by a spirit of tolerance, that facts are what is to be disputed, that facts should clash rather than people, that parties and party vanities should clash, party positions on the list, but only facts [sentence as heard]. [Correspondent] Mr. Draskovic, since this is your first meeting with Mr. Milosevic, and since you have said certain rather uncomfortable things about him as a person, how do you personally see this meeting? [Draskovic] I have never said anything about him as a person. [Correspondent] Saddam, Saddam. [Draskovic] That was [pauses], let me just see [pauses], I would like someone to come up with a single piece of evidence that I have ever said Saddam, Saddam, or anything similar. It was others who said this, students, young people, citizens, not me. However, when it comes to criticizing President Milosevic, he heads a state, our fate frequently depends on his actions, and whoever holds a public post must also be exposed to the risk of being criticized. The president is a charming man, with a sense of humor, but okay, that has nothing to do with the political side, but since you insist on the atmosphere of the talks, I believe that the atmosphere was mutually open, trusting. [Agoston] We also agreed that -- even though this is the first time I have ever heard of this idea -- the idea of electing a government of national unity was a good idea, a government comprised of experts from various parties. I believe that it is important that precisely at this point, in these times, such unity is achieved, which will make it possible for all of us to transcend this difficult situation. [Correspondent] Could you define more clearly your position -- that is, the party's position in relation to the ruling party and the opposition? [Agoston] Well, I think that this relation -- for us at least -- has always been clear. We believe that, considering our demands, the opposition is also an opposition for us. [Correspondent] Mr. Minic, since President Slobodan Milosevic has lately been increasingly insisting on a government of national unity, how does the Socialist Party [of Serbia], as the strongest party and the one with the greatest number of deputies in the parliament, see this? [Minic] After both the first and second multiparty elections, and today, President Milosevic quite openly and clearly insisted on the unification of political forces in Serbia, as has been defined, he favors a government of national unity. [sentence as heard] We believe that, after the third multi-party elections in Serbia, conditions have been met for surpassing the first -- so to speak -- infant diseases of parliamentary life in the republic and that we should strive to conduct such a political struggle that will unify the forces in Serbia. As far as the forming of new republican governments is concerned, the president always felt that -- at the time of the former elections, too -- we should be open to accepting people into the government on the basis that they are competent people who are successfully dealing with problems in these times, so that we see this government of national unity as completely open to the most competent and expert people who will assemble in such a government, so that we can solve social, economic, and political problems which we face. We believe that after these elections, conditions have been met for furthering parliamentary life in the republic, for having a parliament where parties will compete in trying to find those legal solutions which will be best suited to solving the economic and social interests of our people, as we have said, for Serbia. [sentence as heard] Therefore, we consider political life to be a way for parties to clash over such projects. [sentence as heard] There will be a competition between projects in the parliament, arguments will clash, and they will be taken into consideration, rather than who is saying what and what they are striving for. [sentence as heard] Therefore, we believe that the parliament will have its function. [Correspondent] Are the Socialists ready to be without a prime minister? [Minic] We believe that the paramount thing right now is to constitute the republican parliament, while [pauses] as the strongest party, since we have convincingly won the elections, that the president will keep in mind [pauses] to give the mandate to someone from the Socialist Party of Serbia, or depending on the concept. [sentence as heard] We will see how this call for a government of national unity will be reflected [in the public], and depending on this concept, after the parliament is constituted, we will discuss the government in the following days. [sentence as heard]
