According to SNS chairman Jan Slota, Juraj Molnar left for Moscow as an observer with the consent of the party leadership but was not authorized to deliver any message. According to Jan Slota, the SNS did not establish any contacts with the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and does not intend to do so in the future. Our correspondent Vladimir Lach tried to find out more about the whole affair. Jan Slota, chairman of the SNS, told him the following, among other things: [Begin recording] [Slota] The leadership of the party did not know that a congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was being organized in Moscow, and, therefore, I will not comment on this; for me, it is completely unfounded. I also find the comments of Messrs. Bugar [Hungarian Christian Democratic Party chairman], Hagyari [chairman of the Party of Conservative Democrats], Duris [Republican Party chairman], and Mrs. Borzova [deputy chairwoman of the Party of the Democratic Left], for example, totally inappropriate and stupid because they are not verified. For example, Mr. Bugar said that Juraj Molnar delivered a speech at the congress of the Liberal Democratic Party. The truth is that the deputy chairman was not even there. So I suggest that, before making any comments, people check whether the report is first true. [Lach] Mr. Chairman, do you know the whole text of Mr. Molnar's message of greetings to the world congress? [Slota] Molnar said altogether five sentences at the congress. He simply said that all of the Slav nations should unite, and, in particular, the small Slav nations should be protected by the Pan-Slavic group of nations. At the end, he said, of course, that, without great Russia, the Slav nation as such would not exist. I am convinced about this. [passage omitted] [Lach] In this connection, I cannot resist asking about your opinion. It is known that Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should come for a private visit to Slovakia on 16-19 April. We know that many countries expelled him. What is your view about Mr. Zhirinovskiy's visit because there is talk that the SNS--now I will exaggerate--is responsible for it. [Slota] All I can say about this is that it is just as new for me as it is for you that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is supposed to be here between 16 and 19 April. I can unequivocally say that neither our deputy chairman nor the SNS has anything to do with the visit. I do not know who invited him privately. I personally think that, because we are such a democratic country, as everyone keeps saying--at the moment we have the most democratic government ever--I do not see any reason that we should be taken aback by the fact that Mr. Zhirinovskiy will come for a private visit to Slovakia. It can happen, for instance, that, in democratic elections, Mr. Zhirinovskiy will be elected president of Russia. I am not quite sure whether, if the new president wanted to visit Slovakia, we would be taken aback by that as well. I can only be surprised. [passage omitted]
