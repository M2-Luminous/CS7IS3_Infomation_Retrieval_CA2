FR941006-1-00075 FR941006-1-00015 Regardless of what other changes might be made, the Commission is considering whether the IAR should be made public at the time it is sent to the committee. If this were done, the Commission's ``sunshine'' rules might require a public discussion of the IAR, unless the document met other criteria requiring closed discussion under 11 CFR 2.4. The Commission recognizes that committees may prefer that the preliminary repayment calculation, which is now contained in the IAR, not be publicly released, because the amount of the requested repayment may be substantially altered prior to the issuance of the FAR or the final repayment determination. On the other hand, publicly releasing the IAR could encourage committees to address issues at an earlier point, rather than waiting until the later stages of the audit and repayment processes, as now sometimes occurs. If the decision is made to release the IAR, the revised rules would note that the repayment sought could be adjusted upwards or downwards, based on any subsequent information. Finally, the Commission is considering whether, in those audits that lead to enforcement actions, the enforcement process should begin at an earlier point, such as by making reason to believe findings when the IAR is issued. This would permit the investigation to proceed concurrently with the audit and repayment processes, so that the final repayment determination and statement of reasons could be issued when the enforcement matter is concluded. The Commission already has begun to initiate enforcement actions at an earlier point, in appropriate cases. However, it may prove difficult, if not impossible, to formulate a specific policy that would apply equitably to all audits as to when the enforcement process should begin and when it should be completed. The Commission would not want the completion of the audit and repayment processes to be delayed because the enforcement action is still underway. Also, in some situations, it may not be possible for the Commission to open an enforcement matter before it issues a final repayment determination, if that determination constitutes the Commission's earliest analysis of whether certain actions may constitute violations. Thus the current case-by-case approach may prove to be the best alternative. 3. Administrative Record The Commission also has prepared new sections 9007.7 and 9038.7 to explain which documents constitute the administrative record for purposes of judicial review of final determinations regarding candidate certification, eligibility, ineligibility, and repayment. For example, the administrative record includes documents and other supporting evidence on which the Commission's decision is based such as the candidate agreement, matching fund submissions, Interim Audit Report, NOCO statement, the Final Audit Report, transcript of the committee's oral presentation, the final repayment determination, statements of reasons, and the certifications of Commission votes. On the other hand, the Commission has never considered the administrative record to include documents in the files of individual Commissioners, or documents in FEC employees' files which do not constitute a basis for the Commission's decisions. It would also not be appropriate to include in the administrative record transcripts or tapes of Commission discussions of audit or repayment matters. Although these materials may sometimes be made available under the Freedom of Information and Government in the Sunshine Acts, they do not provide an adequate explanation of the reasons for the Commission's decisions because they represent pre-decisional discussions. Documents properly subject to privileges such as an attorney-client privilege, or items constituting attorney work product, would also not be made part of the administrative record. The Commission welcomes comments regarding the types of documents and materials that should or should not be considered part of the administrative record. D. Applicability of the Debt Collection Act to the Certification Process The Debt Collection Act, 31 U.S.C. 3701 et seq. [``DCA''], at section 3716, authorizes the practice of administrative offset, whereby amounts owed to the Government may be deducted from amounts due from the Government to a debtor if certain requirements are met. This means, for example, that the Commission could obtain repayments from certain publicly funded campaigns that have failed to make timely restitution of improperly-utilized public funds, if that candidate qualified for public funding in a future election cycle.
