This opinion was set out in an interview Mikhail Poltoranin, member of the "Russia's Choice" faction of deputies and chairman of the Committee for Information Policy in the State Duma, gave to an ITAR-TASS correspondent. In his view, following the release of the "Lefortovo" inmates, "the president must not slacken his grip on the reins of power, otherwise the carriage of Russian statehood could go off the rails." For his part, the former KGB head, Vadim Bakatin, speaking from political and professional experience, forecasts that "in the present circumstances many of the Lefortovo inmates will rush to whip up the crowd to act against the president." If events turn out that way, he suggests, the force of the law will have to be applied at once to political adventurists.
