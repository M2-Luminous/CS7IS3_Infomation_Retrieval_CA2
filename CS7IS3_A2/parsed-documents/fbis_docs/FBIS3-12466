What are the expected repercussions of the massacre for the negotiations and the peace process? ['Abbas] What the Israeli settlers have done is a major obstacle in the way of the peace process and reflects the wishes and views of those settlers who rejected the peace process from the beginning out of the belief that it endangers their own interests. They see it undermining their beliefs and the illusions they entertained for decades about "greater Israel." That is why, since the signing of the Declaration of Principles agreement and the start of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, they have been provoking the Palestinian population and, in doing so, taking advantage of the privileges they got from the Israeli Government, namely full armament and freedom of movement in the West Bank and the Gaza strip while the Palestinians are forbidden to carry arms and are faced with curfews and movement restrictions. The settlers, enjoying all these freedoms and privileges, of course reject the peace process. That hostile action will have an impact on the Palestinian people. As a matter of principle, we have to say that there has been no crime such as that abominable crime committed by those settlers for many years. It (the Hebron massacre) is of the same magnitude as the Kafr Qasim, Qibyah, and Dayr Yasin massacres, and other massacres committed by the Zionist gangs in the past, crimes now committed and carried out by the settlers militias. We must here hold the Israeli Government responsible because it gave the settler these liberties and because it has special militias. I do not know why a government which has an army, a police force, and security forces needs militias to "protect" those settlers. If it believes that their presence is abnormal, why keep them where they are? Furthermore, why have settlements which have been deemed unnecessary by the United Nations, the whole world, and a large number of Israelis? When (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq) Rabin himself speaks of political settlements and security settlements, he means to say that some of these settlements are unnecessary. We do not believe that the solution to this problem is to be found in the statements and resolutions of condemnation nor in the messages of condolences sent by the Israeli officials. The solution lies in effective measures to disarm the settlers and reassess many settlements which present daily provocations and cause direct friction between the Palestinian and Israeli people, until such a time when settlement as a whole would end, for, in our view, it was unnecessary to begin with. [Khashanah] Do you believe that the revival of the intifadah, with the old thrust and even more strongly, would weaken the negotiation trend or strengthen the position of the Palestinian negotiators? ['Abbas] The intifadah was initiated against the occupation and it will continue as long as the occupation continues, and it will grow day after day whenever massacres such as the Hebron al-Ibrahimi mosque massacre are committed and as long as other tragedies befall the Palestinian people. It is an expression of the Palestinian people's determination to end the occupation. If the Israeli Government wants to coexist with the Palestinians, it must eliminate all the causes of friction and provocation which are real obstacles and barriers in the way of the peace process. [Khashanah] Will the Palestinian suspension of the negotiations continue until the PLO's request for disarmament of the settlers and freezing of the settlements is granted? ['Abbas] We have summoned the heads of the Palestinian negotiating delegations to leadership headquarters in Tunis for consultation on the measures to be taken in the wake of that massacre. [Khashanah] Will a Palestinian delegation go to Washington in response to President Clinton's invitation addressed to the PLO and Israel? ['Abbas] In principle, I see no objection to acceptance of the invitation, but before the (Palestinian) leadership says yes or no, we must have answers to many important inquiries handed by brother Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat] to the U.S. ambassador in Tunis. [Khashanah] Such as? ['Abbas] The purpose of moving the negotiations to Washington, the level of the delegations to the negotiations, and other matters. [Khashanah] Have you noticed that the number of Palestinians killed under this current Labor government is more than the number of those killed under Likud? That casts heavy shadows on the declared peaceful intentions of the ruling Labor Party. ['Abbas] If we look at the general historical course of events and examine the Arab-Israeli conflict developments, we would notice that the Labor Party controlled the Jewish Agency in the early days and it still does, and it was the Labor Party which founded the state of Israel and fought the 1956, 1967, and 1973 wars against the Arabs. It was also the Labor Party which started the settlements, killed the fedayeen and crush their bones in full view of the whole world. But we are dealing with a state and an institution which, if it differs under different governments on some issues, is always in agreement on many other issues.
