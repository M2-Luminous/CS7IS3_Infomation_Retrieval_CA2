From the outside one got the impression that Ukraine was ready to intervene in order to prevent a second round. L. Kravchuk received special authorization, and Ukrainian nationalists urged him on to use force. If he had given in and had not allowed for the resolution of the Crimean question "from the inside," an outpouring of political emotions and confrontations with the participation of the Black Sea fleet would have become inevitable. As a member of the Duma committee on matters pertaining to the CIS, I decided to travel to Kiev and Crimea, and to look at the whole situation on the spot. The trip was a private one, since our committee at that point had not been able to work out a common position. Indecisiveness reigned in Kiev--that very condition in which the most serious mistakes are allowed to occur. Sensible Ukrainian politicians understood that the unwillingness of Crimeans to live as before was so strong that changing the situation would be possible only by force--force that was not there, since Ukraine as a state found itself on the verge of catastrophe, on the threshold of a possible explosion of social discontent. On the eve of the new elections, when the Ukrainian state would inevitably have to change its orientation, the politicians in Kiev found themselves unwilling to take upon themselves the responsibility for forcible pressure on Crimea and a possible armed conflict. Bagrov, who had been Kiev's favorite going into the past elections, had in the past been a pro-Russian pioneer and, essentially, of Crimea's anti-Ukrainian orientation. But having worked for a bit under the new conditions, he grasped the realities and thought it advisable to stand up for the unity of Ukraine--with Crimea as a component part of it. With this pragmatic position of his, he identified himself with Ukraine, and lost the support of the population in almost total measure. In Kiev, Meshkov was viewed as a protege of imperial forces, a separatist, ready to violate the integrity of the Ukrainian state. In actual fact, the situation was much more complicated. Meshkov found himself a hostage to an idea: He demanded decisive actions for the obtaining of independence, and he agitated for a referendum on the restoration of the Crimean Constitution, which was adopted in May 1992. But already as he was taking part in the elections, he realized that immediately incorporating Crimea into Russia was impossible. Meshkov understood that Crimea's rapprochement with Russia would not happen all at once, but in stages, and would most likely take place not at all in the form of a separation from Ukraine and entry into Russia. Crimea could become that locomotive that pulls Ukraine toward Russia, aiding in their rapprochement. And that was why, directly after the first round of voting, Meshkov made the appropriate announcement. Bagrov played on this, saying: "See--there is no alternative to my way!", which compelled Meshkov again to emphasize his radicalism. As a result, from the outside one got the impression that this was an irresponsible person who was grasping for power, a person who would quickly proclaim Crimea's independence. And further on, Ukraine would answer with forcible methods, and a war would start. In fact, Meshkov has no program that differs from Bagrov's. He proposes different methods. Bagrov trod only those paths that had been trampled smooth by the party nomenklatura: He traveled to Kiev, reported on everything, and supposed that the matter was in the bag. And when parliament did not approve or did not carry out the arrangement, it came as a surprise to him. But Meshkov and other opponents believe that it is necessary to seek to achieve not arrangements, but the adoption of corresponding laws; it is necessary to make a break and to forge ahead. This is an objective contradiction, which cannot be avoided in this changing world. Of course, a changing of the guard must take place from time to time. I met with many very highly placed bureaucrats of Bagrov's team. And they gave me to understand that they were tired of Bagrov: That was it; they could do no more. It was not that Meshkov was better, but simply that they had had enough of Bagrov. Another segment felt that Bagrov was losing the reins, that power was slipping away and was already switching over to other banners. As a result, even before Meshkov's victory, the level of control in Bagrov's team approached zero. Meshkov gave me the impression of being a rather well-bred person. He tries to act like, and copies the behavior of, "decisive" people, who can bang their fists on the table. But he is a mild person, and one feels a pose, an artificiality, in his decisiveness. Some seek to alarm us, saying: "He is a Crimean Zhirinovskiy!" Nothing of the kind. It is another matter that the motives for voting for Meshkov are the same as those of the Russian population for voting for Zhirinovskiy. If one gets rid of Meshkov, a Zhirinovskiy will be there next, because that is precisely the mood in Crimea. Bagrov sits in the luxurious building of the Supreme Council; I met with Meshkov in a not overly clean, unfurnished room in the Veterans Union. He was guarded by Afghan veterans with submachine guns; these guys sat around in everyday sweaters. None of them wore jackets or ties. A completely different atmosphere. There is some kind of political fanatic on his team, but there are also former political prisoners, members of the local intelligentsia, and so on. It would be a mistake to expect of him the same as from Zhirinovskiy. The people surrounding Meshkov understand the complexity of the problems and are willing not to be in a hurry, to act together with Ukraine and Russia without any extravagant steps. They understand the needs of the population and are ready to move in that direction--understanding the difficulties, they are prepared to act with moderation. But it is immediately apparent that they cannot deal with the situation. They will not know how to work with the apparat. Bagrov is surrounded by a very bad circle: It includes many corrupted bureaucrats and mafiosi. And here come young people, who want to realize their program by honest means, not behind the scenes, not over the telephone, but in a normal way, through the legislature. They are planning to struggle with corruption, but economic monsters have already sucked onto power there. What are the new politicians to do? Needless to say, a panic begins. I can understand Meshkov, hiding behind submachine guns. After all, how many political figures and entrepreneurs have been killed! I do not rule out the possibility that a disruption of production and an outflow of capital will begin in Crimea. Now let us imagine that Meshkov really does conduct a referendum with strict formulations on the status of Crimea. I do not think that the Ukrainian Government will embark on any kind of resolute actions. One scenario, however, is possible, where the Ukrainian National Self-Defense Organization would send its detachments there. Then a catastrophe would be inevitable. There is enough militia presence summoned from Galician parts, and there are extreme nationalists there--both Ukrainian and Russian. Clashes take place with Crimean Tatars, who are prepared to act in the most resolute manner. In such a situation there are enough sparks to start a Dniester region. And a Dniester region in Crimea would be horrifying, if only because the Black Sea fleet is no 14th Army. A catastrophe could happen here. Neither Ukraine nor Russia could remain uninvolved, even if they very much wanted to. The Cossacks would come in from Russia, and the Zaporozhtsy would come in from Ukraine. And after them, like it or not, our tanks and Ukrainian tanks.... Just one gaffe in Meshkov's behavior, or Bagrov's refusal to participate in the power structures, could provoke a serious conflict in Crimea. Russia would do well to act as an active mediator and avert hasty actions. It would be possible to make an announcement that would restrain the population from making extreme demands, and this would allow Meshkov to save face. It would be possible to try, on the one hand, to convince the former executive power to deal with the new president and the new realities. To propose some kind of paths that would inspire the confidence of Ukraine, to prepare Ukrainian dialogue with Moscow. Moscow's moderation in its demands of Crimea, and a refusal to carry out the decisions of the former Supreme Soviet--even without their formal repeal--would create the prerequisites for the rapprochement of Ukraine and Russia. That would help support stability in Crimea.
