FBIS4-56438 "drlat086_f_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 El Salvador Minister: Joint U.S. Operation May Be Suspended Minister: Joint U.S. Operation May Be Suspended PA0405041094 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0130 GMT 4 May 94 PA0405041094 Mexico City NOTIMEX Spanish BFN [Text] San Salvador, 3 May (NOTIMEX) -- Today, Humberto Corado, Salvadoran defense and public security minister, said the second phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos, conducted jointly with the U.S. Army, could be suspended should legal action materialize. The minister added that President Alfredo Cristiani and the Armed Forces will accept a Supreme Court of Justice (CSJ) decision should it rule that the presence of U.S. troops in the country indeed violates the Constitution. The first phase of Operation Fuertes Caminos began in August 1993, but the Bar Association of El Salvador filed a suit in the CSJ, claiming the joint operation was unconstitutional because the presence of U.S. troops violates the Constitution. The first phase of the operation ended in December 1993, but the CSJ has yet to make a decision. The second phase began on 1 May with the presence of 400 soldiers -- U.S. engineers -- and a similar number of Salvadoran military personnel. Official sources said Fuertes Caminos is designed to construct a number of structures, including schools, roads, and water wells, structures that will benefit about 50,000 Salvadorans who live in rural areas. The projects are being carried out in the hamlets of Miraflores and San Juan Nonualco, La Paz Department, 5 km west of San Salvador. The defense minister added that the projects will continue for as long as the CSJ fails to issue a ruling. The projects are scheduled to end on 20 August. The U.S. Government is financing Fuertes Caminos at a cost of $1.5 million. It was reported in San Salvador that 1,147 tons of equipment and provisions to furnish the joint operation have been unloaded in the port of Acajutla, east of San Salvador. Corado pointed out that some of the equipment brought by the U.S. soldiers will be donated to the Salvadoran Armed Forces.
