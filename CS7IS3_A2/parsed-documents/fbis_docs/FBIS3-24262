Gracheva: "Innovative Activity of Russian Industrial Enterprises in 1992-1993 (According to the Results of a Survey of 120 Industrial Enterprises in Russia's European Part)"--material prepared by the "Russian Economic Barometer" bulletin] [Text] The dynamics and specific characteristics of innovative activity are important indicators necessary for the study of transitional processes. Such an activity forms the basis for structural shifts and long-term economic growth. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Innovative Activity of Russian Enterprises (share of enterprises ca-| |rrying out innovations in 1992-1993 in % of the total number of surveyed ent-| |erprises) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Innovative Quota | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Entire industry* |64 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Manufacturing industry |66 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector I (consumer goods) |58 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector II (investment goods) |71 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector III (intermediate goods) |75 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |*It includes the fuel industry, electric power engineering, and the manufact-| |uring industry. | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The innovative activity of Russian industrial enterprises on the basis of the results of 1993, both as compared with their activity in 1990-1992 and with their own expectations expressed at the beginning of 1993, was obviously stirred up (two previous innovative tests were performed by the "Russian Economic Barometer" in November 1992 and in February 1993). Almost one-half of the respondents, which at the beginning of 1993 did not intend to carry out innovations, by the end of the year changed their intentions. At the same time, out of those that at the beginning of 1993 intended to carry out innovations only one-twelfth of the respondents abandoned their plans. On the average, the increase in the innovative quota (that is, the innovators' share in the total number of surveyed enterprises), as compared with 1990-1992, made up 9 percent points and, as compared with the expectations for 1993, 16 percent points. The shift occurred mainly owing to the activation of enterprises of sector III and, in part, of enterprises of sector I. At the same time, the innovative activity of sector II remained at the previous level. As the experience of other countries conducting innovative surveys (for example, East Germany) shows, a sharp increase in innovative activity is a characteristic sign of a transitional economy. Although in our case (Russia) further research is still needed to confirm the correctness of such a conclusion. The distribution of innovations carried out in 1992-1993 into two main types--PRODUCT-INNOVATIONS (innovations or significant improvements in produced products) and PROCESS-INNOVATIONS (innovations or significant improvements in production processes)--on the basis of the results of the fall survey looks as follows: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2. Types of Innovations (in % of the total number of enterprises carry-| |ing our innovations in 1992-1993) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Primarily Product-Innova-|Primarily Process-Innova-| | |tions |tions | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Entire industry |65 |35 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Manufacturing industry |68 |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector I |76 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector II |76 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Sector III |52 |48 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As compared with the two previous surveys, a marked shift toward product-innovations can be noted in sector I of the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser degree, in sector III. In sector II the ratio of the two types of innovations did not change. On the whole, an intensified introduction of innovations or improvements in products of sectors producing consumer and intermediate goods was the basic motive force in the stirring up of the innovative activity of the Russian industry in 1993. The hierarchy of goals pursued during the implementation of various types of innovations looks as follows: Table 3. Goals of Product-Innovations (distribution of answers of enterprises carrying out innovations in 1992-1993 in %)* Goals Entire Manufacturing Sector I Sector Sector Industry Industry II III 1. 36 36 30 43 36 Modification of already produced products 2. Output of 60 60 70 57 50 new products within the framework of basic sphere of activity 3. Output of 29 29 26 38 23 new products beyond the scope of basic sphere of activity *Respondents could indicate all the goals important from their point of view. Table 4. Goals of Process-Innovations (distribution of answers of enterprises carrying out innovations in 1992-1993 in %)* Goals Entire Manufacturing Sector Sector Sector Industry Industry I II III 1. Increase in 47 45 33 53 47 production flexibility 2. Reduction in 55 57 50 67 53 specific costs (labor-, materials-, and power-intensiveness) 3. Improvement in 17 18 17 13 24 working conditions 4. Reduction in the 13 14 33 0 12 load on the environment *Respondents could indicate all the goals important from their point of view. According to these parameters of innovative activity, Russian industrial enterprises have demonstrated quite a marked unanimity. Both in industry as a whole and in individual sectors enterprises carry out product-innovations primarily in order to change over to the output of new products, remaining within their basic sector. The output of substitutes for previously produced goods is second in importance and the output of products exceeding the scope of the basic sector, that is, diversification, is third. The diversification rating in sector II, which is higher as compared with other sectors, is noteworthy. Probably, this is connected with the development of the conversion of machine building defense enterprises. The introduction of labor-, materials-, and energy-saving technologies is the main priority during the implementation of process-innovations for the entire industry and for its individual sectors. An increase in production flexibility is in the second place, an improvement in working conditions, in the third place, and a reduction in the load on the environment, in the last place. If the comparison of Russia and Germany in the hierarchy of goals in the implementation of innovations is continued, it can be noted that in the goals of product-innovations there is an approximate correspondence among them, whereas in process-innovations there is a marked difference. In Germany (both in western and in eastern lands) an increase in production flexibility, not a reduction in costs, is the most important goal. In Russia, however, this trend is only in the second place. What causes such a difference? In our opinion, the fact that the Russian industry is characterized by serious technological backwardness, primarily in sectors producing consumer goods. As a result, the labor-, materials-, and power-intensiveness of production is much higher here than in developed countries. As domestic prices of raw and basic materials and energy carriers approach world prices, the noncompetitiveness of Russian goods is manifested ever more sharply. Increasing the "degree of contemporaneity" of applied technologies and bringing them up to the level already existing in developed countries are the most urgent problems in this situation. Thus, Russian enterprises primarily see to it that the opportunities provided for modern technologies for the economy of the scale in the mass production of standard products be utilized fully. For companies in countries with a developed market economy all this is an already traversed stage. An increase in efficiency through the diversity of products and selection of the optimum variation of the scale in the small-series production of differentiated products is the main imperative here. That is why they see the basic goal of their process-innovations in the introduction of flexible module technologies capable of a quick reorientation toward meeting the demand placed by the present-day, highly segmented market. The structure of output from the standpoint of the "life cycle" of goods, that is, proportions among products in various phases of this cycle (entry into the market, growth, stagnation, and reduction), is an important characteristic of the efficiency of innovations. Table 5. Structure of Output According to Phases of the "Life Cycle" (the entire sample in % of the real production volume) Phases Entire Manufacturing Sector I Sector Sector Industry Industry II III I--of entry 25 25 28 24 19 into the market (new products, the production of which was begun in 1992-1993) II--of 13 13 14 15 9 growth (products produced prior to 1992, the output of which grew in 1993) III--of 38 38 39 45 28 stagnation (products produced prior to 1992, the output of which was stable in 1993) IV--of 24 24 19 16 44 reduction (products produced prior to 1992, the output of which dropped in 1993) Total 100 100 100 100 100 In order to ensure a long-term survival on the market, enterprises must form the structure of their products so that they can reach two main goals. First, to promptly replace obsolete goods, which must be modified or removed from production in the very near future. From this point of view the difference between the shares of output in phases I and IV is important. This difference should be positive--the bigger it is, the better. Second, it is necessary to ensure a stable income for the financing of the activity of an enterprise as a whole and of innovative activity in particular. From this point of view the sum of shares of output in phases II and III, that is, output which has already gained recognition on the market, is important. As the experience of German companies shows, the share of such output should be no less than two-thirds. In most Russian enterprises the first indicator (the balance between phases I and IV) is at a minimally favorable level. It makes up +1 percent point in the entire industry and the manufacturing industry, +9 percent points in sector I, and +8 percent points in sector II. Sector III, where the balance is very unfavorable, that is, -25 percent points, constitutes an exception. The second indicator is at an acceptable level only in sector II (60 percent). In the other sectors (53 percent in I and 37 percent in III) and throughout the industry (51 percent) it is too low. This means that in the current transitional situation in Russian enterprises the share of the least promising, obsolete goods (in phase IV--the reduction phase) is dangerously high and they are forced to maintain, as a minimum, such a high share of goods in phase I (entry into the market). Goods entering the market can be the most promising. At the same time, however, their production is connected with the greatest risk (since their profitability has not been demonstrated definitively) and with considerable capital investments in production and the marketing system. The length of the "cycle of birth" of product-innovations, that is, of the period elapsing from the appearance of the idea of the output of a new or improved product until the beginning of its series output, is another important indicator characterizing the intensity of innovative activity in industry. Table 6. Length of the "Cycle of Birth" of a Product (in % of the total number of surveyed enterprises) Entire Manufacturing Sector I Sector Sector Industry Industry II III Less than 1 44 45 64 28 41 year From 1 to 3 42 42 36 48 44 years From 3 to 5 10 8 - 21 4 years 5 years and 4 5 - 3 11 longer Average length 22 21 13 26 25 of the cycle (months) According to survey data, the "cycle of birth" in the Russian industry is quite short--from 13 months in sectors producing consumer goods to 26 months in sectors producing investment goods. By comparison, in Germany's western lands, on the average, in the manufacturing industry it is 27 months (similar data on Germany's eastern lands are not available). Such high efficiency of Russian enterprises in bringing new or improved products to the market can be attributed to the fact that in the current situation in their innovative activity they adhere primarily to an imitative, overtaking strategy, introducing goods that have already attained success on the world market. Such goods represent innovations for Russia alone and demand from enterprises mainly expenditures on experimental and design research and development. However, in developed countries an attacking, offensive strategy is the predominant direction in the innovative activity of industrial companies. It requires substantial expenditures on scientific research--on applied, as well as basic, research. For example, almost one-half of the innovations carried out by West German companies involve patent registration. There are no similar data on the degree of the patent protection of product-innovations in Russian enterprises. However, data on the degree of participation of professional scientific research organizations in innovations carried out by enterprises can serve as an indirect confirmation of the weak radical nature of innovations. Table 7. Sources of Research and Development Serving as the Basis for Innovations (in % of the total number of enterprises carrying out innovations in 1992-1993) Entire Manufacturing Sector I Sector Sector Industry Industry II III Enterprises 93 93 100 90 88 themselves Scientific 7 7 - 10 12 research firms including state 3 3 - 5 4 private 4 4 - 5 8 The virtually complete confinement of Russian enterprises to their own research and development is due not only to the acute shortage of financial resources (about which most respondents complain). Russia's industry faces the need, primarily, "to digest" what is already known: To bring the parameters and design of its products closer to the standards of developed countries, to master goods elementary for the Western market, but absent on the Russian market, and to reorient the production of traditional goods to new raw and basic materials (this concerns especially products of the consumer sector). During this period the decline in the interest of enterprises in radical, offensive innovations is quite natural. It is only a pity that the collapse of Russian science can come before enterprises make the demand for basic and applied scientific research. This circumstance should be created by state bodies. Weaknesses have the habit of accumulating more rapidly than advantages. Therefore, shortcomings of the imitative strategy can have a serious effect on the future competitiveness of the Russian industry. The shortage of financial resources, which holds back the implementation of innovations, is aggravated by the emerging distancing of Russian banks from industry (distancing, we will note, also quite natural under conditions of our inflationary transitional economy). This is expressed in the fact that commercial banks primarily credit intermediate trade, not industrial, enterprises and are extremely reluctant to give long-term credit for industrial investment projects, in particular those connected with innovations.

Enterprises 48 46 56 28 52 that did not try to receive any innovation credit The sum of numbers in individual columns in lines 1.1 and 1.2 is bigger than that of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 1 and the sum of numbers in individual columns in lines 2.1 and 2.2 is bigger than that of the numbers in corresponding columns in line 2, since some enterprises noted the receipt or nonreceipt of both types of credit. As can be seen from Table 8, during the solution of the problem concerning the financing of innovations almost one-half of Russian enterprises did not even try to receive a bank loan and out of those that applied for bank services only a little more than one-fourth attained success. Naturally, the demand for goal-oriented state credits--at favorable rates--was higher than for commercial credits at market interest rates. Accordingly, enterprises, usually, were denied the first type of credit--the ratio between those that received and did not receive a loan among those that applied for state credit averaged 1:4 (from 1:11 in sector I to 1:1.5 in sector II) and among those that applied for commercial credit, 1:2 (from 1:3 in sector I to 1:1 in sector II). Enterprises of sectors producing investment goods were the main recipients of innovation credits (they accounted for more than one-half of those that received loans of both types), while enterprises of sectors producing intermediate and consumer goods in the process of the financing of innovations were "displaced" to a considerable extent from the credit market, which is narrow as it is, and were forced to rely mainly on themselves.
