Hata told a regularly scheduled news conference that Japan will continue using various channels to persuade North Korea to allow iaea experts to perform complete inspections at key nuclear sites. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is expected to encourage China to urge Pyongyang to accept full international inspections during a visit to Beijing over the weekend. China is regarded as having more sway over North Korea than any other country. Speaking to members of his cabinet, Hosokawa said he expects to see various developments over the next week amid a flurry of regional diplomacy, according to government officials. "I will be visiting China, and South Korean President Kim Yong- sam will visit Japan and China," he said. On Monday, the IAEA is to hold a special meeting of its board of governors to formally assess its inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities. If the IAEA meeting declares North Korea in breach of nuclear safeguard accords, the matter would be referred to the UN Security Council, which might impose economic sanctions on Pyongyang. The Vienna-based UN nuclear watchdog said earlier this week that Pyongyang barred a team of its inspectors from carrying out "important measures" at a radiochemical laboratory in Yongbyon, which the IAEA regards as a nuclear reprocessing plant. Western countries have long been suspicious that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. Pyongyang denies the allegations.
