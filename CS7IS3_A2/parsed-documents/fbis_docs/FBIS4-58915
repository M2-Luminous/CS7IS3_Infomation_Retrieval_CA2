The brother chairman regretted the victims of the ongoing fighting against the rebels in the YSP leadership. He said that the blood that was shed is Yemeni blood and dear to all of us. Addressing the people's deputies at the House of Representatives this morning, the brother chairman said: Our Yemeni people, who offered thousands of martyrs to defend the republican system, will offer more sacrifices to maintain unity. He said: Separation is impossible. We will not move an inch from unity, regardless of the price. The brother chairman announced the rejection of any mediation effort or call aimed at bringing into our country any Arab or international forces. He said: What is taking place in Yemen is an internal affair and an issue that concerns the Yemenis. We are not two states or two regimes, but one state, one people, and one republican system. The ongoing fighting is taking place against Yemeni elements who fomented sedition in the society and rebelled against the constitutional legitimacy. They bear responsibility for their acts and mistakes. But, as for the unionists in the YSP, they are the object of our respect, pride, and love. He added: Our unionist enterprise is to build a new Yemen on the basis of a democratic and multi-party political system, where the constitution and law are enforced. We want to build the state of law and order, social progress, and of genuine, comprehensive progress, away from flowery speeches, slogans, lies, and deception. He indicated that our valiant Armed Forces are now scoring major successes and chasing the forces of rebellion and secession to force them to surrender to the people's will, legitimacy, and national consensus. The brother chairman urged the House of Representatives, and through it the masses of our Yemeni people, to maintain public order, abide by the law, and prevent chaos. He said: We highly appreciate our great Yemeni people's endurance and patience, which has lasted for a period of approximately nine months since the beginning of the political crisis fabricated by the secessionists in the YSP leadership when al-Bid returned to Aden. Relaxation is imminent. The outcome will be favorable, God willing. In his address to the House of Representatives, the brother president reviewed all the developments that have taken place in our country since the fabrication of the crisis on 19 August 1993. He also reviewed the role that the separatist elements in the YSP leadership under al-Bid had in leading the country to the current regrettable situation. He described the concessions that have been made to end the crisis, maintain unity, and spare the people and the homeland problems, troubles, and affliction. The president said: However, the secessionist elements in the YSP continued to work to escalate the crisis and promote its repercussions in the military and information spheres. These elements brought the military situation to a head beginning with the Abyan events on the eve of the signing of the Pledge and Accord Agreement in Amman; through the Shabwah, (Harth Sufyan), and 'Imran events; and finally igniting the fire in Dhamar with the Ba Suhayb Brigade and against the Central Security men in Aden and the 2d Armored Brigade at al-Rahah. The president said: We did not want matters to go this far, but the rebellious secessionist elements continued to be arrogant and intransigent, working to provoke sedition and bring conditions all over the homeland to the point of explosion. The president alluded to the YSP secessionist elements' crimes of plundering public funds and of financial and administrative corruption, noting actions by Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun and a number of other secessionist elements from the YSP leadership who took $375 million from the al-Masilah oil revenues illegally and deposited them in private accounts of their own after having doubled the price of the construction of the al-Masilah oil pipeline in an illegal way and without consulting constitutional establishments. The brother president reviewed the development of the crisis, alluding to the dialogues following the parliamentary election on constitutional amendments and the YSP demands to improve the drafting of some articles in the draft amendments concerning the form of the state presidency, the local government, and the third article of the constitution. However, [word indistinct] imposed new conditions represented by [word indistinct] draft that was agreed on. We accepted the political dialogue and the Pledge and Accord Document was completed. We accepted this in order to prevent the implementation of the plot to dismember the homeland, despite the fact that it contained 75 percent of the YSP demands. However, the YSP was not convinced. The secessionist elements continued to implement their scheme of returning the homeland to what it was before 22 May 1990. They continued to present impossible conditions and refused to accept any mediation efforts. We said: Let us begin with the two basic points in the Pledge and Accord Document; namely, arresting elements accused of sabotage and disturbing security, and withdrawing military units from the previous borders. The president said: But they rejected this. Then we discovered that their demands were only a cover to circumvent the results of the parliamentary elections and implement the plot of secession. This was proven by the fact that elements accused of sabotage and explosions, whose names were placed on the list of of persons to be arrested, were in alliance with the YSP and were fighting among its ranks, paying them money and giving them arms to practice deception. The explosions, the kidnapping of foreigners, and the banditry have been revealed to be the work of the intelligence forces of the YSP in order to terrify unionist elements in the party and force them to leave Sanaa in order to implement the secessionist plot for which al-Bid had been working. He continued to escalate the crisis after reaping the fruits of the crisis. The brother chairman of the Presidential Council added that after the elections, the YSP was offered many concessions to participate in assuming power, despite the fact that it came in third. He pointed out that the YSP continued to practice media deception and kept harping on a state of law and order, at a time when large amounts of weapons were found at the headquarters of the Central Committee in Sanaa. The weapons included more than 400 pieces of equipment, 350 RPG's, and [word indistinct] missiles, and other weapons. This is the cultural scheme of the YSP. The brother chairman added that what happened in 'Imran was part of a series of incidents meant to ignite the military situation in order to destroy the 1st Armored Brigade and then destroy the city of 'Imran and march on Sanaa to topple the regime of the state of unity and constitutional legitimacy. He pointed out that the martyrs and victims who fell in that regrettable fighting are the victims of the policy of the elements that have not learned their lesson since the inception of the YSP. Brother Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives, earlier welcomed brother Lt. Gen. 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council, commending his attendance of the House's session to brief the House on the facts since the inception of the crisis. The House discussed the latest developments in the country. The discussions of the deputies of the people, including the deputies attending for the parliamentary bloc of the YSP, asserted that the members of the House represent the entire Yemeni people in accordance with the Constitution and the constitutional oath taken by the deputies at the first session of the elected House of Representatives. The people's deputies, of various political and party persuasions, stressed adherence to constitutional legitimacy and Yemeni unity and national unity, at whatever cost. The deputies were also unanimous that they are against those who undermine the democratic approach and against those who seek separation. The House of Representatives also stressed that the current war is not a civil war but a war between constitutional legitimacy and those who have abrogated it. The deputies' remarks also stressed that it is important for the security agencies to maintain public security and safeguard public and private funds and the safety of the citizens, regardless of their political persuasion. Afterward, the House formed a committee from its members, including the bloc of the General People's Congress, the YSP bloc, the Yemeni Reform Grouping bloc and the bloc of the independents. The committee will present views to the House on the current developments in the country. At the outset of the session, the House of Representatives reviewed the minutes of its previous session, to which the House statement issued on 5 May 1994 is attached. The two were approved unanimously. The House of Representatives will resume its sessions tomorrow morning, God willing.
