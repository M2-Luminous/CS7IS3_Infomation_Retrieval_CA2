The Foreign Secretary dismissed Eurosceptic fears that the country was moving inexorably towards a European superstate. Instead, the impetus was towards a multispeed Europe in which countries such as Britain would be free to move into the slow lane at will. Mr Hurd told the Scottish Conservative Party conference in Inverness that the "new Europe" would be marked by greater diversity and flexibility. Already, sub-groups of member states worked together on matters of common interest while others stood aloof. Examples included the ERM [Exchange Rate Mechanism] -- where Britain and Italy were no longer members the frontier-free customs union based on the Benelux states, and the Western European Union -- the defence grouping excluding Ireland. Mr Hurd said: "This is a multitrack, multispeed, even multilayered approach which will increasingly be the way of the future. It threatens no one. A more flexible Europe offers more scope to involve countries which are not full members in the activities of the union." Later, speaking to reporters, he spoke of Britain "picking and choosing" from the European menu. Although Mr Hurd denied that he was consigning Britain to the European slow lane -- shorthand for hardline Euroscepticism -- the clear thrust of his message was that the sceptics fears were groundless and that Germany, for instance, was moving Britains way over deregulation and subsidiarity. But these worries still surfaced in the debate as Mr Hurd faced calls for a referendum on a single currency and warnings that if the Government did not heed popular alarm about loss of powers to Brussels it would be "annihilated" in June. The Foreign Secretary contrasted Tory defence of Britains interest in Europe with Labour and Liberal Democrat alleged readiness to accept a federal superstate. He also repeated his warning to the party "not to scratch at old wounds" and concentrate on the Europe of the future. "As strong pro-Europeans we shall campaign on the open trading, deregulating, co-operative Europe which we want. Our opponents will stick to the out-of-date notion that the only good European is one who transfers chunks of power to Brussels at regular intervals until there is one centralised executive and one centralised parliament." Mr Hurd made jobs and the national veto his main themes. The opposition parties would sign the social chapter and throw people out of work. They would abandon the veto and "yield on all points."
