The resolution states that the agreements with Russia were initialed "contrary to the CSCE declaration and the UN resolution on complete and unconditional troop withdrawal." LNNK is of the opinion that initialing these agreements means including Latvia in the sphere of Russian influence, as well as endangering Latvia's sovereignty and the Latvian nation's possibilities to survive. The resolution reads: "By accepting the initialed agreements, Latvia does not resolve the problems connected with troop withdrawal, because Russian Army units remain in Skrunda, as well as in Estonia and Abrene." Therefore, the LNNK board asks the president not to sign the agreements. In addition, the Saeima [parliament] is requested to pass -- in the first place -- a law on the status of foreigners and stateless people, as well as appoint a new delegation to the talks with Russia, which would resolve not only the problem of troop withdrawal, but also such issues as repatriation, emigration, the return of Abrene to Latvia, and compensation for Latvia from Russia, as the legal heir to the USSR. The resolution also requests that the Saeima accept the submitted draft law on a popular referendum, to which a question should be added concerning citizens' opinions on the issue of granting guarantees of social protection to Russian military pensioners. If the Saeima does not satisfy these demands, LNNK will propose a popular ballot for special parliamentary elections. At the LNNK board meeting, candidates for the Riga municipal authorities elections were also chosen. In all, there were 61 candidates confirmed. Their names were not conveyed to the press. As DIENA was told by LNNK Board Member Mirdza Vitola, the decision was not yet final.
