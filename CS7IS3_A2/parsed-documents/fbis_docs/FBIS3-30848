The congress is attended by 830 delegates of Podkrepa structures throughout the country. Fifty-eight leaders of foreign trade union organizations are attending the congress as guests. The delegates were greeted by Enzo Friso, secretary general of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and by Marku Jaskelainen, deputy secretary general of the European Trade Union Confederation. The participants were also greeted by Mr. Kadir Kadir, deputy chairman of the National Assembly (attending the congress in his private capacity), and by Mr. Ahmed Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turks' Movement for Rights and Freedoms, as well as by some MP's. The opening of the congress was not attended by President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov and Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, invited by Podkrepa. No representatives of the Bulgarian Socialist Party were invited because, according to Dr. Trenchev, Podkrepa does not maintain contacts with this party. There were also no representatives of the other major Bulgarian trade union amalgamation -- the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB) with which Podkrepa is in an escalating conflict. Dr. Trenchev believes the KNSB to be an unprincipled and procommunist formation. According to Podkrepa, the Association of Free Trade Unions, led by Asen Chaushev, does not deserve serious attention. The government is unable to solve the enormous problems facing this country and is leading it to disaster, Dr. Trenchev said in his speech. According to him, in such cases it is the duty of the trade unions to undertake nationwide actions. In the two years which have elapsed since the last congress of Podkrepa, the relations between this trade union amalgamation and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) have deteriorated, said Dr. Trenchev who is one of the founders of the SDS. Many delegates at the congress appealed for improving these relations at today's debates. Others stressed that Podkrepa should not commit itself to any political organization. According to Dr. Trenchev, over the past two years the confederation has gained in trade union experience and professionalism and has established democratic decision-making mechanisms. However, the Podkrepa leader also mentioned some shortcomings in the work of the confederation, including conflicts between its regional and branch structures and the failure of the PODKREPA newspaper, conceived as a democratic publication but left in bad hands, Dr. Trenchev said. According to Dr. Trenchev the most important task of the congress is the amendment of the statutes of the confederation. Initially, the independent Podkrepa Trade Union united part of Bulgaria's sci-technical and artistic intelligentsia. It was founded in early 1989 and became a federation that same year. Dr. Konstantin Trenchev is its first chairman and subsequently president. At its congress in 1990 the organization was renamed Podkrepa Labour Confederation and was officially registered under this name in 1993. The decision for holding the Third Congress of Podkrepa was taken at a Confederative Council last September. Statutes, Programme and the Mandate Commissions will work on different organizational issues, including the amendment in principal documents of the confederation. Some sections have not been represented because of failure to present registration documents. The congress is expected to vote 25 resolutions, Dr. Trenchev said at a recent briefing. According to a statement made by him at this briefing, the congress may discuss a decision for calling a general strike aimed at overthrowing the Prime Minister Berov's cabinet. The congress will elect a new leadership.
