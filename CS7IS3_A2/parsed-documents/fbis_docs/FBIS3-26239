FBIS3-26239 "drchi024_n_94013" FBIS-CHI-94-024 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Feb 1994 Economic & Agricultural State Council Adopts Agricultural Development Program HK3101103094 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO in Chinese 19 Jan 94 p 2 HK3101103094 Beijing RENMIN RIBAO Language: Chinese Article Type:BFN ["China's Agricultural Development Program for the Nineties-- Deliberated On and Adopted by the Seventh Executive Meeting of the State Council on 20 August 1993"] [Text] Agriculture is the foundation for economic development, social stability, and national independence. Constantly giving top priority to agricultural development and invigorating the rural economy in all fields is a matter of major importance concerning the overall situation. In the eighties, remarkable achievements were made in our country's agriculture and the major breakthroughs made in the following six aspects created favorable conditions for the acceleration of reform and opening and the accelerated development of the national economy. --Agricultural operations broke through the long-standing old pattern of unified management under a large public ownership system. The double-tiered management system, based mainly on the household output contract system adopted since the beginning of reform and opening, greatly aroused the peasants' initiative and enthusiasm for developing production and emancipated the productive forces in agriculture. --Agricultural production broke through the long-standing situation of slow growth. Between 1980 and 1990, the gross national agricultural output value increased by an average annual rate of 6.4 percent; the outputs of grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, vegetables, fruits, pork, beef, mutton, and aquatic products all increased by big margins; peasant incomes increased by 6.4 percent in comparable terms and peasants, on the whole, had sufficient food and clothing for themselves; and the food supply for urban residents was also greatly enriched. --The rural economic structure broke through the long-standing single-cropping and single-farming pattern. The proportions of forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing increased. Rural industrial enterprises rose as a new force. This gradually changed the situation for more than 30 years past wherein agricultural production was limited to crop farming and crop farming was limited to grain production. --The comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture broke through the long-standing situation of slow growth. Investments made by the central government, the local governments, collectives, and individual peasants totalled 151.9 billion yuan, which was mainly used to strengthen the construction of basic facilities for agricultural production. The flood prevention facilities along major rivers and around major lakes were improved; about 26.7 million hectares of low-yield fields were transformed and 2.5 hectares of wasteland were reclaimed; a large number of production bases for various farm products, improved seeds cultivation bases, and fine breed multiplication bases were set up; the forest coverage rate increased from 12 to 12.9 percent; the ability to monitor and forecast disastrous weather for agriculture was enhanced; and various applicable crop farming, forest-caring, animal farming, and aquicultural techniques were adopted and spread extensively; and the comprehensive grain and cotton production capacities increased from 300 billion kg and 2.5 million tonnes in the early eighties to 425 billion kg and 4.5 million tonnes in the early nineties. The comprehensive meat production capacity was also markedly increased. --The agricultural economy broke through the pattern of a natural economy and the level of commercialization and specialization was greatly enhanced. In the eighties, the central government and various local governments jointly invested nearly 5 billion yuan in building a number of production bases for supplying grain, cotton, meat, and vegetables. The commercialization rate of farm produce increased from 54 to 63 percent and the value of exported farm produce and processed products increased by 150 percent. --Agricultural development broke through the model of single-item development [dang xiang kai fa 0830 7309 7030 4099] and created a new situation of comprehensive development. Beginning in 1988, the state allocated large amounts of money for comprehensive agricultural development projects, mainly aimed at increasing the production of such major products as grain, cotton, oil-bearing crops, meat, and sugar. According to the principle of comprehensively arranging the building of forests, roads, fields, and water channels on plains and hilly land, thus comprehensively utilizing natural resources, 41 comprehensive agricultural development zones were successively set up in the country. They increased the effective supplies of farm produce and played a major role in strengthening the lasting momentum of agricultural development. In the nineties we must stabilize and sustain agricultural development to better satisfy the needs of the high-speed economic growth and the increasingly better-off people in their daily lives. At present, some difficulties still exist in the course of stabilizing and quickening agricultural development in our country. First, agriculture is a sensitive industry, facing both natural and market risks, and is also a basic industry which produces vital social effects but only yields modest economic returns. While the economic structure in our country is changing into a socialist market economy, because the economic control and regulatory mechanisms are imperfect, the economic activities are apt to be driven by immediate economic returns and funds and materials are apt to be placed in nonagricultural fields. This is unfavorable to agricultural development. Second, farmland and other agricultural resources are continuously decreasing but the population is steadily increasing. The load on agriculture is getting heavier and heavier. Third, the material foundation for agriculture remains rather weak, and the capacity to resist natural disasters remains inadequate. Fourth, the economic efficiency of agricultural production is rather low and this affects the peasants' production enthusiasm. Fifth, in trying to progress to a more advanced stage, agricultural production lacks low-cost improved seeds and low-cost new techniques for cultivating improved varieties and breeds with high efficiency; and the technological conditions are not suited to the needs of production development. Therefore, from the long-term and overall point of view, the task of agricultural development in the nineties will be extremely arduous. There still exists great potential for agricultural development in our country. Of the existing over 95 million hectares of farmland, intermediate and low-yield land accounts for about 60 percent. If the soil of such land is properly treated, the per-mu grain output can be increased by several hundred jin. Of the existing grassland, second- and third-class grassland accounts for 80 percent. After being improved, such grassland can feed several times the current number of animals. The per-mu aquatic product output of the current water area is only 95 kg and the return rate of the feed in animal farming is still quite low. After feeding techniques are improved, the meat output can be increased substantially. In the whole country, there are over 33 million hectares of wasteland which could be reclaimed for agricultural purposes. In addition, over 76.7 million hectares of waste hills and slopes, over 1.3 billion hectares of beaches land, and some 12 million hectares of fresh water surface can all be developed and used for agriculture. With the adoption of effective measures and the increase in agricultural input, and with the accelerating comprehensive development of agricultural resources, we will be able to substantially enhance the comprehensive productive capacity of agriculture. I. Objectives and Guidelines for Agricultural Development in the Nineties First, the main objectives of agricultural development in our country in the nineties are to: Comprehensively develop the rural economy, increase production of major agricultural products in a stable manner, and to ensure that their quantity, variety, and quality meet the needs of the comparatively well-off people in the whole country and the needs of the developing national economy. By the year 2000, grain output will reach 500 billion jin; cotton output will reach 5.25 million metric tons; and the production of oil-bearing crops, sugar-bearing crops, and other cash crops, as well as the production of meat and aquatic products, should continuously increase. The rural economy should maintain an appropriate growth rate. In 2000, the gross national agricultural output value (calculated according to 1990 constant prices) will reach 1,210 billion yuan, effecting an average annual increase of about 4 percent. The total output value produced by township and town enterprises throughout the country will reach 5,290 billion yuan (1990 constant prices), increasing by an average annual rate of 18.5 percent. The peasants' living standards will reach the level of being comparatively well-off, with their per capita net income reaching 1,200 yuan and increasing by 5.8 percent each year. The pace of economic development in poor areas will be quickened and the masses there will basically have sufficient food and clothing by the end of this century. Second, the guidelines for agricultural development in the nineties are to: Continue to stabilize the production responsibility system mainly in the form of concluding the household output contracts; continue to improve the double-tier management system which combines individual household operations with unified collective arrangements; greatly develop the community service systems for agriculture; and to gradually build up the strength of the collective economies according to the actual conditions in the various localities. It is necessary to continuously strengthen the agricultural foundation, increase input to agriculture, improve the infrastructural facilities for agriculture, and ensure that agriculture moves up to a new stage and satisfies the needs of the national economy's sustained, rapid, and healthy [chi xu kuai su jian kang 2170 4958 1816 6643 0256 1660] development. The rural reform should be deepened in the light of the requirements of establishing and improving the socialist market economy and the basic facilities and various community service systems in the fields of rural markets, transportation, storage, information, and consultation should be built up more intensively. Agricultural scientific research should be advanced and technological results should be promoted and spread extensively, thus guiding agriculture to develop in the orientation of "high yield, good quality, and high efficiency." Efforts should be made continuously to organize comprehensive agricultural development and the comprehensive agricultural production capacity should be enhanced through the development of such reserve agricultural resources as waste hills, waste slopes, waste water areas, waste beaches, and waste sandy land. The rural production structure and economic structure should be optimized; great efforts should be made to develop agriculture oriented toward export and agriculture should be gradually moved onto the path of "being oriented to the market, more effectively utilizing resources, optimizing the structure, and enhancing the efficiency." Crop farming, animal farming, and product processing should be properly integrated and agricultural production should be linked with commerce and industry. New trades and industries should be developed in the rural economy. The development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishing and the development of the secondary and tertiary industries should be properly coordinated. The scope of rural employment should be broadened. Peasants' income should be increased and peasants' living standards should be raised to the level of comparatively well-off. II. General Arrangements for Agricultural Development in the Nineties Third, agricultural production must follow the principle of being arranged according to the local conditions and giving play to the local advantages in natural resources and the local economic and technological advantages. Crop farming, animal husbandry, forestry, and fishing should be developed as long as the local conditions are suited to such operations. Efforts should be make to promote the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline industry, and fishery and also to promote regional coordination, specialization, and commercialization of agricultural production. Fourth, the state encourages and supports the development of grain production. Grain production and marketing in the whole country should be arranged according to the principle of making all provinces and autonomous regions effect self-sufficiency first and then transfer surplus grain to nearby areas according to a reasonable distribution plan. By the end of this century, most provinces and autonomous regions should be able to basically effect grain self-sufficiency. A small number of provinces and autonomous regions that need to take grain from other areas should establish long-term and stable grain supply relations with nearby grain-supplying provinces and autonomous regions. Provinces and autonomous regions that transfer their grain products to other areas should give play to their advantage in grain production and properly organize grain production and marketing according to the actual needs of their own localities, the state, and other provinces and autonomous regions; they should do this by bearing the overall national interests in mind. Provinces and autonomous regions which can effect grain self-sufficiency should make efforts to develop grain production and strive to produce sufficient grain for themselves. All localities should build up their own commodity grain production bases according to their local conditions. The variety of grain crops should be adjusted according to the market demand. Good-quality varieties should be greatly developed. The production of grain used to feed animals should also be increased. The middle and lower valleys of the Chang Jiang and the southeast coastal areas should increase the production of good-quality rice; the valleys of the Huang He, Huai He, Hai He, and the northeast region should develop the production of wheat, corn, and soya bean. Fifth, the production of cash crops and other crops should be concentrated appropriately and arranged according to the local conditions so that local advantages can be brought into better play and disadvantages avoided. The cropping arrangements should be further readjusted according to this principle. Cotton production should be developed mainly in the plains between the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He; in the plains of the middle and lower valleys of the Chang Jiang; and in Xinjiang. As for the production of oil-bearing crops, rapeseed should be planted mainly in areas south of the Chang Jiang and peanuts should be grown in areas north of the Chang Jiang. The production of other oil-bearing crops should also be properly arranged. As for the production of sugar-bearing crops, sugar cane growth should be stabilized and developed in the southeast coastal areas and sugar beet should be grown in the northeast and northwest regions. At the same time, sugar cane production in Yunnan and Guangxi should also be increased. Sixth, forestry production should proceed from fostering forestry resources, increasing the forest coverage rate, and increasing the timber and forest product supply capacity. Production layout should be readjusted. A batch of windbreak forests, soil conservation forests, and field protection forests should be planted along the Chang Jiang and along the coastline, and in northwest China, the northern part of north China, and the west part of northeast China, the Taihangshan area, and the plains where strong winds and sandstorms produce harmful effects and soil erosion is serious. Timber production bases should be built to rapidly and intensively increase the production of timber mainly in east China, central and south China, and southwest China. Areas with favorable conditions, especially those to the south of the Chang Jiang, can build bases for oil-bearing trees, perfume, medical materials, and dried fruits. In hilly areas where there is a shortage of firewood and in the dry areas of north China, as well as in some coastal areas, fuel forests should be planted in order to mitigate the short supply of energy sources in the rural areas. Straw and crop stalks can be used as fertilizer and as raw materials for generating methane. Seventh, animal farming should focus on pig raising and great efforts should also be made to increase the feeding of grain-saving herbivorous animals and poultry. The suburban areas of large and medium cities should mainly develop the production of animals, poultry, eggs, and milk in order to meet the consumption needs of urban residents. Agricultural areas should continue to promote the production of pork, strive to increase the supply rate of pigs [chu lan lu 0427 2936 3764], and increase the production of pigs with leaner meat. At the same time, it is necessary to spread the technique for making ammoniac stalks [jie gan an hua ji shu 4447 4427 8637 0553 2111 2611], and greatly develop the feeding of cattle in crop farming areas. In half-crop-farming and half-animal- farming areas, attention should be paid to giving play to the favorable condition of having rich feed and forage grass and we should more rapidly develop the production of such herbivorous animals as cattle and sheep. Pastoral areas should attach importance to the building of grassland and should improve the quality of forage grass. They should prevent the grassland from retrograding and becoming eroded by sand and should enhance the meat production capacity. Efforts should be made to increase the production of wool in order to meet the needs of the developing textile industry. Eighth, freshwater and seawater aquaculture should be greatly developed as should oceangoing fishing. Importance should be attached to the processing and comprehensive use of aquatic products. The 11 key projects of developing freshwater aquaculture in the Zhu Jiang Delta area and other areas should be properly handled. Reservoirs should also be used to produce aquatic products. Seawater aquaculture should be focused on the use of coastal beaches. The intensity of offshore fishing should be strictly controlled and efforts should mainly be made to catch fish in the middle and upper layers of the East China Sea and the outer scope of the Huang Hai as well as in the South China Sea. At the same time, oceangoing fishing should also be developed more rapidly. III. Relying on Agricultural Scientific and Technological Progress, Enhancing the Unit Output Rate of Land and Other Agricultural Resources Ninth, to realize the objective of increasing agricultural production in the nineties, we must grasp the key link of enhancing the unit area yield of the land. It is necessary to rely on scientific and technological progress to improve the conditions for agricultural production and to continuously raise the unit area yield. In these 10 years, the per-mu output of grain and cotton should increase by 50 kg and 12 kg respectively, close to the increases in the eighties. Tenth, effectively organize adoption of the new water-saving irrigation techniques and raise the utilization rate of irrigation water. The water-saving irrigation techniques should be actively spread in various localities according to their specific conditions and water-saving farming should be promoted. The techniques of carrying water through pipes, building water channels with liners [qu dao chen qi 3255 6670 6000 4265], preventing leakage, irrigating fields by means of spraying and dropping should be spread broadly. The maintenance and management of water conservancy and irrigation works should be strengthened and the use efficiency of the facilities should be raised. The utilization rate of irrigating water in our country should be raised from 40 to about 50 percent. Eleventh, raising the level of using fertilizers and pesticides scientifically. It is necessary to adopt the techniques of using chemical fertilizer deep inside the soil, applying fertilizer according to the soil-testing formulae, and combining the use of organic and nonorganic fertilizers. The utilization rate of chemical fertilizer should be raised from about 30 to 40 percent. Training should be given to peasants so that they can use various types of pesticide in good time, reasonably, and scientifically, thus improving the condition of preventing and curing plant diseases and wiping out insect pests. Efforts should be made to spread the use of biological pesticides and the adoption of biological prevention techniques, thus reducing the losses caused by plant diseases and pests to agricultural production. Twelfth, comprehensive measures should be adopted to improve the quality of the existing farmland. Sloping fields should be transformed into terraced fields; fields should be leveled; soil should be improved; the irrigation and drainage conditions should be made better; the fertility of the land should be increased; and scientific farming techniques should be adopted to transform the low-yield fields which now account for one-third of the existing farmland. Thus, the unit area output can be raised substantially. Thirteenth, It is necessary to make full use of the light, heat, water, and soil resources; improve the farming techniques; increase the multiplecropping index; and increase the sown area. In southern areas, the rate of winter cropping in idle fields should be raised as should the area intercropping area. In the southern areas where the light and heat resources are insufficient for two seasons and more than enough for one season, the measure of planting ratooning rice should be adopted. By the end of this century, the multiplecropping index in the whole country should be raised from 150 percent in the late eighties to about 160 percent and the sown area should be increased by an average of some 730,000 hectares every year. Fourteenth, cultivating, spreading, and popularizing the adoption of improved seeds and varieties. The agricultural basic research and applied research should be strengthened. A number of high-yield, good-quality, disease-resistant, and pest-resistant varieties and breeds of trees, crops, and animals should be reserved and cultivated. At the same time, it is necessary to introduce a number of improved varieties and fine breeds from abroad in a planned way. While great efforts are made to spread various types of improved varieties, special attention should be paid to the cultivation of good quality high-yield hybrid rice, hybrid corn, and hybrid rape. The breeds of lean-meat pigs and the fine hybrid breeds of cattle, sheep, and poultry should be spread more quickly. In the whole country, the seeds for grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops should be changed once or twice in the nineties. The rate of adopting fine breeds of animals, poultry, and aquatic animals should be further raised. Fifteenth, making great efforts to spread applicable agricultural techniques. The use of improved seeds should be combined with the adoption of advanced techniques. A batch of markedly effective applicable techniques and technologies should be selected and spread as key measures. By the year 2000, the application rate of agricultural scientific research results should be raised from around 40 to about 50 percent. Efforts should be made to further advance the "Harvest Plan," the "Spark Project," the "Spreading Programs," and other activities of spreading scientific research results and advanced techniques and technologies. The techniques of model cultivation, dry land farming, plastic film covering, cultivation on protected land, optimized farming methods, forecasts of plant diseases and pests and comprehensive preventive measures; the advanced animal feeding techniques and the methods of making animal feed, including the technique of making ammoniac stalks; the techniques of high-efficiency production of freshwater and seawater aquatic products, including the methods of proliferating resources and preventing animal diseases; and the technologies of keeping farm produce fresh and processing, storing, and transporting farm produce should be spread broadly. It is necessary to give extensive technical training and education to peasants and to increase their scientific and general knowledge so that they can better master the scientific farming methods. IV. Reinforcing the Construction of Agricultural Commodities Production Bases Sixteenth, reinforcing the construction of the commodity production bases for supplying grain, cotton, cooking oil, and sugar. On the basis of consolidating and improving the existing commodity grain production base counties, we will build 226 new bases so that the number of commodity grain base counties reaches 500. The comprehensive commodity grain production capacity should reach half of the total national output of commodity grain and should be built into high-yield, good-quality, and high-efficiency agricultural bases mainly producing commodity grain. At the same time, the state-owned farms in Heilongjiang, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia should be turned into agricultural commodity bases mainly producing commodity grain. In addition, we will set up 150 high-quality cotton production base counties and a number of new sugar production bases. A number of state-owned farms producing cotton, sugar, and rubber will be turned into sample bases for the specialization and commercialization of agriculture. Seventeenth, quicken the establishment of bases for fast-growing and high-yield, special, quality timber forests and cash-earning forests. The state needs to establish a number of fast-growing, high-yield timber forest bases in the provinces and autonomous regions of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan as well as in the northeast and Inner Mongolia, planting 5 million hectares of new trees to increase timber supplies in the early 2000's. Moreover, it will establish 500 special and quality cash-earning forest production bases all over China. Eighteenth, consolidate the development of the "shopping basket project." 1. The establishment of meat, egg, milk, and vegetable production bases. We will build 200 new lean pig production bases and increase the number of butchered pigs by 50 million annually. We will vigorously promote the technique of raising cows with ammoniated straw, set up a number of lean cow production bases and increase the number of butchered cows to 900,000 annually. We will set up milk cow and milk buffalo production bases in the northeast, Inner Mongolia, and the southeast, increase the number of milk cattle to 200,000 capable of supplying 600,000 metric tons [figures as published] of milk each year. We will set up sheep and goat bases in the northwest and Inner Mongolia. We will establish a number of intensive and modern egg and chicken farms as well as a number of vegetable production bases in some large and medium cities and industrial and mining areas. We will set up a number of poultry farming bases in some areas in the south where there are plenty of water and grass resources. 2. The establishment of bases for the breeding of aquatic products. For freshwater breeding, we should pay good attention to the transformation of medium- and low-yield ponds and to the construction of their supporting projects, improving their yield per unit of area. We should vigorously develop aquatic product breeding in large and medium rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and some low-lying land along the rivers and lakes, building a number of new bases producing aquatic products. While paying good attention to the establishment of seawater aquatic product breeding bases in the Liaodong and Shandong Peninsulas and Bohai Bay, we will quicken the exploitation and utilization of the shorelines of southern provinces, vigorously develop the breeding of valuable marine products, and gradually set up a number of new bases producing valuable marine products. We will continue to improve the construction of fishing bases in West Africa, North America, South America, and South Asia, and the construction of the deep-sea fishing bases in the South Pacific and other areas. Nineteenth, strengthen the construction of export-led bases for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop foreign- currency earning agriculture, strengthen international cooperation and exchanges, push China's agriculture toward the international market, and quicken the pace of agricultural modernization. On the basis of consolidating and perfecting the existing export-led bases for agricultural and sideline products, we will continue to set up a number of new export-led bases for agricultural and sideline products. We will develop the export of good-brand, special, quality, and new products and finely processed and highly wrought goods by fully utilizing the abundance of China's rural work force and agricultural and sideline products, and actively open up the international market. V. Strengthen Comprehensive Agricultural Development Twentieth, the main tasks of comprehensive agricultural development in the nineties are: 1. We will basically stabilize the area of China's total farmland and ensure that the new reclaimed area is no less than the area of occupied farmland. We will adopt strict management measures to control the occupation of farmland and stick to the principle of reclaiming one mu of land to recover one mu of occupied land and set the target of land reclamation at 2.1 million hectares or above nationally. 2. We will transform 18 million hectares of medium- and low-yield fields, plant 6.6 million hectares of trees, create 20 million hectares of artificial grassland and improved grassland, and improve 1.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield paddy fields. 3. We will increase the comprehensive grain production capability by 38 billion kg and the comprehensive cotton production capability by 400,000 metric tons. Twenty-first, the important points in comprehensive agricultural development are: 1. We will reclaim a total of 1.9 million hectares of land and transform 14.67 million hectares of medium- and low-yield fields in 10 state-level key development regions including the plains along the Huang He, Huai He, and the Hai He, and in the Sanjiang Plain [san jiang ping yuan 0005 3068 1627 0626], the Songliao Plain [song liao ping yuan 2646 6697 1627 0626], the Huanghe Delta, and the plains at the middle and lower reaches of the Chang Jiang. 2. We will reclaim 280,000 hectares of farmland and transform over 3.3 million hectares of medium- and low-yield fields in 12 provincial-level key development areas, including the plain at the foot of Yan Shan, the area bounded by the northern part of the Wei He and the eastern Long Shan, in the Nanyang Basin, and in the hilly areas of Hubei. 3. We will create 13.3 million hectares of artificial grassland and improved grassland, of which over 3.3 million hectares will be high-standard artificial grassland, in the six key pastoral and semi-pastoral areas including the grassland in northern Inner Mongolia, the grasslands of Ili and Altay in Xinjiang, the grasslands in the northwest of Sichuan and southern Gansu, the grassland along the Qinghai Hu, and the agricultural and pastoral areas in northeast China. 4. We will strive to enable over two thirds of the poverty- stricken counties in the karst areas of the southwest, and in the hilly gullies on the loess plateau, to possess approximately one mu of basic farmland per capita. 5. We will reclaim 2.33 million hectares of desert along the western corridor to the west of the Huang He and in the oases of Xinjiang and exploit and utilize one million hectares of resources in the desert areas. Twenty-second, for comprehensive agricultural development, we need to strengthen the concepts of the market, quality, and returns, attaching importance to improving the quality and production returns of farm products while making efforts to boost the output of farm products in keeping with market needs. We will really take economic returns as the center and optimize resource allocation and the structure and layout of production. Based on the comprehensive exploitation and utilization of all land resources, we will launch the comprehensive development of hills, water, fields, forests, and highways, developing them in width and in breadth at the same time. It is necessary to promote the circulation of farm products, improve storage facilities, and develop the infrastructural construction of rural markets. Twenty-third, stabilize and perfect the comprehensive agricultural development policy. The policies pursued for comprehensive agricultural development areas during the Seventh Five-Year Plan will be continued and remain unchanged during the nineties. For example, for five years, we will not arrange for the state purchase of grain increases after the improvement and transformation of medium- and low-yield fields and the grain produced in newly-reclaimed farmlands and we will not levy agricultural tax on the newly-reclaimed farmlands; the state will arrange some discount-interest loans, set targets, and grant funds while the local authorities pay the discount interest; the state will continue to increase investment in large-scale water conservancy projects including the harnessing of rivers; and priority will be given to making arrangements for the distribution of such agricultural means of production as diesel oil, chemical fertilizer, pesticide, and agricultural plastic film. Twenty-fourth, strengthen the management of the capital for comprehensive agricultural development and improve its use efficiency. The existing sources of capital used for comprehensive agricultural development must be ensured, while a certain proportion of the fees for the use and transfer of state-owned land, and a certain proportion of the income from the land in various types of economic development areas, will be used on comprehensive agricultural development. For comprehensive agricultural development we should use market mechanisms and employ such means of competition as inviting public tenders for projects, referring to and using the project management methods of international financial organizations, such as the World Bank, and improve the efficiency of capital use. Comprehensive agricultural development must be closely integrated with, and mutually matched by, the construction of farmland and irrigation and water conservancy works, assistance to and development of poverty-stricken areas, the comprehensive harnessing of the small valleys in hilly areas, afforestation, and work-relief programs, forming an overall large-scale integral development project. VI. Energetically Develop Township and Town Enterprises Twenty-fifth, developing township and town enterprises is the only way to boost the rural economy, increase the incomes of peasants, shift the surplus rural work force elsewhere, and to promote agricultural modernization and the development of the national economy. In the nineties, on the basis of consolidating the agricultural foundation, it is necessary to place township and town enterprises in an important strategic position. It is necessary to continue to implement the principle of "actively rendering support to them, making rational plans for them, giving them correct guidance, and strengthening their management"; energetically develop new agriculture-related trades and industries; and unswervingly support the development of township and town enterprises. Twenty-sixth, township and town enterprises must be organized, planned, and rationally laid out and must have their structures adjusted and their returns improved in keeping with the national economic development plan and the industrial policy. It is necessary to arrange for the processing of urban and rural farm products in keeping with the principle that processing is near raw materials production areas and is rational economically. As many newly-added farm product processing industries as possible should be run in rural areas. Cities with the conditions should gradually shift farm and sideline product processing industries to rural areas. Township and town enterprises must maintain a stable rate of development on the premise of continuously improving product quality and economic returns. We should treat and guide the township and town enterprises in different areas differently. For those in the west and in ethnic minority-inhabited areas, we should fully use their special resources and labor advantages, vigorously introduce professional people and technology, develop horizontal association, and set up a number of resources-processing enterprises to nurture omnidirectional development. Central China must make use of the grain and other farm product resources, carry out comprehensive economic development, enhance the processing expertise, and give comprehensive compensation for the production of grain and other farm products. Coastal areas must base themselves on their existing foundations, quicken technological transformation, and develop high-tech products and export-oriented products to earn foreign currency. It is necessary to strengthen enterprise management and spur township and town enterprises to improve both product standards and quality and to improve the quality of enterprises. Twenty-seventh, formulate policies and measures and vigorously guide and support the healthy development of township and town enterprises. It is particularly necessary to energetically support the development of the township and town enterprises in central and western China. The special loans arranged by the People's Bank of China for central and western China and for ethnic-minority-inhabited areas should be appropriately increased each year to mainly help the major grain-producing areas in central and western China develop township and town enterprises. Loans offered by international financial institutions for township and town enterprises should mainly lean toward central and western China. We should encourage eastern, central, and western China, and ethnic-minority-inhabited areas to develop horizontal economic association and cooperation. Areas with a comparatively developed economy should help poverty-stricken areas to develop their economies so that they can supplement each other with their advantages and promote each other for common development. Twenty-eighth, it is necessary to continuously implement the principle of "developing agriculture with industry" among township and town enterprises. We should enhance the construction of basic agricultural facilities by developing township and town enterprises and increasing investment in agriculture. We will strive to enable township and town enterprises to absorb another 50 million of the surplus rural work force by the year 2000, on the premise of meeting the needs of agricultural production. Twenty-ninth, strengthen guidance for the development of small towns in rural areas. As for the development of small cities in rural areas, they should rely on their existing market towns, plan their development in a scientific way, work out a rational layout, and gradually implement plans to nurture the development of tertiary industry and the shift in the surplus work force. It is necessary to guide township and town enterprises for their relative concentration geographically and for them to integrate with the development of small cities. It is necessary to formulate preferential policies and attract peasants to small cities so that they will engage in industry, business, the construction industry, transportation, services, and others. VII. Consolidate the Establishment of the Support System for Agricultural Development Thirtieth, irrigation and water conservancy works are an important guarantee for the sustained and steady development of agricultural production. Both the central and local authorities should concentrate their energies on constructing a number of major irrigation and water conservancy works. Major projects for the nineties are: 1. Flood-prevention projects. We will: Construct the Three Gorges Project for the Chang Jiang and the key water works at the bottleneck of the Li Shui; continue to increase the height of, and consolidate the flood dams on, the middle and lower Chang Jiang; harness Lake Dongting and Lake Poyang; and construct water conservancy projects like the Honghu Project. We will construct 10 projects in Lake Tai, including those at Taipuhe and Wangyuhe and the Hangjia Drainage Project. We will construct a small-tide, low-water key water work project for the Huang He and increase the height of and consolidate the flood dams in its lower reaches. We will widen the floodwater passages in the middle reaches of the Huai He and widen their outlets to other rivers and to the sea in the lower Huang He. We will construct the Xinhe Flood Prevention Project, the project diverting the floodwaters of the Yi He, the Shu He, and the Si He to the east and to the south; and the Shimantan Irrigation and Water Conservancy Project. For the Zhu Jiang, we will construct the Feilai Gorge Waterworks Project in its northern tributary and the Dateng Gorge Waterworks Project in its western tributary. We will continue to construct flood-prevention projects on the Hailuan He and the Songliao He to enhance their flood- resistant capabilities. 2. Water resources projects. We will emphasize the construction of the projects which divert water from southern provinces to Beijing, Tianjin, and northern China; the key waterworks at Wanjiazhai along the Huang He, and the water diversion project which diverts water from the Huang He to Shanxi, Hebei's Taolinkou Reservoir Project, and Xinjiang's Uruwati [wu lu wa ti 3527 7627 3907 2251] Waterworks. We will begin the Daliushu project along the Huang He. We will quicken water diversion from the northeast to the south and strive for the earliest possible construction of the preliminary stage work for water diversion from the Jiang He, the Ji He, and the Huai He to Anhui. 3. Irrigation and drainage works. We will construct and transform a number of large irrigation and drainage works, which mainly include Sichuan's Wudu and Shengzhong irrigation works and Dujiangyan transformation project; the irrigation and drainage works at the Great Bend of the Huang He in Ningxia and Inner Mongolia; Shaanxi's Donglei Waterworks; Henan and Shandong's large-scale water diversion and irrigation projects; the waterworks in the irrigated areas of Anhui's Pi He, Shiguan He, and Hangbu He; the waterworks at the Chaersen Reservoir and irrigated areas in Inner Mongolia and Jilin; Gansu's project which diverts water from the Datong He to the Qinwangchuan area to the north of Lanzhou, and the Qingtai irrigation project; and Hainan's Songtao irrigation project. We will strive to increase the effective irrigated area by 5.33 million hectares within 10 years so that, by the year 2000, the total irrigated area across the country will reach 53.3 million hectares or more. 4. Hydropower projects. Increase China's hydroelectric systems by a total installed capacity of 15 million kw, of which 2.8 million kw comprise the installed capacity of medium and large hydropower stations; 6.2 million kw are from medium hydropower stations; and 6 million kw are from small hydropower stations. We will enable 500 counties in rural areas to basically have access to electricity. 5. Water and soil conservation. We must put an end to soil and water losses over a total area of 400,000 square km in the nineties, with the emphasis on stopping soil and water losses in the middle reaches of the Huang He and in the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang. At the same time, we will pay good attention to conserving soil and water in other rivers including the Zhu Jiang, the Hai He, the Huai He, and the Liao He. We will harness small rivers in the northwest and improve the ecological environment by adopting engineering and biological measures at the same time. Thirty-first, quickening the development of agriculture support industries is an important condition which guarantees the upgrading of agriculture. The major tasks in this respect are: 1. Strengthen the development of the chemical fertilizer industry. In the nineties, we will build Guizhou's Wengfu Chemical Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of double superphosphate will reach 800,000 metric tons; Hubei's Dayukou Project whose annual output of double superphosphate will reach 560,000 metric tons; the second-phase project of Qinghai's Potash Fertilizer Factory whose annual output of potassium chloride will reach 800,000 metric tons; Yunnan's highly-concentrated phosphate fertilizer project; and a number of large and medium chemical fertilizer production plants and support chemical and mining projects in Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi's Weihe, Jiangxi's Jiujiang, and Hunan's Dongting. We will quicken the transformation of small chemical fertilizer factories and promote the introduction of new generations of products. We will strive to produce 150 million metric tons of chemical fertilizer by the year 2000. 2. Quicken the development of agriculture-related industries such as those producing pesticide, agricultural plastic film, and farm machinery. As for pesticide, we need to quicken the readjustment of the product mix, develop and transform a number of large and medium enterprises, energetically develop high-efficiency and low-waste pesticide varieties, and set up China's pesticide research center. We will boost the pesticide output to 240,000 or 250,000 metric tons by the year 2000. It is necessary to set up and transform a number of enterprises producing agricultural plastic film materials and to produce more standardized varieties of agricultural plastic film. We will boost the output of agricultural plastic film to 800,000 metric tons by the year 2000. It is necessary to quicken the development of the farm machinery industry so that by the year 2000, we will be able to produce annually 200,000 large and medium tractors, 500,000 small tractors, 10,000 combined reaping machines, and internal combustion engines totalling 80 million hp. Diesel oil for agricultural use and electricity used in rural areas must be gradually increased and we will make great efforts to create conditions for agricultural modernization. Thirty-second, forestry is the ecological defense of high and stable agricultural yield. In the nineties, we must pay attention to the following key construction projects of forestry: 1. The "three north" shelter-forest project: The task of afforesting a total area of 7.18 million hectares must be fulfilled by the end of this century. 2. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest system in nine provinces and 145 counties along the upper and middle reaches of the Chang Jiang. A total area of 6.67 million hectares will be forested. 3. The first phase project of building a shelter-forest system in 11 provinces, regions, and municipalities along the coast. A total area of 2.44 million hectares will be forested. 4. We must continue to accomplish the Taihang Shan afforestation project and the plains afforestation project in major grain-producing areas in our country, such as the Sanjiang Plain, the Songliao Plain, the Huabei Plain, and the plains along the middle and lower reaches of Chang Jiang. Thirty-third, efforts must be made to strengthen the construction of a meteorological forecasting system. In the nineties, we must accelerate the pace of meteorological modernization, with the core being the construction of system projects related to the business of medium-term numerical real-time forecasting, the reception and processing of ground information from geostationary meteorological satellites, the business of the comprehensive application of meteorological satellites, the automation of atmospheric monitoring, a comprehensive meteorological information network, and the application of meteorological satellite monitoring. We must strengthen the monitoring of disastrous weather and short-term weather forecasting, improve the effectiveness and precision of forecasts, and reduce losses brought on agriculture by natural calamities. Thirty-fourth, efforts must be made to strengthen construction of the feed industry. In the nineties, a number of new enterprises developing and utilizing rapeseed will be established in oil-producing areas. Two 5,000-tonne lysine enterprises, one or two 100,000-metric tons calcium phosphate producing bases, and a set of large feed-grade vitamin A and E installations will be built. By 2000, the national mixed feed processing capability must be over 70 million metric tons and the yield of mixed feed must exceed 55 million metric tons. Thirty-fifth, efforts must be made to strengthen the construction of livestock vaccine and pharmaceutical factories. In the nineties, as far as prevention and treatment of epidemic diseases in livestock is concerned, we must continue to uphold the principle of "relying mainly on prevention" and devote our energies and financial resources to doing a good job of preventing epidemic diseases which are very harmful to livestock and mankind. We must focus on the construction and transformation of a number of biological pharmaceutical factories which will serve the whole country. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan, projects for making animal health care products will be arranged in Jinan, Shandong, and Shanghai and a new capability of producing vaccine for 6 billion poultry will be added. Technological transformation must be carried out in key bio-medical factories. Thirty-sixth, efforts must be made to strengthen the construction of agricultural scientific research. We must enhance international scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation and organize the research work of major domestic agricultural scientific and technological projects properly. We must strengthen the construction of key state laboratories and professional research institutes and enrich and improve the conditions for scientific research into agriculture. We must strive to add more funds to tackle key problems, carry out experiments, and develop new technology in scientific research in agriculture. The state will focus on the construction of scientific research institutes in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy which are serving the whole country, including the Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Forestry Sciences, and the Academy of Water Conservancy Sciences. We must strengthen basic scientific research of biological projects (including gene projects, cell projects, enzyme projects, and fermentation projects) as well as research of application sciences, such as fine-breed reproduction, cultivation techniques, irrigation techniques, water and soil conservation techniques, prevention and cure of plant diseases and insect pests, and skills in processing, freshening, storing, and transporting farm produce. Governments at all levels must take effective measures to support and promote close integration between scientific research in agriculture and the work of popularizing agricultural technology. We must not only devote our energies to supporting basic scientific research in agriculture but also attach great importance to the application and popularization of scientific and technological achievements to speed up the transformation of scientific research achievements in agriculture. Thirty-seventh, we must do a good job in rural elementary education and higher education in agriculture. We must vigorously promote rural elementary, vocational, and adult education to bring about close integration between education and economic construction. The authorities at the county and township levels must bring education into the local economic and social development programs; supervise elementary, vocational, technical, and adult education at different levels; and popularize education on agricultural technology in higher primary and junior secondary classes in rural areas. Efforts must be made to coordinate and plan economic, scientific and technological, and educational development and to basically popularize nine-year compulsory education. We must further accomplish the construction of a number of key universities, colleges, and courses in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy; devote our energies to building a number of key secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy which have a higher standard. We must help colleges and secondary schools in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy accelerate the process of building up teaching bases and set up teacher training centers for colleges in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. To fully promote the rural economy, we must rely on education because "education is the foundation of our plan for generations." Hence, governments at all levels must truly cultivate this ideology and take practical and effective measures to speed up educational reform and development. VIII. Widely Opening Up Agricultural Investment Channels, Increasing Agricultural Construction Funds Thirty-eighth, huge investment is needed if we want to fulfill the task of agricultural construction for the nineties. We must try to broaden agricultural investment channels and drastically increase agricultural investment. Budgetary investment in agricultural capital construction, state financial aid-agriculture funds, agricultural credit funds provided by banks, and funds for providing relief in exchange for work are current channels of agricultural investment which must be stabilized for a long time and increased gradually. In order to ensure meeting the needs of agricultural investment, all departments in charge of planning, finance, and credit from the central to local levels must guarantee, in the first place, the supply of agricultural funds and must be determined to alter the situation of the small proportion of agricultural investment in overall investment. We must vigorously open up capital channels and more frequently absorb and utilize foreign investment in accordance with the orientation of reforming state taxation, monetary, investment, and foreign trade systems. We must capitalize on the support of departments in charge of foreign trade to vigorously widen the scope and increase the amount of utilizing foreign investment in agriculture, constantly upgrade the standards, and work out preferential policies. Thirty-ninth, efforts must be made to urge rural collectives and individuals to make more investment in agriculture. We must work through such measures as developing township and town enterprises to enhance the economic strength of rural collectives. We must work out corresponding laws, regulations, and policies to ensure that rural collectives will use a certain proportion of accumulated capital in agriculture and guide peasants to make more investment in agricultural construction. Governments at all levels must, in accordance with local conditions, further perfect the labor accumulation system and fully utilize our country's superiority of having an abundant rural labor force to strengthen the construction of agricultural infrastructures. Fortieth, forces from all social sectors must be mobilized to make more investment in agriculture. A certain proportion of social funds must be put together through various forms and used in the construction of large and medium agricultural infrastructures. We must vigorously integrate the development of agriculture with that of industry and commerce and create conditions to promote processing of farm produce and to enable enterprises engaging in transportation and marketing to invest in agriculture. Forty-first, agricultural investment must be managed and used well and the efficiency of utilizing agricultural investment must be improved. Budgetary capital construction investment at the central and local levels must be managed in strict accordance with the state's administrative method of capital construction investment and used mainly in the construction of agricultural infrastructures, such as the work of harnessing large rivers and lakes, important state-level agricultural commodity production bases, large-scale key shelter-forest projects, the meteorological forest system, and the agricultural socialized service system. We must ensure that financial aid-agriculture funds, funds for providing relief in exchange for work, and bank loans for agricultural construction at the central and local levels must be used in strengthening agricultural production. Funds used by rural collectives in agricultural construction must be controlled by rural collectives and these funds should never be indiscriminately diverted to other uses. Efforts must be made to encourage peasants to use their funds in production-oriented construction. Nobody is allowed to violate state regulations and increase peasants' burdens by raising funds and apportioning expenses from them in any form. Nobody is allowed to seize and misuse peasants' funds invested in agricultural production. As far as the administration of funds utilized in agricultural construction is concerned, we must not only give play to the enthusiasm of departments at all levels in making more investment in agriculture but also establish an effective macroscopic regulation mechanism and lay down an overall plan and coordinate agricultural investment made through various channels, thus making joint efforts in agricultural construction. We must strengthen the early-stage proof of agricultural construction projects and take gradual steps to implement the project owner responsibility system and the tender system to improve the efficiency of utilizing agricultural investment. IX. Strengthening Construction of the Agricultural Socialized Service System Forty-second, efforts must be made to strengthen construction of the agricultural socialized service system, which plays an important role in upholding the responsibility system with the household contract linking remuneration to output as the main form; perfecting the system of unified management combined with independent management; promoting the development of the rural socialist market economy; and advancing agriculture to a new stage. By the end of this century, a service system with multiple economic components, forms, and levels must be gradually established on the basis of rural collective and cooperative economic organizations and with the support of specialized economic and technical departments while being supplemented by services run by the peasants themselves. Forty-third, the foci of agricultural socialized service work are: 1) to do a good job in the integrated services provided by collective economic organizations at the village level, which mainly include tractor-ploughing, irrigation and drainage, crop protection, harvesting, and transportation; 2) to perfect organizations at the township level, such as those related to farming techniques, agricultural machinery, water conservancy (water conservation), forestry, animal husbandry and veterinary science, aquatic products, management and administration, and meteorological services, and to do a good job in service work; 3) to run supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives well. Concerned state and collective technological and economic organizations must vigorously help peasants develop key services, such as buying and selling farm produce and agricultural means of production, storing, processing, transporting, and exporting farm produce, and raising funds, and insurance; 4) to do a good job in technological information, staff training, technological contracting, and other services provided by departments in charge of scientific research and education, information, and consultation; 5) to encourage the development of such organizations as specialized technological associations and research institutes and provide specialized mutual- aid services; 6) to set up "front-runner-type" service organizations for key industries in township and town enterprise and to provide services ranging from production to supply and marketing to domestic and foreign buyers. In this way, agriculture is provided with comprehensive services before, during, and after production through various service organizations. Forty-fourth, all trades and departments must have the idea of serving peasants and agricultural production, constantly improve their work style, and upgrade service quality. It is necessary to integrate agriculture with science, education, industry, and commerce. Multisectoral services and functions must be coordinated to develop a series of comprehensive services which integrate agriculture with trade and industry, as well as with supply and marketing, and help agricultural socialized services develop into industries, specialties, and enterprises. Forty-fifth, we must vigorously support peasants in individually and jointly running service organizations. Governments at all levels must support socialized service organizations individually and jointly run by peasants and protect their legitimate rights and interests. Departments in charge of finance, science and technology, and domestic and foreign trade must give their support in the forms of capital, technology, and material supply. Forty-sixth, we must further lay down and implement polices which support agricultural socialized service work. We must support the construction of an agricultural socialized service system in the form of capital and bring into effect preferential policies in business administration and taxation enjoyed by concerned scientific and technological departments when setting up service entities. X. Strengthening Leadership, Creating a Good Social Environment For Agricultural Development Forty-seventh, governments at all levels must strengthen their leadership over agriculture and rural work, firmly cultivate the ideology of stressing the foundation role of agriculture, and insist on treating agriculture as the top priority in economic work. We must frequently carry out investigations and studies to solve real problems related to agricultural development. We must take measures in light of local conditions, give specific guidance and, in particular, pay attention to supporting economic development in impoverished localities. We must strengthen macroscopic administration and regulation, ensure the supply of essential agricultural funds, make good arrangements for the work of producing, purchasing, and supplying farm produce and agricultural means of production, and strive to create a social environment which is favorable to agricultural development. Forty-eighth, we must safeguard agricultural production and protect peasants' interests. The state implements practical protective policies towards agricultural production, particularly grain, cotton, and other farm produce with a bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood. Various trades and professions must wholeheartedly serve agricultural production and the peasants, protect the peasants' interests, and vigorously support agricultural development. Forty-ninth, we must strengthen construction of the legal system and gradually realize the goal of using the law to rule and promote agriculture. We must set the propaganda and popularization of a number of relevant laws as the focus for strengthening the people's legal concept. The laws are: The "PRC Law on Land Administration," the "PRC Law on Forest," the "PRC Law on Water," the "PRC Law on Grassland," the "PRC Law on Fisheries," the "PRC Law on Water Conservation," the "PRC Law on Agriculture," and the "PRC Law on Popularization of Farming Techniques." We must perfect rural legal organs, do a good job of implementing laws in rural areas and vigorously provide legal consultation services in rural areas. We must speed up the work of formulating a complete set of laws and regulations to protect agricultural resources, promote agricultural production and circulation of farm produce, and lighten peasants' burdens. We must employ legal means to sternly fight against various practices which disrupt agricultural production, such as manufacturing and selling fake and inferior chemical fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and other agricultural means of production, thus bringing about stability in agricultural production and in the market. Fiftieth, leaders and executive and administrative departments at all levels must, under the guidance of the National Program for Agricultural Development, formulate programs for agricultural development in light of local conditions and conscientiously organize forces to implement them.
