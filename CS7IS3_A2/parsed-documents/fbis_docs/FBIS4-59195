It is his duty, if he cannot rule and resign all at once or if he does not want to rule yet does not want to resign, to tell the people why he has decided not to perform his duties. Spelling things out is the least a man should do. But if this is difficult, the motive behind the prime minister's decision to stay home should certainly not be to get the various groups to rally round to declare their adherence to al-Hariri, to claim that he is indispensable. This is the case whether the decision not to perform his duties is halfway to resignation or, in the other direction, to strengthening his role in office. It is also the case whether the outcome is his return to business as usual or to changing the people he works with. [passage omitted] The formula is very simple. If what is required is to amend the representation of leaders inside the government, then there is no need for a crisis over things that neither add to nor subtract from the situation. If the objective is to rectify the popular representation inside the government, then what is needed is much more than just the appointment of two more ministers to the Cabinet. The Christian situation in Lebanon cannot be resolved through a little game. And the Christian situation in Lebanon cannot be resolved without addressing the entire Lebanese situation. The Lebanese situation has many problems, including imbalanced political and social positions, and a virtual absence of national equality. Political life here is dormant. The increasing internal and external debts, taxes, and fines fall on the shoulders of the poor alone. The Middle East peace settlement circumvents Lebanon amid fears that the settlement will apply to and include Lebanon. When Prime Minister al-Hariri says he can no longer tolerate the situation, what should those who are caught in the middle of the struggle over power between the warlords and the money barons do? Whatever the case, a public crisis is better than a covert one. Perhaps our case is similar to Dr. Kissinger's. After heart surgery, he said mockingly: This proves that I have a heart. Between their joking and their serious moments, can the Lebanese claim that the crisis proves that politics exist in Lebanon?
