Tsai] [Text] Taipei, May 21 (CNA) -- Taiwan will attend a worldwide meeting on trade, environmental protection, and global sustained development scheduled for June 10-11 in Geneva, an industrial official said Saturday [21 May]. Lin Chih-sheng, a division chief in charge of industrial regulations at the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), noted that the two-day meeting will be hosted by the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The world trade regulating body, which will be superseded by the World Trade Organization (WTO) next year, has as its top priority the balanced development of world trade and environmental protection, Lin said. Major topics on the agenda include the relationship among free trade, environmental protection, and global sustained development, environmental protection costs versus trade policies, and the future direction of international cooperation, he elaborated. In order to learn of the most recent developments in this regard, he said, Taiwan must be represented at the meeting. The bureau, however, has yet to decide on which delegates will attend the meeting, he added. A Taiwan delegation, led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng, is in Geneva this week for the fifth meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's membership application. Taiwan was accepted as a GATT observer in September 1992 and is expected to become a full member by the end of this year. Citing a faxed letter from IDB Deputy Director-General Ho Mei-liang who is among the 33-member delegation in Geneva, Lin said that the June 10-11 GATT meeting will be vital to future trade and production trends.
