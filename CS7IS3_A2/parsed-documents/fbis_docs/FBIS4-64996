The fear others have of us is our own fault." This is the opinion of CNEL [National Council for Economy and Labor] Chairman Giuseppe De Rita, who believes that "it is absurd to think that extremist movements of the [German] Republikaner type are making any headway in our country. Those who judge us from the outside have misinterpreted [National Alliance Secretary] Gianfranco Fini's attempts to constitutionalize the Right. The way that information has been presented in the Italian media has resulted in an element of distortion of reality. The picture that foreign countries have of Italy is precisely that which our national press and television networks have transmitted across the borders. It makes no sense," De Rita added, "to speak of a return of fascism, when only 1 percent of Italians profess to be fascists." Furthermore, in this period "we are witnessing an impoverishment of the middle stratum of the ruling class. There are increasingly fewer people who are prepared to take an interest in politics. The new government is having to `scratch about' more than the previous one. [Clean Hands Judge] Di Pietro himself has declined [Prime Minister-Designate] Berlusconi's invitation. Why should he have joined the Viminale's [Interior Ministry] bureaucracy considering that he enjoys much more autonomy conducting investigations, and that he is more popular than [Mayor] Giuliani in New York?"
