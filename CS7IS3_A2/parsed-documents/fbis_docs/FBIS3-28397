The corporation began implementing two joint ventures involving more than one million dollars in capital investment with foreign firms. It also encouraged peasants to sign contracts to grow subsidiary food crops of high economic value to meet export demands, helping them with seeds, technological assistance, and product consumption. As a result, hundreds of hectares of land have been zoned off for planting Japanese red beans, black sesame, and mushrooms to meet export demands.
