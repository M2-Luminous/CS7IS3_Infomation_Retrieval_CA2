Pastukhov, V.F. Veretennikov, R.I. Mendubayev; UDC 533.6.013.13] [Abstract] The popularity of lifting, stabilizing, and control surfaces executed as grid wings and a scarcity of aerodynamic analyses of numerous wing shapes necessitated the development of an aerodynamic analysis method which would make it possible in the nonlinear problem formulation to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the planforms, side frames, wings, and fin assemblies within a broad range of geometric parameters of grid wings and select optimum grid wing configurations from the aerodynamic characteristics viewpoint. An algorithm for determining the aerodynamic characteristics based on a vortical model is proposed, and an approximate method of analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics (ADKh) of frame grid wings and the frame fin assembly as a whole is developed. A comparison of analytical data to the experimental results makes it possible to speculate that the procedure proposed for analyzing the aerodynamic characteristics of frame grid fin assemblies, rectangular slip plates, and slender wings is adequate for practical applications and may be recommended for implementation in aircraft, ship, and vessel computer-aided design systems (SAPR).
