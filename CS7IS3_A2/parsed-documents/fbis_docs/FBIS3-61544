Comments on the Search for New Mechanisms of Scientific Collaboration Between the East and the West''] [Text] It is difficult to impress Akademgorodok in Novosibirsk. At the height of the``cold war'' it received de Gaulle and Nixon, and in the spy craze era, Gersh Budker, who was at that time director of the top-secret Institute of Nuclear Physics, liked to invite probable James Bonds to eat Siberian pelmeni [similar to ravioli]. Still, the workshop (for the sake of simplicity let us call it a seminar) attended in late November by the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and NATO's research program department prompted unconcealed interest there. Suggestions on possible points of agreement were somewhat defined when Alain Joubert, director of NATO's program for international scientific exchange handed out to the seminar participants a list of 60 international conferences and seminars within the framework of the 1994 NATO program on ``Science to serve society.'' These meetings will deal with such priority interests of mankind as the new generation of immune stimulators, materials science for orthopedic implants, molecular aspects of carcinogenesis, climate sensitivity to radiation perturbations.... Technologies for disarmament, environmental protection, high-tech technologies for high-level investigation of human resources were mentioned as the priority areas of NATO research programs. Do these remarkable, peaceful programs mean that NATO, the most powerful military group with its objectively inherent power-oriented attitudes, will miraculously change suddenly into some sort of international humanitarian organization? The answer is easy. Even now, the North Atlantic bloc has something to protect and someone against whom to defend itself. And for a long time it will remain a military entity, and, God willing, let it be only defensive. But expressly this implies that friendly business relations will be established with it. Of course it was difficult for Siberian scientists to behave as equal partners with representatives from the West at this meeting: the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences is in distress, as is all of Russian science. Scientists are engaged in a feverish search for funding. Yet the products of major research, as validly noted by Boris Saltykov, the Russian minister who spoke here, are sometimes sold abroad for outrageously low prices. But if scientific developments become, at least in part, a commodity, the Siberians must be given their due: some solid results were submitted in the best way. It must be conceded that the Western emissaries arrived here quite well prepared. Upon meeting Professor Gerdt Maier, representative of the FRG aerospace research establishment, I was amazed at how well he was informed, not only about academic, but also industrial research of the Siberian scientists. What was particularly remarkable is that, while the official documents of the seminar listed the Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and NATO research services as organizers, the circle of foreign participants at the meeting was much broader. Prominent figures attended: representatives of authoritative international organizations such as UNESCO and Pangis (pan-African working network of geological information systems), the international "Kazimir" project that deals with investigation of rift zones--faults in the earth's crust, the Association for Environmental Study in Rome, International Institute of Systems Analysis in Vienna, and International Institute of Forest Studies in Moscow, headed by Academician Aleksandr Isayev of Siberia. But it is not at all a matter of listing well-known names and brilliant institutes: the logic of development of science leads increasingly to alliances of researchers from previously separated fields of knowledge and remote continents of our planet. The study of forests has become in recent years a brilliant example of international and interdisciplinary collaboration. Unfortunately, it is a common tendency to underestimate the danger that is developing before our eyes. Forest fires, for example, presently alarm mainly those whom they directly affect. Yet there are tens of thousands of forest fires per year on our planet, and the areas involved measure millions of hectares. An objective scientific assessment is more alarming than the ordinary one. For example, Doctor Johann G. Goldammer from the Max Planck Institute (Freiburg, FRG) observed that the energy of an average forest fire is as great as the power of an atomic bomb. Furthermore, an enormous amount of carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, and this alone can cause global changes in the climate. And, according to estimates, within the next few decades it could lead to severe droughts over enormous territories, with all their tragic consequences. The forest fires that have become more frequent in the United States and Canada, Spain, France and German, Italy, Austria and Switzerland, and, of course, in Siberia, have become serious grounds for scientists from these countries to join forces in order to solve this multifaceted problem. It was learned that such forest fires are caused, to a considerable extent, by man's cavalier intervention in the forest environment, depriving it of self-protection against fire. Optimization of the condition of forest will require enormous expenditures and time far beyond the lifetime of a single generation of people. Today, however, the main thing is to learn to forecast a forest fire, detect it rapidly, assess it and nip it in the bud. The unique experiment in Krasnoyarsk Kray last summer was concerned with solving these problems. For the first time anywhere in the world, it was possible to test the diverse knowledge gained in the last decades about forest fires, radiometric and other forecasting methods, assessment and tactics of extinguishing them. This was possible largely because the experiment, which involved a deliberately set forest fire covering a limited area, was carried out by the International Research Center of Boreal Forests in Krasnoyarsk. One of the remarkable distinctions of development of major Siberian science in our difficult times consists of the fact that, perhaps, the most interesting results are achieved at international research centers, such as the one in Altay, Baykal, and the one dealing with solar and earth physics in East Siberia. There are 16 such centers today, and there will be more than 20 in the next few years. They use both the effect of integration of ideas and knowhow of the West and the East, and some financial aid from the West. Siberian science is an example of the experience and volume of collaboration with scientists from distant lands. Here, an increasing number of creative contacts are being established directly by research teams, in addition to officials. As for collaboration with NATO, the main objective of the meeting in Akademgorodok was to develop programs for long-term scientific collaboration, rather than to receive immediately grants for participation in NATO conferences and seminars. And a start has been made.
