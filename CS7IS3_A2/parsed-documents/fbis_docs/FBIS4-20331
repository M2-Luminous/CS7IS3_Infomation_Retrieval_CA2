We hereby publish an excerpt of the study report and hope that the localities and various departments will pay more attention to and spend more time exploring and studying this issue. Between July and October 1993, we revolved around the goal of elevating the rural areas to the relatively well-off level by the end of the century and conducted a fairly large-scale, province-wide survey and study of the shift in the surplus rural labor force. The province organized three survey teams and selected Feidong, Mongcheng, and Xiuning to be representative counties in a prototypical survey, and at the same time, a general survey was conducted in 15 province-run departments, four prefectural cities, and 13 counties. Through this round of survey and study, we have basically sorted out the province's labor resource and its distribution, gained a thorough understanding of the important strategic impact of the accelerated shift in the surplus rural labor force on achieving the goal of making the rural areas relatively well-off, and have made a preliminary study of the basic approach and countermeasures to speed up the shift of the labor force. I. Rural Socioeconomic Development's Natural Choice Labor is the most active and the most important factor of production. Given the conditions of a socialist market economy, how to realize the optimal allocation of the rural labor resource in accordance with the market mechanisms and law of value and how to further liberate and develop the rural labor force is an important issue for today and well into the distant future. In particular, whether the large surplus rural labor force can be successfully shifted is an important strategic task that will determine whether the rural areas can beco me relatively well-off by the end of the century. To become relatively well-off, the rural areas have many norms to satisfy, but the most fundamental is to substantially increase the peasants' income. Anhui is a major agricultural province. It has a total population of 58.17 million, 84.4 percent of which is rural population. It has 65 million mu in total farm area, averaging 1.33 mu per capita. In 1992, the province's rural population had a per capita net income of 575 yuan, and overall, everybody was basically well-fed and clothed, and some peasants have begun to advance toward the goal of becoming fairly well-off. This means Anhui's rural socioeconomic development has entered a new phase, which is most encouraging. But we should also realize sobermindedly that in recent years, the planting industry's comparative profit has been on the decline, and so increased agricultural production has not been matched by higher agricultural income. The increase in the peasants' income has been slow, and in some areas, it has even stalled. In addition, because peasants in many localities are heavily burdened, it has dampened their production enthusiasm and has slowed their advance toward the goal of becoming relatively well-off. If we make an in-depth examination and analysis of the reasons for the slow increase in peasant income, besides such factors as the widening price scissors between industrial and agricultural products and the lower comparative profit for agriculture, especially for grains, cotto n, and oil, the most important reasons are the slow readjustment of the rural industrial structure, the improper distribution of labor employment, and the wide gap between the input of labor resource and material output. In 1992, nationwide, the nonagricultural sector's contribution to the rural society's total output value was 64.2 percent, and in some well-developed coastal provinces, it exceeded 80 percent, but it was only 55 percent in Anhui which had a rural labor force of 24.32 million--of which 19 .92 million, or 81.90 percent, were employed in agriculture, and among those in agriculture, 93.6 percent were in the planting business. By today's productive standard of an average of 6 mu per worker, we needed approximately 11 million people, and subtracting those who left through the development of township enterprises and other channels, in 1992 we had a surplus rural labor force of 4.92 million people, or one-fifth of the labor force. Anhui's share of stalled agricultural labor force is approximate ly 30 percentage points higher than that in the economically well-developed coastal provinces. Anhui currently is in a transition from the early stage of industrialization to the mature stage, and compared to international standards, the proportion of stalled agricultural labor force in other relevant nations at this stage of development is generally below 70 percent [as published]. This means the shift in Anhui's rural labor force is lagging far behind. The poor rural industrial structure and the improper employment structure naturally affect the income structure. In 1992, the per capita net income of Anhui's peasants was 575 yuan. Specifically, those in the town and township's secondary and tertiary industries had average incomes of 142 yuan [as published], and they accounted for only 24.7 percent of the work force (national standard was 28.4 percent), while those in agriculture accounted for 75.3 percent (57 percent for the nation), and among those in agriculture, 61.3 percent plant crops (compared to 36.8 percent nationwide). Such income structure which is made up primarily of agricultural, especially crop-planting, income not only slows the rate of increase but faces market and natural risks. If we fail to vigorously readjust the rural industrial structure, accelerate the rural labor force's move to the nonagricultural sector, and increase the output value and the employment shares of the secondary and tertiary industries, a large rural labor force will remain on the land which averages a little over a mu per person, and no matter how we try to change the production method, it will be difficult to increase income by much. Thus, if we simply stake the "treasure" that can make us rich in grain, cotton, and oil and put all of our hopes of becoming relatively well-off into agriculture, or especially in the planting industry, it will not work, and not only will it not be safe, but it can actually be dangerous. In this sense, whether Anhui's rural areas can become relatively well-off will, to a large extent, be determined by how much of the surplus rural labor force we can shift out. In recent years, pressured by the rural surplus labor force and pulled by the difference in comparative advantages among different industries, the rural labor forces in many localities have begun to move through channels such as agricultural development, township enterprises, labor export, and entry to small cities and towns and so on. By the end of 1992, approximately 5.30 million people in the province have shifted to the secondary and tertiary industries. Because Anhui's urban industries and township enterprises are relatively small in scope and limited in capacity at the present time, and because the large- and medium-sized cities and the economically well-developed localities have a big demand for labor, many peasants have spontaneously and continuously left the yellow earth which for generations and generations has been tilled and planted, and they have flocked to some of the nation's large- and medium-sized cities, especially in the economically well-developed coastal regions to find work, creating a so called "tidal wave of civilian workers." In 1992, the province exported approximately 5 million workers (around 2 million on a year-round basis). Gradually this shift is creating a trend that rivals the absorption of the labor force by township enterprises. This large-scale spontaneous shift of the rural labor force heralds a major trend in socioeconomic development: Regardless of whether a locality is importing or exporting labor, it will clearly benefit economically and socially. Overall, we can say that the current shift in the surplus rural labor force is the product of a macroeconomic backdrop of the transition from the old economic system to the new during which the peasants' increased output is not matched by increased income and the gaps between industry and agriculture, between urban and rural areas, and among different regions are constantly widening. It is a natural product driven by profit; it is a natural trend as the labor force turns to face the market, adapts to the market, goes after higher economic profit, strives to realize its own value, and improves its overall quality. It is a natural choice as the peasants make an historical transition from being well-fed and clothed to being comfortable and advance faster toward the goal of becoming relatively well-off. We should also realize that surplus rural labor will become an even more serious problem as agriculture becomes increasingly mechanized, as scientific farming standard rises, as farm area shrinks, and with the natural population increase. It is estimated that by the year 2000, Anhui's total rural labor force will be 28.13 million strong, with surplus labor of approximately 11.50 million. If this huge army of surplus labor cannot be effectively shifted, it not only will jeopardize the goal of becoming relatively well-off, it can even threaten social stability. This is an important political-economic problem and a social problem that affects the whole situation. Realistic Approach and Prospects for Accelerating the Shift It is estimated that to achieve the goal of becoming relatively well-off by the end of the year 2000, the peasants' per capita income should top 1,700 yuan (at that year's prices). If we analyze the relevant figures from other countries and apply them here, by that time, the agricultural to nonagricultural employment ratio for Anhui's rural labor force should be adjusted from today's 7.3:2.7 to 3.6:6.4. That is, out of the total labor force of 28.13 million, 10.03 million should be in agriculture while 18.10 million should be in the nonagricultural sector. These represent decrease and increase of 37 percent respectively based on 1992 figures, and only then can we basically complete the historical mission of shifting 11.50 million surplus rural labor force. Judging by the current conditions of the province's resources and economic development and summing up the experiences and approaches of various localities over the years, it is still possible to realize this goal via different channels to speed up the shift of the surplus rural labor force: (1) Readjust agriculture's internal structure, vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and encourage the surplus labor force to go wider and deeper into agriculture. As a major agricultural province, Anhui is rich in agricultural resources and rural labor resource . Much can be said about how to develop and utilize those agricultural resources and at the same time properly tap the rural labor resource; there is huge potential. Currently, the agricultural sector has a poor internal employment structure: the labor force is concentrated primarily in the planting industry, and within the planting industry, the emphasis is on grain production. In 1992, province-wide, 18.65 million people were employed in the planting industry; only 1.27 million were employed in fore stry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery--they made up 6.4 percent of the work force in the planting industry. Thus, for most localities in Anhui, we must plant our foothold on the comprehensive development of agricultural resources, and while stabilizing grain production, we should use a two-prong approach of expanding across the board and developing internally to accelerate the rural labor force's shift from crop-planting to forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery a nd from simple grain planting to growing other cash crops. We must expand forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery and the growing of cash crops, increase their share and efficiency, and increase the peasants' income via several channels. The province currently has 65 million mu of arable land; 25 million is suitable for forest planting and 13.81 million mu for growing aquatic products. Their current exploitation and utilization rate and production rates are fairly low and therefore accelerating the development of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, and cash crop productions will provide much potential for changing agriculture's internal structure and the labor force's employment structure. Initially, the ratio of labor force in the planting industry to those in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery and cash crops should be adjusted from 93.6:6.4 to 79.8:20.2 by the year 2000, raising the labor force in the latter group by 13.8 percent. Based on the 1980 to 1992 figures where each percentage point increase in the output value of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery resulted in an increase in employment of 61,000 people, we need a work force of 2.18 million people, 890,000 more than in 1992. By developing "one superior and two high" in agriculture, Anhui can achieve an average of one mu of high efficiency cash-crop farm per peasant household, and based on 2 mu of land per worker, this can accommodate 6.85 million workers, and subtracting the 1.37 million workers needed in conventional farming, we can absorb 5.48 million workers. Thus, by readjusting agriculture's internal structure and increasing the agricultural resource utilization rate, the province can absorb more than 6.37 million of the rural labor force. This is an effective way to move the surplus rural force which we should not overlook. (2) Optimize the rural industrial structure, vigorously develop township enterprises, and promote the shift of the surplus rural labor force to the non-agriculture sector. Whether the peasants' per capita net income can reach the relatively well-off level is determined to a large extent by the optimization of the rural industrial structure. Looking at Anhui's current situation, the rural industrial structure is only a "well-fed and clothed" structure. In 1992, the nonagricultural sector's share of the province's rural total output was 8.9 percentage points below the national average. This structure se riously hampers the increase in peasant income and its advancement toward the goal of becoming relatively well-off. In the next seven years or so, we have a very arduous task in meeting the provincial party committee and provincial government's standards for a comfortable rural life. We cannot rely on agriculture alone. We must guide and organize the shift of masses of peasant to the secondary and tertiary industries. Practice in many localities has already proved that the development of township enterpri ses should be the main focus of attack if we want to increase the peasants' income and advance faster toward the goal of becoming fairly well-off, and it is also the main avenue for shifting the rural labor force. Between 1984 and 1991, the total output value of China's township enterprises rose from 100 billion to 1.1 trillion, at a net increase of 1 trillion yuan; total labor force employed by township enterprises also rose to 100 million. This means for every 10,000 yuan increase in the township ente rprises' output value, we can employ one more worker. In 1992, Anhui's township enterprises' output value was 58.8 billion yuan, and that year, nearly 600,000 people were shifted, an increase of 12.3 percent compared to the previous year. By the year 2000, Anhui's township enterprises will employ 13.80 million people, a net increase of 8.45 million compared to 1992; they will account for 49 percent of the total rural labor force. Of course, township enterprises' rapid development is constrained by many factors; fund problem is one of the main problems. Based on the province's financial situation, working hard to raise money from the masses, from enterprises themselves, through bank loans, and via foreign investments, we can provide township enterprises with an average of 5 billion yuan a year in development fund. Based on the current figure that each additional person must be outfitted with 5,000 yuan's worth of equipment, in the next seven years, it is possible for township enterprises to absorb another 8.45 million people. (3) Actively develop a rural socialized service system with emphasis on the civilian-run format, broaden employment opportunities, and promote the surplus rural labor force's shift to the tertiary industry. To develop a socialist market economy, we must have a fully developed tertiary industry, and the rural areas especially must set up a socialized service system. In 1992, Anhui's tertiary industry accounted for 21.4 percent of the province's total output value; it e mployed 15 percent of the labor force--both were below the national average levels. The rural area's tertiary industry is even weaker. Only around 5 percent of the labor force is employed in the tertiary industry. They are concentrated primarily in communications, transportations, retail shops, and restaurants and other businesses; few have anything to do directly with services before, during, and after agricultural productions. In particular, because circulation lags far behind production, agricultur al and sideline products and township enterprise products are stockpiled. To solve this problem, besides producing hot-selling products, it is especially important to enliven circulation services. We should emphasize building a rural socialized service system that focuses on circulation. Looking at years of practice, to set up and firmly establish a service system truly capable of shouldering this responsibility, we cannot rely on the government service organizations to do it all; instead, we must continue to give play to the government service organizations, but at the same time, we must actively develop a very vigorous, civilian-run rural service system. So called civilian-run rural service system is a kind of community shareholding cooperative organization that is based on family enterprises and is organized voluntarily by the peasants to provide services before, during, and after agricultural production. The basic mold is to make cooperatives its main format, marketization its basic direction, modernization its strong suit, and industrialization its general approach. It is an effective means to adjust to the development of the agricultural labor force and the shift in rural labor force during the agricultural modernization process, and it opens up a new way for the surplus rural labor force to shift from the agricultural to the nonagricultural sector. This kind of family-enterprise-based rural cooperative economic organization turns separate agriculture, industry, and commerce management into joint management; it changes the separate and solitary use of important factors of production to optimized composite use; it turns dispersed, low-efficiency use of resources into properly-allocated, comprehensive use; it reduces the multiple links and speeds up the slow circulation of agricultural products; it turns a single family's productive force into a combined community productive force, so that rural production and management can make the historical change from "separate" to "combined" and in turn promote the progress of the rural productive forces and the modernization of agriculture. Looking at initial practices, the civilian-run service system is playing a very important role in promoting the readjustment of the rural industrial structure and accelerating the development of the rural economy, and meanwhile, it itself has a large capacity for absorbing the surplus labor force. Its future is very promising, and it should be vigorously developed. (4) Reform the system of separation of to wn and country, accelerate the process of turning villages into towns and townships, and encourage the surplus rural labor force to move to the small towns and townships. Urbanization is an important norm gauging a country's or a region's level of modernization. The establishment of the socialist market economic system creates an important condition for smashing the dual, city-versus-country, socioeconomic structure. We should seize the opportunity, accelerate the development of the nonagricultura l sector, and actively guide its regionalized development, so that the masses of peasants will embark on the rural urbanization road by leaving the land and the villages, leaving the villages without entering the cities, or leaving the villages to build new cities. Since reform and opening up, Anhui's economy has undergone rapid development, but its urbanization standards still lag behind. In 1992, of the province's total population of 58.17 million, the cities and towns claimed 8.73 million, or 15.1 pe rcent; agricultural population claimed 49.44 million, or 84.9 percent. In 1992, the province's GVIAO was 133.3 billion yuan, of which industries contributed 72.4 percent and agriculture contributed only 27.6 percent. This structure serious hampers the unification of town and country and the process of modernizing agriculture. It not only makes it difficult to raise the peasants' income level or realize the goal of becoming relatively well-off, but the state's modernization process is also affected. It is increasingly clear that shifting the rural labor force to the towns and townships is an irreversible trend. The massive shift of rural labor force in recent years is but a prelude to the great future migration of peasants from the villages to the cities and towns. For this reason, we must correctly gauge this trend and actively promote the progress of urbanization. Internationally, there are two ways to achieve urbanization: centralized and decentralized. In general, for the industrialization of the well-developed nations early on, they chose the approach of expanding the large cities which brought a rapid rate of urbanization, but it also brought economic and social problems to the cities and caused agriculture to remain stagnation and even shrink temporarily. Nations that began their industrialization after World War II primarily took the decentralized approach and focused more on rural industrialization and the development of small cities and towns. This latter approach is more appropriate for us. Currently, Anhui's small cities and towns are spread out among the masses of villages; they are the rural political, economic, and cultural centers. In the wake of the development of the market economy, small towns and townships, acting as bridges and links between town and country, will shoulder the important responsibility of absorbing and transforming the rural surplus labor force. At the end of 1992, the province had 3,219 assorted market towns with total population of 9.167 million. Each market town had an average of fewer than 1,000 nonagricultural population. They are small-scale, low-level towns with little impact. Where people gather, towns flourish, and when towns flourish, people tend to gather. If, on the average, each market town doubles its nonagricultural personnel, we not only can permanently shift more than 3 million rural workers but can bring definite scale economy and cumulative effects to industrial production and the tertiary industry in the small towns and townships and impact and give impetus to the economic development of the surrounding areas. To build small cities and towns, we must insist on unified planning, proper layout, raising funds in all directions, comprehensive development, and the construction of other necessary facilities. First, we must choose some central cities and towns that have good basic conditions and good future prospects and develop them first, so that they can play an exemplary role and bring along the others. In terms of economic components, we must let the individual, private, and shareholding cooperative economies develop freely. In terms of industrial development, we should start out from the small cities' and towns' own conditions, set priority, and integrate the development of small industrial zones and markets. We should emphasize the development of the construction industry, the transportations and communications industries, the real estate industry, and other service trades to strengthen the overall function of the small cities an d towns. While accelerating their development, we should also develop the large- and medium-sized cities, so that they can be the source of radiation and point of support to the small cities and towns. (5) Set up an open labor market, expand labor export, and encourage the surplus rural labor force to shift across regional boundaries. In recent years, more and more of Anhui's workers have gone outside of the region to work; the number has reached 5 million. This trend of going outside of t he region to work has been coined by the cadres and the masses as "machine-less factory, counter-less shop, invisible technical school, and credit-less bank." It not only has increased the peasant's economic income but even more important is that it has forged ties between town and country and enlivened the factors of production, so that through this kind of labor export, many peasants have gone to the economically well-developed cities and regions not only to learn technologies but also to obtain information and enhance their sense of commodity economy, and more importantly, it has integrated the dual--town versus country--economic structure into a single structure and has created conditions for modernizing agriculture. Because of the many limiting conditions, in the next seven years or longer, it will be very difficult for Anhui to completely digest the surplus rural labor force internally, and there will continue to be big differences in economic development among the provinces. Thus, labor export will continue to be an important way to solve the surplus rural labor force problem. The trend of large numbers of surplus workers going outside of the region to work or do business will continue, and this trend will grow -- perhaps no fewer than 6 million people will move, which adds another million people or more on top of today's labor export figure. It is estimated that by the year 2000, there may be as many as 2.2 million people working outside of the province year-round. We should continue to advocate, encourage, and support labor export. In particular, we should gradually set up a labor market network that covers both town and country, actively expand the organized export of labor, reduce the kind of aimlessness typical of uncontrolled mobility, and promptly solve the problems created by the shift in the labor force--such as transportation, family planning, and public security--so as to promote the healthy development of labor export. III. Provide Active Guidance and Give Impetus To Accelerating the Shift Shift in the rural labor force not only involves the peasants, agriculture, and the villages but also affects the cities, industries, social life, and other aspects. It is a social project of grand scale, and we must mobilize and organize all sides to actively participate and work hard together in order to effectively promote a quicker pace in shifting the rural labor force. Today, the following problems urgently need to be addressed: One, we must further liberate our thinking, change old concepts, and conscientiously strengthen organizational leadership in working to shift the labor force. Because of the old traditional concepts and decades of economic planning, many cadres and the masses have come to believe that "peasants grow crop, and the crop they grow is grain," that "cities build factories, and villages engage in agriculture," and that "any shift in the rural labor force will weaken the agricultural base" and so on. They also embrace such small-scale peasant economy co ncepts as finding satisfaction in being warm and well-fed and being complacent with a little money, and these ideas have influenced and obstructed the shift in the rural labor force. Therefore, we must further liberate our thinking and free ourselves from the bondage of these concepts. We should have a "first-course procedure" to make the shift in the rural labor force successful. In particular, in terms of guiding ideology, the party committee and government leading comrades should deepen and heighten their awareness from the strategic high point that the goal of becoming relatively well-off, the industrial structure, and the employment structure are a "three-in-one" concept, and they should be diligent in guiding and organizing the shift in the rural labor force. It is fair to say that whether we can seize the historical opportunity before us, take advantage of the situation, and accelerate the shift of the surplus rural labor force are in essence an important indication of whether the leaders at al l levels, especially the key leaders in the prefectures, cities, and counties, are in command of all aspects of the rural tasks, and they are also an important test of the ideologies, concepts, leadership standards, and the ability of the leading group. Party committees and governments at all levels should put the shift of rural labor force on the top of their agenda and keep in mind the goal of becoming relatively well-off as well as local conditions to promulgate programs, procedure, and measures for shifting the rural labor force through the end of the century. We must insist on suiting measures to local conditions and provide different types of advice, choose the breakthrough points and the main approaches properly, pay attention to the typical effects, and give impetus to the task of moving the labor force. Two, we must deepen the reform process and promulgate and perfect other policies to complement the reform. In the wake of the establishment of the socialist market system, the policies and s ystems promulgated under the planned economic system no longer meet the needs of the new situation and can affect and even obstruct the movement of the rural labor force and the further liberation of the productive forces. In the spirit of reform, we should promptly promulgate, perfect, and develop new policies and system that are compatible with the market economy. More problematic is, for example, the existing town and country household control system and policy which seriously restrict the proper cir culation of labor force between town and country, obstruct fair competition, and hinder the processes of rural industrialization and urbanization and should be actively reformed in order to create the conditions to achieve fair competition and proper circulation of the labor force. The existing rural land management policy and system restrict the movement and relative concentration of land. On the one hand they affect the shift of the labor force to the nonagricultural sector, and on the other hand, the y prevent the farming experts from getting the amount of land they deserve in order to achieve economies of scale. Therefore we should explore land management system and policies that are compatible with the new situation after we have stabilized and perfected the output-related contract responsibility system. With regard to the rural area's various specialized technical and management personnel, we should consider the rural area's real conditions and make professional skills and management standards th e primary bases to formulate a unified set of standards for the rural specialized technical and management positions, create an organ to evaluate job titles and issue certificates, so that the hiring units can refer to those standards. We should set up a social security system and gradually provide collective-, individual-, and privately-owned enterprise workers comprehensive medical care, pension, job-related injury, and unemployment insurance, so that the workers' basic needs and legal rights and privileges are protected, so that they do not have to worry about the future after moving to a different sector. With respect to the industrial policy, we should encourage and guide the spread of agricultural and sideline product processing and parts and spares production from the cities to the township enterprises and small cities and towns to give full play to the superiority of the rural labor force and local resources and promote the development of the town and the country economies. Three, we should accelerate the development of the labor market and set up a network-type service system. Objectively, the development of the market economy requires a perfect market for factors of production. Similarly, a mobile labor force requires a labor market, advice, information, training, organization and other services. These in turn provide the opportunity and condition for the rural labor force to achieve free and proper circulation and to compete on equal footing. Overall, Anhui's labor market is still in a naturally dispersed, relatively immature stage. It has not formed a regional market or a network of service systems, and as a result, there is a lack of information and the channels are clogged, so that labor circulation often tends to be aimless. It is imperative that we set up a labor market system that is compatible with the shift and employment of the rural labor force. In this and next year, the province should focus on the construction of prefectural, city, county, and key town and township labo r markets and continuously expand, perfect, and upgrade them to eventually form a network. By the end of the century, we should have a fully equipped, well-informed, full service, standardized, and guaranteed labor service network that covers the province's every town and township and which links tracks with the national and international labor markets. It should basically shoulder the whole province's labor export organizational responsibility. To accelerate the pace of labor market construction, fund s should be gathered through multiple channels at every level. In accordance with the principle of "whoever makes the investments obtain ownership and reaps the profit," we should mobilize and organize the state, collectives, individuals, and the shareholding cooperatives to work together and vigorously develop a team consisting of all types of labor intermediary organizations and agents to form an open labor market and its service system. We should also speed up market legislation to standardize the la bor market activities and diligently protect the workers' legal rights and privileges. Four, we should set up a rural education system consisting of a "central program for three types of education" to improve the overall quality of the rural labor force. In the wake of the development of the productive forces, we are increasingly demanding of the quality of the workers. The existing rural education system is very incompatible with the need to raise the worker's educational and technical qualities. T his is manifested especially in the backward vocational and technical education and adult education which restricts the mobility of the labor force. For this reason, we must deepen the reform of the rural education system and set up a new system consisting of a "central program for three types of education"--basic education, vocational and technical education, and adult education. In other words, we must continue to focus on the universal, 9-year, compulsory education system, but we should also take the multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-format approach to vigorously develop rural vocational-technical education and adult education. Vocational-technical education should be linked to the colleges and universities and scientific research units at the higher level, maintain contact with various trades and industries laterally, and impact the masses of rural households below, so that the rural economic, science and technology, and education departments' human, financial, and material resources become one strong combined force. Adult education should consist primarily of practical technical education. The relevant departments and units at every level should get organized to offer the rural labor force training for different professions or of different types, so that every worker at least have one or two special skills. We should strive for a 1:1 ratio between polytechnic schools and regular junior and senior high schools in the villages throughout the province by the end of the century. For rural adul t education, we should strive to build comprehensive training centers in the counties, central schools in the villages and towns, and tutorials in the administrative villages. At the same time, the middle and elementary schools should offer manual labor courses, technical course, and vocational elective courses, and we should accelerate the education reform and school system reform to separate out the students at the end of their junior high or senior high school years and implement the "three-plus-one" system (that is, upon graduating from junior or senior high, students can enroll in a one-year, vocational-technical training course) to provide some students with directional or preparatory professional-technical education. The province, prefectures, and counties should set up vocational-technical education and adult education funds, provide paid services to get the development rolling, and vigorously advocate, encourage, and support various trades and industries, units, and individuals to open schools and offer training courses of all types. Through the "three kinds of education," we can accelerate the improvement in the overall quality of the rural labor force and create the conditions for the successful transfer of the labor force.
