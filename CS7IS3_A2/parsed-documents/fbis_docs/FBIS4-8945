The Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro, the ruling party in that Yugoslav republic, said that the peace process in Bosnia-Herzegovina had real chances to succeed provided the United Nations and NATO abandon the hasty and disastrous military operations against Bosnian Serbs and that the legitimate interests of all warring sides be equally respected in the diplomatic activities. This party, whose delegates are in federal parliament, assessed on the basis of a report on Yugoslavia's diplomatic activities presented by Republican President Momir Bulatovic, that efforts should continue unabated to contribute to the peace process and lasting solutions. The lifting of the international sanctions against Yugoslavia is an integral and inseparable part of a global agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the party said. The opposition Democratic Party, whose delegates are present in the federal and Serbian parliaments, is convinced that the establishment of peace in the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina is mostly in the interest of the Serb side, and an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, is the first step towards this. In a statement for the public, Democratic Party President Zoran Djindjic said it was necessary to respect the agreement on an immediate ceasefire in Gorazde, that both sides accept the immediate arrival of U.N. observers, that the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR) immediately demilitarize Gorazde as a protected area, and that the international community pressure the Moslem side to accept the Serb proposal on a truce in the entire territory of the republic. The Democratic Party's information service said that Djindjic had telephoned Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic to consult him and that the statement for the public was based on this phone conversation. Serbian Renewal Movement President Vuk Draskovic told a press conference that the only solution for the Bosnian crisis was an end to all military activities and the signing of a peace accord. `We are now on a crossroads - peace or escalation of war,' Draskovic said, adding that he believed there would be no more NATO air strikes. The leader of this opposition party, whose delegates are present in Serbian parliament, believes that it is necessary to place the heavy weapons of all three sides -- Moslems, Serbs and Croats -- simultaneously under U.N. control, and later to demilitarize the entire area, and that only then should a political solution be sought. Draskovic believes that it is in the national and state interest of Serbs to `distance themselves from the war-crazed minority, to brand war-mongers and war profiteers.'
