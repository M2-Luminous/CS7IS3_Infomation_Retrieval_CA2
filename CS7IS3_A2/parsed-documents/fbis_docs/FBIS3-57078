(For a while last year he was the Russian president's representative in the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone.) [Skukin] Do you intend to return to the Ossetian-Ingush problem -- this time in your new capacity? [Kostoyev] It will be time to extend the president's edict on the state of emergency in the conflict zone in a few days' time, and I, as chairman of the Federation Council Committe for Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reforms, will insist that a group of deputies travel to the trouble spot first. [Skukin] Issa Magametovich, what matters within your area of competence are truly urgent? [Kostoyev] It is essential to establish which power structures are to deal with what. The introduction of trial by jury has revealed Russia's all-around lack of preparation for civilized legal proceedings. Our laws are often ill-drafted and contradictory. A huge army of investigators from the former Security Ministry has been jettisoned, but not every lawyer is capable of being an investigator. These people won't be wasted; they are professionals, and they are going into commercial structures. Investigation, however, will suffer: Only 40 percent of crimes are being detected now. [Skukin] What will you be seeking to achieve when you start your new job? [Kotsoyev] I will be seeking firmly and persistently to ensure that when we draft Russian laws we include within them a mechanism for their implementation. Laws must operate with clockwork precision.
