FR940412-1-00026 FR940412-1-00008 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Coast Guard 46 CFR Parts 401, 403, and 404 [CGD 92&hyph;072] RIN 2115&hyph;AE45 Great Lakes Pilotage Rate Methodology AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and hearing. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard proposes to amend the Great Lakes Pilotage Regulations by establishing new procedures for determining Great Lakes pilotage rates, and revising the financial reporting requirements mandated for Great Lakes pilot associations. The proposed methodology would adopt methods which have proven effective in ratemaking methodologies used by regulators of other public service industries. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) does not propose a change to the existing Great Lakes pilotage rates and charges, but proposes to standardize the methodology by which those rates would be determined in the future. DATES: Comments must be received on or before July 11, 1994. A public hearing will be held on May 20, 1994. Details regarding the place and time of this hearing are discussed below under ``Request for Comments.''

Drafting Information The principal persons involved in drafting this rule are: Mr. Scott A.

Background and Purpose Under the Great Lakes Pilotage Act of 1960 (Pub. L. 86&hyph;555, 46 U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), vessels of the United States operating on register and foreign vessels must engage a U.S. or Canadian registered pilot when traversing the waters of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act, as amended, vests the Secretary of Transportation with responsibility for setting pilotage rates. The Great Lakes Pilotage Act 49 U.S.C. 9303 provides that the Secretary shall prescribe by regulation rates and charges for pilotage services, giving consideration to the public interest and the costs of providing the services. This authority, except for the authority to enter into, revise or amend arrangements with Canada, has been delegated to the Commandant of the Coast Guard by 49 CFR 1.46 (a).
