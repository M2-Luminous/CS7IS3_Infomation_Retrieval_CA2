Gen. Tran Van Quang headed a delegation of the Vietnam Veterans Association that had come to Paris to attend the congress of the French ARAC Veterans Association. On the afternoon of 29 October, Senior Lt. Gen. Tran Van Quang visited the Association of Vietnamese in France and met with more than 50 Vietnamese veterans of the Second World War at the association's headquarters at 16 Petit Musc, Quarter 4, Paris. On this occasion, Senior Lt. Gen. graciously granted an interview to DOAN KET. [passage omitted] [DOAN KET] In the past period, every time the head of the American administration has reviewed the embargo against Vietnam, "secret files" on "American MIAs" have always came to light. Some people have even said that you were the author of one of those "files." [Quang] As you know, in recent years, each time the American government has raised the issue of ending the embargo against Vietnam, damaging stories about American MIAs have appeared. The so-called "secret files" are part of this. In 1992, people published a photograph and claimed that the picture showed an American still alive in Vietnam. They also claimed that the Vietnamese government had sent a number of prisoners of war to the former Soviet Union. In fact, American officials have admitted that those stories are all fabrications. As for the "secret file" supposedly written by me, after meeting with me and investigating the matter thoroughly, General Vessey, the special envoy of the American president, and Senator J. Kerry admitted that "the materials are not believable." The reason is that the data are inaccurate. The number of prisoners of war mentioned in the materials are even greater than the number disclosed by the American government. What is interesting is that people have said that I reported those data to the Politburo of the Vietnamese Communist Party in September 1972. But at that time, I was in command on the Tri Thien-Hue front. What is the reason for these fabrications? It's because a number of Americans remain stubborn and want to poison Vietnamese-American relations. But as people know, continuing the embargo against Vietnam is immoral and contrary to the trend toward cooperation and friendship between nations, and this is making it difficult for us to rebuild our country. And in addition, this is harming American businessmen. I think that with an independent foreign line that desires to be friends with all countries that are striving for peace and stability and the development of our country and with the struggle of the wholesome forces in the world, including those in the United States, the effectiveness of the American embargo will gradually decline. [DOAN KET] Vietnamese in France in general and readers of DOAN KET in particular would like to know more about the Vietnam Veterans Association, of which you are the president. In particular, people would like to know more about the spirit and contents of the association's activities. [Quang] The Vietnam Veterans Association is a mass organization whose task is to foster solidarity among all discharged cadres and soldiers of the Vietnam People's Army and guerrillas who fought in the wars to liberate and defend the fatherland. We want to help each other to maintain a spirit of patriotism and the tradition of "Uncle Ho troops," help each other became a part of ordinary life, and look after the material and spiritual lives of each other. Other tasks of the association are to contribute to maintaining political security and defending the fatherland, disseminate experiences to the young generation, participate in the socioeconomic programs, and contribute to foreign affairs activities, particularly with veterans in other countries. With a tradition of patriotism and love for socialism, the Vietnam Veterans Association is doing its utmost to hit the above targets, and initial results have been achieved. Thus, the party and state and the people have confidence in the association, and they have given us encouragement and help. [DOAN KET] What are your views on those Vietnamese who fought in the Saigon army and who are now living abroad? [Quang] As for Vietnamese who found in the Saigon army, we feel that except for a small number who are still reactionaries, the great majority of these people, both officers and enlisted men, are patriotic people. Today, our country is independent, democratic, free, and united. National construction and national valor are stimulating all people to abandon the old hatreds and look to the future. We believe that those people will gradually awaken. With the great solidarity policy of the state, many of those who once worked for the Saigon regime are now making an effort to become integrated into the life of the people. They are seeking profits and and happiness in the movement to restore the country, and they are proud of the very important achievements scored by the fatherland. As for our veterans, we hope that those people will forget the past, look to the future, and quickly become integrated in the free and independent life of the country. Our forefathers said that "one drop of blood is more precious than a pond of water." The peoples of the world and many governments in the world are encouraging and supporting our renovation movement and so how can those people, who are Vietnamese, stand outside this tide? On this occasion, on behalf of all Vietnamese veterans, through DOAN KET I would like to wish all Vietnamese now living in France happiness and good health. We hope that they will return to their beloved fatherland and contribute to building the country so that it can catch up with the other civilized countries in the world and have a brilliant future.
