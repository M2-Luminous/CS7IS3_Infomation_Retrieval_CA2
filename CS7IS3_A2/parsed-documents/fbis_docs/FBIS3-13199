Attention has been drawn to the fact that Saudi King Fahd refrained from receiving King Husayn, who visited Saudi Arabia for the first time for four years. Our correspondent in Amman, Randah Habib, has this report on the interpretations heard in Amman today on this lost opportunity to normalize relations between Amman and Riyadh: [Begin Randah Habib recording] The meeting, which did not take place between Jordan's King Husayn and Saudi King Fahd during the former's visit to Mecca, echoed Saudi Arabia's refusal to normalize its relations with Jordan--relations that deteriorated during the Gulf crisis. The Jordanian officials, however, emphasize that King Husayn's visit was confined to performing the minor pilgrimage in a holy place that is open to all Muslims and that Jordan has not requested a meeting with any party. Nevertheless, Amman, according to the same officials, would have appreciated some cordial gesture by the Saudis. Diplomats in Jordan had expected a Saudi-Jordanian summit during the king's visit, the first in about four years. A Western diplomat today said the failure to hold a summit was considered an insult, which is not characteristic of Arab tradition, nor is it common for a head of state. He described King Husayn's visit as an outstretched hand, extended to shake the hand of the Saudis. [end recording]
