Unfortunately, a new wave of killing and plundering has recently engulfed the country. Why has this happened? [Vaitekunas] The Interior Ministry collegium meeting only provided criminal statistics pertaining to the first quarter of this year. They partially reflect the general decline in crime. On the other hand, the exposure of crimes has improved. This indicator is the key one in assessing the work of criminal police. The increasing number of grave crimes, particularly of premeditated murders, is cause for concern. [passage omitted] [Skarzinskas] President A. Brazauskas recently issued a decree establishing the Coordination Committee for Crime Prevention, to which you also belong. I wonder what joint action you have taken against offenders? [Vaitekunas] This is not a new institution. Back in 1993, a decree of the Lithuanian president established a working group for combating organized crime and corruption. This group was very active in proposing draft laws. It also assisted in preparing the Penal Code and the Criminal Proceedings Code, and revisions and amendments to the law on operative actions. Enlarged meetings of this group, which are also attended by the president of the Republic, address the most pressing issues of crime, the activities of law enforcement and other institutions, and grant specific obligations to officials and offices. In my opinion, this helps concentrate and coordinate actions. [Skarzinskas] You said at the ministry collegium meeting that you succeeded in striking a blow to criminal groups and splitting their ranks. However, your opponents, including Seimas [parliament] Deputy Chairman E. Bickauskas, are rather skeptical about the criminal situation in Lithuania. How could you comment on your opponents' arguments? [Vaitekunas] We do not work for single reports. There is the sole desire to stabilize crime, which is manifesting itself in increasingly new forms. I would say that it is incorrect to ignore any positive changes in our work. No one argues that we want to accomplish more by prompt actions. However, this is not production. [passage omitted] [Skarzinskas] The Interior Ministry is planning to establish additional economic police subunits. What will be their specific duties? [Vaitekunas] The Government of the Republic of Lithuania has adopted a decision to create an additional 100 jobs at the Interior Ministry Department for Investigating Economic Crime and its subdivisions in all towns and regions. Officials of these new subunits will specialize in the financial system and closely cooperate with tax inspections so as to better expose these crimes. The number of such crimes has increased recently. Our task is to enlarge the state budget through operative means. [Skarzinskas] Will the legalization of firearms for self-defense as of 1 April really help people protect themselves against criminals in the slightest manner? [Vaitekunas] One can only predict this. The position of the Interior Ministry is that we do not intend to issue mass permits for acquiring firearms. Life will show how much this law affects crime. Thus far, the number of crimes committed with firearms has not dropped. We draw on the experience of foreign countries in our activities, and we do not want to commit any grievous mistakes. [Skarzinskas] Most of our readers are interested in the current number of political prisoners in Lithuania. [Vaitekunas] There are three persons imprisoned for crimes against the state. [passage omitted] [Skarzinskas] The popularity ratings of the police are the lowest among legal institutions. Why is the community's trust in the police so moderate? [Vaitekunas] First of all, you are slightly incorrect. Out of the 10 most often rated institutions in Lithuania, the police occupy eighth place. These ratings also include courts, which rank close to us in the opinion polls. The police is trusted by 30 percent of those polled. Why this percentage? There are many reasons. Our strategic goal is to seek greater trust among the people. This is necessary not only for us, but also for those who are in trouble. The police ratings primarily depend on the results of our work.
