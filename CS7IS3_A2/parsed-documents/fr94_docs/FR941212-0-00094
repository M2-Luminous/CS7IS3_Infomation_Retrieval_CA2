FR941212-0-00094 FR941212-0-00019 (2) In foreign countries where the amount agreed to does not exceed $2,500.00, the requirement for obtaining a guardian may be eliminated. However, in areas where the FTCA (subpart D) applies, local law should be consulted as a basis for determining whether a court appointed guardian should be required. The requirement to appoint a guardian should not be imposed until a particular claim is determined to be meritorious in an amount that would require the appointment of a guardian. The claimant should be advised of this requirement well in advance of settlement negotiations so that the cost of establishing guardianship can be considered by the claimant as a factor in evaluating the claim. This requirement also can be eliminated if local law authorizes or requires a claim such as for death of a parent of the minor, to be presented on behalf of the estate of the decedent by an administrator, administratrix, or the like. In such cases, a settlement agreement signed by the administrator, administratrix, or the like will suffice if, under local law, such action is binding on the minor. (3) The above provisions are in addition to, not in lieu of, the requirements of §536.20(a)(5). (c) Claims involving incompetents. The above stated principles may also be applied in appropriate cases involving incompetents. Authority to waive the foregoing requirements in appropriate cases is delegated to the Commander, USARCS. If it is felt that the foregoing requirements are materially impeding settlement of the claim, the matter should be brought to the attention of the Commander, USARCS for appropriate resolution. (d) Claims involving workmen's compensation carriers. The settlement of a claim involving a claimant who has elected to receive workmen's compensation benefits under local law may require the consent of the workmen's compensation carrier and in certain jurisdictions the State agency with authority over workmen's compensation awards. Accordingly, claims approval and settlement authorities should be aware of local requirements. §536.33 Vouchers. Vouchers are prepared in an original and three copies. The original and two copies (one marked as comeback copy) will be transmitted to the disbursing office and one copy retained as a suspense copy. Upon payment of the claim, the disbursing office will return the comeback copy, which will be included in the file when it is transmitted to the Commander, USARCS for post settlement review. §536.34 Accounting codes. (a) Certifying an approved claim for payment creates an obligation against the claims appropriation for the fiscal year then in progress. Accordingly, the voucher will bear the appropriate accounting code for both the appropriation charged and the current fiscal year, irrespective of the date the claim accrued or was filed. Confusion sometimes arises at the end of a fiscal year; for example, an approved claim is certified for payment on 28 September (the last business day of a fiscal year), but it is obvious that it will not be actually paid (i.e., a check issued by the disbursing activity) until on or after 1 October (the first day of the following fiscal year). At the time the check is issued, the accounting code will not be advanced to the next fiscal year. Claims checks are issued using the accounting code of the fiscal year in which the claim was certified for payment (i.e., the fiscal year in which the voucher was signed). (b) The accounting code for each type of claim remains constant, except for the third digit of the code which is the second digit of the fiscal year (e.g., ``O'' for ``FY90''). The accounting codes for claims appropriations are published each fiscal year in the AR 37&hyph;100 series. Accounting codes used in the payment of claims and refunds, and their references, are listed below; the ``X'' denotes the space where the second digit of the fiscal year appears.

(a) General . Except as provided in §536.35(a)(1), when a claim has been determined to be payable, the approval or settlement authority will transmit the following to the appropriate disbursing office: (1) The voucher (SF 1034 or SF 1145 as appropriate) in triplicate, with a request that one copy be returned with voucher number and date of payment noted thereon. (2) Two copies of_ (i) The claim . (Under Subpart K this means DD Form 1842 (Claim for Loss of or Damage to Personal Property Incident to Service).) (ii) The settlement agreement, as required. (iii) Actions and other documents as required; for example, DA Form 1668 signed by the approving or settlement authority (as the substitute for action in small claims under subparts C, D, E, F, H or J) attorney general approval and court approval on claims for minors and incompetents. (iv) Original power of attorney, where appropriate. (b) Electronic payment procedures . At installations where electronic payment procedures have been implemented, the approving or settlement authority will electronically transmit payment information to the servicing finance and accounting office. The claim, the settlement agreement, any actions or other required documents, and the original power of attorney will not be transmitted to the finance and accounting office, but will be retained in the claims file. Instead, a ``payment report'' produced by the claims automation program provided such offices by USARCS, which evidences or supports the fact that a claims official has approved a claim payment, will be transmitted to the disbursing activity in accordance with locally established procedures. The method of transmission used should not result in avoidable or significant delay in the issuance of checks for claims payments. The payment report includes_ (1) The name of the payee. (2) The payee's social security number (if available). (3) The payee's address. (4) The date the claim was filed. (5) The claim number. (6) The amount claimed. (7) The amount of the approved payment. (8) The date the payment was recorded in claims records. (9) The claims office identification. (10) The claims office's office code. (c) Payments in excess of $2,500 under the FTCA (§536.78). Claims paid in excess of $2,500 under the FTCA will be submitted to the GAO with the same documentation as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section but with the following exceptions: (1) Standard Form 1145 will be signed by the settlement authority on the lower left side only. The space on the right side for the authorized certifying officer will not be signed. (i) Where a minor is payee, the full legal name of the individual should be listed on the voucher; for example, ``John Doe, Sr., as guardian of John Doe, Jr.'' Descriptive words such as ``Mrs. John Doe and her three minor children'' should not be used.
