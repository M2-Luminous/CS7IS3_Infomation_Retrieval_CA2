From the pedestrian to the policy-making level the mood is extremely sceptical of official denials that fail to stand up to scrutiny, even for 24 hours. The fact of the matter is that the Prithvi was to be tried by the Army for the first time, and for which enormous logistical preparations had been made months in advance. At the last moment the test was postponed to an unscheduled date. Simple logic prompts the deduction that something is amiss, especially given the PMO's penchant for overruling those professionally charged with fulfilling their assigned roles. So is the country to blame for smelling a rat when the stench is overwhelming. The attitude of the political authorities to the indigenous defence programmes is niggardly in its funding and inconsistent in its policy. But if despite these constraints, Indian scientists are able to craft weapon systems that rankle some, it is testimony to the nation's potential. The scientists are inspired by a vision of India as a proud, respected and secure nation whose sovereignty is not up for barter. Tragically, this vision is sadly lacking among those who are taking decisions on behalf of the people of India. Why accuse Washington of imperiousness when India's future is being compromised by those who perceive it to be a poor third-world country unworthy of aspiring to the top league? This third-best mindset has contributed to policies that declare India is up for grabs if some President Clinton or Lee Hamilton so wills. Postponing the Prithvi trials is yet another manifestation of this servility, and whatever be the proffered excuses they are not likely to seem otherwise to someone either in Washington or Warangal. The US knows what India is capable of achieving and is bent on ensuring that this is not realised. Applying pressure, overtly or covertly, leads Washington to believe that India can be checked. The Indian sees that lesson, and a more significant one as well. The soldiers who were to begin their familiarisation with the Prithvi and the scientists who developed it will now be convinced that when the chips are down the Government will also go down, on its knees. Delhi's inconsistency with the trials schedule is not simply a matter of changing dates. It sends an ominous signal that the country will succumb even at the cost of its security and sovereignty. After all, if there can be compromises over trial dates there is nothing to ensure that induction will not suffer the same fate. Testing is training, and greater the training the closer India is to perfection. In effect, it is a simple question of the vision for India. Prithvi, Agni et al, are metaphors for pride and respect. They have been made by, and for India. They are also essential in India's quest for an honourable place under the sun. But that presupposes a similar quest by those deciding the destiny of India.
