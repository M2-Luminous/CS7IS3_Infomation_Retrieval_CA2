A tourist coach returning from Turkey arrived at the Roszke (Hungarian-Yugoslav) border station on Wednesday [9 March] afternoon. In the course of a routine inspection, Hungarian customs officers discovered a secret compartment under the back stairs containing 136 bags of heroin, each weighing about 530-550 grams -- a total of 73.15 kg. The coach had been hired from a travel agency by a 29-year-old Budapest resident. There were two drivers, but only one of them, a 25-year-old man from Budapest, allegedly knew about the hidden drugs. The smugglers allegedly agreed with the owner of the bus to transport the heroin into Hungary for 600 German marks per kilogram. The owner is said to have been present during the loading of the drugs but he has not been located, as he apparently returned to Hungary by plane. Neither the identity of the owner nor the final destination of the heroin is known by the police. A Turkish travel agency manager is also suspected of being involved, but his role has not been clarified yet.
