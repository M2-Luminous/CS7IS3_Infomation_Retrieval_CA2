He also said that "as the guarantor of the Ukrainian Constitution, the president will act within the limits of his powers." He stated that the Crimean authorities had interpreted the attempts to find a compromise and work constructively as a sign of Ukraine's weakness. "Today, we are responding, perhaps with a delay, to the extremist moves by certain Crimean political quarters," he said. He laid the responsibility for a possible conflict on the central Crimean authorities who, he said, are pushing Crimea to the conflict. He also denied the reports about the landing of additional Ukrainian forces in Crimea and about an attempted seizure of the Crimean Interior Ministry. "We did and do act in strict accordance with the Constitution, but our patience may come to an end," he said. On 20 May, the Crimean parliament intended to adopt a resolution on restoring the Crimean Constitution adopted on 6 May 1992, which said that relations between Crimea and Ukraine shall be regulated by agreements. Presently, Crimean-Ukrainian relations are based on the Ukrainian law on the delimitation of powers between the Ukrainian and Crimean authorities.
