He added: It should be noted that the negotiations in which we have been engaged since the Security Council issued its resolution are based on the resolution itself. This is an intensive effort to implement Resolution 904. Responding to al-Shar', Sha'th said: We insist on Arab coordination. If there is a problem, it is because in Madrid, the Arab parties' accepted a phased solution interim period for the Palestinians. Hence, the Arab agreement was and continues to be that the PLO should hasten to achieve its phased solution so that there will be a single negotiating stage with the other parties over a final solution.
