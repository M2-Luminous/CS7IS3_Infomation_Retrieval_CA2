The sale, made by Westland Helicopters Ltd. from Somerset, was the best news heard yesterday in British business circles. The report was released yesterday at noon through the REUTER news agency, and was later broadcast during the evening television and radio newscasts despite the fact that the selling company had made no official comment on the deal. Without citing its source for the information, REUTER asserts that the contract was signed on 23 December. Westland did not confirm the amount of money involved as cited in the radio and television reports. The unofficial figure was learned of on the floor of the London Stock Exchange, where the company's shares put in a strong performance. Westland's preferential shares climbed by 9 pence during the day, closing at 2.65 pounds, or $3.97. The contract signed between the British supplier and the Brazilian Navy establishes that the equipment will be delivered over a period of two years. During the same period of time Westland must modernize the Lynx helicopter fleet operated by the Brazilian Navy. [passage omitted] The nine Super Lynx helicopters purchased by the Navy will be used for war exercises on the Niteroi class frigates. The aircraft were purchased thanks to a line of credit of 111.505 million pounds granted by the Brazilian American Merchant Bank. According to Captain of Sea and War Kleber Luciano de Assis, Navy public relations director, the first unit will be delivered in June 1996.
