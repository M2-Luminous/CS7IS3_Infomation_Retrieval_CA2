In the meeting, the president expressed concern over the fate of the people of Azerbaijan, especially those who live in the war-hit areas. He said: The war that is currently in progress in Nagorno-Karabakh and along the border between Azerbaijan and Armenia cannot be justified by any international norms and conventions, and fanning the flames of this war will not be in the interests of any country in the region or the world. The president stressed: The atrocious living conditions of the women and children refugees of Azerbaijan in the cold areas on the borders make it absolutely necessary that international organizations pay greater attention to the fate of these people. Moreover, Hashemi-Rafsanjani referred to the fact that from the early days of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia, Iran had foreseen its bitter consequences and made efforts to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. He added: At present, too, on the basis of its humanitarian principles, the Islamic Republic of Iran has provided shelter on the border areas to thousands of oppressed and helpless Azerbaijani refugees. Iran has done all it can to remedy the suffering of these refugees, and will continue to do so. In this meeting, Gasanov, in turn, expressed the gratitude of the president, government, and the people of Azerbaijan for the humanitarian aid given to the Azeri refugees by the government and nation of Iran. Furthermore, he presented a report about the latest developments in Azerbaijan, particularly the crisis areas on the border with Armenia. Earlier today, Gasanov also met and conferred with our country's foreign minister, 'Ali Akbar Velayati.
