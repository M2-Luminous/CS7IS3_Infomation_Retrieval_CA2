Chief of the Second Sub-division of the Tourist Police, Pol Col Sanit Miphan, said the three suspects are wanted by the US government which has offered a reward of two million dollars for information leading to their arrest. He said the Tourist Police Division has ordered its officers to be on the look out for the gang, who are also believed to have shot and killed two CIA agents last year. Pol Col Sanit Miphan said he had received a report from a foreign source that the suspects might be in Thailand. However, he refused to elaborate on the report because "police want to do their work quietly without attracting too much attention." Photographs of the three terrorists have been circulated to tourist police both in Bangkok and in such provincial areas as Phatthaya where they might be lying low. He identified the gang members as Mir Aimal Kansi (or Kasi), 30, a suspect in the January 25, 1993 murder of two CIA employees in Virginia, Muhammad Faruq, 47, one of the suspects of the February 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre that left six dead and injured 1,200. The third suspect is Ramzi Ahmad Yousef, from Iraq or Kuwait, who was trained in terrorism in Pakistan.
