How would you assess the results of this visit in general? And another question. When we talk about relations between Georgia and Iran, Georgia and Turkey, or Georgia and Russia it is clear that this is about regional problems and regional interests. However, what political interests can Georgia and France have in common? [Shevardnadze] Those who had the opportunity must have heard some of the assessments I made on the plane and at a news conference in Paris. I can state again now that the visit was very important. As you know, this was the first official state government visit. And the main result, as you said, was the signing of those two documents, which laid the foundation of law-based relations between Georgia and France. Without this foundation, there can be no extensive economic, cultural, scientific, or other kind of cooperation, which is something our society is so interested in. You know well from our history that in their quest for independence guarantees, our ancestors would often turn to France. I cannot say that the situation is the same today but, probably, one of the most important challenges for all countries on our continent is the art of building good relations with a country such as France as well as other countries. I think the fact that France is a permanent member of the Security Council is very important. The settlement and resolution of such complex issues as the conflict in Abkhazia as well as other conflicts in the entire [?Caucasus] region and the planet depend on France's position. It was very important for us to see for ourselves how they understand us in France and whether or not we should count on France's support in this regard. I must say that there cannot be two opinions that France understands Georgia's problems of territorial integrity and state unity as well as we do. They take our problems close to heart and understand them very well. Now, if we look at this in the context of other countries, why, after all, do Georgia and France have common interests? I would give a very general answer. This is because they are equally interested -- perhaps, we are interested even more -- in the building of a new Europe. [passage omitted] [Oniani] The treaty you signed in Paris is not an ordinary treaty. [Shevardnadze] You noticed that and told me on the plane [from Paris to Tbilisi] that this treaty was slightly different from some other treaties. That is right, since it reflects the Paris Charter, which we have just joined. As I have said before, it was the second time I signed it, but now in a different capacity [reference to the signing of the Paris Charter by Shevardnadze as Soviet Foreign Minister]. This time I did it in Georgian, which is also important. Apart from that, there are direct interests, such as economic relations with France. Forget everything else, we now subsist on EC credits. Once we received 70 million ECUs, then 40 million was allocated. There is now hope for another 10-15 million. We can have some hope for the future. We should not forget that EC credits do not fall from the sky. They are the resources of these European states. The FRG's share in this is 60-65 percent. I again want to remember with gratitude Chancellor Kohl's special appeal to the EC leadership to allocate credit to Georgia, which will get us through some more time. We should also not forget that France's share in this exceeds 20 percent. When I told Mr. Mitterrand that we are in economic hardship, he reminded me that France has done what it could by contributing its share and supporting the Georgian appeal. [passage omitted] I think it was a timely visit and a useful visit. Perhaps it came a little too late. However, neither the French nor ourselves are to blame for that. There were simply some objective reasons. [Oniani] Thank you. Batono Eduard, you have said that your position toward the ruble zone will become clear after your visits. There have already been two visits. There were visits to France and Turkey. In France, you met with representatives of financial circles. You met with Economics Minister Alphandery and with Jean-Claude Paye, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Has your position toward the ruble zone become clear? [Shevardnadze] No, when I said: After the visits, I did not have only the visit to France in mind. First of all, I had in mind Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia and meetings with him and his colleagues. A lot will be decided here. However, this is not all either. I am planning a visit to the United States, to Washington, which will probably take place in the next few weeks [dekada]. There will be contacts with the administration, which, of course, will be very important. However, my meetings with the Monetary Fund and the Reconstruction Bank will also be very important. If we receive some kind of a guarantee regarding the creation of a stabilization fund, we will then be able to struggle with more determination for our national currency, for the strengthening of the national currency, and so on. If such guarantees are not received, then we should look for another way. Therefore, all options are gradually becoming clear in the course of these visits. I have options but I think it is too early to speak about them. I do not know whether or not we will return to this topic but I would like to point out in a couple of words the importance of our meetings with regard to the conferment on Georgia of the status of a developing country. I do not know if you have a question on this. I would say that it was our first contact with this institute [not specified], whose headquarters is in France. The main result is that we agreed that a large group of representatives of this organization will visit Georgia. We also agreed on the approximate time of the visit. [passage omitted] I would like to remember with special gratitude my meeting with UNESCO Secretary-general Federico Mayor. [passage omitted] [Oniani] You had a busy schedule in Paris. There were 15 official meetings in the course of two days as well as beautiful ceremonies [words indistinct]. On the second day of the visit you met with Swiss Ambassador Brunner. At the end of the second day UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali arrived. We remember that prior to your departure for France you had a rather difficult debate in parliament in connection with Abkhazian issues. Did your position toward Abkhazia change after the meetings with Mr. Ghali and Mr. Brunner? Or perhaps you became even more convinced that your position was right. [Shevardnadze] These were extremely important meetings. They were followed by my request to the minister of foreign affairs, Mr. Chikvaidze, and a similar request made today to Georgian negotiator Sandro Kavsadze, and Zurab Erkvania, chairman of the Abkhaz Council of Ministers, to travel to Moscow. My conclusion is that some of our approaches are to be sorted out with Russia. Russia has its own version of a UN Security Council draft resolution. However, judging by our talk with the secretary general, there is a lot of work to be done on this draft. We must by all means prepare our own draft. We worked late into the night yesterday and it has already been prepared. For me, the purpose of this meeting was to find out how the UN secretary-general perceived the peace process and its stages. The main element in this process is the adoption of a new Security Council resolution. It is important how specific it will be and how it will reflect the interests of Georgia as a whole, including, of course, the interests of Abkhazia. I must say that many of my colleagues look in a simplified way at the adoption of resolutions. Meanwhile, it is a most complicated process. The secretary general told me that we should not look at this as if Georgia was guaranteed the passage of a resolution which would bring peace in a very short time. It will be very difficult. There are various drafts. Three or four possible drafts were listed, each of which could be adopted. However, major and serious work is necessary for that. Not only with the secretary general. He gave me a guarantee that he would struggle for it to be a perfect resolution which will determine the future of peace in Abkhazia. At the same time, major work must be carried out with permanent members of the Security Council. A plan of how to carry out this most difficult activity was also outlined. Of course, I became convinced again that discussing with the secretary general any other way of solving the Abkhaz conflict but a peaceful one would be simply absurd. And I think that rejecting a peaceful way today would rejecting one's own self. It is impermissible even to talk about it. Even talking about it must be ruled out. If any of the above-mentioned drafts is adopted, it will mean that there is a realistic way of settlement. I must take issue with some. Those who talk most of a military solution think the least about it. Those who think that such a solution is possible talk the least about this option. That is how it is in general. I think that behind many such statements -- I do not mean people who are embittered, those who were persecuted and tortured, perhaps this is how they feel -- are partisan and selfish interests, which overshadow a realistic attitude toward conflict settlement in Abkhazia. I attach extremely great importance to this meeting. It was a warm and constructive meeting. [Oniani] You have just mentioned in your answer that after the talks with Butrus-Ghali and Ambassador Brunner it became clear that we must agree our position with Russia. [Words indistinct] financial circles in Paris suggested to us that our relations with European countries would to a large degree depend on how good our relations with Russia are, whether we like it or not. You had talks with many politicians, including the president. Does Europe perceive and see the threat which exists in Russia? I mean the personnel changes, the increased activity of profascist forces, for example, in relation to the French president. Mr. Zhirinovskiy spoke in terrible terms about Francois Mitterrand. How well do they perceive the profascist threat in Russia? [Shevardnadze] I think that behind some politicians' statements that Georgia should build normal and good relations with Russia, is a great desire to see stability in Georgia. The French believe that normal relations with Russia, as we say, new relations, are some kind of a guarantee of stability. And not only the French think so. In general, Western business circles believe that good relations among the countries of the former Soviet Union -- and I am talking about Russia's new role in this connection; I will return to this subject some other time -- are some kind of a guarantee of stability. Business does not work without stability and it is natural that financial circles are interested in stability. This is the main interest of businessmen. Second, as far as the coming to the fore of profascism is concerned, which you have just mentioned, my impression is that France as well as other countries in Europe and the world are no less concerned about this than we are. During our meetings in France we again expressed the wish that the democratic way of development should be supported in any possible way [words indistinct]. [passage omitted]
