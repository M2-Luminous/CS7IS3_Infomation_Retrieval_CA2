The first four volumes of the reminiscences, already published, have been widely read among the people at home and abroad. Vol. 5 covers the historical period from May 1936 to March 1937 when an epochal upturn was brought about in the Korean people's glorious history of anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. Printed in the front part of it is a famous handwriting of President Kim Il-song saying it is the historical lesson from the hard-fought anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle that the destiny of the fatherland can be saved only by the united efforts of the whole nation. Also edited in it are photographs showing military and political activities of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) conducted briskly in the latter half of the 1930s with the Mt. Paektu secret camp as a stronghold, pictures showing activities of anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters including Comrade Kim Chong-suk, an indomitable communist revolutionary fighter, photos illustrating revolutionary art and publications created in the flames of the anti-Japanese struggle, and other valuable materials. The fifth volume consists of three chapters. In this volume President Kim Il-song recalls with deep emotions that the KPRA created guerrilla bases of a new form in the Mt. Paektu area and conducted brisk military and political activities in reliance upon them and that the Korean communists vigorously pushed ahead with the work of building party organizations at home. He also recounts his struggle to rally broad sections of masses around the anti-Japanese national united front under the banner of great national unity and to form a joint front of the Korean and the Chinese peoples and deepen militant unity and fraternity between them in the heat of the bloody struggle against Japanese imperialism, the common enemy. The book records significant stories about the revolutionary traits of Army-civilian unity and unity between officers and men which were highly displayed among the KPRA and people in those days, and emotional recollection of the glorious traditions of the revolutionary literature and art and publications created then. Particularly emotional are stories about the noble communist virtues of President Kim Il-song who showed deep loving care for and trust in anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who remained unfailingly loyal to the cause of national liberation and brought them up as fine revolutionaries.
