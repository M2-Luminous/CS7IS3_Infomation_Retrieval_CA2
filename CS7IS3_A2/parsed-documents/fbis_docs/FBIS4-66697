This is especially so because Egypt preceded most developing countries, all the Eastern European socialist countries, and China in following an economic open-door policy that led to a relative development of the services sector. A report of the national committee monitoring the Uruguay Round and the permanent committee on trade in services affirms this. The subcommittee on trade in services will begin meeting next week to arrive at a final report before the agreement is signed this April. Although many advanced and developing countries fear the consequences of the agreement to liberalize trade in services under the Uruguay agreement that is to go into effect in July 1995, experts in Egypt state that Egypt's service sectors--especially finance, tourism, construction, and building--are ready to deal with the world through import and export. Ashraf Shams-al-Din chairs a subcommittee of the permanent committee on the international agreement to liberalize trade in goods and services. He also heads the foreign markets and international cooperation section of the Financial Market Authority. He stated that Egypt's commitment to an economic reform program has effectively speeded the growth of the service sectors, so that they can compete on the international level. He indicated that these sectors would be ready to operate under the GATT agreement in only three years, although the agreement allows developing countries a period of ten years to develop their sectors to be consistent with GATT. Relative Advantages [Dhikri] In light of reports that other countries at the Uruguay Round of the international trade agreement failed to be convinced to remove their barriers to foreign financial services, how can Egypt benefit from joining the GATT agreement as regards trade in services? [Shams-al-Din] In many service activities Egypt enjoys relative advantages that increase its competitiveness in particular areas. The service sector has contributed greatly and increasingly to national income and to improving the balance of payments situation, particularly through the remittances of overseas workers, tourism, and the Suez Canal. At the beginning of the nineties, the service sector contributed nearly 76 percent to the balance of payments. Compare this to the situation at the beginning of the seventies, when it contributed only 13 percent. Thus, liberalizing international trade in services will realize a great export surge for Egypt. The service sectors rely basically on human capital and skilled workers in many areas. The agreement allows the service sector wider movement and a precise structure for exporting to foreign markets outside the Arab and African regions. This is of concern to us, according to a report of the permanent committee on trade in services, in such areas as professional services, work force, and building and construction--especially with regard to workers organized as groups or in exercising the right to establish service projects that rely on skilled workers. Opportunities for Egyptian Workers As for the immediate advantages for Egypt, the liberalization commitments that the agreement's member nations have made will provide opportunities for Egyptian exports of services, especially in sectors that have reached a high stage of competitiveness, such as banking services and insurance. Egyptian professionals will be given an opportunity to work in the advanced countries. The construction sector will be able to carry on activity in the agreement's Arab member countries--Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria--as well as in the African countries. In addition, the services agreement allows Egypt through its definite commitments to obtain modern technology, to access communications channels and centers of information about service activities and trade in various countries, and to benefit from other countries' laws in regulating and encouraging its service sectors. [Dhikri] Are there to be further negotiations about workers? [Shams-al-Din] Regarding the Egyptian work force (the individuals necessary to provide services), in addition to the commitments that have been made in this area, negotiations will be held starting in May 1994 to make the advanced countries' markets more open to organized, rather than individual, workers. Special Privileges [Dhikri] Egypt played a prominent role in the grouping of developing countries during the negotiations. What was the role of the Egyptian negotiator? Did the developing countries succeed in obtaining any advantages? Did any disagreement occur about liberalizing trade in services? [Shams-al-Din] There was no disagreement over the principle of liberalizing trade in services, but there was disagreement on definitions. A permanent committee on the agreement has been formed in Egypt. It has seven subcommittees, including one on trade in services. The role of each committee is to participate with the Egyptian negotiator, so that the negotiating takes place on objective principles that convince the nations of the world that we are part of an international fabric whose goal is to benefit from liberalizing trade in goods and services--but also bears in mind the economic and social circumstances that we must take into account while implementing our liberalization program. Egypt is part of the developing world. It stated its position from the beginning and played a prominent role in the grouping of developing countries. It acted as a spokesman for Africa and the Arab countries that have joined the agreement. Egypt also spoke in the same way as India and Latin America. Egypt was encouraged to play this role by its experience in its announced program of economic reform, which has won the esteem of advanced and developing countries alike. Our position was based on sound economic principles. Egypt officially entered the Uruguay Round in 1986 and announced that it was a party to the agreement. It participated in the 1990 multilateral negotiations. As for the developing countries, through their united stand in the negotiations they obtained special treatment in view of their weak competitiveness in most service sectors. The agreement on services included provisions that give the developing nations flexibility. Most importantly, they were granted a longer time to establish national information publishing centers to comply with the principle of full disclosure of local laws and regulations governing the service sectors under negotiation. Also, it was made easier for these countries to enter into economic integration agreements among themselves to develop trade in services or between themselves and the advanced countries, provided that the subjects of these countries are exempted from work and residence permits. Safeguards include measures to enable a temporary disengagement from particular commitments in case of a balance of payments deficit or if the member country needs to take certain steps to preserve its hard currency reserve. These provisions allow one to request that certain commitments be amended or withdrawn a year after the agreement begins to be implemented, without being bound by the ordinarily specified three-year period. In addition, the developing countries, including Egypt, are given sufficient flexibility to subsidize their production or exports in the services trade. At the same time, the advanced countries are forbidden to use subsidies as a means to increase their exports to the developing countries. A developing country may retain a monopoly right to import certain of its services during the time this agreement is in effect, provided that the monopoly does not carry on its activity in a way that does not accord with the provisions of the agreement. There are many additional provisions that give the developing countries, including Egypt, greater flexibility. Legislative Changes [Dhikri] What are Egypt's commitments under this agreement? Does its application require legislative or administrative changes? Within what time period can we accomplish what is required on the international level? [Shams-al-Din] Egypt's general commitments accord with the general commitments in the agreement. Most importantly, Egypt commits itself to the most-favored-nation principle, under which any member country of the agreement will enjoy any privileges granted to any other member country. It also commits itself to the principle of full disclosure--meaning that rules governing trade in services are to be published, announced, and disclosed to others. There are particular commitments in certain sectors. Egypt has announced its desire to enter into the international services trade in economic sectors that have already been liberalized in the economic reform program. Lists of commitments have been prepared in accordance with the regulations, laws, and rules that govern these activities, especially in the finance sector, tourism, and building and construction. The Egyptian delegation at the negotiations demanded that other countries in turn promise to open their markets to Egyptian service exports, especially the organized and professional work force. The definite commitments that Egypt made will allow foreign investments in Egypt to set up companies in accordance with Egyptian legislation in the sectors of banking, insurance, reinsurance, capital market services, tourism services, marine transport services, construction services, and engineering consulting services. Commitments in one of these sectors were made before the agreement; negotiations took place and an agreement was reached. The remaining sectors must prepare themselves philosophically in the framework of this agreement. They must work out development programs with the assistance of research centers and must engage in the necessary training--especially in the transportation and communication sector, the education sector, and the social insurance sector. We have worked as a committee to encourage more sectors to study the situation and to lay down a plan to mobilize the country's economic and technical forces. In this way the country will be able to announce its full position on the general framework of the agreement to be signed this April. As for the changes required, some pieces of legislation do indeed need to be changed--not to be in step with the agreement, but to serve the national economy. The nationalization laws have still not been fully repealed. We have begun the process of legislative change with the unified tax and the unified labor law. Change begins with general law and proceeds to specific law, specific regulation, and finally internal regulations--all for a single purpose more important than any other purpose, namely economic reform.
