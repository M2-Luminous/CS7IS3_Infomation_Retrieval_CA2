Foreign Ministry Deputy Spokesman Ferhat Ataman told a press conference that the massacre of 63 Palestinians in Hebron's Ibrahim Mosque by a fanatic Jewish settler should not hinder the peace process. Ataman said such "regrettable" incidents showed that the peace process was still in a sensitive and critical point. Ataman recalled that Israel proposed several measures to prevent such incidents from happening again, however the Palestinian people found them inadequate. After the incident President Suleyman Demirel called Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat [title as received] and expressed his condolences over the massacre saying, "I am shocked to hear the news regarding the brutal attack perpetrated against innocent Palestinians praying in the Mosque." Demirel also said Turkey was ready to do its utmost if help is demanded to further the Middle East peace process.
