The parties intend to consummate the transaction on or soon after the effective date of the exemption. The subject line, currently owned by CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), was approved for abandonment by the Commission in CSX Transportation, Inc._Abandonment_Between Deforest Junction and North Warren in Trumbull County, OH, Docket No. AB&hyph;55 (Sub-No. 449), (ICC served Feb. 12, 1993). EDRC, a quasi-public regional economic development entity, will purchase the line from CSXT prior to WTRM's commencement of rail carrier service. WTRM will operate over the line as a common carrier by rail serving shippers local to the line, and will interchange traffic with CSXT at Deforest Junction. The transaction is related to a notice of exemption concurrently filed in Summit View Corporation_Continuance in Control Exemption_The Warren & Trumbull Railroad Company, Finance Docket No. 32439 wherein Summit View Corporation (Summit) seeks to continue in control of WTRM and three other class III railroads upon WTRM becoming a class III rail carrier. 1 1 WTRM is a subsidiary of Summit, a noncarrier holding company which controls Ohio Central Railroad, Inc., Ohio Southern Railroad, Inc. and the Youngstown & Austintown Railroad, Inc., none of which would connect with WTRM.

If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Decided: January 7, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1016 Filed 1&hyph;13&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
