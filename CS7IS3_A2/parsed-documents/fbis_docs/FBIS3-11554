Explaining the recent confrontations in Chapare between coca producers and antidrug forces to the Senate Antinarcotic Struggle Committee, the minister flatly maintained that actions by the Mobile Police Units for Rural Areas (Umopar) in the tropical region seek to control traffickers, not coca producers. Quiroga stated that the actions in Chapare will continue despite opposition by coca producers. Regarding demands by coca producers leaders to sit down and talk with the government, Quiroga said he agreed to suspend the forced eradication of coca because "at this time no leader is under arrest." "Wherever we find a maceration pit or a cocaine laboratory we will destroy it," he said. He indicated that the government is awaiting a call from the Bolivian Labor Federation, which is mediating in the negotiations, to proceed with a meeting between the coca producers and government that is scheduled for today. He stated that the government wants to reach agreement with the producers, without implying any loss for the campesinos, and wants to stop the supply of precursors to the traffickers. He noted that the results of the fight against trafficking is reflected in the price paid for a drum of coca leaf: On 1 February 1994 a drum cost 270 bolivianos, today it costs just 90 bolivianos.
