She came directly from Strasbourg. Both Prime Minister Balladur and President Francois Mitterrand received the Norwegian guest -- the latter at the Elysee Palace. But there was no suggestion of dinner or any social pleasantries at the present time, in the days leading up to the funeral of Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst. According to the Norwegian prime minister, one of the most concrete things to emerge from the visit was that the French voiced "positive reactions" to Norwegian demands to the effect that the country needs time and a gradual transition to the EU's [European Union] agricultural policy. EU prices on agricultural produce from day one of membership -- the arrangement that has been proposed hitherto in the negotiations -- are unacceptable to Norway. And Prime Minister Brundtland said that inside the EU great importance will be attached to the view France takes on such issues. "This is after all a classic field for France," she said. Fish and agriculture are still the most problematic issues in the present phase of the negotiations. As far as regional policy and what support arrangements Norway and the other applicant nations will be covered by are concerned, things have been moving back and forth over the last few days. But Brundtland said yesterday that she could not imagine that it will be impossible to achieve some movement on issues to do with regional support arrangements. "The question of money has come further to the fore recently. It is linked to the EU's internal allocation policy," she said at a press conference. Brundtland's visit to Paris is part of the Norwegian strategy to work on the EU countries' capitals. While the EU Commission in Brussels has been accommodating on Norway's position on many issues, it is expected that the biggest problems are likely to arise in individual member countries in the final phase of the negotiations. "When you approach the end of the negotiations the EU capitals begin to see things in context. And then the tactical game starts everywhere," she said. The whaling issue was also raised in Paris yesterday by Prime Minister Balladur, but the pressure on the Norwegians from the French on this issue is less than that from several other countries. The Norwegian Embassy has received around 800 "whale letters." Norway is still intent that the timetable for completion of the negotiations by 1 March should hold. But asked whether she herself takes the view that Norway is in an ideal position, she said that "we have a few more undecided areas than Sweden." Brundtland also took the opportunity to invite Prime Minister Balladur to Norway. It is 10 years since a French prime minister visited.
