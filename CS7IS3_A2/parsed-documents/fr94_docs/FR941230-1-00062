FR941230-1-00062 FR941230-1-00004 (b) Effective dates. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the private activity bond regulations apply to bonds issued on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations in the Federal Register (the effective date ) that are subject to section 1301 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. (c) Refunding bonds. The private activity bond regulations do not apply to bonds issued on or after the effective date to refund a bond to which the private activity bond regulations do not apply unless_ (1) The weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is greater than the remaining weighted average maturity of the refunded bonds; or (2) A principal purpose for the issuance of the refunding bonds is to make one or more new conduit loans. (d) Permissive application of regulations. Except as otherwise provided, the private activity bond regulations may be applied in whole, but not in part, to_ (1) Bonds issued after December 30, 1994 and before the effective date; or (2) Refunding bonds issued on or after the effective date. (e) Permissive retroactive application of certain sections. The following sections may each be applied to any bonds issued before the effective date: (1) Section 1.141&hyph;6; (2) Section 1.141&hyph;13; and (3) Section 1.141&hyph;14. Par. 5. Section 1.145&hyph;1 is added to read as follows: §1.145&hyph;1 Qualified 501(c)(3) bonds. (a) In general. In applying the requirements of section 145(a)(2), §§1.141&hyph;1 through 1.141&hyph;16 apply to determine whether use of the proceeds of an issue (or private payments or security with respect thereto) by a person (other than a section 501(c)(3) organization using the proceeds in an activity that does not constitute an unrelated trade or business) gives rise to private business use, private security or payments, or private loans. (b) Reasonable expectations and deliberate actions_ (1) In general. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), an issue is an issue of qualified 501(c)(3) bonds if the issuer and the 501(c)(3) organization reasonably expect, as of the issue date, that the issue will meet the requirements applicable to those bonds under section 141(e) and section 145. An issue ceases to be an issue of qualified 501(c)(3) bonds if the issuer or 501(c)(3) organization takes a deliberate action, subsequent to the issue date, that causes the bonds to fail to comply with the applicable requirements under section 141(e) and 145 (for example, revocation of exempt status as a result of private inurement). For this purpose, deliberate actions are defined under §1.141&hyph;2. In lieu of this paragraph (b), §1.141&hyph;12 applies for purposes of section 145(d)(2)(B) (related to certain residential rental projects). (2) Remedial actions. The remedial actions of §1.141&hyph;13 may be applied to prevent a deliberate action from causing an issue to cease to be treated as tax-exempt bonds under section 145. (c) Effective dates. For effective dates of this section, see §1.141&hyph;16. Par. 6. Section 1.148&hyph;6 is amended by adding new paragraphs (a)(3) and (d)(1)(iii) to read as follows: §1.148&hyph;6 General allocation and accounting rules. (a) *␣*␣* (3) Absence of allocation and accounting methods. If an issuer fails to maintain books and records sufficient to establish the accounting method for an issue and the allocation of the proceeds of that issue, the rules of this section are applied using the specific tracing method. This paragraph (a)(3) applies to bonds issued on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations in the Federal Register . * * * * * (d) *␣*␣* (1) *␣*␣* (iii) Timing. An issuer must account for the allocation of proceeds to expenditures not later than 18 months after the later of the date the expenditure is paid or the date the project, if any, that is financed by the issue is placed in service. This allocation must be made in any event by the date 60 days after the fifth anniversary of the issue date or the date 60 days after the retirement of the issue, if earlier. This paragraph (d)(1)(iii) applies to bonds issued on or after the date that is 60 days after publication of final regulations in the Federal Register .
