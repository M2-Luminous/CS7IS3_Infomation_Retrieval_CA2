FR940318-0-00061 FR940318-0-00012 (D) The value of any other property, including any disqualified stock. (iv) Example. The following example illustrates these provisions. Example. (A) X Corporation has three outstanding debts, Debt 1, Debt 2, and Debt 3. Debts 1 and 2 are unsecured and each has an adjusted issue price of $100,000. Debt 3 is also unsecured, and it has an adjusted issue price of $90,000 and accrued but unpaid interest of $10,000. In a title 11 case, Debt 1 is exchanged for $50,000 cash and $20,000 of common stock, Debt 2 is exchanged for $10,000 cash, and Debt 3 is exchanged for $5,000 common stock. The individual common stock ratio for Debt 1 is 40 percent, which is determined by comparing the value of the common stock issued for the indebtedness ($20,000) to the amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to that stock ($100,000 adjusted issue price less $50,000 cash received). The individual common stock ratio for Debt 2 is 0 percent because no stock is received in exchange for the indebtedness. The individual common stock ratio for Debt 3 is 5 percent, which is determined by comparing the value of the common stock issued for the indebtedness ($5,000) to the amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to that stock ($100,000=$90,000 adjusted issue price and $10,000 of accrued but unpaid interest). (B) The group common stock ratio is 10.4 percent, which is determined by comparing the value of all of the common stock issued for unsecured indebtedness in the title 11 case ($25,000) to the amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to the stock ($290,000 aggregate adjusted issue price of all indebtedness exchanged for stock or cancelled in the title 11 case plus $10,000 accrued but unpaid interest less $60,000 cash received). Accordingly, section 108(e)(8)(B) is satisfied only with respect to the common stock issued for Debt 1. The stock-for-debt exception does not apply to Debt 2 or Debt 3. (2) Preferred stock issued for unsecured indebtedness _(i) In general. The common law stock-for-debt exception does not apply to an unsecured indebtedness discharged for preferred stock in a title 11 case or insolvency workout if the individual preferred stock ratio does not equal at least one-half of the group preferred stock ratio. (ii) Individual preferred stock ratio defined. The individual preferred stock ratio is the ratio of the value of the preferred stock issued for an unsecured indebtedness to the amount of the unsecured indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock. The amount of the unsecured indebtedness allocated to preferred stock is equal to the lesser of the lowest redemption price (if any) or lowest liquidation preference (if any) of the preferred stock (determined at issuance). However, the allocable indebtedness may not be less than the fair market value of the preferred stock or greater than the amount of the unsecured indebtedness. (iii) Group preferred stock ratio defined. The group preferred stock ratio is the ratio of the aggregate value of all preferred stock issued for unsecured indebtedness in the title 11 case or insolvency workout to the aggregate amount of unsecured indebtedness allocated to the preferred stock under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. (d) Definitions and special rules. For purposes of this section: (1) Common stock. Common stock is all stock other than disqualified stock and preferred stock. (2) Disqualified stock. Disqualified stock is disqualified stock as defined in section 108(e)(10)(B)(ii). (3) Liquidation preference. A liquidation preference exists if the stock's right to share in liquidation proceeds is limited and preferred.
