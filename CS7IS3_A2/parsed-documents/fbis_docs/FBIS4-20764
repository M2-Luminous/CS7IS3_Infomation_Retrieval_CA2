The study, prepared by Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahim Fu'ad Faris, economic advisor in the office of the Minister of State and Chief of the General Monitoring Bureau in Saudi Arabia, indicates that "hosting joint ventures in the free zone represents an important step toward gradually liberalizing production factors on scientific bases. It will also help indirectly to achieve economic integration among Arab countries or the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states." He said in his study, published in the most recent issue of TA'AWUN [Cooperation], published by the Secretariat General of the GCC states, that "for the hosted projects to produce the desired results, the Kingdom would follow a selective policy with the aim of establishing a free industrial export zone, and not only a free port. Industries would be located there to help create new added value." He indicated that supporters of establishing a free zone in Saudi Arabia hope it would achieve several objectives, such as diversifying the economic base and boosting the participation of the industrial sector in the GNP. Industry currently accounts for 10 percent of GNP, and oil accounts for more than 90 percent of the Kingdom's total exports, despite the remarkable development the petrochemical industry and other industries have achieved. The study noted that supporters of a free zone seek to encourage greater private sector participation, as an active free zone and the private sector's cash flow inside and outside the country offer the private sector investment opportunities to carry out its important role. The free zone can also help to transfer and develop usable technology to serve the needs of the Saudi economy. Proponents of the idea, according to the study, believe the free zone could increase the non-oil GNP growth rate by increasing demand for locally produced raw materials; stimulating exports of goods and services; reducing substitute imports; and using and training domestic labor. They also see the possibility of bringing home Saudi money abroad and attracting foreign capital, as well as helping to support the competitive ability of the industries the Kingom takes part in. Saudi Arabia's petrochemical production has trouble penetrating European markets, for example, because of taxes and other obstacles, negatively effecting the competitive ability of these industries. The establishment of joint ventures with other countries in the free zone would support these industries' competitive ability. Dr. Faris believes that "the Kingdom should heed the example of other countries so that Saudi Arabia will not repeat their unsuccessful experiences with projects that were hastily implemented during the oil boom." He pointed out that "the idea of establishing a free zone must be founded on the basis of its own merits." The study contained two propositions, one supporting the idea of establishing a free zone in the Kingdom, and the other not supporting it. It mentioned "that some of the encouraging factors that show the possibility of establishing a free port in the Kingdom are: Saudi Arabia's pursuance of a free economy policy; the volume and international standing of the Saudi economy, estimated at $50 billion annually; abundant capital and liquidity; and the excellent reputation and confidence the Kingdom enjoys in global financil circles, in addition to its political and economic stability." Among the obstacles and negative aspects of the establishment of a free zone in the Kingdom are, according to statements not supporting the idea, the high cost. Despite the Kingdom's excellent infrastructure, the establishment of the zone would require the spending of large sums, possibly in excess of $10 billion. The free zone in 'Jabal 'Ali, constructed in the late 1970s, cost $2.5 billion, or the equivalent of $10 billion in 1988 prices. Besides that, free zones have failed to achieve their goals--such as the transfer of appropriate modern technology--in numerous countries. And free zones have social and political effects that, it is expected, Saudi society would reject. As to economic freedom in the Kingdom, some people believe the Saudi economy enjoys sufficient economic freedom, and that the establishment of a free zone might not add all that much to it. For another thing, free zones are not considered, from an economic standpoint, to be part of the host country. If there were a concession agreement between Saudi Arabia and another country as the first country's condition for custody, then the free zone's products might not benefit in this case, as its products would not be Saudi, even if the Kingdom's share in those goods were substantial. The study concluded by saying that establishing a free zone in the Kingdom would require conditions, among them the use of a system sufficiently flexible in terms of guiding measures for establishing imported labor and their families; stimulating the financial market in the Kingdom; lifting many curbs, while retaining controls or enacting similar ones to reduce chances of repeating the stock exchange experiment in Kuwait; and studying incentives, to aid the success of the free zone without damage to the local market in the form of taxes, duties, administrative measures, control of foreign currency, and arbitration. It added that while the 'Jabal 'Ali free zone was the first to enter the free zone world, Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia and Iran, are considering or may consider their own free zones. It is expected that competition would intensify after the establishment of these zones, ending the chances of most or even all of them for success. Thus it would be necessary to invite relevant Arab countries, particularly the GCC states, to coordinate among themselves to avoid trouble.
