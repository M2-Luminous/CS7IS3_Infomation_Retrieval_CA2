This was expressed by the Indian Human Resource Development Minister Arjun Singh last night when he was addressing a press conference here. The minister will inaugurate the festival which opens with the performing arts components stringed together to play up the main theme of "harmony." The festival would last for 51 days. It was devised by the Indian Council for Cultural Relations as a multi-discipline extravaganza covering fine arts and folk arts, handicrafts and textiles, a seminar on literary traditions with eminent writers participating and an exhibition on English books published in India. A fashion show with emphasis on Indian motifs in contemporary garments and a film festival with eight feature films would also take place. India and China can benefit through mutual cooperation as both the nations have deep cultural relations and common interests, the Chinese Ambassador to India Cheng Ruisheng said while addressing the Fifth National Conference of Indo-China Friendship Society here yesterday. He welcomed the exchange of cultural and other delegations between the two countries for closer understanding. India is the first country ever to make a major cultural appearance in China in its recent history.
