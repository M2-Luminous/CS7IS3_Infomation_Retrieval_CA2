At the present time, halogen-silver photo-emulsion is the only material exhibiting a 10[.sup]-4[/] - 10[.sup]-5[/] J/cm[.sup]2[/] sensitivity with nanosecond exposure, and a dynamic range of _D_n = 0.1. With a 50-100ï¿½m thickness of emulsion, information can be recorded in 5-10 layers. However, the processing of materials with this thickness is difficult. Photopolymer is a convenient material for immediate reading after recording. The significant advantage of the photopolymers is the fact that there is no need for a ``wet'' processing, a self fixation with recording, and a substantial light amplification. However, because the power density in the recording region is much greater than the optimal, the sensitivity is decreased with recording. The other feature is the dependance of the medium absorption coefficient on exposure. Some characteristics of several recording media, significant for application with multilayer recording devices, are listed in a table. One of possible options for reaching a compromise between the layer sensitivity and the total number of layers is the application of a two-photon absorption. A possible recording diagram of a two-photon recording is described. With application of a two-photon absorption the fundamental problems of the multi- layer recording can be solved. This includes a uniform recording in a bulk and a non-destructive reading at the recording wavelength. However, the two-photon absorption coefficient for most media is small, and becomes significant only with a power density of 10[.sup]7[/] - 10[.sup]8[/] W/cm[.sup]2[/].
