It is irritating to see the government act slowly. After the Japan-U.S. framework trade negotiations and talks between Prime Minister Hosokawa and U.S. President Clinton broke down, there have been fears about the future of Japan-U.S. relations, calls for early resumption of the trade talks and proposals to lessen the friction between the two countries. While there has been sharp criticism of each other, Japan and the United States agree on the basic principle that bilateral relations must not be damaged. Therefore, swift action by Japan is the key to breaking the deadlock. Hosokawa must have had a plan ready when he said "no" to the U.S. Government's demands. How is Japan going to change and become a more open nation? We would like to hear Hosokawa's specific plan as soon as possible. At the same time, Japan must keep up a constant dialogue with the United States not only at a government level but also at the private sector level. During an upcoming meeting of finance ministers and central bank heads from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in Germany, a finance ministerial meeting between Japan and the United States is also expected to be held. We urge Finance Minister Fujii to make sure that the United States will correctly understand Japan's measures for boosting domestic demand, including the implementation of a tax cut far ahead of a tax increase. In the first half of March, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher is scheduled to visit Japan. Since the U.S. Congress supports the Clinton administration's negotiating stance toward Japan -- including the submission of a bill demanding that Japan open its markets or face sanctions -- Christopher will likely come to Japan with some very strong words. But the Japanese government should not map out a package of market-opening measures because of such pressure from the United States. It should do so on its own and announce it to the world. Under the circumstances, Hosokawa is now required to make a political decision. For help on his decision, the prime minister can look to Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], who has proposed that a goal be voluntarily set for reduction of Japan's current account surplus, that tariffs on manufactured products be reduced to nearly zero, and that foreigners' direct investment in Japan be completely liberalized. Such market-opening measures, which are easy to understand, are worth considering. However, while Japan's bureaucrats are certain to oppose all of these measures, we are tired of listening to explanations emphasizing only what cannot be done, instead of what can be done. There will be no way out from this impasse unless a new way of thinking is instituted. Japan can increase its imports much more if it uses the strength of the high yen. It can also reduce the current account surplus. According to a survey conducted by the Management and Coordination Agency and released on 24 February, there are quite a few factors within the administration to arrest the growth of imports. There are still many unnecessary restrictions on importers, and the import promotion tax system has not been fully utilized. In addition, about 70 percent of importers surveyed did not know there was an Office of Trade and Investment Ombudsman (OTO) that had been set up within the government to deal with complaints about problems related to opening Japan's markets. The survey also showed that nearly 40 percent of the importers failed to bring up complaints, even though they had some. One reason was that they were afraid that if they made a complaint against a government office, their relations with the office would suffer. If such a climate is not changed, no revisions of a system and no calls to increase imports will prove effective. We urge that relevant government offices thoroughly examine what is going on and improve the situation quickly. We also would like to see private companies gather enough courage to cooperate in implementing a reform to promote imports.
