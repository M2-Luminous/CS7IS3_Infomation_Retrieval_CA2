People who have hard currency are not so naive as to obey the edict and return the hard currency to Ukraine. This is an issue that confronts us all today. At present, according to various facts, there is up to $20 billion that belongs to Ukraine. No edict will be able to return these funds. They will be returned on the condition that those who own the funds receive guarantees that the capital will remain theirs. There should be a state guarantee that nobody will take an interest in how the owners obtained these funds. If we give such a guarantee then the money will be made to work for us. If we attempt to find out whether the money is dirty, gray, or white then we will do so until the end of the world." In an interview with a UNIAN correspondent, Vasyl Durdynets, first deputy chairman of the Coordinating Committee for the Fight Against Corruption and Organized Crime noted that the aforementioned edict of the Ukrainian president "is of a principled significance for our state." He noted the importance of setting up concrete time-limits, both for declaring hard currency valuables that are held abroad (10 days) and for transferring them to Ukraine (one month). Durdynets stressed the importance of the fact that if the regulations of the edict in respect of businesses are carried out then sanctions will not be applied and their directors and officials will not be brought to book. "This edict gives law breakers the possibility to atone for their sins and to fulfill their duties toward the state," noted Durdynets, adding that if the regulations are ignored other legal norms and laws would come into effect and he gave assurances that the law enforcement bodies would then act more decisively. With regard to the edict of the Ukrainian president on the fight against speculation, Durdynets gave assurances that the coordinating committee -- of which he is chairman -- that will supervise the implementation of this, will conduct steadfast supervision over the implementation of all its provisions. "I want Ukrainian citizens to understand that our actions are directed at protecting their rights as consumers," noted Durdynets.
