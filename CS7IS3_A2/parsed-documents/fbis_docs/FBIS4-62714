FBIS4-62714 "drsov096_f_94013" FBIS-SOV-94-096 Daily Report 16 May 1994 National Affairs Turkmenistan Said To Resume Natural Gas Shipment Via Russia Turkmenistan Said To Resume Natural Gas Shipment Via Russia WS1705141494 Kiev UKRINFORM in English 1637 GMT 16 May 94 WS1705141494 Kiev UKRINFORM English BFN [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 20, 9-15 May 94] [Text] As Mikhail Kovalko, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee for Oil and Gas, tipped off in an interview to UKRINFORM's correspondent, Turkmenistan notified Ukraine on 7 May about resumption of its natural gas supplies to Ukraine. However, the entire amount, which was piped from the Central Asian nation, has settled in Russia, according to the Ukrgazprom concern's dispatching service. Its factual piping from Russia to Ukraine is expected to occur by 17 May. In this way, daily Turkmen gas piping is supposed to average 75 to 80 million cu. m [cubic meters]. By that time, Ukraine's delegation is to finalize an agreement with the Russian Gazprom supplier on charges for Turkmen gas transit piping through Russia's territory to Ukraine's border. The Ukrainian delegation was in Moscow on 15 and 16 May. On 19 May Gazprom's delegation is expected to arrive in Kiev to negotiate this and other issues of mutual interest with the Ukrainian Government. More likely than not, the Russian delegation will push for Russia's hand in Ukrainian joint-stock societies to be set up as a result of denationalization of Ukraine's oil and gas complex (in the context of President Kravchuk's decree on establishment of the holding-type National Joint-Stock Company). Turkmenistan's announcement about gas supply resumption (if ever Turkmen gas reaches Ukraine) probably occurred quite unrelated to the problem of Ukraine's indebtedness to Turkmenistan for the latter's natural gas supplies, though it was precisely this reason that Turkmenistan mentioned, when it terminated gas supplies to Ukraine in mid-February. So far, there has been no official confirmation of the "Republika" concern's repayment of Ukraine's debt, which intention was widely rumored in March (see UBN No. 16/1994), since the concern was authorized to do so by the Ukrainian Government. Moreover, on 5 April acting Prime Minister Zvyahilskyy complained that he could not contact Igor Bakai, the concern's president, and that the government did not possess money enough to repay the debt on its own. Should Turkmen gas supplies prove regular, Ukrgazprom would stock them in underground storages, as well as natural gas amounts, economized by domestic consumers, to be utilized during the fall-winter heating period. In this way, Ukraine could receive about 20 billion cu. m. of Turkmen gas (1994's original figure was set at 28 billion cu. m.). The issue of repayment remains open, however. Russian natural gas supplies within the 6 through 13 May period exceeded the planned amount by 247.2 million cu. m. (they totalled 3,959.2 million cu. m.). Their daily amount averaged 565.6 million cu. m. Ukraine's gas consumption during the same period amounted to 1,448.3 million cu. m. versus the expected figure of 1,847.3 million cu. m. with the daily consumption average of 906.9 million cu. m.
