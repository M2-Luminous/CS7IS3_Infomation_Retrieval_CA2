The official said that although North Korea seems to be making this assertion on the basis that the exchange of special envoys was not specified in the U.S.-North Korean written agreement in New York, the exchange of special envoys was agreed upon internally between the United States and North Korea, though the United States acceded to the North Korean demand not to include it in the written agreement. The official said that, therefore, Kang Sok-chu's allegation that the text of the New York agreement mentions only the resumption of the working contact and that it does not make any reference to the realization of the exchange of special envoys is an absurd allegation aimed at overturning the explicit agreement between the United States and North Korea.
