Kazan Close to Victory in Dispute With Moscow"] [Text] Yesterday Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev held intensive talks with the Russian Government in preparation for the meeting between Mintimer Shaymiyev and Boris Yeltsin. According to reports received by KOMMERSANT-DAILY, the Tatarstan president is to arrive in Moscow this weekend to discuss with the Russian president the final conditions for signing an interstate treaty. The document, which will be unprecedented for the Russian Federation, will give Tatarstan -- one of the most powerful components in economic terms -- a special status compared with other regions. Mintimer Shaymiyev's views on Russia's structure differ from Boris Yeltsin's. In the Tatarstan president's opinion, the federation should be built not from Moscow, but from the regions, which will hand over to the center only those powers they are unable to exercise on their own. At the same time, Mintimer Shaymiyev consistently dismisses charges that the republic is going to secede from the federation. "What we are standing for is not a secession from Russia, but treaty-based relations and a voluntary transfer of a number of powers to the center. Tatarstan does not plan to set up its own army, or to erect a border, or to quit the ruble zone," he said in one of his interviews. Tatarstan Vice President Vasiliy Likhachev conducted talks with Viktor Chernomyrdin, Yuriy Yarov, and Sergey Shakhray to settle with them the last five agreements on which the treaty "On the Delegation of Terms of Reference and Powers of State Authorities" will actually be based. There is a total of 12 agreements, out of which seven were signed last year, when Tatarstan had its way by skillfully playing on the conflict between the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet. Reports that Tatarstan is ready to take part in the new elections for the Federal Assembly scheduled for 13 March and that Mintimer Shaymiyev and Farid Mukhametshin are even going to run for the Federal Assembly's upper chamber suggest that the remaining five agreements will also be signed. Evidently, this is the price Kazan will have to pay for a treaty that will recognize the sovereignty of a republic where Boris Yeltsin, then a candidate for the Russian presidency, made a statement that secured him support from the regions: "Take as much sovereignty as you can digest." In mid-February Boris Yeltsin will leave for Kazan to reap the first fruits of that statement. Afterward, however, no one will be able to say whether they will be the last ones or whether other republics will follow Tatarstan's suit. Predicting whether Kazan's appetites will be satisfied by a bilateral treaty will be just as difficult a task. A list of agreements on the basis of which the treaty between Russia and Tatarstan will be concluded Signed in 1993 Agreements on the prospecting and production of oil; on ownership matters; on the mutual delegation of powers regarding defense industries; on customs; on the organization and transportation of oil and oil products; on environmental cooperation; on education policy. Expected to be signed in February 1994 Agreements on the budget; on the banking system; on foreign economic activity; on combating crime; on military organization. Commentary A special relationship between Tatarstan and Moscow has been determined primarily by the federal authorities' interest in maintaining their influence in a region that is strategically important for the Russian economy. It is there that a number of Russia's largest monopolistic enterprises, such as KamAZ, "Kazanorgsintez," and "Tasma," are located. The republic accounts for 40 percent of polyethylene; 34 percent of thermoplastic tubes; 100 percent of motion picture and photo films; and 53 percent of diesel trucks manufactured in Russia. Moscow's considerable dependence on Kazan for various industrial products has been compounded by Tatarstan's monopoly of military aircraft and helicopter production (Tu-160 Blackjack and Tu-22M3 Backfire strategic bombers, Mi-8, Mi-8MTB, Mi-9, and Mi-17 multipurpose helicopters). So, serious arguments in a dialogue with Moscow have made Tatarstan, along with Yakutia, an "ice breaker" in pushing through regional export quotas. Last year, the republic was given a quota to export 8 million tonnes of oil out of the 25 million tonnes it produced. The federal authorities, however, have just as weighty economic trump cards. In particular, they may capitalize on extremely scanty natural gas reserves in Tatarstan. More important, however, is the problem of the republic's independent sales of its production, primarily oil. It is not only the need to use Russian oil pipelines that matters. Tatar oil, given its high sulfur content, does not hold particular interest for foreign consumers. This is the reason it is mixed with Tyumen oil to obtain a product known on the world market as "Soviet export mix."
