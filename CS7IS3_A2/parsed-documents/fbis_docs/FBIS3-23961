Gaydar, leader of Russia's Choice, and his team. The gap in incomes has made life unbearable for them. So they wanted to make everyone equal. True, the excessive wealth detected by the worthy reformers was not at all in the possession of the latter-day nouveaux riches, but in the possession of...Northerners--doctors, teachers, librarians, and pensioners--who are supposedly receiving enormous sums for nothing. And they propose only one way of eliminating this "crying injustice": to take away the northern and regional coefficients and to make everyone equally indigent. Yes, it was this very topic that was discussed on 15 December of last year by Yu. Yarov, E. Pamfilova, and others who had gathered at Ye. Gaydar's office. In the draft edict of the president, hastily put together in the bowels of the Ministry of Finance on instructions from the high-level gathering, this is directly stated: "The existing system of benefits and compensations (for Northerners) levels the measures taken by the president and the Government of the Russian Federation on social protection of the needy and insufficiently provided-for strata of society, and it increases the inequality of citizens who are living in the same climatic conditions and receiving benefits for the discomfort of their living conditions. A significant disproportion in incomes of separate strata of the population has become apparent in the payment of regional coefficients and percentage wage increases in the regions of the Far North, and in localities and regions of equal status, where regional coefficients have been established by legislation currently in force." Further, the Council of Ministers is given the instruction: "In one month's time, prepare the appropriate decision, meaning the revocation of baseless benefits and compensations, and the elimination of disproportions in the incomes of separate strata of the population due to paid benefits and compensations and the limiting of the total size of payments of regional coefficients and percentage wage increases to six times the amount of the minimum monthly wage." In the regular draft law on the North that is affixed to the edict, many of the compensations won by the working people have been revoked (for instance, paid fare to a vacation place once every two years), and the previous law, which had been worked out with such assiduity and adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, has been, to all practical purposes, liquidated. But we shall see what the measures proposed by Ye. Gaydar, B. Fedorov, and company (I speak of these people advisedly, for despite the formal exit of these gentlemen from the government, it is precisely now that their drafts are being intensively "forced through") will bring the Far North and its inhabitants. The edict will concern primarily workers paid from the budget and workers in subsidized sectors. And to a greater degree, even, than proposed by the rosy-cheeked fighters for justice. The point is that in the packet of affixed documents, the guarantees and compensations are called state ones, although their carrying out is entrusted to enterprises and organizations, and also to local budgets. Considering their disastrous position, it is possible to say straight out: Compensations will inevitably be curtailed, with the exception, perhaps, of payments of the above-mentioned sixfold minimum wages. Will they cover the real needs of northerners? Today the total sum of the regional coefficients and northern supplements in regions of the Far North fluctuate between 150 percent and 200 percent. That is, with the payment of a base salary of 100,000 rubles [R], the worker is entitled to another R150,000 or R200,000. Is this a lot or a little? The cost of food products in Kolyma is seven or eight times higher than in Moscow, and four times higher than in the Far East. A loaf of bread, for example, costs R1,500 here; a liter of milk, R3,000; 10 eggs, R4,000; and a kilogram of meat, R15,000. The basket of physiological survival--of the minimum selection of food products capable just barely of sustaining life--cost R70,000 in Magadan in December, and in the backwoods of the oblast it cost R120,000. But after all, a person wants not only to survive, but to live--to eat, drink, clothe himself, and support his family in normal fashion. Until now, workers paid from the budget, thanks to a contrasting replacement of coefficients, have been able to maintain their not very substantial existence. At the end of last year their average salary in Chukotka amounted to R150,000-R180,000, which is already higher than the level that the Gaydarites propose to establish. But in fact since the new year, prices, running ahead of the wage increase promised by the president, surged sharply higher. The cost of electricity, heating, and hot and cold water is going up by a factor of five; apartment rents are going up 10-fold. By May, specialists predict an increase in the price of a liter of milk to R5,000 in Magadan and to R8,000 in Kolyma, and the price of 10 eggs, to R6,000-R9,000. These prognoses, without a doubt, will prove justified, for a lack of fodder has compelled the slaughter of cows and hens--their numbers now amount to a third of what they were before the reforms. This means that in the near future we must expect a four- or fivefold increase in the cost of living, at a minimum. The rottenest thing about it is that the northerner has nowhere to go from this hopeless situation. He can no longer go anywhere from here. Just one ticket, for instance, from Susuman to Novosibirsk costs half a million rubles. And with all one's household things--R3-4 million. Whereas according to the latest government decree, a person moving away from Kolyma can receive for his vacated housing only 10 minimum wages for every year worked. That is, for 20 years of northern work, a person is entitled to an amount that is insufficient even to pay for his freight. And such a "good life" brings down on northerners the accusation of extravagance. Oh Lord, what is it that makes those in power hate their own people so? The Magadan association of trade unions called on the citizens of Kolyma actively to oppose the adoption of these acts. "The main thing here is not to allow the signing by the president of the draft edict prepared by the Ministry of Finance," says the chairman of the association, A. Makhankov. "The draft law must be discussed in the Federal Assembly, where it will inevitably be voted down. But the edict, having become a fait accompli, will make the defense of northerners' vital interests immeasurably more difficult." And that is why rallies are being held at enterprises in the oblast, and an appeal is being drafted to the government and the president, protesting against the new infringement of the rights of northerners. A fundamentally different attitude toward these events is being expressed by the oblast administration. "Inflaming popular opinion, the trade unions are pursuing their own political ends," believes its head, V. Mikhaylov. "No one has come to discuss these documents with us by the official channels, and therefore we cannot believe just any conjecturings." In other words, the administration considers what is happening to be merely provocation on the part of the trade unions, resting on no real grounds. The administration is playing games. The trade unions provided it with copies of the documents put "into production" by the Gaydarites.
