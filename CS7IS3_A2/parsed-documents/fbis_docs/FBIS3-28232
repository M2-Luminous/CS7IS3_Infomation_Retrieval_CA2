Zhu is expected to meet Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Tokyo to discuss bilateral issues, including ways Japan can support reform and open-door policies in China, the sources said. Zhu, who is regarded as a possible successor to Premier Li Peng, will also seek increased investment from the Japanese private sector in China at meetings with top business leaders. During the 10-day visit, the vice premier also plans to visit Osaka and Fukuoka, western Japan, to inspect local business activities and seek cooperation from private concerns. Both nations agreed on Zhu's visit to Japan when Hata went to Beijing in January. Zhu's visit to Japan is the first since he assumed his post in April 1991.
