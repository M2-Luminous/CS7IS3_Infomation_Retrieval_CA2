Shen Guofang, speaking at a weekly ministry briefing, refused to go into details about the 1961 treaty, saying only there is still room and the possibility for the participants involved in the nuclear issue on North Korea to arrive at "a proper settlement." Article 3 of the 1961 Sino-North Korean Mutual Aid Treaty stipulates that if either China or North Korea is invaded by a third country, mutual aid will be offered to the country under invasion. "When one of the signatory countries of the treaty enters a state of war due to the military attack of another country or its ally, then the other signatory country must immediately, to the extent of its authority, offer military and other aid," the treaty states in a Japanese translation. Shen, reiterating that China does not want to see the development of such a situation, said, "it is our hope that all the parties concerned choose not to talk about war but talk about ways for solving the nuclear issue." He did not comment on North Korea's unilateral position that any UN sanctions will be treated as "a declaration of war" but said, "we hope that the interested parties will carry on their dialogues and try to relax the tensions in order to find a proper solution in the end." The UN Security Council is considering implementing sanctions on North Korea in an effort to urge the Stalinist state to accept international inspections of its suspected nuclear weapons program. The treaty could be seen as a good indication that China will use its power as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to veto any sanctions resolution, analysts said. The treaty, signed by the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and North Korea leader Kim Il-song, also stipulates that neither signatory will join any kind of international bloc against the other signatory.
