The supply of farm produce is directly related to stable prices and an improvement in the people's livelihood, and an increase in the peasants' income, is directly related to market development. It is the crux of rural work at present and in the future and an important and pressing task for the vast numbers of peasants and rural cadres to increase the peasants' income. The successes attained in China's agriculture since reform are obvious to all. However, the problems exposed in development are also worrisome. Of all the problems, the most serious ones are the declining efficiency in agriculture and the slow growth in the peasants' income. The peasants' income increased rapidly at an annual rate of 13.9 percent from 1978 to 1984. The enthusiasm of the peasants for farming ran unprecedentedly high and the output of farm produce increased by a wide margin during that period. Take grain output for example: The figure rose from 300 billion kg in 1978 to 400 billion kg in 1984, an increase of 100 billion kg in six years. Before rural reform, it took 20 years to get an additional 100 billion kg of grain. After 1985, however, the peasants' income did not increase despite the increase in output, or the output increased remarkably but their income increased slightly. In the eight years from 1985 to 1993, the peasants' incomes increased by an annual rate of only 2 percent. Income fell behind production growth. As a result, the annual growth target of 5.4 percent required for attaining the comparatively well-off goal was out of reach. The main reason for the problem is the irrational price relationship between farm and manufactured goods and the low economic efficiency of agriculture. On the one hand, the price of farm produce, driven by overall price hikes, rose. But the extent was still lower than the increase in the price of means of production. In other words, the price of products was lower than the price of materials and cost, resulting in high input but low efficiency. On the other hand, the increase in the price of farm produce was far lower than that in manufactured goods which used farm produce as materials. As agricultural production could not share the average social profits, agriculture, which is a basic industry, was thrown into an unfavorable position. As a consequence, income from agriculture, which constituted 70 to 80 percent of the source of peasants' average per capita income, rose at a slow pace, and even dropped in some regions. The problems caused by the drop in peasants' income were serious: First, the market for rural consumer goods remained weak, growth dropped, and consumer goods bought by rural inhabitants, who accounted for over 80 percent of the country's total population, accounted for 40 percent of total retail sales. Second, the input in agriculture decreased. In some economically developed regions, the tendency of neglecting agriculture was more obvious, the amount of cultivated land and sown area of grain decreased while large amount of agricultural funds flowed nonagricultural fields. Third, because of the irrational prices, the peasants are not enthusiastic to sell farm produce to the state. Some are waiting for better prices. As a result, the amount of major farm produce including grain, cotton, and edible oil possessed by the state decreased, which affected its capacity for macroeconomic regulation and control. Fourth, the low income of the peasants added difficulties to the development of rural social welfare undertakings. As the income of most of the peasants is not high and the growth in their income has decreased instead of increasing, it will be impossible to transform the outlook of the rural areas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphatically pointed out on numerous occasions: "Without rural stability, there will be no stability in the overall political situation. If the peasants have not extricated themselves from poverty, it means that our country has not extricated itself from poverty." "Without the enthusiasm of the peasants, it will be difficult for the state to develop." Hence, we should look at the peasants' incomes from the high plane of social stability, political stability, and coordinated development of the national economy as a whole. In light of the requirements of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Central Rural Work Conference, and the National Agricultural Work Conference, it is necessary to stabilize the party's basic policies in the rural areas, further deepen rural reform, appropriately settle the outstanding problems arising from rural economic development, and try by every means to increase the peasants' income. To increase the peasants' income, it is necessary to first focus attention on developing production. While ensuring the sown area of grain, cotton, and edible oil, we should vigorously readjust agricultural production and product mix, develop quality, high-yield, and efficient agriculture. Of the growth in peasants' income last year, over 30 percent derived from township enterprises. This is an important source for increasing the peasants' income, which should be firmly grasped. Second, it is necessary to gradually readjust the purchase price of farm produce and reduce the price scissors between industrial and farm products. To stabilize consumption by the inhabitants, it is necessary to establish a risk fund and adopt other measures to curb price hikes and prevent a price spiral. Third, to increase input in agriculture, the state should readjust the investment in capital construction, budgetary funds, and credit, increase the proportion of investment in agriculture, and support agricultural development. Fourth, the circulation for farm produce should be unclogged and the rural market should be invigorated. The peasants should be organized to enter the market, develop production-supply-marketing and trade- industry-agriculture integrated organizations, and reduce the loss in profits from the intermediate links. Fifth, to increase the peasants' incomes, further efforts should be made to alleviate the peasants' burden. In places where the peasants' burden is lightened and the unreasonable charges are removed, these practices should not be allowed to reoccur under any excuse. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the "help-the-poor scheme" and do well the work of helping the poor. The question of agriculture, rural areas, and peasants has always been a fundamental one in China's revolution and construction. It is an economic, as well as a political task, to try by every means to increase the peasants' incomes. From the strategic high plane of rural and social stability and promoting the rural economy and sustained, rapid, and healthy growth of the national economy, we should seriously do the work well so that the peasants' incomes will increase along with economic growth and the 900 million peasants will be able to attain the comparatively well-off goal at an early date.
