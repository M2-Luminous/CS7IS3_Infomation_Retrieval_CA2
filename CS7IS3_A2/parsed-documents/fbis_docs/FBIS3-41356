Seizures of mandrax this year are likely to go up in comparison to those of heroin, say the police, who have noted this change on the basis of records of the past five years. The other major change in the drug-running business appears to be a lack of trust among gangs who have now begun to ask for cash first and delivery at whatever time and place that the buyer wants. In fact, what is alarming the police here is the fall in drug seizures last year. With seizures being the only indication of the degree of trafficking in any area, the police and drug enforcement agencies in the city do not know whether to congratulate themselves or watch out for gangs who may be outsmarting them. "I have a feeling they are using more sophisticated packaging at the airport these days," says Mr Rahul Rai Sur, in-charge of the police anti-narcotic cell. "Recently we were told about seizures of methaqualone in Moscow and South Africa which originated from Bombay airport." Drugs with Pakistani marking also have been fewer since last year. The last seizure, five kg of heroin, was made in September last year. On the other hand, mandrax tablets are flowing in the city. From only 63 kg in 1990, seizures went up to 4,300 kg in 1992, along with Rs 4 lakh of equipment used to manufacture them. Last year 809 kg of tablets were seized by the police. Not only are there large quantities of tablets but the police have also begun locating small factories in and around the city. With no expertise needed for working the tablet manufacturing units, which cost Rs 2 lakh each, traffickers are turning to addicts and unemployed youth to run these. Shaikh Akhtar Shaikh Abdulla, the Vakola resident arrested by the police recently, had put up a machine at Sakinaka and was running it along with Syed Javed, an addict since the last three years. Abdulla had been arrested in a mandrax case in 1989 and was being supplied the stuff by one Khalil Ahmed in connection with another man, Shanu, whom the police are yet to arrest. Before he became a part of the drug racket, he was an agent sending eager youth to the Gulf. The addict, Javed, used to get his tablets from Masjid Bunder, he told the police, and used up three to four vials a day worth Rs 10 each, it was with the help of Abdulla's connections that the machine was put up. A recent seizure of heroin is worrying the police over its low price. Hanif Mohammed, one of the men arrested in the case, hails from Ratlam, in Madhya Pradesh. He says he bought the heroin from one Ramesh at Rs 40,000 a kg which is Rs 60,000 less than the price in Bombay or elsewhere in the country.
