The Belarusian public learned about this valuable present from the U.S. Government to the republic which had badly suffered from the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, during U.S. President Bill Clinton's recent visit to Minsk. The President's wife, Hillary Clinton, visited then the 4th Children's Clinical Hospital in the Belarussian capital, met with medical workers and organizers of public health and familiarized herself with the needs of Belarussian medical institutions. That is why the equipment packed in 130 containers, 20 tons each, includes unique surgical furniture and roentgen apparatuses, refrigerators and microscopes, and special beds for patients. Apart from the 9th clinic, this equipment will be received by the 4th Children's Clinic, well known to the U.S. side, the Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and the Minsk first-aid hospital. The U.S. Government has been rendering humanitarian aid to Belarus on a regular basis lately which is estimated at over 100 million U.S. dollars. Still, the handing over of this considerable humanitarian cargo is a very important fact for many reasons. First, medical workers of the Republic received valuable and unique equipment which this country cannot afford to buy. Second, the process of the delivery of this humanitarian cargo became a bridge of friendship between the two armies as from both sides the cargo was dispatched and received by people in a military uniform. In addition, during the transportation of the cargo help was rendered by marines from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland. Some 30 young U.S. servicemen headed by Major-General of the Medical Service Michael Scotty, arrived in Belarus and now together with their Belarusian colleagues are not only receiving the cargo but also training Belarusian medical workers to handle the equipment unfamiliar to them. During the ceremony of presenting the humanitarian aid General Michael Scotty noted that for the first time during his 30 years of service he was handing over the Army property not for military but for peaceful purposes.
