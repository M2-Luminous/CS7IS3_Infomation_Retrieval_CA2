Now it must "break with convention" and reform its power industry, said Power Industry Minister Shi Dazhen, in PEOPLE'S DAILY (December 19). Excerpts follow: When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the mainland had an installed electricity capacity of only 1.86 million kilowatts, and it could generate just 4.3 billion kilowatt hours a year. By the end of this year, China's installed capacity is expected to have passed 180 million kilowatts, with an annual supply of more than 800 billion kilowatt hours. The amount of electricity China generates in two days now is equal to the total for the whole of 1949. But as industries expand and people use more electricity, the shortage of power in most parts of the country gets worse. The industry has developed most in areas with higher economic growth, but these places are also the hardest hit by the power shortage. It is unfair to say that the State has overlooked the problem and achievements made in reforming the power industry's management should never be underestimated. But most reform measures and policies in this sector were drawn up within the framework of the traditional planned economy and it is inevitable they bear the stamp of the old system. Investment Conventionally, enterprises in the power industry are subsidiaries of administrative organs. They tend to be controlled by arbitrary orders, which can mean poor investment. The World Bank suggests developing countries invest more than 2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in the power industry. But from 1980 to 1992, China put in an average of only 1.24 percent of GNP. Energy-saving policies and measures are also inadequate and the public lacks a strong sense of energy conservation. The huge shortage of electricity thus co-exists with massive waste. For a long time, the State has demanded enterprises in the power industry hand in more than 90 percent of their revenue in taxes and profit turnover. This leaves them little cash to keep going and the enterprises can afford no more than 5 percent of their revenue to invest in development. By contrast, their foreign counterparts raise about half the cash they invest themselves and in some countries the figure is up to 90 percent. Because enterprises in China's power industry are not independent commodity producers and managers, they do not feel the pressure of competition. Most have long had more workers than they need. In the old system, electricity prices were unreasonably low which has caused unequal competition between enterprises in the power industry and those in other sectors. This leads to waste which affects fundraising and the introduction of foreign investment. China's power industry is, however, trying to keep pace with and even overtake the growth of the national economy. From 1995 to 1997, the government plans to increase the generating capacity of large and medium-sized power stations by more than 15 million kilowatts a year. The figure for 1998-2000 is 20 million kilowatts. If these goals are met, China's total installed electric capacity will hit around 310 million kilowatts by the turn of the century. This will ease the shortage nationwide and put electricity within the reach of every county and 95 percent of rural households. To fulfill the goal, the power industry must break with conventional practices. Modern power enterprises should be set up. They should be free from government interference, be given decision-making powers and assume sole responsibility for profits and losses. Their property rights, and rights and obligations should be clearly defined. The package also includes efforts to drum into the public the need to save electricity. Enterprises in the power industry should also be allowed to compete on an equal footing with enterprises in other sectors. Shareholding The power industry would further be helped by the introduction of the shareholding system. This sophisticated form of fundraising can separate managerial power from ownership and help protect the legal rights of both investors and managers. In the next seven years, the power industry will need $25 billion to import electricity generating units with a capacity of 45 million kilowatts. Besides foreign loans, foreign investment is welcome and overseas investors are encouraged to build solely-funded or co-funded power plants. As investors, they can draw dividends according to their investment. As loan lenders, they will recoup both the loan and interest.
