Mr. Lin said during the period from June of last year to May this year, the Region had uncovered 5008 drug cases, more than 500 of them being big cases. Over 700-kilogram opium, 120-kilogram heroin, 16-kilogram caffeine and RMB [renminbi] 2.4 million gained from drug trafficking had been seized. Some 189 cases of gun trafficking had been also uncovered with 346 guns, 8200 rounds of ammunition as well as over 360 grenades, flashlights and mines seized. Special efforts must be made in areas teeming with such illegal activities. The areas, according to Guangxi, include frontier area connecting the Region with Vietnam, the juncture between the Region and Yunnan Province, Guizhou City and Guangdong Province. Hubs of communications in the Region such as Nanning City, Liuzhou City and Wuzhou City as well as the important communication lines and districts along these lines. It was reported that drug taking situation in the Region had been rampant with drug market there expanding. According to the authoritative statistics, drug addicts in the Region have reached nearly 40,000 in number covering 6 cities, 8 prefectures and 79 counties there. A special campaign against drug underground market has been staged in Nanning, Liuzhou, Wuzhou and Beihai at present to curb drug addiction. In Frontier areas, more than 250,000 opium poppies have been rooted out. Serious punishment had been imposed on criminals engaging in drug and gun trafficking. From June of last year till May this year, among 326 criminals arrested, 209 of them had been sentenced to different terms of imprisonment with 16 of them sentenced to death, 11 sentenced to suspended death and 21 to life imprisonment. On June 26 this year, the international day for banning drugs, another batch of criminals will be put to death in the region. Mr. Lin said drug trafficking cases in the Region had been increasing. In the former five months this year, such cases had increased by 60 percent than the same period of last year and heroin seized doubled that in the same period of last year. Therefore it would be still an arduous task for the Region to handle such problems.
