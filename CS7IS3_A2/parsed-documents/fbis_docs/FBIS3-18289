In an interview that lasted a couple of hours and was interrupted by an intriguing minor riot in the ranks, we were told by the shadow government's minister of finance, 45-year-old Goran Persson, that he was working under high pressure on an emergency program for Sweden. There are parallels with the emergency program that, under the title "Future for Sweden," was worked out by a task force headed by current party Chairman Ingvar Carlsson in 1981. It has not been decided whether the new program will be made public during the election campaign. But in any case, it will be the basis for a "running start" by the Social Democrats if they win the election. Program Under Discussion The crisis is far from over even though, figuratively speaking, Goran Persson can see light at the end of the tunnel. But now a more short-term program with the same title as the one in 1981 -- "Future for Sweden" -- is under discussion. It has been only a few days since Persson, along with Ingvar Carlsson and party secretary Mona Sahlin, presented the Social Democratic Party's shadow budget. We asked: "Are you pleased with the reaction?" He answered: "Yes, I am." Persson is such a good shadow minister that not a shadow of doubt crossed his face. He said with a satisfied grin: "The criticism we are getting from the nonsocialist side is awfully sour. That is partly because we have gotten a grip on savings and are showing responsibility for state finances and partly because we, too, have a program against unemployment." In his budget alternative, Persson came up with a balance for fiscal 1994-95 that is just over 5 billion kronor better than the government's proposal even though spending increases total 22 billion kronor. The equation was solved largely by the assumption that 90,000 new jobs will produce more tax revenues and reduce expenditures by 15.8 billion kronor. "Is that voodoo economics?" "No," he answered. "I don't let that criticism bother me. There is a very strong connection between higher unemployment and a deterioration in state finances. If the connection is so obvious in that direction, then the same thing applies in the other direction." Persson also remarked that there has been hardly any criticism of his proposals regarding taxes on capital and stockholders. According to the party's tax bill, reintroducing double taxation -- Persson does not like the expression -- will mean 3.9 billion kronor in higher taxes from the households concerned and 1.6 billion from firms in fiscal 1994-95 alone. He said: "We have noticed the silence on that subject. Naturally, we are going to step up our criticism of the government regarding taxes on capital, an area where we see that we are in a very strong position." The government's tax reductions, combined with unemployment, are going to be the Social Democratic Party's big issue in the election campaign. Persson makes no secret of that fact. We asked: "What about internal criticism?" He answered: "I have tried to use the kind of language that Social Democrats will recognize. It consists of combining an austere message with arguments regarding an income distribution policy while always emphasizing the fight against unemployment. It has been very well received." "People's Home" Preferred Over "Welfare State" With that in mind, Persson has very deliberately used the expression "people's home," which he feels is better than the "somewhat bloated" expression "welfare state." We asked: "What about the proposal to reduce the parents' insurance benefit?" (The same card that the government was going to play the next day.) He answered: "Things have gone very well there, too. It is not popular, but on the other hand...." "Does this increase confidence in your policy?" "Yes. It is a matter, you know, of showing that we must effect savings, and if we do so, people are going to feel it. But when we make these proposals, which are touchy ones, we also include the line of reasoning about taxing stockholders. The two issues go together." We asked: "Does this mean that there is no criticism worth taking seriously?" He answered: "I want to be clear and say that it is going to be very hard and difficult work reducing unemployment. On that subject we probably need more open discussion of the problems. But it is a subject on which we have not gotten much reaction yet." "Do you mean that the line of reasoning is not fully developed in your bill?" "Yes, it is a bigger job than many people think -- except for the unemployed, of course, who naturally understand the whole thing in their own way. In other words, I would like to see more problemizing on the whole subject. I miss that contribution to the debate." We asked: "But how will it be possible, using measures adopted by the Riksdag at its spring session, to make a big impact on employment and the national budget so quickly?" He answered: "We cannot swear to the last billion kronor or the last 10,000 jobs or the phasing-in of the program in one fiscal year. But it is still an accurate way of describing the process." We said: "In his guest editorial in DAGENS NYHETER, Carl Bildt criticized you on a number of points." Persson replied: "I haven't actually read it." But he explained the absence from the Social Democratic bill of a section on the EU [European Union] by saying that his party does not disagree with the government when it comes to the importance of joining the EU. We asked: "So what happened to your talk about the spiral of depression in earlier bills?" He replied: "It was an obvious danger as recently as last fall, when the economic fraternity was split on that point. The question was whether Finland's path would become our path. If so, should we say that we did not believe it would? No, it is better to be cautious. Fortunately, private consumption had bottomed out at the time. The spiral did not continue downward, but we still have a dual economy, with one part growing like mad while the other is declining." We asked: "Is the fact that private consumption is rising slightly the reason why you are not again proposing a drop in VAT [value-added tax]?" Persson answered: "Yes, but there are also technical reasons. Reducing VAT for seven months is not meaningful, and we said right from the start that the lower rates should not continue past the end of 1994." Questioned About Deletion At that point the interview was interrupted: Social Democratic members of the Riksdag's Communications Committee wanted to know why they had not been consulted before Persson, in completing the bill, deleted 1.7 billion kronor in planned highway spending from the package for the coming fiscal year. After the interruption, he explained: "That was the last thing I did Sunday [24 January] night." In his criticism, Bildt pointed out that the Social Democrats were including 1.5 billion kronor in the budget as the proceeds from selling off the venture capital firms Atle and Bure, but had left out the several billion kronor that would not be collected because they wanted to halt the privatization of Assidoman. Persson said generously: "I can accept that criticism if Bildt will promise not to sell off Assidoman." But he agrees that what is involved is naturally not savings but an injection of cash into the budget. "But notice that we are also including one-time effects in the other direction, and they are much bigger than this one," he says, drawing attention to, among other things, the proposal on direct write-offs, which is expected to cost the Treasury 5 billion kronor during fiscal 1994-95. Work on the shadow budget began in November after the government presented its autumn bill. Based on the opinions of 10 or so forecasting institutes and his own economic staff in the Riksdag Building, Persson attempted to evaluate the situation as it would look in January. About 20 November, he presented his analysis to about 10 Social Democratic economists from universities, banks, and union organizations. Social Democrats from the Riksdag's Finance Committee also attended. Persson told them: "Early in December, I will approach the main Riksdag group and give them my opinion. I will say it means that the budget work ahead of us is going to be very troublesome but that our focus should be on investment. But I also want room for reform -- something that will provide encouragement. So I put in an extra 50 million kronor for culture and another 100 million kronor for adult education. But the whole thing must result in a budget proposal in which the balance will not be worse than that in the government's proposal." To remind the committee members that it was necessary to effect savings, Persson wrote them a letter in the middle of December. We asked: "What did it say?" He replied: "During the Christmas break, you must come up with a bunch of savings that we can decide on when we return in January." We asked: "Did they come up with savings or revenue enhancements?" He answered: "Both. We call it savings, but they often involve tax increases." Just before Christmas, Persson met with economists from the TCO [Central Organization of Salaried Employees], who were shocked by his prediction that the government would forecast a 2.4-percent growth rate for 1994. (Persson is more than a little proud that his prediction, made in November, was right on the mark.) The TCO was expecting a growth rate of 1 percent this year. Then the government's budget was presented on 10 January. "But what surprised me when I read the budget was that the government had not been able to come up with a savings package. That was a weak spot. I had been thinking that they would be able to save something." Few Billion Kronor in Savings Proposal Aside from the tax increases already adopted at the fall session of the Riksdag, the government had only a few billion kronor in its savings proposal for 1994-95. The savings concerned dental care and medicines plus what Persson calls Ian Wachtmeister savings on the allowance for families with more than one child, the press subsidy, and the subsidy for home language instruction. "Those last items were nothing more than political provocations." The message to the committees, however, was that they should accept anything in the way of savings that the government had proposed. What came next was a real tussle over the budget -- a foretaste of what may be in store. Except when priority areas were involved, Persson sat in his office and, with Ingvar Carlsson's consent, knocked down every bright spending proposal by the committee members. "They sat there, one by one, in the same chair you are sitting in," he told me with a smile that made me feel like I was sitting in a catapult. The undermining of parents' insurance, which was included in the savings package that Sten Andersson was never able to push through last spring, was taken care of by Mona Sahlin with the help of other combative women members of the Riksdag. The proposal came from Persson's staff, but it was unacceptable to the group until Sahlin and several others hit upon a compromise that called for pushing the effective date back from 1 July to the start of 1995. Before the budget debate in the Riksdag on 10 January, it was decided in consultation with Ingvar Carlsson that Goran Persson would make an "all-out attack." "It is possible in that way to expose one's flank and be attacked in return if one does not protect oneself. But I knew that we had savings and a better balance than the government even if the matter of parents' insurance had not been settled." After 10 January, the temperature at Social Democratic headquarters rose several degrees. The budget tussle and new calculations every five minutes resulted in the drastic cut of 1.7 billion kronor from the communications budget on the night of 23 January. We asked: "In previous proposals, the Social Democrats strongly emphasized the reform proposal that called for removing sickness and industrial injury insurance from the budget and then eventually increasing it by 45 billion kronor. Is that no longer included?" "Our position is the same as before. The change in position that may be noted is that we are now putting even more emphasis on the dangers involved in the budget deficit and the national debt." We said: "Excluding the proposal for direct write-offs, which will be in effect for only one year, the tax burden on the firms will increase under your proposal." He answered: "No, we are not going to increase the tax burden on companies. We just need time, since it is difficult for technical reasons to roll back some of the government's reforms. Here it is also important to say that we are not going to cancel the tax reduction for self-employed individuals which was introduced last fall and which is being financed by taxes on foreign travel expenses and a slight increase in employers contributions." We asked: "You may benefit businesses, but the businessmen will not be allowed to get rich. Isn't that a dilemma?" Persson said: "You are talking like a nonsocialist propagandist. We lowered the corporation tax and the tax on dividends radically as part of the tax reform. Isn't it reasonable to see how that works first? If the reduced tax on capital leads to a big inflow of venture capital, it will mean that during its term of office, the government will have lowered the tax on capital by 25 billion kronor without creating all that many jobs." Can Solve the Problem Persson does not see any lack of venture capital in the stock market, but he admits that the problem exists for smaller firms. "We have always been open to dialogue with the business community, and we can solve this problem, too. But it requires that we have some kind of social contract in which everyone must be involved and help carry the burden," says Persson. He claims that he has no objection at all to businessmen getting rich, provided that their wealth is linked to production and that they build up something. "On the other hand, we find it very hard to see the point in the present situation, in which a small number of people are building private fortunes with the help of tax subsidies. The danger here is that we will have a rerun of the 1980's!" That warning comes from Goran Persson, who is unlikely to be thinking of the same rerun that Carl Bildt has already starting warning us of.
