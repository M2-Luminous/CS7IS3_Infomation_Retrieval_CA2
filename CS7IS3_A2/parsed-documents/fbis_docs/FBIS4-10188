The news that Chile had asked the United States to open an FBI liaison office in Chile caused considerable impact last year. The debate extended to many sectors. Politicians, police, and government officials spoke about the controversial subject. Some people even qualified the initiative as interference in Chilean domestic affairs. It is said that Washington was surprised by this reaction and preferred not to touch the subject in public in order not to continue creating a flurry. The problem is that nowadays, no one or very few people know what will happen with this initiative. Before leaving, the Patricio Aylwin administration said everything was status quo and opening a FBI office depended on the dedication of a new U.S. Embassy building. The current administration has not made a decision yet on the matter but everything indicates that it will stay the same. That is, the FBI will come. Neither Carabineros nor the Investigative Police have coordinated meetings yet with the eventual "liaison" officers, even though they will be work colleagues. Meanwhile, the U.S. Embassy is totally silent on the subject. "There is nothing new," is all they say. And when one tells the Embassy that we are not asking for news but for the date when the new Embassy building will be ready, all the Embassy answers is that it probably will be ready by the middle of next year, without further details. Something more concrete, however, was learned. The FBI already has assigned the "individual" who will work in the office that will be opened in Santiago. It will be only one agent. There will not be two, three, or four agents like it was once said. Unofficially, it was revealed that the number of agents interested in being transferred to Santiago was far greater than expected, something that had not happened in a long time in an American institution. The U.S. State Department and the Chilean Interior Ministry still must take some joint steps. Apparently, the two institutions have not discussed the subject lately, after it was announced by former Minister Enrique Krauss on 16 July 1993. As vice president of the Republic, Krauss then said the purpose of asking for the opening of an FBI office in Chile was only to strengthen cooperation between the Chilean forces of order and the FBI in the struggle against international crime. Maximum Alert One of the people who expressed a warning on the subject noted that Chile is becoming -- due to its economic development -- an attractive country for international traffickers and other types of criminals. This would make it necessary to reinforce the Chilean police by increasing its operational capability instead of creating a situation that would demand the participation of foreign agents. But this will not be the case because the U.S. agents will not have any power to operate. The Chilean law, like those in every other country of the world, prevents foreign agents from operating in territory other than their own country. Their task, therefore, will be merely to exchange information in addition to granting technical and academic support. There were also protests from those who feared the fact would be misinterpreted by Chilean police in the sense that FBI agents were being brought to Chile because things were not being done properly here. While some politicians tried to minimize the issue, others tried to explain the government's true purpose to the Chilean people: That it did not aspire to have agents with operational capability in Chile; that the idea was to have an FBI agent who would allow for a more fluid and expeditious relationship between the security forces; that bringing an FBI agent did not represent interference in domestic affairs; and that by no means did it reveal a government weakness in its struggle against drug trafficking. Everything boiled down to a mere discussion until a group of National Renewal legislators decided to ask the government to withdraw its invitation to the FBI. They argued that the initiative violated the law currently in force and national sovereignty because, according to the Constitution, Carabineros and the Investigative Police are in charge of safeguarding domestic order. The government was indignant and Krauss said it was "great insolence" to believe that the Chilean Government and police institutions could be manipulated by foreign interests. But those directly affected were barely consulted on the subject. Carabineros, through Director General Rodolfo Stange, at first reacted negatively, although in an indirect manner. A few days later, however, Carabineros suggested it might view this initiative as positive for cooperation in the police field. Carabineros, though, still has not disclosed its official stance on the issue. The opinions within this force are varied. A Carabineros source stated those who are against the idea or choose not to state their opinion do so because they are not fully aware of the effect that a liaison with the FBI in Chile may have. Carabineros believe this difference of opinions is positive. The same person made an interesting comment: The FBI office in Santiago will not be autonomous; it will be subject to the U.S. Embassy. It will, in fact, be located in the Embassy building. He also asserted that it is merely another of the 21 officies the FBI already has throughout the world, which is also the case of the Chilean Armed and security forces. Carabineros has attaches in some embassies, like in Spain, Colombia, the United States, and Costa Rica, as well as missions stationed in El Salvador and Ecuador, among other countries. Between Doubts and Advantages The Investigative Police has voiced its full support for the initiative. The thing is that its agents, for some time now, have maintained a cooperative relationship with the FBI office in Montevideo, which is in charge of coordinating actions in the Southern Cone. The FBI has four agents in Montevideo. But the distance, although short, causes certain inconveniences. The relationship is not as fluid as it should be. Carlos Espinoza, administrative chief of the Santiago Interpol National Headquarters, said one must admit that the FBI is in the vanguard of technological developments and this is highly positive for the development of criminal investigations carried out by Chilean agents. Espinoza said: "If we reach a point in our investigations at which our resources prevent us from going any further, as has been the case, there are our FBI friends who, somehow or other, can help us complete our work." He added: "They have more technology than we do, but our human resources, the quality of our professionals, are good. When they need something they get it done properly and in time." Carabineros also offers human resources. Their offer, however, is less specific than the offer of the Investigative Police, dedicated mainly to criminal matters. Carabineros has a greater choice of professionals. They also point out their viewpoint of another social situation, in addition to their experience in confronting other social phenomenons in the crime field also applicable in the United States. This is the case of the struggle against delinquency in the capital's outskirts, also applicable to the actions carried out in the United States in neighborhoods or areas where different ethnic groups are gathered. There are coincidences on the reasons why the United States may have so readily accepted the Chilean Government request to install an FBI office here. Basically, they refer to the degree of economic development reached by Chile, which makes it increasingly vulnerable to the much-talked-about "internationalization of crime." In other words, that important foreign delinquents increasingly choose Chile in which to commit their crimes or hide. In view of this situation and the globalization phenomenon the world is experiencing in all fields of action, few see the purpose of denying the existence of a liaison with U.S. police in Chile. A person linked to this issue commented: "We cannot close our borders if there is a tendency toward rapprochement and international police cooperation throughout the world," and added, "why would we hesitate before crime if it can only be fought by working." There are some who believe one must suspect the U.S. attitude to readily accept the request. Some believe that "the gringos do nothing for free." But others believe there is nothing wrong with that. Police forces believe Chile also has done the right thing. Although many may say the benefits are shared, it is true that Chile will benefit even more.
