Using a not necessarily completely fitting metaphor, it is much as if the PBC's situation has changed suddenly from its past "looking for subsistence" to "being given subsistence" by the state. Why have we conducted this reform? This has become a matter of great concern to those within and outside of the PBC system. A financial system in the final analysis is a product of an economic system. A particular economic system is bound to produce a corresponding financial system. And a particular financial system is also bound to reflect the inherent laws and demands of a particular economic system. Since 1984, the PBC has begun to exercise the special functions of a central bank, no longer concurrently handling industrial and commercial credit business. But its financial system has been essentially one of financial insurance, with its spending characterized by cost management and overall expense-rate management, and its profit distribution by the profit-retention system, with tax payment according to law, as well as setting aside of credit funds. This means that on one hand, the PBC has had to endeavor to explore ways to establish a new central banking system and exercise its particular functions, while on the other having to do all possible to consider ways to resolve its own "livelihood" and subsistence problems. As the PBC, as the central bank, has long been subject to a relative shortage of all funds, it has been hard for it to meet reform needs and normal expenditures for business development and functional activities. But as our banking reform has intensified, it is now clear that the major functions of our reformed PBC are to formulate and apply monetary policy, preserving currency stability, and to exercise strict oversight of financial institutions, ensuring the safe and effective operation of our banking system. So it was imperative that we reform our former financial-insurance financial system, by establishing an independent financial-budget management system that differs from both our fiscal budget and our administrative institution budget, to reflect the relative independence of our central bank. As to future central bank functions, basic currency handling authority and credit scope regulation authority will be concentrated in the head office, while branches will be responsible for financial oversight, investigation of statistics, management of the treasury, foreign exchange control, inter-branch clearing, cash allocation, and interim position adjustment. With PBC revenue concentrated mostly in the head office, and spending mostly by branches, it will be only a uniform budget-management system that will essentially better resolve the PBC's financial revenue and expenditure problems. The old PBC's financial sources were mainly profit retention. In other words, the next year's spending by the PBC depended mainly on its current year's revenue. In recent years, as capital construction has expanded, and new business, such as securities and capital lending, have developed, all costs have grown faster, causing great spending pressure. This has objectively spurred the central bank, particularly branches at all levels, to strive for more profits, by doing all possible to diversify and develop new funding sources. This state of "the central bank not acting like a central bank, and specialized banks not acting like specialized banks," was undoubtedly exceptionally adverse to the central bank doing a good job of financial macroeconomic regulation and control, as well as not contributing to honest administration. Thus, instituting the new budget system, with the clear division of revenue and expenditures into "two lines" with no links, so that proper earnings are recouped and proper expenditures are rationally met, can eliminate the PBC's tendency to strive for profits, enabling it to better focus its main energies on implementing monetary policy, to bring its financial macroeconomic regulation and control function into full play. As to the financial systems of central banks in certain developed countries, while they may differ somewhat, what they all have in common is central bank independence. Our new financial system not only draws on overseas central bank financial systems, but also reflects China's central banking features and needs. In addition, we have also paid attention to the relations among all parties, instituting a central bank financial system that conforms to international practice while being suited to China's particular conditions. Our new financial management system is one of "uniform budgeting, graded management, independent accounting, and centralized responsibility for profits and losses." Our fundamental principles for implementing this financial system were mainly the two of practicing an independent financial-budget management system and ensuring all expenditures. Meanwhile, we considered that PBC profits are a key component of state revenue and, under current conditions of state revenue difficulties, PBC spending needs to be strictly controlled and managed. So our formulation of the PBC financial system and its future financial management had to consider the following areas: 1) it had to reflect the PBC's independent budget-management authority, with all financial revenue and expenditure budgeting being examined and approved by the head office; 2) it had to conform to PBC features, with spending meeting the rational needs of normal business development; 3) it had to tighten revenue control, with revenue being recouped according to provision, and no arbitrary reduction of revenue or concession of profits, to ensure state revenue growth; 4) it had to observe state financial laws and regulations, with a rigorous financial management system, advocacy of the spirit of hard work, industry, and thrift, strict control of budgets, economy in all spending, and subjection to state revenue and auditing financial oversight. The PBC's independent budget-management system is a new model and new system, the outcome of intensified banking reform. As this reform is wide in scope, with a heavy workload, and quite heavy technical demands and many meticulous management tasks, so that many historical leftovers cannot be resolved at once, it needs to be carried out positively and safely. We now especially need to guard against the two tendencies of drawing up too large budgets and easing revenue control, by doing a good job of dovetailing the old and new systems, to prevent unnecessary losses due to management mistakes. We need to understand that our new financial system is absolutely not merely to resolve the PBC's "subsistence" problems, nor is it a replay of the "iron ricebowl" system. It shows that China's central bank has begun to mature, with a stronger macroeconomic regulation and control capability, while also being a brand new yardstick, with new standards for starting an overall, accurate, and specific investigation of the work and management levels of the central bank at all levels. So implementing the new financial system is not a matter merely for the leadership or the accounting sector, but rather will require the joint efforts of those throughout the PBC at all levels.
