The main problems are ahead. They will arise during the discussion of draft laws. The division of forces in the lower chamber is not yet final. This is the opinion of deputies of various political orientation in the State Duma, expressed to ITAR-TASS. "The Duma vacillates between utter uncontrollability and too rigidly controlled decision-making of heads of groups," believes Vasiliy Lipitskiy, head of the People's Party of Free Russia, who was elected from a one-seat constituency and who has not joined any faction in the Duma. He believes new factions may be formed. Many deputies regret that the Duma does not have clearly defined centrist forces "which could balance the struggle which leads to shaky compromises," he said. Another independent deputy, Irina Hakamada, general secretary of the Party of Economic Freedom, believes that the forming of new groups of deputies is inevitable. The "Union of December 12" being formed by Hakamada and a number of her supporters will soon amass 35 members and will become eligible for registration. She refuted the supposition that the new group will be a subsidiary of Russia's Choice bloc. "We are closer to market reforms than anybody else, regardless of party affiliations," she said. (It should be noted Gaydar said that his group discussed more than once reinforcing the Union of December 12 with members of Russia's Choice bloc). Sergey Baburin, elected from a one-seat constituency, said that 17 people so far applied for Russia's Path group that he is forming. The group will exist de facto even while not registered. He said other people with patriotic leanings are in various party factions and in the "New Regional Policy" group. Baburin, the leader of the Russian National Alliance, expressed dissatisfaction with the fact that "the patriotic forces relinquished key committees to Russia's Choice bloc and its supporters." Nevertheless he believes there is every chance that the Duma will be effective legislatively if it is effective politically. "The Duma has shown that it is effective," said Vladimir Isakov, elected on the slate of the Agrarian Party of Russia. Isakov, who was one of the most remarkable representatives of the opposition in the former Supreme Soviet, believes the new parliament has been able to avoid the main pitfall, that of being bogged down in organisational matters for weeks. He said the package vote on the list of deputy speakers and heads of committees was a reasonable compromise that made it possible to avoid wasting weeks on voting on appointments. Assessing the alignment of forces in the Duma, he said that it is split approximately in half with the left opposition having a slight edge. Neither of the factions, nor any of the sides has a guaranteed majority. So compromises should be sought. Extreme decisions will not be passed. Isakov said the main danger is that no decisions will be passed on key problems of reform in the lower chamber. "We have not yet tackled these matters," he said. There are differences among deputies on the draft laws on the economy and the question of the media," said Kirill Ignatiyev, representative of Russia's Choice faction. He believes the structure of the Deputies Corps has already been determined. It has two extremist wing (the right wing -- LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] and the left wing -- communists and agrarians) and the centre which is formed of Russia's Choice and other democratic factions. He said there is no complete unanimity in the centre. Russia's Choice, the group of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord and the Union of December 12 mainly vote in the same way, while members of Yabloko and the new regional policy group all vote differently. Speaking highly of professionalism and proper conduct of Speaker of the Duma Ivan Rybkin, Ignatiyev predicted that a political alliance of Viktor Chernomyrdin and Ivan Rybkin will gradually form. The government without reformers will rely on the parliamentary majority which will include the extreme left -- communists and agrarians, part of the "New Regional Policy" faction and part of the group of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, he said. Leader of the Democratic Party of Russia group, Nikolay Travkin, believes the Duma has a high potential in organising itself. He believes this was shown by the fact that it had completed the formation of working bodies on the fourth day of work. Travkin believes not a single political trend can earn half the number of votes. This has a positive aspect as an irresponsible decision will not be passed by the Duma in a rush. Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy, representative of Yabloko group said the voting on a package in electing the leadership of the lower chamber and heads of committees had been an achievement. Heated debates in the Duma immediately subsided. People realised that there is an opportunity for actual specific work. Shostakovskiy believes that during an intermission of plenary meetings, when work is conducted in committees, the role of factions will decrease for some time. "Nothing could be worse than continued political clashes and overly politisation. If this were so, it would be an end of Duma, he said. The chief task at present is to draw up a programme of the legislative activity of the Duma and of each of its committees, Shostakovskiy believes.
