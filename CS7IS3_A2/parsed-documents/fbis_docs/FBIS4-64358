FBIS4-64358 "drweu085_l_94003" FBIS-WEU-94-085 Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 SPAIN Solbes, UGT, CEOE Offer Economic Outlook Solbes, UGT, CEOE Offer Economic Outlook Pension System `Guaranteed' 94ES0287C Madrid DIARIO 16 in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 52 94ES0287C Madrid DIARIO 16 Spanish CSO [Article by R. de Querol] [Text] Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Solbes stated yesterday that "the payment of pensions in the future is fully guaranteed," although he stressed that changes will be necessary to "strengthen" the public system of Social Security. In his remarks to the Congress of Deputies, the minister thus contested the controversy that has ensued from his previous statements in which he warned that the pension system will be threatened in 20 to 30 years. Stating that his words on that occasion had not been well understood, the minister emphasized that a public pension system similar to the present one will continue to exist in the future. He advocated the maintaining of the financial system of distributions (in which the workers' current contributions finance current pensions), although this system "can be supplemented by elements of capitalization," thus guaranteeing, in his opinion, "solidarity among people, groups, and generations." Solbes also promised that the Social Security benefits will retain their purchasing power independently of the existence of private systems that may provide pensioners with additional income. The minister of the economy dwelt on the need to begin "addressing seriously and responsibly a problem that, if nothing is done, could arise in 20 or 30 years." The future reform of the Social Security System, he added, will not bring into question the present system, but on the contrary will strengthen it. In his remarks, Pedro Solbes reproached the opposition groups with their "catastrophic views, which alarm people here and now," and urged that pursuit of the debate be "sober-minded." To this end, the Congress's Committee for the Economy appointed an ad hoc subcommittee to initiate studies on the future of the Social Security System. The deputies of the PP [People's Party] and IU [United Left] criticized Solbes harshly for "creating social alarm concerning the future of pensions." Cristobal Montoro, PP spokesman, accused the minister of "acting like a pyromaniac" for having put in question the pensions of future retirees. In Montoro's opinion, the problem is not a demographic one, but rather stems from the low employment and high unemployment rates, which reduce total contributions. Montoro pointed out that a sizable number of pensions "amount to poverty levels." Pedro Antonio Rius, of the IU, reproached the government with "intent to dismantle the welfare state's most important package." According to Rius, the debate that has been opened regarding pensions obeys the "strategy" of an executive branch in which "accountants hold sway over the defenders of ideas." The pension system is strong, he said, and continues to be strong "if the government sees to it that there is employment." Francesc Homs, of CiU [Convergence and Union] termed the economy minister's initiative timely, because all of Europe has opened a debate on social welfare.
