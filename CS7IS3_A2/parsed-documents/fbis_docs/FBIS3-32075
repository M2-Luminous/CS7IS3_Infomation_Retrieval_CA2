The results of the popular consultation prove that the Guatemalan people have left behind the sad pages of their history, especially the pages pertaining to confrontation, bloodshed, and corruption. The indisputable yes-vote victory, with 377,044 yes-votes and 70,761 no votes, clearly proves the Guatemalan people support the moral revolution initiated by the president of the Republic, and thereby they are paving the way for a renewal phase through peaceful means, with respect for the legal and institutional framework and, in this case, the most powerful weapon democracy has: the citizens' vote. Much has been said these past few hours about the abstention phenomenon. The truth is, as one of today's newspaper editorials states, the fact that a high percentage of citizens did not participate in the election does not mean abstentionism won. Although every citizen had the option of abstaining, the democratic process only considers the number of yes and no votes and in the country's 330 municipalities, the yes vote won. In other words, the yes vote is the option that won. The issue is that the law and the result of the popular consultation must be respected because that is the very essence of the de jure state we hope to consolidate in Guatemala. With the approval of the constitutional reforms from yesterday's popular consultation, it is now up to the Congress of the Republic to fulfill its pledge to reform the Electoral and Political Parties Law and the Congressional Internal System Law as soon as possible so new deputies can be quickly elected with the participation of civic committees and other organizations. The entire country is awaiting the fulfillment of these reforms. At any rate, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will schedule the election of new deputies very soon. The results of the popular consultation will allow us to continue purging the branches of state. The yes vote has won, but there are no winners or losers. The winners are the Guatemalan people, who with their participation have proven that regardless of the misinformation generated by certain groups they know what they want: to live in peace and democracy. The electoral event was conducted in a peaceful manner despite the terrorism and blackmail perpetrated on the eve of the consultation in an effort to surround the process with insecurity and instability. Consequently, the democratic system has been saved and strengthened. This is the first time in Guatemalan history it is possible to reform the political Constitution without resorting to the traditional coup d'etat, which confirms we are paving the way for a better future. The results of the popular consultation mark the beginning of a truly democratic culture. As we conclude this phase, I must emphasize that we are making a different scenario possible. A country seeking and working for peace must not foster confrontations, impunity, and corruption. Therefore, the popular consultation was the mechanism used to purge the branches of state. It took more time, but it adhered to the law and was peaceful, which is how things should be in a de jure state. Now, the people and government must work together in a spirit of solidarity for our country. The time has come to leave behind our personal interests. Guatemala has lost many years because of its fragmented and confrontational positions. We must not lose the opportunity that is now available to us. This is why as president, committed only and exclusively to the Guatemalan people, I call for national unity to work in solidarity for a single goal, to consolidate a national project. Political, economic, and social sectors should adopt national commitments that foster the right scenario for the country's governability. Elections are already a handsome page in our history. Now we must continue to move ahead. As president, I have the responsibility to keep the commitments established in the government agenda that allow for laying down the irreversible basis for a more modern economy and a society with equality. I know this is a challenge, but my mind is set to achieve it. I want to tell you that I am proud of the demonstration we have given the world, because slowly but surely we are confirming that we prefer to solve our problems with words and not with violence. Proof of this was the responsible attitude of the public workers who, understanding the political moment we were living, ignored summonses to paralyze the public administration this past weekend. This shows we are maturing. I firmly request the National Transportation Coordinating Board to put aside its differences and continue talks aimed at solving the stated problems. We cannot continue with this political agitation. We must resolve these differences at the dialogue table and spend our time working for Guatemala. Our government starts the year with a tight-knit team, a strengthened team bent on reaching a single goal: to execute the government agenda. We cannot continue to ignore or pretend to ignore the tremendous social and cultural reality of our society. We have no ties to any political party or any other ambitions. That is why, I repeat, our only commitment is to the people of Guatemala. I am convinced that all the sacrifice and all the blood that has been shed during our country's history has not been in vain, because the seed of peace and democracy flourishes in the hearts of all Guatemalans. Let us work so that Guatemala may at last achieve peace and grow free and strong for the sake of our children's happiness and that of future generations. Guatemalans, this is the moment for all of us together to say: Go ahead, Guatemala! Many thanks and good night.
