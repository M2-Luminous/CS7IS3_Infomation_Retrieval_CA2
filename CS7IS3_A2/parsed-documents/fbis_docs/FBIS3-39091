In a remarkably frank outburst last December, the French Socialist MEP [Member of the European Parliament] Claude Cheysson, a former foreign minister and European commissioner, stated that it was inconceivable that a Briton could take on the top Commission post after the country had shunned monetary union and vast tracts of planned social legislation. The attack demonstrated some of the unexpected obstacles that Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic affairs commissioner, who had just emerged with plaudits from negotiating the GATT Uruguay Round, faces in his campaign to succeed Delors. This, and London's failure to win in the hosting of the European central bank, may be political repercussions of Britain's less-than-total commitment to Maastricht's goals. But legal repercussions of the EMU [European Monetary Union] opt-out are unlikely to be felt for several years. Similarly, the clarifications on European citizenship, defence, justice and home affairs which Denmark subsequently negotiated to the treaty have caused the Union few legal difficulties. But it is in the area of social policy that the Union now faces its greatest challenge -- a situation where legislation might apply to 11 members but not to the United Kingdom. London has been accused of trying to operate social dumping -- reducing social cost to attract investment from its European competitors. But it is the legal implications that are haunting policy-makers. The obstacles became apparent this week with the Commission's latest proposal to establish works councils, calling on multinational firms in the Union with at least 1,000 employees to inform and consult their staff. The proposal is directed at employer groups and trade unions in the hope they can agree on a consultation mechanism. But if this fails, there may be moves to enforce the measures in the 11 countries that subscribe to Maastricht's Social Chapter. Under the scheme, a multinational with branches in Britain could ask employers and unions to participate although the management would be free to refuse. More controversially, the Commission proposes that British-based staff of other EU [European Union] companies be counted when calculating whether the level of 1,000 employees, which activates the consultation measures, has been reached. British multinationals with more than 1,OOO staff in the Union would also have to implement the system, even for British staff in other EU countries, because the opt-out is based on territory, not nationality. But governments are also unclear how such proposals should be processed. All commissioners will draft future legislation. All MEP's will be allowed to debate and amend such proposals, after a crude attempt to exclude British Conservative members from the process failed last month. Similarly, all members of the advisory economic and social committee will have their say. The difficulty is in the Council of Ministers. No one believes that Britain should be allowed to vote on such legislation, but governments are divided over whether British ministers and officials should be allowed to participate in discussions influencing the eventual shape of the law, or be told to sit and observe. There is another insidious consequence of the derogations governments have been prepared to grant EU countries. It makes it harder for the Union to say categorically to applicant countries that they must accept the full body of EU law and responsibilities when exceptions are made for current members. Several Austrians feel aggrieved that their efforts to control the sale of second homes to other EU citizens is being so fiercely contested when Denmark secured the very same opt-out in 1973.
