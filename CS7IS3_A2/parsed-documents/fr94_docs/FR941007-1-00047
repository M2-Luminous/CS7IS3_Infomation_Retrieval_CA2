SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Introduction The Federal financial supervisory agencies are jointly proposing to revise their regulations implementing the CRA (12 U.S.C. 2901 et seq. ). The proposed regulations would replace the existing regulations in their entirety. The CRA is designed to promote affirmative and ongoing efforts by regulated financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their entire communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operations. Despite the CRA's notable successes, bank and thrift industry, community, consumer and other groups maintain that its full potential has not been realized, in large part, because compliance efforts have focused on process rather than performance. In accordance with a request by the President, the Federal financial supervisory agencies have undertaken a comprehensive effort to reform their evaluation standards and examination procedures. The proposed regulations would implement one part of this reform effort by substituting a new system that would rate institutions based on their actual performance in helping to meet community credit needs. In addition to this rulemaking, the agencies will work together to improve examiner training and to increase interagency coordination regarding application of standards, performance of examinations, assignment of ratings, and use of enforcement procedures. These efforts should produce a CRA assessment process that is less burdensome for many institutions yet yields better results for the local communities the law is intended to benefit.
