FR940907-2-00005 FR940907-2-00002 Response: NMFS is proposing the following eligibility criteria: Participation in the commercial fishery in either 1992 or 1993; at least 50 percent of gross income from the commercial fishery in the base year, selected from 1986&hyph;1989, used to determine a loss; at least a 50 percent decline in commercial fishery income from the base year as compared to commercial fishery income in 1992 or 1993, whichever is greater; and, if single, 1993 gross income of less than $25,000, or if married, combined gross income of less than $50,000. Persons receiving a permit buyout would not be eligible for the jobs programs. The disaster relief funds are being made available under the IFA, which excludes government entities from receiving aid; tribal and local governments are ineligible for this program. However, individual tribal commercial fishermen are eligible to apply for the NEAP program. 3. If fishing permits are relinquished, how can their further reissuance be handled by the states? Comments: A charterboat operator stated that the total number of permits should be reduced, beginning with the inactive permits. Under no circumstance should any new permits be issued. An individual suggested waiting until salmon numbers increase, and then giving first priority for new permits to former permit holders who relinquished theirs. A tribe member stated that this should be coordinated with the treaty tribes and other entities involved, after studying the natural and biological effects. Response: NMFS is proposing that, as a condition for receipt of buyout funds under this program, the administering authority must ensure that reissuance of purchased permits will not be allowed. 4. What should be the basis for the valuation of the permits, and should inactive permits be valuated differently? Comments: A fisherman stated that permit value should relate to the current market value of Alaska troll permits that are for sale. A charterboat operator commented that this should be decided by industry as a function of criteria for a permit buyout. Valuation should logically reflect the level of activity in the fishery, i.e., greater value for the more active permits. An individual stated that all active permits should have the same value; inactive permits should be valueless. A tribal individual's response to this question was ``economic hardship, and education.'' Response: NMFS is proposing not to set a value for permits, but to use a sealed bid process for conducting a permit buyout. However, in no case may a buyout recipient receive benefits in excess of 75 percent of the total uninsured losses incurred for the disaster period, or $100,000, whichever is less. 5. What would be appropriate documentation to determine the extent of uninsured losses? Comments: One fisherman stated that a notarized statement from the vessel's captain should be required for determining aid to deckhands.
