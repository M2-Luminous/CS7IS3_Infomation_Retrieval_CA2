The chairman of the "Armenia-Russia" society, Professor of Philology Vladimir Grigoryan, who opened the meeting, emphasized the importance of the problem under discussion. The ultimate goal of the "roundtable," he said, is the development and submission of recommendations to the republic's government. The scientists who spoke subsequently--sociologists, economists, demographers--were almost unanimous in the main point: the problem of migration should be examined and monitored at the state level. As one should have anticipated, opinions differed in the particulars. Thus, the director of the Sociological Research Center, Gevorg Pogosyan, who cited a figure for those annually leaving the Republic of Armenia (23,000-25,000--this is only those stricken from residence permit registration and how many leave while retaining it is not known precisely), focused the attention of his colleagues on the "brain" drain from the country. That is why it is necessary to create conditions for full-blooded work in the motherland for national intellectuals. The fact is that there are scientists and even entire institutes of the European level in Armenia. The diaspora and friendly developed states can help in this matter; however, not on the crudely "humanitarian" level being done, for example, in Bangladesh and Somalia. The prominent Armenian sociologist Agaron Adibekyan offered his vision of the problem: study the mental state of the migrants, who, in his view, are siezed with a fear of the unknown based upon an information vacuum. Explanatory "therapy" is needed in order for people to know what is waiting for them in the future and how to adjust to difficulties and to find a way out of the negative realities on the spot. Doctor of Economic Sciences Suren Karapetyan, who considers that the outflow of population from the Republic of Armenia is a good thing under present conditions, expressed a contrary point of view. As an argument he referred to the objective capability of Armenia's agriculture to feed its population of almost four million only for... two months a year. And even industry is not capable of ensuring its needs under market economy conditions, as well as the employment of labor. That is why it is pointless to raise the question of hindering the outflow of the population. One needs only to selectively regulate it to retain the cadres which constitute the nation's intellectual potential. Rafik Seyranyan, a scientific associate of the Institute of Philosophy, dwelt on the problem, dear to him, of refugees, a certain portion of whom, after a short sojourn in the motherland, have left it. In particular he noted the significance of their intellectual and labor potential for Armenia, having proposed the creation of a data bank (not a primitive questionnaire one but one more in depth) in order to utilize this considerable force for the good of the republic. The emotional speech of Candidate of Economic Sciences Sevak Ayvazyan provoked the approval of the majority. He named the breakdown of the former union and the rejection (even if temporary) of a pro-Russian orientation as the global cause of the breakdown of life (and as a consequence--of mass migration). Having supported the idea of the creation of a governmental organ on migration-related problems, S. Ayvazyan also stated the urgency of the day-to-day ensuring of the survival of our compatriots. An interesting thought was heard in the speech of cooperative chairman Suron Tarkhanyan, who suggested the idea of the balancing of exports and imports. Nothing prevents Armenia from exporting work groups and services besides goods, for example, the construction brigades traditionally in demand in the CIS countries. Organization of the latter should emanate from state structures. This will relieve the republic and also will bring in a profit to the republic from abroad.
