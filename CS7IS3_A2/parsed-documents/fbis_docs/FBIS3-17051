Zonov replaces Ardo Ojasalu, who was appointed the head of the country's Tax Department and has to step down as MP, as the next candidate on ticket of the 1992 parliamentary elections. Zonov in today's interview with BNS said he was going to aim his activity in the parliament toward the adoption of legislative acts that would contribute to integration of Russian-speakers into Estonia's life and to equal rights in the society. In Zonov's words the population in Estonia could be viewed as divided into five categories: legal citizens of Estonia, those applying for Estonian citizenship, those applying for the citizenship of some other country, citizens of other countries, and those who have to make up their minds yet. Zotov says the country's stability will depend on what will be the official policy toward the last of these five categories. He said it was essential for Estonia that as many as possible of those still making up their minds would choose to apply for Estonian citizenship. In order to achieve this, it is necessary, beside other things, to better inform people about the application rules, work out a national language learning program, and abstain from extremist statements in politics. Apart from this, many problems of legislative and bureaucratic character need to be resolved, he added. "It is also important that Russia withdrew its military units from Estonia, because this is a problem over which particularly active speculation is going on. It may be that upon the final withdrawal other issues for speculation will be found, but currently this is the main one," Zonov said in the interview. He said he was going to use the "good team" that his Social Democratic Party and the Moderate coalition, part of which the Social Democrats are, have in the parliament. He said also his own good personal contacts with Estonian politicians were a factor that would positively contribute to his work. "I have people whom I know well practically in all factions of the parliament," Zonov said, adding that these contacts had been established during his work at the Estonian Popular Front and the Council of Estonian Citizens. Zonov told BNS that he was ready to work closely with the organizations of Estonia's Russian-speakers, but was not going to allow himself to become their tool in the parliament or enforce ideas that are contradicting his own.
