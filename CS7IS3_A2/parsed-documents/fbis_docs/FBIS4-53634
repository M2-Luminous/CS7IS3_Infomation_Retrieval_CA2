The councilor said: "We have not yet received a reply from Pyongyang. However, I expect that a positive answer to the IAEA proposal will come." He thus disclosed North Korea's intention to accept the IAEA proposal. In reply to MAINICHI SHIMBUN questions, the councilor stressed North Korea's positive attitude toward accepting the IAEA delegation, and clearly said: "The scale of the delegation is an issue that should be decided by the IAEA. We have no intention of making any requests on that." Moreover, in discussing an IAEA request for the picking of sample fuel rods, the councilor said: "It is clear that we are ready to provide basic materials to the IAEA to comply with safeguard obligations by accepting nuclear inspections." Thus, he hinted at an intention to take a flexible stance on picking of the samples. However, regarding a 19 May IAEA request that the exchange of fuel rods be postponed, the councilor said: "I do not think (North Korea) will accept it." North Korea is expected to submit an official reply to the IAEA in a day or two.
