It is true that for many in Brasilia there are other issues of greater strategic significance, such as the community of Portuguese-speaking countries. This idea, which was conceived by Ambassador Jose Aparecido, was put into motion on the evening of 10 February at a dinner hosted by President Itamar Franco and attended by representatives of Portuguese-speaking countries from this continent and abroad. Similarly, the Workers Party [PT] does not consider Foreign Minister Celso Amorim's trips to Washington and Bonn to be important. The hints given by PT candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Lula to Japanese businessmen about his foreign policy lead one to believe that he is going to seek to replace trade and economic relations with the United States with stronger ties with Andean Pact member countries. The prevailing idea in other parties is that foreign policy is for experts! These are strategic options, although strange ones! It is within this backdrop of "circumstances" that Amorim will be telling the Americans that Brazil is neither engaging in unfair trade practices nor failing to protect intellectual property rights, and the Germans that Brazil is not planning to tread the path of nuclear proliferation. In Bonn, Amorim's task will be easier in light of the Senate's approval of the agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which will allow him to ask for "time" for the Brazilian Senate to approve the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty. In Washington, however, his task will be tough -- and the public must be prepared for a possible failure of his mission that will affect the steel, paper, cellulose, and orange juice industries. In his negotiations with the U.S. trade representatives, Amorim will certainly try to undo some old knots stemming from mutual misunderstandings, misinterpretations, unwarranted jingoism, missionary concepts dating back to the time of the gunboats, and dollar diplomacy. The U.S. administration must tell the U.S. Congress whether U.S. commercial interests are being respected in Brazil, while the Brazilian foreign minister will seek to persuade his U.S. counterparts that the Brazilian Government has adopted a foreign policy that in many cases displeases the White House and the State Department because it also has national interests to protect. For a government that administers a GDP totaling trillions of dollars, it should not be hard to understand that in a country administering a GDP that amounts to a few hundred billion dollars, the concepts of "commercial" and "industrial" are often confused with the concept of "national." In fact, last week President Clinton was able to note that this confusion exists even in Japan. All things considered, however, the U.S. pressure stems primarily from the fact that in Washington there is also confusion about what is national and what is related to the private economic sector. Looking at things coolly, Amorim may have been able to succeed in his efforts had it not been for the many years of frequent misunderstandings we have mentioned earlier. In addition to other issues that are rather delicate but not relevant, the Brazilian-U.S. dispute today revolves around the patent draft law being studied in the Senate. We have time and again said that had it been voted on on time, many of the U.S. complaints would have been avoided. The irony of the whole story is that the government of Itamar Franco will have to endure the consequences of something for which it cannot be held responsible (except for the laxity that has become its trademark): It was during the tenure of Senator Fernando Henrique Cardoso as foreign minister that the executive branch made every possible effort to make the Chamber of Deputies pass the patent law. The law includes points upholding Brazilian interests that are unacceptable to U.S. pharmaceutical lobbying groups. Amorim and Mickey Kantor, the U.S. trade representative, will have their hands tied by that intangible thing known as "national interest," which is always present in diplomatic and commercial negotiations. An understanding would be in the best interests of security in the hemisphere, but unfortunately this is not the way things are seen in Washington and Brasilia. We should thus prepare for a courteous but tough dialogue that might yield predictable but undesirable consequences.
