Kovac Cited AU1002085994 Prague CTK in English 0752 GMT 10 Feb 94 AU1002085994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Casta-Papiernicka, West Slovakia Feb 10 (CTK) -- At a meeting between parliamentary groups of deputies from the coalition parties and cabinet members last night, Deputy Premier Roman Kovac pointed out that a difference in opinion exists between him and Premier Vladimir Meciar, Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the Movement For a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) parliamentary group of deputies said after the meeting. The ruling coalition includes the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS). "There is not any disagreement", he said, adding that no new faction has formed within the HZDS as yet, although two unspecified deputy chairmen of a deputies' group of deputies offered their resignation, to be considered today. Earlier yesterday, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and Deputy Ivan Laluha hinted at polarisation within the HZDS when they told journalists that they had rejected Meciar's proposal to hold referendum over the expulsion from the parliament of deputies who strayed from their mother parties. The meeting also discussed the parliamentary stalemate, brought on by the walkout of the coalition deputies, Cabaj said, adding that he believed the parliamentary session would continue as planned on February 16. Meciar told the meeting about an unofficial offer from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) for a wider coalition, Cabaj said. But SDL Chairman Peter Weiss today refused the idea of a coalition with the HZDS. The SNS would only take a decision over the proposed referendum on the maverick deputies after an SNS extraordinary congress was held on February 19, chairman of the SNS parliamentary group, Miloslav Kona, said. "Everything is possible and everything depends on the conditions," he added, reflecting on a possible coalition with the SDL. The congress will try to resolve the rift within the SNS.
