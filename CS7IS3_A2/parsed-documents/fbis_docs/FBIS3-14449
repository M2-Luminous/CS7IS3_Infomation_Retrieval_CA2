At the beginning of this news conference, before we delve into details and issues, I would like to ask you to demonstrate your full professionalism at every stage we are going through in this country. That is, you need to always report the situation or the news item in full. Lebanese and Arab brothers in Lebanon who report on Lebanon, as well as the foreign correspondents who are here to report on developments, we beg of you to take into consideration the fact that this is a homeland whose people have suffered a great deal. It deserves your full professionalism on the one hand, and your help in reporting and commenting on events here on the other hand. You should do this to fortify its unity and help it emerge from the remnants of past events so that no foreign scheme to return it to its previous condition can slip into the country. After that introduction to my meeting with you, I thank you for your work and all you are doing. Specifically, I address your professional duties in this homeland under these circumstances. To start off with -- I would prefer to dedicate more time to questions and answers -- but I would like to say that the circumstances Lebanon is experiencing and the repercussions of all events in the region, in particular the negotiations, have caused us to experience security events and actions during the recent stages that prompted the cabinet two days ago to take the measures that it took. These are extraordinary measures because the situation in Lebanon at this stage is extraordinary and sensitive. We are not claiming that the situation is dangerous. No. But so that the situation does not reach the danger point one day, we need to handle extraordinary situations with extraordinary measures that bolster the unity of the homeland -- land, people, and institutions -- and fortify the Lebanese national decision internally and in the negotiations taking place in Washington within the framework of the peace talks which started in Madrid. I would now like to allow an opportunity for questions and answers. [Correspondent] From what I hear you say, I infer that the decision to prevent the private media from broadcasting newscasts and political programs was demanded by negotiations [as heard], in an indirect manner, that is, and that the suspension will be for a long time. What can you say about that? [Samahah] This inference is wrong and out of place. To be precise, the measure is exceptional and temporary. The Council of Ministers linked it to the audiovisual media law, which the cabinet will conclude on Tuesday. It will be available to the Chamber of Deputies as of Wednesday. It is absolutely not connected to negotiations or to what goes on during them. It is linked to security and the psychological experience the country has undergone. The decision does not condemn audiovisual media in Lebanon. This decision is not a condemnation; it prepares for the restoration of normalcy in the general atmosphere in the country at the sensitive stage we are going through. The future of these mass media, their circulation of news and their very existence, will depend on the new law. That is why we ordered the suspension of newscasts and did not close private radio and television stations, out of a desire to respect the Constitution, the nature of our people, and our system's observation of freedoms. The legalization of audiovisual mass media will be achieved through the new law. As explained in the recent cabinet statement, all that is happening in Lebanon today -- starting with the negative security incidents caused primarily by the heated situation in the south as a result of the Israeli occupation of our land and our people's resistance of this occupation and also by the assault against Lebanon's geographic, human, and personal identity as represented by the Sayyidat al-Najat explosion -- is linked to our conflict with Israel in its various aspects and the ongoing negotiations with Israel. There is evidence in this connection. If anyone thinks that negotiations with Israel will dictate to us any position on suspending freedoms and preventing our people from expressing their views on this issue, this is out of the question completely. All freedoms, particularly in this field, are protected, not only by government decision or action, but by the actual practice of the Chamber of Deputies and daily practice. We exempted written media -- newspapers and magazines -- which are subject to the publication law. No measure, directive, or guidance has been issued to these media. [Correspondent] Your Excellency, the Lebanese Government has adopted measures against the media. [Samahah] Not all the media. No measures were adopted against the media. An information measure was adopted which fully respects and appreciates the role of the private media. Our objective behind this measure is to ensure a stronger commitment by everyone to the law and to the ongoing efforts to boost the national decision and services. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct]. [Samahah] I want to speak clearly. Over the past four months, many things have happened in Lebanon. These include rumors and minor bombings of some holy places and certain educational centers and schools. They also include attacks on religious sites in several areas and attacks on the cemeteries of various sects. Furthermore, leaflets were distributed during the night inciting religious sedition, particularly during the holiday periods [words indistinct] spiritual families in Lebanon. Then came the bombing of the church in Zuq Mikha'il. This was followed by rumors. However, the source and motives of the rumors were known. [words indistinct]. What the security services and judicial authority have done is quite important to our homeland. It is an extraordinary measure. The information that was made available when the Council of Ministers adopted its decision demonstrated to us that Lebanon's unity, the Lebanese legitimate institutions, the unity of the Lebanese, and coexistence in Lebanon were the targets. This is an extraordinary matter as far as we are concerned. What we experienced of events in the sixties, seventies, eighties, and early nineties made the government, as a result of the facts and information available to it, adopt extraordinary measures and stands that it announced after the recent session of the Council of Ministers. This, therefore, is not a state of emergency; had it been so, we would have simply announced it. This is an extraordinary case that could be handled only by the extraordinary decisions and measures that the government took to stabilize the situation, to bolster the decision, and to protect Lebanon's most important foundations: the unity of the land, the institutions, and the citizens. The measures were also meant to remove the specter of the dark years that our citizens have experienced, remove it from their (?daily) life and their aspirations for a better future. [Correspondent] [words indistinct] [Samahah] I am not concerned [words indistinct] from all private audio, visual, and even printed media. There is no discrimination before the law [words indistinct]. All are equal before the law. When officials apply this to themselves, they become equal to nonofficials and to those who are outside the decision centers in the government; both refrain from expressing their opinions in their media. This is a national measure taken in the context of national decisions at the level of the homeland. There was a need to ease the situation, remove the tension, and entrench stability. The decision was not meant to condemn the media or to evaluate them. Along with the other decisions, it was made out of concern for the citizens' psychological stability and national immunity. And because this is an extraordinary situation and the ban is an extraordinary, temporary move, the decision was basically related to the application of the Lebanese law, through the law on audio and visual media, to the existing media, which will continue to exist. This is not a restriction on freedoms, about which we are much concerned; this is an extraordinary case to bolster all elements of the homeland at a stage in which a new kind of confrontation is imposed on us by the Israeli enemy. Regarding the first question -- the deployment of the Lebanese Army in Saydun -- I cannot say anything because nothing has yet been said officially concerning the dead men. If they belonged to the Lebanese Army, then the Army Command will make an announcement, and if not, [words indistinct] if the resistance carried out an operation against elements collaborating with Israel inside our occupied territory and the operation succeeded. Regarding the second question, any media establishment on Lebanese territory that does not conform to the cabinet's decision to stop newscasts and direct or indirect political programs will be considered to have violated this decision. If that is the case, the necessary measures will be taken against it. There can be no vacillation or hesitation in this regard. The cabinet's decisions were made to be implemented and there can be no bargaining in this respect. There is a special situation in southern Lebanon where the citizens are influenced by the media services in the occupied Lebanese territory. These citizens are the target of psychological warfare waged by the radio of the collaborators with Israel [Kafr Killa Voice of the South] and by Israel's radio. We are currently studying how to confront this situation through Lebanon's state radio and television. The state radio reaches several areas and state television covers most parts of the south. In the next 24 hours we will boost transmission to that area. All this is within the framework of implementing the cabinet's decision. No one [word indistinct] in Lebanon has violated this decision. [Correspondent] First, do you believe gallows will be set up in Beirut [words indistinct]? Second, do you believe the investigation [words indistinct]? [Samahah] There is no person in Lebanon, be he Lebanese or non-Lebanese, who does not come under the jurisdiction of Lebanese law. The Lebanese law is above everyone, regardless of his capacity, responsibility, and position. The death sentence is the jurisdiction of the Lebanese judiciary. The government cannot anticipate the verdicts of the specialized courts on who will be sentenced to death or what the sentences will be. The Lebanese Government can affirm and I can affirm on behalf of the president that if the courts issue death sentences, these sentences will be carried out where the crimes took place. If the law or the investigation involves big and small fish, there are no small and big fish; there are citizens or residents on Lebanese territory. If they are convicted, accused, or arrest warrants are issued against them, the law will be applied and they will be brought to investigation. They will be equally treated and their full rights will be safeguarded, such as having a defense attorney present during the interrogation and to defend them in public trials that are held in accordance with the procedures for Lebanese trials. [Correspondent] Could we go back to [words indistinct]? [Samahah] What is the question? [Correspondent] The question is will the fate of [words indistinct]? [Samahah] [Words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]? [Samahah] I will start by answering the latter part, because the answer to the latter part makes answering the second and first parts of the questions easier. All the circumstances that have been created in the past in Christian society, or in the Christian street as you called it, took various forms to pave the way for what was supposed to take place in the Christian street as a result of the death of over 100 people in the Phalangist Party headquarters explosion and over 100 people in the Zuq Mikha'il Church bomb. We heard some voices programmed to make statements at the same time as the explosion, on the night it happened and the days following it, targeting the unity of Lebanon by calling for self-security and federalism. Thus, whoever wanted to frustrate the Christian street was planting the seeds through which he could reap Lebanon's fragmentation. He was building on the frustration and absence of relations with the authorities, the regime, and the legitimate institutions that unite the homeland. Through this gap, he would then demand international protection, to go along with talk we have recently heard about requests for international protection, as an after-effect of the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque or the international protection that has been demanded for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Lebanon is a different case altogether. Lebanon is not territory occupied by another power as is the case in the occupied Arab territories in Palestine which makes the Palestinians demand international protection. The same case as the Palestinian one also applies to the struggle in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for one party in the struggle to demand international protection from an oppressor party. Lebanon is united in its territory and people; there is coexistence among the spiritual families. Lebanon is also united in its institutions and authorities. Therefore, the objective of all attempts that started a long time ago to plant frustration in the minds of some people in the Christian street was to move from this condition to another condition which would be the result of programmed explosions. Reactions to these programmed explosions were also programmed to demand the fragmentation of the country. Consequently, one cannot be frustrated if one believes in the ideals of the spiritual families, believes in the homeland, has a democratic political pattern in the political work inside the country, and believes in his land. This frustration represents an evil desire that seeks to dismember the homeland. What is required is that we pass these tests. Thank God, our people and their leaders have shown cohesion in confronting the aftermath of the church bombing and the Phalangist Party headquarters bombing. We must rally more around the state's establishments, around the unity of the homeland, and around the citizens' unity. I now come to the subject of freedoms, and consequently the subject of the television and radio media law. [words indistinct] It is natural that this law should take its course [words indistinct]. The cabinet has now received this law. At its last meeting, the cabinet adopted a decision to discuss this law definitively at an extraordinary meeting to be held especially for this purpose on Tuesday [29 March]. [words indistinct] The decision is that we should study and approve this law at a meeting on Tuesday even if the meeting is a long one. I hope that even if the meeting takes a long time we will be able to finalize it and refer it [to parliament] on Wednesday. I am confident that with the new willpower of the cabinet [words indistinct] the law will reach the phase of final study and final approval at the next meeting. [words indistinct] [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, some newspaper reports claim that the United States [words indistinct] knew about the Council of Ministers' decision before they were issued [words indistinct]. Is this true? [Samahah] This is certainly not true. The way I read this report in some newspapers, it was published as though it was a confirmed report. In order to make these decisions -- and you can testify to what I am saying -- the recent session of the Council of Ministers started at 1700 and ended at 2230 in the evening. In other words, these decisions were discussed at length and in depth. They were decided by the session. No one can have prior information before a session begins about decisions that are made during that session through a consensus of the Council of Ministers and that are formulated during the session. Anyone who suggests such an idea, is wrong. The Lebanese Government's decisions are made by the Lebanese Government itself during its meetings. The Government is not affected by any necessity to inform some other party before it makes these decisions [words indistinct]. No. Many of the decisions were proposed during the [Council of Ministers] session and their proposition, discussion, and approval were dictated by the facts that were available to the Council of Ministers during the session. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] Mr. Minister [words indistinct] an attempt to [words indistinct] change the Lebanese society, and [words indistinct]. Could one say that the measures taken by the Council of Ministers are an attempt to [word indistinct] the media [words indistinct]? [Samahah] You are talking about the decisions dealing with the media? [Correspondent] Yes, the media and [word indistinct] preparing Lebanese society [words indistinct]? Can you comment on the [word indistinct] negotiations? [Samahah] The decisions that we have made are not linked in any way to the contents of the peace negotiations nor to any possible evaluations we might have about the results of these negotiations. The decisions we adopted were made as a result of the information available to us. They are an indivisible whole. The decisions we made concern the media, the political situation, security, and a host of issues on handling the extraordinary circumstances, situation, and reality the country is going through. The temporary nature of the decision regarding the audio-visual media is linked to this reality and nothing else. It has no background in, or relationship to the results of the negotiations on the one hand, nor to the actual contents of the law on audio and visual media to be issued. Had we wanted to restrict freedoms, or had there been ulterior motives to restrict freedoms, the decision would have also included the print media and press. Our decision does not include these two areas, because they are covered by a separate law, which exists within its own framework. The Cabinet decision was made under extraordinary circumstances for specific purposes and for a limited period of time. I sincerely hope that it will not last too long. The law includes the audio and visual media only, for the reasons I explained at the beginning of our meeting. There is nothing else behind these reasons and they are not linked to the negotiations or their results. The country's security situation [words indistinct] negotiations. When Israel threatens at the negotiations to change the course of these negotiations by disrupting security, we should be wary in interpreting this threat and linking it with the security incident that targets political decision-making through [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] some [word indistinct] the dissolution of the Lebanese Forces Party [words indistinct]? [Samahah] The decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces Party at the Cabinet meeting upon the interior minister's proposal was not made merely for judicial considerations. The Cabinet does not (?depend) on the judicial authorities' investigation. The Cabinet had no knowledge of the investigation and it has no access to the investigation before a judge makes an indictment. In its decision, the cabinet relied on security and political considerations and on a number of incidents and factors in the context of its eagerness to enhance the domestic situation. On the other hand, we in the government are concerned with Dr. Samir Ja'ja's case as much as we are concerned about any Lebanese citizen. As for what Dr. Ja'ja' decides to do, he is free to do what he likes. Whether or not he is implicated -- as your question might suggest -- this has to be decided by the judiciary in light of the evidence they have and the conviction of the investigating judge, who alone has the right to act according to his convictions. We cannot predict or jump to conclusions on this issue. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Samahah] According to the Cabinet's information, we do not believe that for four years Lebanon has witnessed such progress in consolidating stability and national unity and institutions as it has in the past three or four weeks. Besides, no conditions as serious and delicate as those which prevailed recently have ever existed in Lebanon before. The Cabinet's recent assessment of the general course of domestic events required us to adopt this kind of important, bold, and extraordinary decisions to protect the unity of the land and the people and the country's security and stability, all of which was at stake. Our aim was to dispel the fear that held the nation in thrall and that was blamed, we were told, on frustration. Bombs were planted, leaflets were distributed, places of worship were attacked, and rumors were spread, creating an extraordinary situation, one which the Cabinet was mindful of when it made its decisions at this specific point in time. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the media that supports or opposes the Government? [Samahah] Private media cannot be easily classified as progovernment or antigovernment. Those who support the Government and those who oppose it, as well as those who make up their minds as they go all work for various media organs. Means of expression are still available in Lebanon. We still have newspapers. The press is still free. We still have Lebanese Television, Radio Lebanon, and the NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY. The private media, by their very nature, were not in the habit of printing all statements in full. Your objection, although valid, is not the only consideration that dictates everything that should be published. The official media do not carry the full statements of the information minister, just the highlights. The situation will be dealt with gradually. The official media will be as open to the Government as to the opposition. They will reflect the country's political life to the fullest extent. The measure that has been taken is an extraordinary and temporary one, if I may repeat. We are not making excuses. This is an extraordinary situation and, whether you are Lebanese or foreign, you must be aware of that from the experience of the past few weeks, for you have been in close touch with events. Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures. These measures will not last for long, because we want the situation to go back to normal. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, what is it that is frightening you about the radio and television stations? Is there something specific [preceding word in English] about what these radio and television stations did? You have 50, 60, or 100 radio and television stations [words indistinct]. What precisely frightened you? [Samahah] In what you have watched and heard on those television and radio stations, were there not broadcasts that largely contributed to the spread of anxiety or sought to encourage resentment in the ranks of certain sects or groups, thus possibly serving the same aims as the recent bombings? I am not saying everyone did this; only some and perhaps only a few. After carefully observing these broadcasts, we judged that in addition to the positive and helpful atmosphere provided by some television and radio stations, some others created certain atmospheres that were amenable to Israeli-influenced plans. Were these stations doing this innocently or maliciously? In view of our exceptional circumstances, it was necessary for us to make not only this exceptional decision, but a large number of exceptional decisions. Furthermore, we made this decision because, for the first time ever, we had uncovered schemes to disrupt the country's security; we discovered their planners and those who carried out the schemes. We also came into possession of security information apart from the data that is purely judicial. We acted preemptively in order to protect our resolutions during these exceptional circumstances. This will not last long. Soon these audiovisual media will be governed by law, as in other countries. I do not wish to draw a comparison between Lebanon, in its current circumstances, and those very few countries that have no new laws governing the media. We must keep in mind that no one else has passed through 20 dark years as we did. No one else is going through a period of domestic recuperation while living in regional circumstances like ours and negotiating at the same time. We are not taking anyone to task, as I said at the beginning. I am saying exactly what I mean. I was careful in choosing my words when I discussed the subject. We are not taking anyone to task. The measure we implemented was precautionary, not disciplinary. We are not trying to suppress these media. Had we wanted to do this, we would have closed them down. We simply adopted a protective measure, pending the issuance of the media law and the results of our ongoing communications with the people in charge of those media. [Correspondent] What guarantee is there, Mr. Minister, that [words indistinct] the media law for a period [words indistinct]? [Samahah] Thank you for that question. The guarantee is the Lebanese system. The nature of the Lebanese system and the existence of the democratic institutions in the Lebanese system, particularly the existence of the Chamber of Deputies, is our guarantee that no one will misuse his authority. I think that as a minister in the Government I know that the Government does not want and will not misuse its authority. If, God forbid, the authority has been misused, there is the Chamber of Deputies to monitor the misuse of authority. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the issuance of the law by the Council of Ministers on Tuesday? [Samahah] Yes. You arrived late. These questions were asked before your arrival. [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces was adopted after the judicial authorities' decision. The judicial authorities issued a tentative indictment [words indistinct] regarding a certain political party, but no measures were adopted against it. Why? [Samahah] The tentative indictment was issued yesterday. A Council of Ministers meeting will be held on Tuesday. Wait for the Council of Ministers' decisions on Tuesday. [Correspondent] In the wake of the Zuq Mikha'il explosion, [words indistinct] arrest warrants were issued [words indistinct] the Lebanese Forces. [Words indistinct] involved certain areas only? [Samahah] They covered all areas, and successive ... [Correspondent, interrupting] ...did not go beyond a specific area? [Samahah] Measures are being adopted in all the Lebanese Army's deployment areas. Statements are being issued by the Lebanese Army regarding all the confiscations that are taking place. There is no discrimination. All Lebanese are equal under the law and according to security measures. There is no autonomous security in Lebanon. [Correspondent] When will it take up its new (?positions)? [Samahah] It will take its new positions in its present deployment areas, in the areas where it has the ability to do so, and in the areas where the Syrian Army, which complements the Lebanese security forces, is deployed. The same measures are being adopted in all Lebanese territory and covers all Lebanese citizens. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, my question is about the operations area of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon. [Words indistinct] the deployment of the Lebanese Army, will it leave the area or [words indistinct]? [Samahah] This involves another very careful consideration related to the Israeli occupation and the confrontation with Israeli occupation. [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, did the Council of Ministers consider [words indistinct]? [Samahah] These measures have been adopted and will be implemented. The Lebanese authorities are working to maintain security according to Government policy. Thank you.
