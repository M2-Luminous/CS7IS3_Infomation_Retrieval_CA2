Addressing a meeting here today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of their formulation, Li said these principles provide the basis for the establishment and development of state-to-state relations. The principles, namely mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-existence, were jointly advocated by China, India and Burma (now Myanmar) in June 1954. Li said that the five principles were born in response to the call of the times. The spirit of the five principles was embodied in the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference in 1955 and reaffirmed by the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations Among States adopted by the 25th session of the UN General Assembly in 1970 and the Declaration on the Establishment of a New International Economic Order adopted by the sixth special session of the UN General Assembly in 1974. Many documents of international organizations and conferences also quoted the five principles, he added. Li said that by observing the five principles, countries with different ideologies, social systems and levels of economic development can very well establish mutual trust and friendly and cooperative relations; by violating these principles, even countries with identical ideologies and social systems may run into confrontation and even armed conflict. As a co-initiator of the five principles, he said, China has always upheld and observed these principles. China has established diplomatic relations with 158 countries, carried out exchanges and cooperation with over 200 countries and regions in the economic, trade, scientific and technological and cultural fields, established amicable relations with all its neighbors and surrounding countries, and has resolved boundary issues left over from the past with most of its neighbors, Li added. The Chinese premier added that China has contributed its share to peaceful settlement of international disputes, promotion of international cooeration and maintenance of regional and world peace. Li Peng noted that the past 40 years have witnessed enormous changes in the world, the bi-polar structure has come to an end while the trend towards multi-polarity is accelerating. International relations are undergoing profound changes. By and large, the international situation is moving towards greater relaxation of tension, and for an extended period of time, a new world war could be averted, Li said, adding that however, the end of the Cold War does not mean a trouble-free world. He emphasized that non-interference in each other's internal affairs is at the core of the five principles and the new international order. The world is a colorful and diversified place as witnessed not only by different social systems, values and ideologies, but also by different histories, traditions, religious beliefs and cultural backgrounds among nations, he said. "Only when we recognize these differences and respect one another will it be possible to expand cooperation, increase exchanges and live in harmony," Li said. To impose one's own values and model of society on others is bound to lead to tension and confrontation between states, Li said. Li said mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and mutual non-aggression and peaceful co-existence between states is the basis of the five principles and a new international order, Li said. Such actions as undermining or divesting another country of its sovereignty, violating or annexing another country's territory or resorting to the threat of use of force to advance one's own policy under whatever pretext should not be allowed, Li said. He pointed out that Deng Xiaoping has made penetrating comments on the five principles. Deng had put forth the great concept of "one country, two systems" to settle the questions of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Deng said: "We have initiated the concept of 'one country, two systems' for the settlement of issues concerning China's reunification. It will also be a kind of peaceful co-existence." Li said Deng also pointed out that as for some territorial disputes between nations, the question of sovereignty may be put aside for the time being and joint development may go ahead first. "We are actively discussing with the countries concerned ways of joint development in the disputed areas with a view to maintaining peace and stability in the region and averting tension," Li said. Equality and mutual benefit of the five principles is a principle guiding economic relations, Li said. "Countries should learn from each other in economic development and help supply each other's needs through mutually-beneficial cooperation on an equal footing, whereas trade protectionism of any form and exchanges of unequal values are undesirable." Li emphasized that the Chinese people are devoting themselves heart and soul to the modernization of their country. "We need a peaceful international environment and want to develop friendly relations and cooperation with all other countries." In conclusion, Li said that holding high the banner of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, the Chinese Government and people will join other countries in working for the establishment of a new international political and economic order and for a better future for all mankind.
