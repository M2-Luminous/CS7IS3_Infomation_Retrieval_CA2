He pointed out that the settlement of problems connected with legal and social aid to servicemen involved in wars and military operations in foreign countries encounter difficulties in the CIS. He came out for the improvement of the system of the realization of interstate legal acts of aid to veterans, adopted in the framework of the CIS, including control over their implementation by top legislative bodies of sovereign states. Shumeyko expressed the hope that programmes, coordinated between countries of the CIS and connected with the welfare and health care of war veterans, will be given budgetary support.
