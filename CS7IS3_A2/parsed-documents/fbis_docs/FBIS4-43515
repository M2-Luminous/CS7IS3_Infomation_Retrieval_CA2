Anyone playing down the Socialist Unity Party of Germany regime today was jeopardizing the "fundamental antitotalitarian consensus" in Germany, Kohl said in Bonn today. The same applied to those who sought to suppress the crimes of the national-socialist tyranny. Kohl added: "Left-wing and right-wing radicalism is shameful for our country." The chancellor emphasized that remembering the popular uprising in the GDR of 17 June 1953 remained topical even after German unification. It united all democrats in the belief that there should never be another dictatorship. History has proved those right who at the time had "worked courageously and selflessly for freedom and German unity." Kohl recalled that the peaceful uprising in Berlin, Jena, and many other industrial centres of the former GDR was "brutally put down by the communist power apparatus."
