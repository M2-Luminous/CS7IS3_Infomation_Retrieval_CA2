John Major was thrown on to the defensive by the Chancellor's admission, in an early morning radio broadcast, that the increases would "take a bit of the edge off consumer demand." Mr Clarke's acknowledgment, exploited gleefully by the Labour leadership, coincided with a new double warning of the fragility of the recent economic improvement. Labour was pressing home its attack in a week when millions of people have received their new tax codes showing the increases in the past two budgets. Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, said ministers had admitted this month that tax rises would slow the recovery. "Now the Chancellor is going further in admitting that tax rises will check the recovery. That means they will halt the recovery for the time being." Verbal warfare over the economy intensified as a report from British Chambers of Commerce spoke of a "glass ceiling" holding growth to less than pre-recession levels. Another survey of consumer opinion found that households in London and the Southeast were bracing themselves for a year of austerity. Mr Clarke and Mr Major brushed aside the latest figures to maintain that recovery was well under way. Their counter-offensive came as the Cabinet, in an 80-minute political session without officials, concluded that the brightening economic outlook offered the Tories their best hope of averting disaster in the council and European Parliament elections in the early summer. "We have been through some difficulties but the opportunity to present our case is there and will build up towards the elections," one minister said. "It comes from growing evidence that the economic situation is getting better, which will have its effect." Mr Clarke insisted that Britain was on course for a "steady recovery at a sustainable level" and added that it was silly to judge the economy on the strength of one month's figures. Appearing to rule out an early cut in interest rates, he said the important thing was to behave responsibly and keep inflation down. He gave a buoyant assessment of the state of the economy. "We have manufacturing output up. We have unemployment that has been falling. Retail sales in these figures in December were 4 percent up on the year before," he said. "Our inflation record for the last 12 months is the best we have seen since the 1960's. We are plainly on course for a steady recovery at a sustainable level. We have the chance of keeping inflation down. It is absolutely silly for people to keep reacting to one month's figures." He added: "I want to see the recovery stronger than it is, but I think the actual position is, we do have the best recovery of any major economy in Europe." Mr Major, challenged by John Smith over Mr Clarke's remarks, said there was "no doubt whatsoever that recovery is under way." He pointed out that Mr Clarke had also said that the recovery was now "strong enough not to be stopped." But the Labour Leader said that tax increases, equivalent to 7 pence on income tax, were "bound to hit family budgets for six." As he was taunted by Mr Smith over Mr Clarke's'remarks, the Prime Minister hit back: "The economy has grown over 2 percent in 12 months and has risen for six successive quarters. Retail sales have grown 4 percent in the last year. Car production, manufacturing output and export volumes are all up. With low inflation and low interest rates there is no doubt whatsoever that recovery is under way." Mr Smith, however, said that people were starting to see the full impact of tax increases on their standard of living. He asked: "Do you recall saying during the election campaign that greater taxation would kill economic recovery stone dead? If it was true then, why isn't it true now? Or is that one of many things you find it easy to forget you ever mentioned?"
