Lenin, and the Republic Clinical Hospital, Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health; UDC 658.387.003.1] [Text] The new economic mechanism of managing the public health system based on economic methods began with experiments conducted in 1988 in St. Petersburg and in Kemerovo and Samara oblasts. Study of the results of this experiment, analysis of available literature and familiarization with the principles of organizing and managing a public health system in a number of countries and republics permitted us to develop our own concept for transition of a large multiprofile treatment and diagnosis complex, such as the Republic Clinical Hospital, to economic methods of management and administration. Two basic principles were laid at the basis of this concept: first, the principle of raising the level and quality of medical assistance provided to patients, achieved by way of a new mechanism of planning, financing, administering and controlling the quality of the treatment and diagnosis process, and evaluating the activity of the entire hospital as a whole and each of each structural subdivisions; second, the principle of fundamentally changing the hospital's financing to settling accounts with each cured patient rather than allocating a budget for the entire year. Three basic stages can be clearly delineated in the practical implementation of this concept. The first stage (preparatory) embraced the period up to April 1991. It included economic training for physicians and secondary medical personnel in a program set up by us, study of existing experience, development of our own variant of clinical-statistical groups and the principles of settling mutual accounts and of medical and financial document turnover, and calculation of the cost of medical services. Clinical-statistical groups were formed by the directors and physicians of the hospital's departments on the basis of an analysis of the structure of hospital morbidity over the 3 preceding years. By breaking down the diagnostic and treatment process into days of the patient's hospital stay, we were able to create flow charts on the basis of which a list of prices of medical services was formed. The new functional interrelationships between clinical departments, the hospital statistical service, the automated control system division, the planning and financial division and the accounting office brought about the need for making certain changes in the official accounting forms used in statistical and financial document turnover, and for developing the procedures of working with these documents. The first stage of introducing the economic mechanism of management had as its result an agreement between the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan and the Republic Clinical Hospital, as well as agreements between the administration and the hospital's departments. According to the agreement the Republic Clinical Hospital obligated itself to organize treatment and diagnosis in the hospital's departments and in the polyclinic, and consultative and emergency aid in the rayons, through the efforts of its associates and at a certain level of work quality. In the meantime the Health Ministry will provide financing to the Republic Clinical Hospital for each patient who is cured or receives consultation in accordance with a price list, and with regard for the treatment results. As an attachment to the agreement we determined the quantitative and qualitative indicators embracing all aspects of the hospital's diverse activity. Attainment of these indicators meant full financing of the hospital's work; when certain of them were not met, penalties went into effect on the basis of mutual financial settlements. Fulfillment of agreements between the hospital administration and the individual services was organized in similar fashion. A system of monitoring treatment quality was developed; a commission to summarize quarterly results of fulfilling the agreement was approved by an order of the hospital's chief physician. Work under the agreements (the second stage of introducing the new economic mechanism of management) with the departments and services within the hospital made it possible in 1991 to upgrade the quality and intensity of the work of the personnel, to materially reinforce the personal responsibility of each medical worker for the end results of both his own labor and the labor of the entire department, and to do away with ``leveling'' of wages. It must be emphasized that the Republic Clinical Hospital fulfilled its agreed obligations completely on the basis of the work results for 1991. Intensification of the work of the services and of all associates made it possible to reduce the average daily time of a patient's occupancy of a bed in the hospital as a whole, as a result of which around an additional 6,000 patients received hospital care, which was over 25 percent of the total number of hospitalized patients stipulated in the agreement. The number of inhabitants of the republic's rayons in the hospital was 60.7 percent (the planned indicator was 60 percent). The work quality of the associates improved, and contracted obligations were fulfilled and surpassed. This was reflected in the hospital's financial activity. Under the new conditions of management the hospital earned an additional 12.5 percent of funds over what was planned by the budget. According to the results for 1991, the wages of hospital associates generally increased by an average of 40 percent in comparison with what they received in March 1991. During 1991 the hospital also provided medical services on the basis of direct contracts with enterprises and institutions, as well as through health insurance companies. The second stage of introducing economic methods of management ended with summarization of the results of fulfilling the agreement on joint work by the Republic Clinical Hospital and the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Tatarstan in 1991. The results achieved by the Republic Clinical Hospital became an object of business-like and incisive discussion at a meeting of the board of the Republic of Tatarstan Ministry of Health on 26 February 1992, at which the principles of organizing our work were approved. In courses organized by the training center, directors of public health institutions in the republic's cities and rayons, their deputies, economists, accountants and department directors were acquainted with the system and sequence of organizing the efforts of the Republic Clinical Hospital to prepare for and accomplish the transition to economic methods of management. The accumulated experience allowed us to account for issues left unresolved in the preceding stages when we signed an agreement with the Ministry of Health for 1992. Thus, the clinical-statistical groups were reexamined, and consideration was given in them to the particular features of the course and nature of disease treatment and to presence of accompanying illnesses and complications, which brought about the need for differentiating the prices. Expert evaluation sheets were drawn up for the purpose of evaluating the completeness of the set of therapeutic measures and the quality of treatment rendered to each patient. Use of these sheets will make it possible to carry out three-stage control of quality and make an integral evaluation of it. Thus we have been in the third stage of the work since the beginning of 1992--introducing the contract form of labor organization and wages for the hospital administration and department directors. The preliminary results of using the new economic methods of management in the Republic Clinical Hospital were as follows: The attitude toward patients changed--the patient became a desired guest in the minds of the hospital, the physicians and all medical personnel; in addition interest appeared in curing a larger number of patients with better quality of treatment. And it is the latter that determines the wages received both in the different structural subdivisions of the hospital and by individual associates for the real results of their concrete work.
