The adopted amendment of the law is a reaction to experience gained in applying the law particularly in terms of making some provisions more specific because their language was subject to varying interpretations and their application in practical terms was connected with certain problems (for example, remuneration for overtime work and holiday work). At the same time, the amendment contains provisions allowing for the modification, through generally binding regulations, of the procedure to be adopted in regulating the amount of resources to be set aside for pay and emoluments in return for the readiness to work. What Will Follow? The effective date of Law No. 143 is set for 1 April 1994. It is the basis for the creation of additional decisive documents, including government regulations and subsequently adopted internal pay regulations in the Defense Department. At the present time, finance components in the Ministry of Defense have processed the results of the markup proceedings to which the proposal for the government regulation was subjected. Any incidental changes will be processed by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs into the final text of the government regulation, which the government will approve in March. This document, stemming from the amendment to Law No. 143, will be the starting point for the adoption of new pay regulations in the Army. Among other things, these will include new tariff groups (pay categories). At the same time, a solution is found for the so-called overcoming of the transition period in April. Innovations Pertaining to Extra Pay for Leadership Increases in the rates of extra pay for leadership are based on the desire to maintain the desirable relationship with respect to pay categories, the levels of which were raised during the previous era. This led to a narrowing of the relative differences in pay for rank-and-file and leading employees. What is essentially involved here is a better reward for leadership. Therefore, the employer must take into account, within the framework of better pay for leadership, any possible overtime work performed by the leading worker. A new provision also sets better pay for leadership in the case of employees who are not charged with being leaders but who are authorized to direct the work of other employees. This rewards the demanding nature of this kind of work, even at the lowest levels. The amendment to the law also contains details of the span. If we disregard the leading employees of central organs of the state administration (for example, the minister and his deputies, department directors, etc.), the span is as follows: A leader who directs the work of subordinates (for example, unit commanders)--500-3,000 korunas [Kc]; a leading employee who directs several formations of an organization--Kc1,000-6,000; a deputy of a statutory organ--Kc2,000-9,000; a statutory organ--Kc3,000-13,000. An employee who is not a leader but who, according to the organizational chart, is authorized to organize, direct, and control the work of others is entitled to extra pay for leadership, depending on the demanding nature of such work, within the range of Kc330-1,500. The amount of extra pay for the employee is determined by the employer or by the individual who appointed the employee to his position or who assigned him to that position. Overtime and Compensatory Leave Even this institution has been completely redefined. For an hour of overtime work, the employee is entitled to the portion of his monthly pay reflecting an hour of work, excluding overtime work, within the calendar month. The reward for overtime work takes the form of extra pay. The basis for computing this pay continues to be the average earning of the individual.
