After Austria's entry into the European Union [EU], their major task will be to control the 1,200-km external EU border with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, and other countries. Loeschnak, who flew to the Nikolsdorf border crossing on board a Bell Augusta-type police helicopter, stated: "The control of the border by the police, customs officers, and the Army has proven successful but is no permanent solution. Thus, the historic opportunity that is opening up after entry into the EU should be used to establish a uniform border police." In the event of EU membership, controls at the border with Germany and Italy would no longer be necessary. Redundant customs officers might be incorporated into the border police. Currently, 3,800 customs officers are being asked whether they want to continue to be employed by the Finance Ministry or whether they want to join the border police. Loeschnak mentioned the following major reform goals: - The equipping of border control offices with computers to make it easier to call up data of wanted persons. - Enabling the new border police to slowly reduce the deployment of the Army at the borders. - Strengthening the border police in the fight against crime and illegal refugees.
