The economy's future and employment must be supported through a broadly conceived program for adult education and an active labor market policy. To reduce unemployment a decision is needed which is based on voluntarism and on agreement among the labor market parties. This is what the SDP said in a motion on jobs policy which the party delegates approved in its meeting on Wednesday [16 March]. In its 21-point employment stimulus program, the SDP promises 100,000 new jobs or training slots this year. It is estimated that state funding should be increased by 2.5 billion [markkas]. This would increase the pressure for added borrowing this year, but lead to decreased expenditures in coming years. A low interest rate would be the main goal for monetary policy. An investment program targeting improvements in transportation, education, research, and product development as main areas would be sought. Taxation must be quickly eased to increase domestic demand. The tax rate for workers and pensioners must be reduced by at least 1.5 percent. The reform with the value-added tax should be delayed to improve employment prospects in the private sector. To ease unemployment in the construction sector there should be spending on renovating residences. An increased effort in adult education and a guaranteed subsidized job after 500 days of unemployment are other SDP model proposals. Unemployment compensation must be converted from the system of passive subsidies to one with a more active job protection. With regard to incomes policy, the demands for solidarity and competitiveness must be combined. In wage pacts there must be a goal-directed attempt to improve the employment situation. The possibilities of taking training or sabbatical leave for periods of three to 12 months must be facilitated, on condition that an unemployed worker can be hired through this. [passage omitted]
