"It is a reasonable idea," Takemura was quoted as saying of the proposal in a meeting with SDP chairman Tomiichi Murayama. Both Sakigake and the SDP quit the ruling coalition last month, leaving the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to be a minority government. Sakigake has offered cooperation for the Hata cabinet without occupying any post in it, while the SDP has declared it is an opposition party. Murayama urged Hata on Wednesday to dissolve the House of Representatives and call a snap general election under the current election system. Murayama told the Sakigake leader that the premier's authority to dissolve the lower house should not be restricted just because the Diet has not yet passed a bill for redistributing multiple-seat constituencies into single-seat electoral districts, the officials said. The Diet in January passed the new electoral system revision bill to replace the multiseat system with a mix of 300 single seats and 200 seats under proportional representation. But a separate bill has to be passed to reorganize the single-seat constituencies before an election can be held under the new system. The meeting between Takemura and Murayama took place in the SDP headquarters. They also met Wednesday at the Sakigake headquarters. The two leaders also agreed to initiate talks aimed at reconciling their policy and ideological differences as a prerequisite for cementing their solidarity and parliamentary tactical collaboration, the officials said. One of the key differences is over the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, opposed by some SDP members but supported by Sakigake, which was set up by a breakaway group of Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislators.
