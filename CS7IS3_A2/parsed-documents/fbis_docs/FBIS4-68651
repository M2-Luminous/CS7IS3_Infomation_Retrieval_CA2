Public Employment and Income At the end of February around 2 million people in the Commonwealth countries were seeking jobs with the aid of employment services, and 1.4 million of them were registered as unemployed. The correlation of supply and demand in the labor market in the different countries changed in the following manner in January and February this year (thousands of people at the end of the month): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Number of jobless applying f-|Enterprise personnel require-| | |or placement services |ments reported to employment | | | |services | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |January |February |January |February | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |48.8 |49.7 |10.9 |10.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |112.9 |115.5 |0.9 |1.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |72.5 |76.7 |13.5 |11.6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |... |... |27.8 |25.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |8.3 |9.6 |3.0 |2.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |15.8 |17.1 |0.9 |1.0 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |1164.6 |1266.5 |282.7 |274.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |130.9 |143.1 |... |17.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |30.1 |32.8 |26.2 |28.7 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |130.0 |138.0 |120.1 |108.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- There were disparities between the demand for manpower and the supply in most of the states in February, just as there had been in preceding months. In Azerbaijan there were 4.8 jobless individuals for each vacant position in February 1994, as compared to 3.1 in February 1993. The respective figures for other countries were 92.2 and 74.8 for Armenia, 6.6 and 2.9 for Belorussia, 3.3 and 1.8 for Kirghizia, 4.6 and 3.5 for Russia, and 1.3 and 1.1 for Ukraine. In Uzbekistan the correlation displayed virtually no change and was 1.1. In Tajikistan the lower number of jobless individuals per vacancy (15.5 in February 1993 and 8.2 in February 1994) was due to migration and the resulting increase in the demand of enterprises for workers (to fill the vacated positions). The data below indicate the number of unemployed individuals registered with employment services in January and February 1994: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Thousands of people |In % of preceding month | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |January |February |January |February | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |20.2 |20.9 |103.7 |103.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |104.8 |107.0 |102.1 |102.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |72.5 |76.7 |109.5 |105.8 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |42.9 |46.7 |105.8 |108.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |3.1 |3.6 |106.4 |116.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |15.8 |17.1 |112.1 |108.2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |893.6 |989.5 |107.0 |110.7 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |22.7 |25.2 |105.6 |111.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |14.2 |17.1 |106.8 |120.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |87.7 |93.1 |104.5 |106.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The proportional numbers of jobless individuals qualifying for unemployed status in February 1994 were 42.1 percent in Azerbaijan, 92.7 percent in Armenia, 100 percent in Belorussia and Moldavia, 37.3 percent in Kirghizia, 78.1 percent in Russia, 17.6 percent in Tajikistan, 52.1 percent in Uzbekistan, and 67.5 percent in Ukraine. The proportional numbers of unemployed individuals collecting unemployment benefits in February were 23.3 percent in Azerbaijan, 20.8 percent in Armenia, 52.6 percent in Belorussia, 38.2 percent in Kazakhstan, 58.8 percent in Kirghizia, 25.2 percent in Moldavia, 64 percent in Russia, 18.4 percent in Tajikistan, 52.1 percent in Uzbekistan, and 46 percent in Ukraine. The average amounts of unemployment compensation in February were 67.2 drams in Armenia, 12.1 lei in Moldavia, and 147,800 karbovantsy in Ukraine. The proportional numbers of unemployed individuals assigned to vocational training courses by employment services at the end of February were 1.7 percent in Belorussia, around 1 percent in Kazakhstan, 19 percent in Kirghizia, 6 percent in Moldavia, 5 percent in Russia, 20 percent in Uzbekistan, and 7 percent in Ukraine. The rise in the average monthly nominal wage (including material assistance and social benefits) in January-February 1994 in comparison with the same period last year is illustrated by the following data: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |January-February 1994 |February 1994 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Units of nati-|In relation t-|Units of nati-|In relation t-| | |onal currency |o Jan-Feb 93, |onal currency |o Feb 93, tim-| | | |times | |es | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan, m-|4,850 |4.4 |4,900 |4.3 | |anat | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia, dram |473 |... |516 |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia, r-|231,315 |14.8 |257,000 |15.0 | |uble | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan, t-|380.4 |13.5 |430.0 |13.1 | |enge | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia, som|175.0 |5.2 |187.0 |4.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia, lei |72.1 |9.2 |76.5 |9.3 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia, ruble |151,000 |8.3 |160,000 |7.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan, r-|30,000 |8.1 |35,000 |8.0 | |uble | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan, |... |... |... |... | |manat | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan, r-|94,344 |15.5 |100,000 |15.5 | |uble | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine, karb-|820,508 |45.6 |825,678 |40.9 | |ovanets | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- In Azerbaijan the nominal wage was 5.4 times as high as the official minimum wage in February this year (3.8 times in February 1993), in Armenia it was 4.7 times as high (1.7 in 1993), in Belorussia it was 8.6 times as high (5.7), in Kazakhstan it was 10.8 times as high (6.6), in Russia it was 10.9 times as high (9.0), in Uzbekistan it was 3.3 times as high (2.6), and in Ukraine it was 13.8 times as high (4.4).

Consumer Market Inflationary processes continued in February in the consumer markets of virtually all of the Commonwealth states. The prices of food, non-food items, and paid services for the population continued to rise, both in the organized and unorganized sectors. The following data illustrate the dynamics of the retail trade prices of consumer goods in the Commonwealth states in January-February 1994: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |In relation to same period o-|February 1994 in % of: | | |f 1993, times | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Jan-Feb |February |Jan 94 |Dec 93 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |8.4 |8.7 |122 |183 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |43.8 |41.6 |113 |171 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |32.0 |30.8 |124 |176 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgia |... |115.5 |141 |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |22.4 |22.3 |131 |190 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |12.6 |11.1 |116 |131 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia[.sup]1|16.5 |16.5 |127 |184 | |[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia[.sup]1 |7.4* |7.0* |111 |130 | |[/] | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |16.0 |14.0 |94 |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |26.8 |23.7 |117 |143 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |12.1 |12.4 |118 |149 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |59.5 |55.5 |112 |139 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1. Consumer goods price index. | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rise in food prices was relatively restricted in Armenia (an increase of 11 percent in comparison with January), in Russia (9 percent), and in Uzbekistan (8 percent). Food prices in Tajikistan decreased by 11 percent. Meanwhile, food prices rose 21 percent in Belorussia, 25 percent in Azerbaijan, and 28 percent in Moldavia in the past month. In Kazakhstan the rise in food prices in February was 32 percent, and the prices were twice as high as they had been in December. This was a result of the centralized cancellation of earlier price controls on sales of the main food products to the population (meat of all types, butter and vegetable oil, milk and dairy products, eggs, noodles, sugar, and salt). The highest increases in food prices in the organized trade network in Russia in February were for milk and dairy products (20-25 percent). The prices of bread and baked goods, cereal grain, fish, and vegetables increased by 15-20 percent, and the prices of meat and meat products rose 8-12 percent. The average prices of milk, dairy products, bread, baked goods, and vegetables in Russia were 1.4-1.5 times as high as in December 1993. The retail price index for non-food items in February was 110 percent of the January figure in Russia, 116.2-117.1 percent in Armenia and Azerbaijan, 125.5-128.5 percent in Moldavia, Belorussia, and Kazakhstan, 131 percent in Uzbekistan, and virtually the same as the earlier figure in Tajikistan. The prices of agricultural produce in urban markets continued to rise. The following data illustrate the dynamics of prices in this sales channel this year: ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Feb 1994 in % |Feb 94 in % o-|Jan-Feb 94 in |Feb 94 in rel-| | |of Jan 94 |f Dec 93 |relation to J-|ation to Feb 9| | | | |an-Feb 93, ti-|3, times | | | | |mes | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |149 |239 |16.1 |17.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |115 |124 |96.6 |86.2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |124 |181 |25.2 |22.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgia |148 |-- |-- |679.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |119 |165 |25.7 |23.9 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |114 |130 |9.0 |7.6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |114 |140 |12.6 |11.7 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |114 |133 |6.7* |6.4 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |-- |-- |17.3 |7.6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |150 |222 |48.3 |52.6 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |127 |117 |23.4 |24.5 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |107 |132 |57.6 |52.1 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prices in urban markets in Belorussia in February this year in comparison with prices in February 1993 were 20.7 times as high for meat products, 11.8 times as high for potatoes, 19.4 times as high for vegetables (including 11.7 times for fresh cabbage and 43.8-47.0 times for onions and pickled cucumbers), and 30.2 times as high for dairy products. For citydwellers in Kazakhstan, potatoes cost 23.7 times as much in urban markets this February as they did last February, vegetables cost 35.8 times as much (40.6 times for fresh cabbage, 58.9 times for onions, and 78.5 times for fresh cucumbers); beef in republic markets cost 19.3 times as much, pork and lard cost 22.9-27.0 times as much, dairy products cost 29.4 times as much, and honey cost 53.9 times as much. Although the average increase in prices in Russian urban markets in February 1994 in comparison with February 1993 was 6.4 times, the prices of vegetables were 18 times as high, potato prices were 7.3 times as high, fruit prices were 5.1 times as high, the price of fresh milk was 8.3 times as high, and egg prices were 7.4 times as high.

Including the turnover of urban markets, according to the data of a sample survey for January-February--160.6 billion sum-coupons, with 86.8 billion sum-coupons in February. Commodity turnover in Russia, including expert estimates of the sales volume of unregistered (and therefore unrecorded) enterprises and the unorganized imports and sales of goods from other countries by private individuals, amounted to 23.8 trillion rubles in the past two months, or 7.5 times as much as in the same period last year in current prices and 2.3 percent more in comparable prices. The private sector's share of the consumer market is growing. In Russia, for example, it represented (including consumer cooperatives) 56 percent of all commodity turnover in January-February 1994 (40 percent in January-February 1993), in Turkmenistan it represented around 40 percent, and in Kazakhstan it represented 49 percent. In spite of the general reduction of 2 percent in the physical commodity turnover of officially registered enterprises in Russia in February 1994 in comparison with the same period last year, food sales decreased by 3 percent, including decreases of 9-17 percent for meat and poultry, canned meat, and vegetable oil and of 24-30 percent for canned fish, eggs, and sugar. The organized trade network in Uzbekistan sold almost a third less meat and meat products than last year, sales of eggs and cereal grains decreased by more than half, sales of sugar and salt decreased by around 20 percent, sales of woolen fabric decreased by 30 percent, and sales of clothing and linens decreased by almost 40 percent. Supplies of goods entering the retail trade network in Turkmenistan were 16 percent smaller than last year's for meat, 34 percent smaller for sausage, and 56 percent smaller for canned meats; deliveries to the retail network decreased by 41 percent for cotton fabric, 65 percent for woolen fabric, 44 percent for hosiery, and 22 percent for leather footwear. The retail trade network in the republic did receive 1.4 times as much lard as last year and 1.6 times as much tea, sugar, and cheese. The slowdown of sales of consumer goods increased commodity stocks in retail trade. On 1 March, for example, the retail link of the Armenian trade network had reserve stocks for 72 days of trade, in comparison with 54 days on the same date last year. The respective figures for other states were 60 and 48 days for Belorussia, 73 and 53 days for Kazakhstan, 114 and 78 days for Kirghizia, 53 and 47 days for Ukraine, and 43 and 41 days for Russia. Supplies were approximately the same as last year in retail trade in Azerbaijan (100 days), Uzbekistan (71 days), and Moldavia (44 days); reserves in Turkmenistan decreased from 100 days on 1 March 1993 to 80 days of trade on 1 March this year. The state of the market for paid services in 1994 in all Commonwealth states was distinguished by a continued dramatic decrease in physical volume accompanied by an increase in volume in terms of cost.

Including services performed by private individuals--2.6 trillion rubles, representing 1100 percent of the previous year's figure in actual prices and 54 percent of that figure in comparable prices. The personal service sector is in a particularly unsatisfactory state: The number of personal service enterprises is still declining, and the reduction of the physical volume of many types of personal services is sizable. In Belorussia, for example, the number of studios and workshops decreased by 11 percent in the past year (and by 18 percent in rural areas); shoemaking services decreased by 39 percent in comparable prices, and tailoring services decreased by 45 percent, with corresponding decreases of 60 percent in the repair and maintenance of privately owned motor vehicles and 63 percent in cabinetmaking services. Paid services cost much more in February than in January this year in Armenia--an increase of 58.7 percent--and Azerbaijan--an increase of 42.8 percent. The lowest service rate increases were in Turkmenistan (6.8 percent) and Tajikistan (8.6 percent). Public utility rates rose 5.4 percent in Belorussia, 27.2 percent in Moldavia, 3.5 percent in Tajikistan, and 241.4 percent in Uzbekistan. Passenger transport fares rose 71.7 percent in Azerbaijan, 85.4 percent in Armenia, 10.4 percent in Belorussia, and 8.3 percent in Tajikistan. Communication service rates increased by 68 percent in Moldavia and 40 percent in Uzbekistan. The lowest increases were in Kirghizia (1.6 percent), Tajikistan (4.1 percent), and Kazakhstan (4.5 percent). The rates stayed the same in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. Day-care fees for pre-schoolers rose 3.9 percent in Armenia, 0.6 percent in Belorussia, 56.5 percent in Kazakhstan, 47.2 percent in Moldavia, and 76 percent in Uzbekistan. There were sizable increases in the rates of health care services in Kazakhstan (117.8 percent) and Tajikistan (117.2 percent) and relatively small increases in Azerbaijan (12.1 percent) and Uzbekistan (26.2 percent). The most dramatic increases in service rates in health resorts were in Azerbaijan (94.1 percent) and Kirghizia (56.3 percent), and the smallest increases were in Turkmenistan (10.3 percent) and Uzbekistan (15.1 percent). Increases in fees for travel services ranged from 15.8 percent in Kirghizia and 22.6 percent in Belorussia to 67.2 percent in Turkmenistan and 87.1 percent in Moldavia. Industry Changes in the total industrial product and the prices of producer-enterprises in Commonwealth states in comparison with January-February 1993 are illustrated by the following data (in percentages): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | | |For comparison: Jan-Feb 93 i-| | | | |n relation to Jan-Feb 92 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Total product |Producer pric-|Total product |Producer pric-| | |(comparable p-|es | |es | | |rices) | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |81.9 |815 |72.0 |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |105 |3604 |29 |859 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |63.5 |3698 |83.6 |1186 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgia |... |... |... |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |70 |1346 |89.4 |1830 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |62.7 |754 |79.3 |856 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |69.6 |1619 |101.7 |803 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |76.4 |781 |79.6 |993 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |82.6 |772 |60.6 |1038 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |82.7 |1170 |94.0 |1542 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |91.0 |957 |96.6 |902 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |64.3 |... |94.6 |... | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The average reduction of industrial production volume in the Commonwealth in the past two months was 26.8 percent, and the prices of producer-enterprises displayed a more than tenfold increase. Industrial output in February was the same as in January this year, and producer prices increased by 18 percent during that period. The output of electric power in January-February 1994 was smaller than the output for the same period last year by 11 percent in Kazakhstan, 14 percent in Belorussia, and 21 percent in Armenia. The output of finished rolled ferrous metal products in January-February 1994 was smaller than the output for the same period last year by 22 percent in Russia and 36 percent in Kazakhstan. The output of steel pipe in Russia decreased to around half of the previous figure. In machine building the output of several of the main products was much smaller than in January-February 1993. The output of metal-cutting lathes decreased by 46 percent in Belorussia and by half in Russia during the two months. The Russian output of forging and pressing equipment was 71 percent below the figure for January-February 1993. The number of motor vehicles produced in Belorussia decreased by 56 percent; the number of trucks produced in Russia decreased by two-thirds, and the Russian output of passenger cars decreased by 41 percent. Tractor production decreased by 45 percent in Belorussia, by three-fourths in Kazakhstan, and by 81 percent in Russia. Tractors almost ceased to be produced in Uzbekistan.

The output of washing machines, for example, decreased by 18 percent in Belorussia, 39 percent in Moldavia, and 42 percent in Russia; radio production decreased by a third in Belorussia and by 53 percent in Russia; the number of television sets produced decreased by 13 percent in Belorussia, 17 percent in Russia, and 24 percent in Moldavia; reductions in the output of tape recorders were 30 percent in Kazakhstan and 51-58 percent in Belorussia, Russia, and Kirghizia. Agriculture In the past two months the output of the main animal husbandry products of agricultural enterprises of the Commonwealth countries in comparison with the output for the same period in 1993 displayed the following changes: Meat (live weight) Milk Eggs Countries Thousands In % of Thousands In % of Millions In % of of tonnes Jan-Feb of tonnes Jan-Feb Jan-Feb 93 93 93 Azerbaijan 7 89 19 71 10 48 Armenia 0.2 50 0.3 75 0.6 55 Belorussia 139 74 422 100.8 325 92 Kazakhstan 139 79 230 83 286 87 Kirghizia 11 87 30 73 15 47 Moldavia 12 60 69 81 30 54 Russia 866 82 2994 85 4546 94 Tajikistan 4 78 17 102 14 65 Turkmenistan 10 79 30 96 21 100.9 Uzbekistan 36 91 135 98 117 93 Ukraine 330 65 1420 99 850 80 Commonwealth 1556 77 5370 89 6214 91 totals The productivity of cows continued to decline in most of the Commonwealth states. In January-February this year the average milk yield at agricultural enterprises of Moldavia, Russia, Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan was 20-30 kilograms less than the yield in the same period of 1993. In several Commonwealth states (Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine) the total output of milk decreased while the productivity of cows increased, signifying a dramatic reduction of the herd in these regions. The total output of the main animal husbandry products in February this year in comparison with February 1993 decreased in all Commonwealth states, which is confirmed by the following data (in percentages): ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Meat |Milk |Eggs | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |97 |70 |42 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |33 |40 |40 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |87 |99 |91 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |69 |77 |80 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |93 |73 |55 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |54 |80 |57 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |83 |84 |95 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |79 |93 |54 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |68 |94 |100 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |86 |96 |88 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |71 |95 |77 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commonwealth aver-|79 |87 |90 | |age | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Transportation Freight shipped (or accepted) by public rail carriers in January-February 1994 amounted to the following (in millions of tonnes): ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Countries |Jan-Feb 94 |Feb 94 |In % of Jan-F-|In % of Feb 93| | | | |eb 93 | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Azerbaijan |2.1 |0.9 |67 |63 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Armenia |0.014 |0.006 |31 |22 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Belorussia |6.5 |3.3 |57 |65 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Georgia |0.4 |0.1 |72 |46 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kazakhstan |25.3 |12.1 |70 |69 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kirghizia |0.2 |0.1 |54 |60 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moldavia |0.7 |0.3 |73 |61 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Russia |174.7 |83.2 |79 |77 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tajikistan |0.14 |0.06 |95 |94 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Turkmenistan |2.8 |1.4 |103 |104 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Uzbekistan |7.7 |3.6 |79 |77 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Ukraine |59.1 |28.2 |65 |64 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Commonwealth |279.7 |133.3 |74 |73 | |totals | | | | | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- The amount of freight shipped (or accepted) by rail carriers in January-February totaled 279.7 million tonnes, or 99.2 percent of the freight scheduled for shipment by shippers.
