FR940505-0-00075 FR940505-0-00020 Five comments stated that the Postal Service needs to establish a procedure for mailers to obtain advance binding rulings regarding whether materials and products will be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates. In general, as discussed above, the Postal Service does not believe such a procedure is necessary because mailers have access to the many IRS determinations and precedents that govern how the eligibility restrictions are administered. The Postal Service also believes that nonprofit mailers that engage in any considerable amount of commercial advertising or business activity may have already obtained private legal or financial counsel to help them deal with such matters. The Postal Service further notes that it does not have the staffing to provide a large volume of such rulings in a timely and consistent fashion, has not had a formal procedure for providing such opinions in mail classification matters, and does not believe that it is feasible to provide such a procedure. One comment was concerned that the Postal Service may disqualify a mailing announcing a meeting, seminar, or conference sponsored by the qualified organization if it contains a brochure for the hotel where the meeting will be held. This decision must necessarily be determined upon the specific circumstances of the mailing. Nevertheless, the Postal Service does not believe that the inclusion of such a brochure would necessarily prevent the mailpiece from being mailed at the special rates. For instance, it would be significant whether the brochure is donated to the qualified organization as information for individuals that will or may attend a meeting, seminar, or conference sponsored by the qualified organization at that hotel, as opposed to being provided by the hotel to the nonprofit with payment for inclusion in the mailpiece. Seven comments stated that a ``grace period'' should be authorized to allow qualified organizations to mail materials that are in the process of being prepared for mailing to avoid having to discard them or pay a higher postage rate than was planned for the mailing. One comment suggested that the grace period be allowed and that the Postal Service publish a graduated phase-in schedule, beginning January 1, 1996, to allow for the acceptance of materials in the process of being prepared for mailing. One comment suggested a 90-day grace period consistent with this comment. The final rule will be effective September 4, 1994, more than 4 months after it is published. Although the Postal Service is sympathetic with the concerns expressed by comments seeking a more extended period, these interests must be balanced against the additional revenue loss caused by any delay in the effective date of the rules. This loss will ultimately be borne by postal customers. Additionally, it is noted that the rules will not become effective until a full 8 months after the January 1, 1994, date authorized in the legislation. One comment from a nonprofit society stated that the regulations should provide specific ``procedural rules'' for reliance on Internal Revenue Service regulations and court decisions regarding the ``substantially related'' test. It is not clear what type of ``procedural rules'' the comment envisions. Nevertheless, the final rule makes it clear, as specified by Public Law 103&hyph;123, that the Postal Service will use standards established by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts with respect to determining whether a product or service is substantially related to the purpose(s) on which the qualified organization's authorization to mail at special bulk third-class rates is based. Three comments stated that the Postal Service should determine that the ``substantially related'' test does not apply to an offer for a ``back-end premium'' (a product or service provided to a donor who first contributes a certain sum of money). To be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates, the ``back-end premium'' itself, if it is a product, must be a ``low-cost'' item or otherwise comply with 39 U.S.C. 3626(m). The solicitation seeking donations and offering the ``back end premium'' is, moreover, an advertisement, covered by the new ``substantially related `` test. Accordingly, the solicitation is mailable at the special rates only if the premium is substantially related to the nonprofit's qualifying purposes. One comment stated that organizations that market training and education through the mail should not be allowed to mail at the special bulk third-class rates if they are not accredited educational institutions. The statutory provisions do not restrict the use of special rates in this manner, and this suggestion is beyond the authority of the Postal Service to adopt. One comment stated that the Postal Service should allow third-class periodical publications that contain advertisements, have no subscribers, and meet the definition of a periodical to be mailable at the special bulk third-class rates until the Postal Service obtains approval from the Postal Rate Commission to accept such periodicals as second-class matter. Again, the statutory provisions do not authorize an exception of this type, and it is beyond the authority of the Postal Service to adopt. Organizations that wish to mail publications at the special second-class rates will be required to obtain authorization, under the existing eligibility requirements, to mail at those rates, which would generally require that the publication be primarily circulated to paid subscribers. Subscriptions may be paid for with dues or contributions, if the dues or contributions and the subscription price are separated to show the amount paid for the subscription. A membership organization applying for second-class mailing privileges under the narrowly defined ``Publications of Institutions and Societies'' category (see DMM E222) may pass a resolution specifying the amount that is to be used for a subscription to receive its periodical publication if each member knows how much is being paid for the subscription. Mailers should contact their postmasters for advice on the exact procedures they must follow to qualify their publications for special second-class mailing privileges.
