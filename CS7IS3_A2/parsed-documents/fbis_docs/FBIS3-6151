Chea Sim, chairman of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KC] National Assembly, led a high-level KC National Assembly delegation on an official friendship visit to the LPDR from 5 to 7 March 1994. During their visit, Samdech Chea Sim and delegation paid separate courtesy calls on H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan and H.E. Khamtai Siphandon, respectively president and prime minister of the LPDR. During the courtesy calls, H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan stressed that Lao-Cambodian ties consist of fine relations of friendship, fraternal solidarity, neighborliness, and comradeship. The traditional fine relations and cooperation between the two countries have existed since ancient times. The peoples of the two countries have practiced similar customs and traditions, ardently given support and assistance to each other, and shared weal and woe both during the periods of struggle against colonialism and neocolonialism and of national defense and national construction in each country. H.E. Khamtai Siphandon regarded that in the new period, there is a need to further strengthen the long-standing traditional relations of friendship, solidarity, and multifaceted cooperation between the LPDR and the KC in coordinating with each other to improve and readjust the forms and methods of cooperation for better harmony and higher efficiency for the immediate and long- term common and individual interests. This will ardently conform to the ever-increasing strong aspirations of the peoples of Laos and Cambodia in building their respective countries with peace, national independence, and prosperity. The receptions and conversations between the hosts and guests were permeated with an atmosphere of profound friendship from beginning to end. Samdech Chea Sim and delegation laid a wreath at the Monument of Unknown Combatants and visited many places of economic and cultural significance in Vientiane capital and Vientiane Province. Wherever Samdech Chea Sim and delegation visited, they were given a warm and intimate welcome by the local administrations, authorities, and Lao residents. A meeting between the KC National Assembly delegation headed by Samdech Chea Sim and the LPDR National Assembly delegation headed by H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket to exchange views on the situation took place at the Lao National Assembly in Vientiane capital in an atmosphere of friendship, sincerity, and mutual understanding. At the meeting, the two sides informed each other of outstanding situations in their respective countries and exchanged views on the strengthening of relations and cooperation between the two countries and between the two legislative organizations. They exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest. The Lao side regarded that the official friendship visit by Samdech Chea Sim and delegation constituted a gesture of historic significance, contributing to strengthening and multiplying the intimate, normal relations which have existed since ancient times between Laos and Cambodia. At the same time, it also wholeheartedly hailed the increasing achievements of the implementation of the Paris agreement, which is the process of achieving peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia; as well as the successful National Assembly elections; the endorsement and promulgation of the new Constitution; the revival of the constitutional monarchy; the return to the throne of the Kingdom of Cambodia by Samdech Norodom Sihanouk who has played the supreme, historical role in realizing the unification, peace, political stability, national reconciliation, rehabilitation, and reconstruction; and the establishment of the Government of the KC. The Lao side highly assessed the role of the KC National Assembly in the process of national reconciliation and in developing and building the KC into an independent, peaceful, neutral, nonaligned, and prosperous country. Samdech Chea Sim and delegation hailed the great achievements in various fields made by the Lao Government and people, noting that such successes have been scored thanks to the policy of principled and all-around restructuring under the clear- and far-sighted leadership of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. He also hailed the role of the LPDR NA in building and broadening the popular democratic regime, carrying out socioeconomic development, and pursuing the broad foreign policy of peace, independence, friendship, and cooperation, thereby ardently contributing to turning Laos into a country of peace, independence, democracy, unification, and prosperity. The two sides expressed satisfaction with the traditional fine relations of friendship which have continued for centuries and have thus been worthy of being good-neighborly countries which have practiced cooperation in many fields. They see a need to incessantly multiply and increase such relations and cooperation on the basis of the principles of respect for each other's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; noninterference in each other's internal affairs; refraining from the use force and coercion; resolving all problems between the two countries peacefully; cooperation; equality; and mutual benefits. They regarded the exchange of visits of the high-level delegations headed by the prime ministers of the two countries; the Laos- Cambodia joint statement issued in July 1993; and the Laos-Cambodia joint declaration and the agreement on economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation between the two countries signed by the two governments in Phnom Penh in November 1993 as very significant to the relations and cooperation between Laos and Cambodia in the new period. The two sides were unanimous in planning to set up a friendship association between the LPDR National Assembly and the KC National Assembly to exchange delegations at various levels, and to assist each other in the sphere of legislative work on a regular basis. The two sides share a common aim of establishing close relations and cooperation with the legislative institutions of other countries in the region and the Interparliamentary Union to contribute to turning Southeast Asia into a region of peace, friendship, and cooperation. The Lao side expressed extreme appreciation with the success of the visit to the LPDR this time by Samdech Chea Sim and delegation, terming it a new glorious milestone in the history of relations between the two legislative institutions as well as the two countries. Samdech Chea Sim and delegation highly valued the success of the visit and expressed profound thanks to the Lao National Assembly and people for having accorded an intimate welcome filled with a spirit of fraternal warmth and good neighborliness to the KC National Assembly delegation during its official friendship visit to the LPDR. On behalf of the KC National Assembly, Chairman Samdech Chea Sim extended an invitation to H.E. Saman Vi-gnaket, chairman of the LPDR National Assembly, and delegation to pay an official friendship visit to the KC.
