It was undersigned by "Fatah Hawks" and "'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam Battalions." According to the document, the parties agree: 1. To immediately halt all defamation campaigns between Fatah and Hamas, provided the right to freedom of expression and opinion is guaranteed to everyone. A fraternal dialogue between the two organizations will be held to decide measures that will serve our lofty masses everywhere. 2. To renounce differences and bloody conflicts and stop using violence to resolve these differences. The two sides emphasize the need to be committed to constructive dialogue among our people to put an end to the conspiracies being concocted to trap our people in chronic crises and differences. 3. As of the date of this statement, the wanted persons and gunmen of both sides are prohibited from interfering to resolve organizational or family problems. The Islamic and national reconciliation committees are asked to play their role in resolving any problem that may arise. If no solution is reached, the leaders of the political factions are to intervene to put an end to the problems. Fatah and Hamas will work out a suitable mechanism for implementing this resolution. 4. After a long study of our people's economic conditions, it has been decided to stage a one-day strike for every martyr in his own neighborhood only and to declare only one day of mourning in the remaining areas. The intifadah activists are hereby prohibited from throwing stones at cars moving for urgent reasons. The two parties appeal to all factions to reduce overall strikes as much as possible. In cases of emergencies, a strike shall be announced jointly and through a fraternal and constructive understanding. 5. Regarding educational matters, we urge our male and female students to remain in their classes during strikes. All students are urged to deal with any attempt to force them out of their classes. 6. After a careful study of the question of collaborators, Fatah and Hamas have decided to stop killing collaborators between 22 April 1994 and 22 May 1994. During this period, efforts will be made to tackle this phenomenon. We advise the collaborators to cut off their ties with the enemy's intelligence agencies for God's mercy is better for them than the enemy's hell. This month will provide a chance to reconsider and define positions.
