The Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and the Shikoku Electric Power Company (SEPCO) individually developed power storage equipment that use the capability to levitate objects, and the Superconductivity Research Laboratory (SRL), which was established jointly by the government and the private sector, test-manufactured a superconducting IC by using the characteristic of high frequency. Bearings and sensors also have been produced. The focus of high-temperature superconductors used to be on development of material, but gradual progress from research to application is being made. High-Sensitivity IC Test-Manufactured by SRL The power storage equipment developed by TEPCO and SEPCO stores energy when an object levitated by high-temperature superconductivity is rotated rapidly. It is said that this is the world's first of this type. <graphic> </graphic> A high-temperature superconducting material called MPMG, which was developed by SRL, was used for this equipment. Conductive material is mixed with high-temperature superconducting material, and the magnetic flux from magnets cannot intersect the boundary surface and is repelled. Thus it will be levitated by an adequately strong magnet. Repellent force arises even if the magnets are brought closer together, but if MPMG and a magnet are placed on top of each other, the phenomenon of "repulsion in the vertical direction but fixed in the horizontal direction" occurs. In SEPCO's device, a permanent magnet is embedded in the bottom of a revolving element that is 13.5 cm tall, has a maximum radius of 25 cm and weighs 27.5 kg. This is placed on a bed on which MPMG has been deposited. When the MPMG is cooled to the temperature of liquid nitrogen, it becomes superconductive and the revolving element is levitated. When charging, the electromagnetic motor increases the rotation of the revolving element. When discharging, the same motor works as a power generator. The device is rotated at high speed, 23,000 rpm, and it can store 102 watt-hours of electric power. TEPCO's device has almost the same structure and it can store 50 watt-hours. Both companies confirmed that the devices they test-manufactured worked as designed. Hereafter, they will wait for mass-production of material with three times the magnetic capability, then they will conduct R&D to increase size and raise efficiency to about 85 percent. Ultimately, the goal is to build a facility that can store around 10,000 kWh in each area substation and create a system to deal with fluctuations in power demand. Superconductive power storage equipment loses less power than pumped storage power plants, and it is thought that there will be few limiting conditions as far as sites are concerned. On the other hand, the research group led by Katsumi Suzuki, chief researcher of SRL's Lab 6, is the first in the world to test manufacture a high-temperature superconducting IC in which a high-frequency antenna and signal processing Josephson devices were integrated on one chip. Because the important parts are made of a low-resistance superconducting material, high-speed signals can be picked up with good precision. In a test, music from a CD player was carried by high frequency, then received by a superconducting IC, which performed as anticipated. The developed device is composed of two antennas that can receive 23 gigahertz (1 gigahertz = 1 billion hertz) microwave and six Josephson device circuits to extract data riding on the radio waves. Both are made of yttrium-base high-temperature superconductors and they were incorporated onto a 20 square millimeter substrate. Superconducting circuits have virtually no electric resistance. Their strong point is that they can operate adequately even in high frequency bands where normal conductors lose their utility because resistance is too high. Application sectors include inter-satellite communications using 60 gigahertz microwaves and automobile collision prevention radar. It is said that this can also be used for portable phones -- to raise the sensitivity of receiving stations and reduce power consumption. Other applications of high-temperature superconducting technology are the magnetic bearings co-developed by SRL and Nippon Seiko and magnetic sensors developed by the superconducting sensor research institute, which is financed by the government and private sector. Both appeared on the scene this fall. Editorial Comment: Quality Upgrade of Material Contributes to Success Behind the emergence of high-temperature superconducting technology application is the substantial upgrading of the quality of materials. Ceramic-base materials are used in high-temperature superconducting materials, but in the early stages, the characteristics of ceramics -- processing difficulty, brittleness -- impeded development and application. Today, however, it is possible to make 1-inch monocrystals and line up their surfaces. If high-quality materials are made into substrates, the microprocessing on the substrates can be done with existing technology. Furthermore, the weak points in the strong surface are being conquered. Shoji Tanaka, director of SRL, says that "High-temperature superconductors no longer have to be ceramic," thereby stressing the fact that high-temperature superconductors are becoming components like metal and semiconductors. Almost all high-temperature superconductivity researchers have stressed development of new materials, but recently, there has been a lull in the push to discover materials, and some thought that research fervor had cooled. In the midst of this, the SRL was established in Japan with government and private funding and is working on raising the quality of materials and upgrading performance. It can be said that this has led to a series of successes. It cannot be said that the phenomenon of high-temperature superconductivity has been fully revealed. As was the case with semiconducting technology, however, when good material is created, basic research is advanced, which in turn leads to the development of even more new materials. SRL Director Tanaka predicts that this productive cycle will occur with high-temperature superconductivity as well.
