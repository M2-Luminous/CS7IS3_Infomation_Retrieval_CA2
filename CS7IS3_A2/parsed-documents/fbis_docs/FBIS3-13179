Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim said that the forces of that regime were using internationally banned napalm incendiary bombs in their attacks on the people of the marshes. The Iraqi opposition leader pointed out that four armored and infantry divisions were taking part in this attack supported by forces from the Republican Guard for intervention whenever it was necessary. Baqir al-Hakim called on the United Nations to put pressure on the Iraqi regime to implement the UN Security Council's resolution No. 688 which stipulates stopping the policy of repression against the civilian population in southern Iraq. Reports coming from inside Iraq mentioned that tens of civilians were killed or wounded in these operations, while hundreds of others ran away into the marshes fleeing the bombardment of the Iraqi regime's forces.
