Fujii told reporters before the meeting with Bentsen that he does not expect bilateral issues to come up in his talks with the U.S. Treasury secretary. "Today's agenda is about APEC," Fujii said of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum. Fujii said he would discuss with Bentsen how to bring the APEC meeting to a success. Earlier Friday, Fujii called for a cautious and balanced approach in liberalizing financial markets in the Asia-Pacific region. "Too much impatience won't be good," Fujii said as he arrived in Honolulu for the APEC finance ministers meeting. Fujii said an open financial market is important for the region but policy-makers should take economic realities into consideration in opening up their markets. "We have to take into account the matter of soundness. We should proceed in a balanced manner," Fujii said. Fujii said he plans to talk about "the Japanese experience" during the two-day APEC finance ministers meeting and underscore the importance of cooperation in the regional group. The meeting, which opens with an informal reception Friday evening, is expected to focus on ways to promote economic growth and foster the flow of capital in the Asia-Pacific region. Fujii was to hold a series of other bilateral talks, including separate meetings with Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, Australian Finance Minister Ralph Willis and Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Ibrahim Anwar.
