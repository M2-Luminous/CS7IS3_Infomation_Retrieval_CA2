Everything is possible concerning the emergence of pre-election alliances between Slovak right-wing parties, except for the possibility of KDH joining any new party, "named, let us say, the Right Bloc, in which individual parties would lose their identity and would create a joint list of candidates," Carnogursky says. He explains the KDH's idea that all right-oriented parties (the Party of Entrepreneurs and Tradesmen, the Democratic Party, the Alliance of Democrats, the groupings around Ludovit Cernak and Jozef Moravcik) should create a free alliance, with each of these parties relying on its own list of candidates for the elections. Later all these parties, or some of them, would ally in a group, under the election law, or create a joint list of candidates. If it turns out that any of the above parties is unable to acquire parliamentary representation, the KDH is ready to put a few people on its list as independent candidates, Carnogursky says. The Slovak right wing should be united by the end of July, when the lists of candidates have to be submitted, he adds. [passage omitted]
