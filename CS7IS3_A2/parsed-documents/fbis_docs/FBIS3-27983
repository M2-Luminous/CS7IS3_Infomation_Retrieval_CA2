"These businesses should be aware that dealing in infringing software is a serious crime in the Philippines and no effort will be spared in tracking down firms that sell our members' products without authorization," BSA Vice President Ron Eckstrom told reporters yesterday. BSA investigators along with the Philippine National Police began the raids last year. Their first casualties were four retail outlets of Brochiere, a leading computer and software retailer in the country. Seized were some 4,000 floppy diskettes and 25 hard disks containing suspected illegal software published by BSA members Lotus and Microsoft. Eckstrom pointed out that Brochiere was merely one of the many retail firms in the country that openly disregard the law. He added that the BSA will urge the courts to impose the most severe penalties available under the law against any firm found guilty of software piracy.
