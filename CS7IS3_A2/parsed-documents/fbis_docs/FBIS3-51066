Rattazzi said that the jump in the figures since 1990, when the airline began operations in Cuba by bringing 2,360 passengers here, is the most eloquent expression of the satisfactory results of its efforts. In 1991, Air Europe brought 15,975 travelers to Cuba, and in 1992 the figure increased to 29,988. Rattazzi said the number of Italian tourists traveling to Cuba is growing by leaps and bounds, and he added that, in turn, Air Europe expects to bring some 120,000 tourists to Cuba in 1995. This, he added, is more than 10 percent of the 1 million tourists Cuba wants to attract. Rattazzi pointed out that Air Europe has five flights per week and currently travels to three Cuban tourist locations: Havana, Varadero, and Ciego de Avila. Rattazzi added that Air Europe works with 10 Italian tour operators and is working for the first time with the Going company, which he described as a serious firm that will have great success in Cuba.
