FR941003-2-00188 FR941003-2-00066 11. Certain charges will be imposed under the SILIC Contracts proposed to be supported by the Sentry Account. Sentry will deduct a mortality and expense risk charge equal on an annual basis to 1.20% of the average daily net asset value of the Sentry Account. Of this charge, .80% will be for mortality risks and .40% will be for expense risks. This charge compensates Sentry for providing a mortality guarantee, a death benefit, an expense guarantee, and the waiver of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, if any, upon the death of the annuitant. 12. Sentry will deduct a contract maintenance charge of $30 per SILIC Contract from contract values on each contract anniversary the SILIC Contract is in force, or when the value of the SILIC Contract is withdrawn in full prior to a contract anniversary. Sentry guarantees that the amount of the contract maintenance charge will not be increased in the future. 13. No sales charge was imposed on the SILIC Contracts at the time of sale. A contingent deferred sales charge is imposed on surrenders of purchase payments within six years after their being made. Thereafter, the charge is equal to zero. The amount of the contingent deferred sales charge is calculated by allocating purchase payments to the amount surrendered, multiplying each such allocated purchase payment by the appropriate percentage determined on the basis of the table below, and adding the products of each such multiplication. ‚ê£ 1Time between receipt of allocated purchase payment and date of surrender 1Percentage Less than 1 year 6 At least 1 year but less than 2 years 5 At least 2 years but less than 3 years 4 At least 3 years but less than 4 years 3 At least 4 years but less than 5 years 2 At least 5 years but less than 6 years 1 At least 6 years 0 The contingent deferred sales charge is intended to provide reimbursement for sales-related expenses. To the extent the charge is insufficient to cover all distribution costs, Sentry may use the mortality and expense risk charge to make up any difference. 14. Sentry will permit SILIC Contractowners to transfer all or part of the contract values between eligible mutual fund(s) or portfolio(s) subject to certain conditions. Currently, Sentry does not impose any charge for effecting transfers but it reserves the right to assess a transfer fee in the future subject to prior Commission approval or pursuant to any applicable exemptive release issued by the Commission. 15. Any premium taxes payable to any governmental entity as a result of the existence of the SILIC Contracts or the Sentry Account will be charged against contract value. Premium taxes currently imposed range from 0% to 4.0%. 16. Sentry deducts from the Sentry Account any income taxes resulting from the operation of the Sentry Account. Sentry has not made a provision for taxes within the Sentry Account for the payment of any tax obligation because Sentry believes that the operations of the Sentry Account and the underlying Trust will be conducted in such a manner as to not give rise to such tax obligation. Sentry has reserved the right, however, to establish such a provision in the future if it determines that it will incur a tax as a result of the operation of the Sentry Account. 17. On July 17, 1984, the SEC issued an order pursuant to Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act to SILIC, the SILIC Account, and SESI, exempting them from Sections 26(a) and 27(c) of the Act to the extent necessary to permit certain deductions and practices in connection with the SILIC Contracts. The SEC granted identical relief on the same day to Sentry, the Sentry Account, and SESI in connection with the Sentry Contracts. Applicants' Legal Analysis 1. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from knowingly selling any securities or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act prohibits these persons from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company. Section 2(a)(3) of the Act defines an ``affiliated person'' of another person to include any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such other person. The Sentry Account and the SILIC Account may be deemed to be under the common control of Sentry, which is the depositor of the Sentry Account and the parent of the depositor of the SILIC Account. While Applicants do not concede that Section 17(a) applies to the Proposed Transaction, because the Sentry Account and the SILIC Account are affiliated persons, the transfer of assets from the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account arguably involves these entities, acting as principals, in buying and selling securities or other property from or to one another in contravention of Section 17(a). 2. Section 17(b) of the Act provides that a person may apply for an order of exemption from the provisions of Section 17(a) in connection with a transaction prohibited by that section, and that the Commission shall grant such an application if evidence establishes that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned; (2) the proposed transaction is consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act; and (3) the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act. 3. Although Rule 17a&hyph;8 is not available in this case, Applicants submit that the Commission can look to the rule to determine whether the transaction is reasonable and fair. Applicants assert that the participating companies' investment objectives, policies, restrictions, and portfolios are compatible. Both the Sentry Account and SILIC Account invest exclusively in shares of the Fund, and, after the Proposed Transaction, the Sentry Account will continue to invest in shares of the Fund and provide holders of SILIC Contracts with the same investment options as before the Proposed Transaction. Accordingly, the Proposed Transaction will result in no change in the investment objectives, policies, restrictions, or portfolios of the separate account funding the SILIC Contracts. 4. Applicants also represent that the transfer of assets held by the SILIC Account to the Sentry Account will be made at the relative net asset values of the subaccounts. No dilution of, or increase in, the SILIC Contractowners' contract values will occur as a result of the Proposed Transaction. The transfer will not result in any change in charges, costs, fees, or expenses borne by Contractowners. 5. Finally, Applicants state that no direct or indirect costs will be incurred by the SILIC Account or the Sentry Account as a result of the transaction. No charges, costs, fees, or other expenses would be incurred by holders of the Contracts as a result of, or in connection with, the Proposed Transaction. Thus, the Proposed Transaction will not result in dilution of the economic interests of the Contractowners. 6. Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction does not involve overreaching on the part of any person involved. The purpose of the transfer is to consolidate two identical separate accounts, both of which issue identical contracts, have the same principal underwriter, and invest in the same underlying mutual fund, into a single separate account. This aggregation will allow for administrative efficiencies and cost savings on Sentry's part because Sentry can consolidate its separate account operations. It also will allow SILIC Contractowners to participate in a separate account that is sizable in terms of its total net assets and can be expected to grow since sales of Sentry contracts will continue after the Proposed Transaction. 7. Section 17(b) also requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the policy of each registered investment company concerned, as recited in its registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Applicants represent that because the assets underlying the SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested in shares of one or more portfolios of the Fund in the same manner as before the Proposed Transaction, the assets underlying the SILIC Contracts and the Sentry Contracts will continue to be invested according to the investment policies recited in their respective registration statements. 8. Finally, Section 17(b) requires that the Proposed Transaction be consistent with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants represent that the Proposed Transaction is consistent with the general policies and purposes of the Act. The transfer does not present any of the issues or abuses that Section 17(a) in particular, and the 1940 Act in general, were designed to prevent. 9. In light of the foregoing, Applicants request an exemption from Section 17(a) of the Act, pursuant to Section 17(b) thereof, to permit the proposed transfer. Applicants represent that the terms of the proposed transfer described in this Application, including the consideration to be paid or received, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching; are consistent with the investment policies of each of the Accounts; and are consistent with the general purposes of the Act.
