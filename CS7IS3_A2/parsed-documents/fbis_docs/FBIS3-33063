The U.S. answer was officially delivered on 14 February by U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman to Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner, with whom he met for some 45 minutes. The U.S. ambassador regretted the fact that U.S. servicemen were unable to carry out social work in San Pedro Department because the "Strong Roads" operation was "for the benefit of Paraguay, however, there is no problem if it does not want the operation to be carried out; there will be no retaliations nor ill feelings." The defense minister said: "I have not been officially informed yet; I have read the press reports. This seems to be a decision by the U.S. Government based on Paraguay's proposal. Well, it may take place some other time." He added that he did not think the U.S. answer was negative, taking into account that it was based on terms imposed by Paraguay for the entry and stay in the country of U.S. servicemen. Estigarribia commented: "I do not think it is negative for Paraguay to establish normal terms for the entry and stay of foreigners in the country. In other words, it is not wrong to establish those sorts of requirements." The minister said: "It is completely normal because it is in the hands of the party that makes the offer to accept or reject the terms in a negotiation." In referring to joint U.S.-Paraguayan military operations scheduled to take place in 1994, Estigarribia said they are normal exercises that are carried out every year. He added: "They are normal operations that take place every year within the framework of an agreement and accepting all the terms regarding the entry and stay in the country. I do not think these operations are going to pose any problems." The minister explained that the United Forces operations are carried out with the U.S. Army, while the Unitas operations are carried out by the Navy. In the opinion of National Encounter Senator Luis Alberto Mauro, the terms established by the Paraguayan Government to allow the entry of U.S. troops into national territory are a pretext rather than measures to safeguard national sovereignty. Mauro said the fact that the U.S. servicemen will not come to our country represent a victory for General Lino Cesar Oviedo, "who exerted pressure because the U.S. Government accepted the participation of the Paraguayan Public Works Ministry rather than the Army." The senator added: "I do not think the United States intends to tread over our sovereignty nor that anybody within the government seriously believes that these terms are designed to safeguard sovereignty." He added: "The Paraguayan peoples' deception represents a victory for Gen. Lino Oviedo because it was he who convinced [President] Juan Carlos Wasmosy about this." Mauro insisted: "It is obvious that these requirements are designed to obstruct and jeopardize the entry of servicemen who intended to build civilian works. It is only a pretext that has nothing to do with the zeal to safeguard national sovereignty. I deeply regret the fact that these civilian works will not be built because they would greatly benefit the country, and that the Unitas maneuvers have been authorized at a historical moment when they are really not justified because there is no belligerency, no border conflicts at either the international or regional level. This is a case of opting for weapons instead of peace, because opting for peace would have meant accepting the entry of servicemen to build civilian works."
