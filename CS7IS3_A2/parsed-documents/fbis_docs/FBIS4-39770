Who Would Have Thought It...."] [Text] It would have been hard to call the deputies' mood on the eve of the plenary session (it had been planned to devote Wednesday and Friday this week entirely to the budget) optimistic. For even the mechanical procedure of voting on the 250 amendments to the budget would take four hours. And then only on the basis of a 10-second vote without the slightest interruption, discussion, dispute, or break. Many deputies knew from their experience of working in previous parliaments that it would not be possible to discuss more than 70 amendments in a day. But journalists have noticed a new feature after five months of the Duma being at work -- the more vexed a problem is, the more unexpectedly and sharply the new parliament cuts through these tangles. And this is what happened. After some debate during the closed session Vladimir Isakov spontaneously proposed moving straight to a vote to adopt the budget on second reading as a whole, bypassing the tedious matter of the amendments. This "sharp move" did not get through (171 deputies -- 38 percent -- voted for it), but Ivan Rybkin managed to tone down the formula to: "passing the budget on second reading, taking account of the amendments adopted by the Budget Committee, including those on the creation of a special nonbudgetary fund for defense needs." The idea behind this interpretation is that the Army will immediately receive 3.5 trillion rubles [R] of the R18 trillion already ratified from on high by redistributing expenditure within the already ratified basic parameters of the budget. The Army will get the rest of the money from the special fund, which will collect the proceeds from post-voucher privatization, from state apparatus spending cuts, and from the abolition of foreign trade benefits. How much this income will come to is unknown, since nobody knows how much privatization -- the procedure for which has not yet been ratified -- will raise, and we all know how we usually go about cutting our apparatus. Consequently, the sums which the Army may receive for use on social needs are unknown, as is the procedure for their distribution. The toned-down formula suited the deputies, all the more so as the government, as Deputy Finance Ministry Vladimir Petrov put it, has withdrawn its last objection (the demand for R1.5 trillion to service domestic debt) and has totally supported the Budget Committee's amendments. The vote was 228 in favor and 40 against, with 32 abstentions. And...the budget, unexpectedly for many people, was adopted. The coordination of the faction leaders' positions bore fruit. Whereas such different people as Rybkin, Burbulis, and Nevzorov voted in favor, "Yabloko" mostly did not vote. The Zhirinovskiy faction was almost entirely absent -- accompanying their leader in Krasnodar Kray. The budget has been passed by the Duma. But this does not mean that Russia now has a budget for this year. The budget now has to be ratified by the Federation Council, which is categorically insisting on allocating the entire requested sum of R55 trillion to the Army and is demanding R23 trillion on its own behalf for Federation components. The upper house's disapproval of the lower house will have to be overcome by a two-thirds vote -- which, given the "marginal" [pogranichnyy] vote yesterday (51 percent in favor) will be very problematic. Later the budget (after passing the Duma and the Federation Council) will reach the president. And he, if you recall, has already stated that he will not allow himself to fall out with the Army. Here is a riddle -- in what month of what year will Russia finally get the ratified 1994 budget? P.S. It transpired at the end of the day that the Duma will have to vote once again on the draft budget. This time -- according to the procedure approved by it for the adoption of the federal budget -- "as a whole."
