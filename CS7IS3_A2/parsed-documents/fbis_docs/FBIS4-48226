The president expresses his displeasure with the totally unfounded and malicious disinformation published by the London SUNDAY TIMES. The article has absolutely no factual basis, and is nothing more than rumour mongering written with the intention to create uncertainty about South Africa's first democratically elected government. President Mandela wishes to state categorically that he intends to remain in office for the full term that he had been elected to. The people of South Africa have given the president a clear mandate, and he intends to fulfill that mandate to the fullest.
