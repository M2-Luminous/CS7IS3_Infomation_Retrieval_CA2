[passage omitted] In the chronology and analysis of the incidents, JUVENTUD REBELDE points out that on 10 February, rumors began to spread through the city of Havana to the effect that the Cuban security guards had been withdrawn from the U.S. Interests Section, and that people going to the Section's offices were expeditiously being awarded visas. During that day, several groups of people appeared in the area, headed for the U.S. Interests Section. Party officials explained to them that what they heard was false, and they desisted. Later, similar incidents occurred, and the custodians asked the people to leave because it was all nothing but a manipulation by unscrupulous people. The area was cordoned off with police barricades. This cordon was later removed, given the characteristics of the people who, deceived, were showing up at the site. In the chronology published today by JUVENTUD REBELDE, it was pointed out that on 11 February, however, the human element that began showing up at the site changed. Noted was the absence of confused people and the presence of lumpen. One man even had a knife hidden under his shirt and was arrested. In the afternoon, a crowd of some 60 or 70 people formed, among whom a number of agitators were observed. These people headed along the Malecon intending to enter the U.S. Interests Section's offices. Revolutionaries gathered at the place thwarted the attempt. Those believed to be the ringleaders were arrested. The police cordon was immediately reestablished. There were another two similar disturbances later, but the provocateurs failed to achieve their goal. [passage omitted] JUVENTUD REBELDE'S article adds: It is obvious who masterminded the incidents. This is how the mechanisms of the counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of deception and cynicism. It has once again been confirmed that the streets of this country belong, and will continue to belong, to the revolutionaries. The item states: The economy is in a special period here, but the dignity and decorum of a people who evidence daily heroism will never be. Let what has occured serve as experience for the unscrupulous authors of the escapade. Never will anyone be able to ride roughshod over the Revolution because to do so, he would have to ride roughshod over the righteous anger [coraje] and determination of us millions of Cubans who place no stock in rumors when it is a matter of defending the unity [integridad] of the fatherland.
