He said the difference between the sum being requested and the sum on offer is so great that the armed forces' continued existence is at stake. For example, the Russian Defense Ministry is asking for 87 trillion rubles, while the Ministry of Finance is insisting on allocating just 37 trillion rubles. According to the Defense Ministry, the Finance Ministry has pared spending on the military to the bone. Arrears have been run up on all major expenditure items. The military is now in the position of having insufficient funds, not only to pay salaries, but also to buy food and equipment and to pay its bills. Lengthy delays in issuing servicemen's pay packets are now routine.
