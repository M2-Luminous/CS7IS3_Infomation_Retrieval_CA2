Judging by the operational figures revealed by weekly price monitoring, the inflation rate in March was slightly down on last month at 8.7 percent (9.9 percent in February, 22 percent in January). Foodstuffs increased in price by 6.2 percent over the month, while nonfood goods were up 11.3 percent, and paid services to the population rose by 14.6 percent. The springtime vitamin deficiency and inflation have done their job -- in March the most tangible price rises were for vegetables (up 24 percent). Bakery, groats, and pasta products were up 13-14 percent. Fish, dairy products, and fruit were up 10-11 percent. Prices for these products were slightly higher than the average growth in the price of foodstuffs -- 6.2 percent. But salt was out in front even here. It increased in price almost by a third in March. Prices for animal and vegetable fat rose insignificantly (by 4-5 percent). Prices for sugar and eggs were virtually unchanged. Vodka prices fell by 4 percent on average. The biggest food price rises over the month were in the Northwest and East Siberian regions -- by 12 and 10 percent respectively. On the other hand, foodstuffs in the Urals and Central Chernozem regions increased by just 3 percent. Prices for foodstuffs as a whole have increased by 40.6 percent since the start of the year. The biggest rises have been for dairy products, vegetables, and salt -- up 80 percent. Bakery products are up 60 percent. Looking at the basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs, its average cost has increased by 7.3 percent over the month and by 44 percent since the start of the year to stand at 44,300 rubles [R] on a monthly basis. The basket cost R42,700 at store prices, and R56,900 at market prices. The spread between the maximum and minimum cost of the basket in different cities of Russia increased from a factor of 3.4 to 3.6 compared with the previous month. The most "expensive" area for the basket continues to be the Far East region at R79,200. The average cost of the basket in the Central Chernozem region (which was the "cheapest" in late March) was R33,100. The cost of the basket of 19 of the most important foodstuffs in Moscow increased by 5.7 percent in March to stand at R48,000. The basket increased by 15.4 percent over the month in St. Petersburg to stand at R49,200. On the list of cities surveyed Moscow ranks 39th most expensive (it was 33d a month ago), while St. Petersburg has leapfrogged Moscow to take 34th place (as opposed to 47th). During March prices for nonfood goods rose twice as fast as food prices. As was the case in February prices rose by 2 percent on average every week. As was to be expected, fuel prices in March were out in front -- up more than 30 percent, and 43 percent for coal. There was a significant rise in the price of wallpaper -- up 26 percent -- medicines, and synthetic detergents (up 24 percent). The smallest increases were for tobacco products and footwear (up 4 and 7 percent respectively). Among Russia's economic regions the increases in nonfood goods were more noticeable in the Volga and East Siberia regions. But prices increased at different rates within the regions. Thus, for instance, over the past month prices for televisions in the Volga region and Kalmykia (which is part of that region) increased by 70 percent, wallpaper was up 30 percent, and the overall increase for nonfood goods was 23 percent. Yet in Saratov Oblast (in the same region) price rises for these goods did not exceed 7 percent. The industrial goods boom has left the Volga-Vyatka region virtually untouched. Nonfood goods there were up 7 percent. There continue to be considerable differences in the price of the same goods in different Russian cities. Thus, in late March prices for tobacco products differed approximately by a factor of five, and by a factor of 15 for analgin [type of analgesic]. Whereas a packet cost R56 in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the price was R810 in Yakutsk.
