FR940104-0-00008 FR940104-0-00003 I. Introduction On December 4, 1992, the Commission issued Order No. 497&hyph;D 1 in response to the opinion issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Tenneco Gas v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Tenneco) 2 which upheld in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497&hyph;A, 3 the Commission's final rule governing the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing or brokering affiliates. However, the court found that the Commission did not adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of §161.3(f) 4 of the Commission's regulations to gas sales and marketing information. Further, in its review of Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), 5 a consolidated case, the court found that, based upon the evidence in the record, the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), a joint venture. Accordingly, the court remanded the proceeding to the Commission. In response to the court's remand, the Commission issued Order No. 497&hyph;D which revised §161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales and marketing information, and found that Ozark is subject to the requirements of Order No. 497. In addition, Order No. 497&hyph;D extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992, until December 31, 1993. However, the order stated that 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline is in full compliance with Order No. 636, 6 the pipeline would not be required to submit the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) to the Commission. The order stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and provide its affiliated transportation log information on its electronic bulletin board (EBB). 1 57 FR 58978 (December 14, 1992), III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 30,958 (1992). 2 969 F.2d 1187 (D.C.
