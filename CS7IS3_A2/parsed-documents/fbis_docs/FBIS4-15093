Russia's peacemaking role in securing these accords has received an unequivocally high rating. Moscow is still pressing for the UN Security Council to confer on Russia the status of international peacemaker. Butrus Butrus-Ghali seems not to be opposed to this. He cautiously confirmed that possibility. But only in theory, in other words if multilateral forces are sent to Abkhazia at any time and the Russian Army might be involved in these forces and total 20-30 percent of the entire contingent. At the same time Butrus-Ghali agreed that Moscow is the most feasible force capable of influencing policy in the "nearby foreign countries" and it holds the keys to a settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. Therefore the prospects of Russian citizens trying UN blue helmets for size in the immediate future are hardly brilliant. Experiencing financial difficulties as it is, the world community is simply unwilling to literally pay for peace in the former Soviet empire. Russia will obviously have to perform this mission itself in one way or another. It is no coincidence that Eduard Shevardnadze, who pinned so many hopes on UN forces and observers, described their activity as passive and futile when there was fighting under way in Abkhazia last week and people were dying. The first document pertaining to a settlement in Abkhazia constitutes pledges on a cease-fire and refraining from using force. The second represents the terms for the return to Abkhazia of over 200,000 refugees who have gathered on the Georgian bank of the Inguri River. The signing ceremony was attended by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, his personal representative Eduard Brunner [name as transliterated], and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. Such lofty patronage ruled out any possibility of either side pulling out at the last minute as has happened repeatedly, and at the same time creates guarantees for the implementation of the accords. In an interview with IZVESTIYA, Eduard Brunner particularly noted the peacemaking efforts made by Russian diplomacy, thanks to which, he said, a major step has been taken toward solving a very complex situation in one of the regions of the Caucasus. The Moscow agreements were largely the result of compromise and concessions on Tbilisi's part. They resolve current problems and lay the foundation for talks on the main issue -- the political status of Abkhazia. Georgia lost the political initiative with its edict dissolving the parliament in Sukhumi. During recent combat operations it suffered another defeat. And now Tbilisi has been forced to accept the kind of wordings that it refused to hear of previously. So, for the first time, the agreements do not mention Georgian territorial integrity -- a fundamental principle at all the previous talks. Russia and the United Nations nevertheless underline their commitment to this principle. Andrey Kozyrev once again confirmed that Russian foreign policy is still based on recognition of Georgia as a unified state. Tbilisi has also renounced its previous demand for all refugees without exception to return freely. This agreement does admittedly stipulate terms for admitting those who have laid down their arms and have promised not to take them up again, even if they fought on Georgia's side. Only those formations and field commanders that are continuing the war are barred from crossing the Inguri River. Presumably, the repatriation mechanism will be finalized still further with the participation of UN observers at local level and the Russian military. A schedule has not yet been drawn up. The international commission for refugees is to convene in Sochi. Then there will be peacekeeping forces on the banks of the Inguri River. The operation is expected to begin within the next few days in order to give people a chance to carry out spring field work. In the prevailing situation battalions of the Russian Group of Forces in the Transcaucasus are the main guarantor of stability.
