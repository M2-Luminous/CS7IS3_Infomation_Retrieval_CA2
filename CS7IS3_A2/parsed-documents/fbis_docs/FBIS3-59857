Feelings boiled over this time, and the trade unions of Rouiba passed from words into action: a general strike. Top union officials from the Rouiba industrial zone required little time at their meeting yesterday to decide to serve notice of a one-day strike to be held on 6 December. If no concrete progress is made toward satisfying union demands (see LIBERTE of 26 October and 20 November 1993) within the next two weeks, some 28,000 workers will down tools. In a nutshell, immobilization of the Rouiba industrial zone will also paralyze such enormous economic entities as CVI (industrial vehicles), SNTR [National Highway Transport Company], SNTV [National Passenger Transport Company], Naftal-Distribution, ENIPEC (hides and leather), ENEL [National Electric Power Board], and ENATB [expansion not given]. Warning signs that a strike was ahead have been building for some time now, so the move took no one by surprise. Over the last few months (nine months, to be precise), a handful of issues--no more than five or six--have dragged on unresolved, even though the whole lot of them could have been settled in less time than it took union representatives yesterday to vote for a strike. What they decided was to stage a thrice-postponed "solidarity" general strike, basically to demand that the "dialogue" between the social partners (labor and management) be more than a polite fiction. Workers and union representatives have been laid off at INDEFOC (training), ERWA (salvage), INFRAFER (railroad infrastructure), Hydrotechnique, and one or two smaller enterprises. UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers] representatives have held that these layoffs were unjustified and improper. The national syndicate brought the matter to the general inspectorate for labor, which has acknowledged unionists' complaints were well founded. Overall, the inspectorate opined that the layoffs were not justified, at the same time serving notice that efforts by management to intimidate or harass served only to expose their incompetence. On several occasions the inspectorate demanded, in vain, that sanctions be lifted and personnel rehired. Spurred to action by the syndicate's national leadership, the ministries concerned ended by sending faxes directly to the enterprises under their jurisdiction, urging them to act immediately to resolve the disputes. This was the situation as it stood a day or two before 2 November. On that date, at the sit-in held by 500 to 600 Rouiba unionists at People's House (site of UGTA headquarters), Mr. Sidi Said, UGTA's national secretary for social affairs and top conflict resolution expert, claimed victory too soon when he happily announced news of the ministerial directives. But the unionists quietly dispersed, trusting completely in the promises of the authorities as relayed to them by national syndicate officials. By yesterday, however, no further progress had been made toward resolving this handful of issues. And of course the workers, or at least their representatives in the industrial zone, believe they were "taken in" for too long. Mr. Sidi Said called it a "provocation." Indeed. Even so, the unionists, including those in the most moderate wing of the UGTA, have not fully appreciated the significance of the fact that these relatively simple layoff disputes have not been resolved as rapidly as issues much thornier were in the past. One might also ask, in the context of Algeria's current situation, whose interests are being served by pushing UGTA out of its high-level role as instigator and articulator of proposals for economic recovery and social peace and miring it down in petty, secondary issues. Along the same lines, one wonders whether driving nails into the coffin of some sector of an economy already in its death throes might tend not only to discredit the UGTA but also to exacerbate social tensions, adding fuel to the fire. That said, it must be noted that not all the news is bad: Within the Rouiba industrial zone, some enterprises deserve kudos for good management and for maintaining good communications between the social partners.
