"The nation needs political stability for national development and rehabilitation through non-violence and national reconciliation" said Ieng Muly, minister of Information, at his audience with the common people last week. "As such, the Royal Government requires support and assistance from the entire people including the journalists," he added. Since the advent of real democracy after the formation of the Royal Government, the nation has more than 30 print and electronic media, most of which are newspapers. The Khmer language newspapers especially, have been strongly attacking the corrupted government officials and in the meantime they have denounced each other on charges of supporting the corrupted or being one-sided. The battle of criticism against the so-called corrupted appears in most columns of their traditional four-page newspapers. Stories of corruption usually look several years back when the country was in the middle of the nightmare of war. Ieng Muli demanded the media carefully consider all sources and angles taken of a comment or story to be analysed. Criticising the King is very sensitive to a minister who said: "Only with King Norodom Sihanouk can peace and national reconciliation be achieved." Most politicians have begged journalists to be patient for sometime until the fragile ship of this nation successfully reaches the shore of real peace. Dr. Barnett Baron, deputy director of Asia Foundation on his recent visit here, said: "Journalistic professionalism must be linked to responsibility in order to ensure accuracy, truth of news reports." He was surprised with the growing number of print and electronic media which are on similar missions to build up and promote free democracy here. "San Francisco, where I am from, counts only three newspaper organizations, while in New York there are five including the New York Times, the national newspaper," Barnett said. So far, two newspapers have been attacked by certain circles in the government. Editor of Damnoeng Pelproek or Morning News was detained for 48 hours on charges of ignoring court warrants with regard to a clarification about a news report denouncing an official accused of being corrupted. Circulation of the 15th issue of Sakol or "Universal" was interrupted and stopped for its news reports attacking King Norodom Sihanouk. The two newspapers are now operating their businesses as usual.
