In this war exercise, which was aimed at waging a port blockade in Chinhae District, the racals clamored about a perfect posture, improvement of the capability of technique and tactics for an actual war, and the like, thus, inspiring war fever. That the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique which are frantically running wild in arms buildup for a northward invasion are constantly waging a new military commotion proves that the rascals are further driving the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.
