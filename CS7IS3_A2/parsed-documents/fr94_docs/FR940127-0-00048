FR940127-0-00048 FR940127-0-00012 Four commenters state that a repair station that has the authority to return to service a product or article should be able to develop and use major repair data for components or parts of those products and articles and return them to service as well. One of these commenters suggested that the FAA meant to imply that air carriers and repair stations that accomplish major repairs on products or articles are not qualified to accomplish major repairs on parts or components of those products or articles. The FAA agrees that repair stations with the authority to return to service a product or article are qualified and must be able to develop and use major repair data to perform repairs on components or parts of those products or articles. The FAA disagrees, however, that the repair station should automatically be permitted to return to service those components or parts, unless the components or parts are reinserted into the original product or article before leaving the repair station. This SFAR addresses the development of major repair data; the issues concerning accomplishing the repair and return to service authority for repair stations for components or parts is beyond the scope of this rulemaking, and no changes are made to the NPRM pursuant to these comments. Two commenters suggest that the final rule should allow current holders of the SFAR 36 authorization to continue to use the authorization for the term of the extension, or until a permanent rule is in place. One of these commenters read the NPRM to mean that repair stations currently conducting work under SFAR 36 must discontinue such work. The FAA disagrees; the rule does not require that work be discontinued, but rather that the repair station performing the work be truly qualified before returning an article to service. As was stated in the NPRM, some SFAR 36 authorizations were issued in error, due to misinterpretations of the rule. The FAA has determined that the error must not continue and those authorizations issued in error can not be extended without the authorization holders meeting all qualifications. The rule language proposed in the NPRM is retained to clarify the qualifications. One commenter is concerned that its current authorization may lapse on the termination date of January 23, 1994. To ensure a smooth transition, current SFAR 36 authorization holders will be permitted to use their authorizations until the FAA notifies them that they do not continue to qualify to hold the authorization. One commenter proposes that the rule include a system of positive identification on the restored product with traceability directly back to the facility performing the major repair and to the specific data package authorizing the major repair. The FAA agrees that this issue has merit; however, such a requirement would add a substantial burden not proposed in the NPRM. The suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. Future documents such as Advisory Circulars, FAA Orders, or other rulemaking projects, including those developed in the ARAC, may consider this suggestion, if applicable. One commenter suggests allowing foreign repair stations to use SFAR 36 authorizations to develop and use major repair data. The FAA disagrees; SFAR 36 has never been available to foreign repair stations. The resources and database systems currently available to oversee foreign operations are not sufficient to adequately monitor such SFAR 36 authorizations. The rule will not be expanded to include foreign repair stations. One commenter suggests that the current SFAR 36 does not need clarification, but rather §§145.51(b) and 145.53 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, which address return to service authority and maintenance of rated items, need to be enforced. The FAA disagrees; the erroneous issuance of SFAR 36 authorizations demonstrates that ambiguity exists in the current rule. The rule sections cited by the commenter are not at issue in improper SFAR 36 authorizations. Increased enforcement of other regulations would not change the ambiguity that exists in SFAR 36. One commenter suggests that the three subsections of section 2 of the rule be considered into one paragraph, along with other minor revisions. The FAA realizes that some of the material in these subsections is repeated, but the subsections do refer to different sections of the regulations. Part of the confusion with the current SFAR stems from the very combinations of information suggested by the commenter. Section 2 was divided into three sections in order to clarify what is available to different applicants.
