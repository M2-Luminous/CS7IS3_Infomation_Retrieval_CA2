Bender, holding a press conference on Thursday, said that in case of an affirmative answer the council will react to the complaint. Council member Marek Siwiec added that the councils failure to take a stand "on the existing conflict is something like hiding one's head in the sand." Ryszard Bender, recently appointed the head of the council by President Lech Walesa to replace Marek Markiewicz, took the advantage to state that he has also received letters in which TV viewers protested against moving the "Prosto Z Belwederu" (Directly From the Belvedere) programme, a weekly review of activities of the Polish president, to late evening hours. Lech Dymarski, also of the council, said that the council has still not adopted a regulation concerning the air time limits for political parties and union organizations to be granted by public TV and radio before the June local elections. The Council, according to Dymarski, is waiting for opinions of programmatic councils of the Polish Television and the Polish Radio.
