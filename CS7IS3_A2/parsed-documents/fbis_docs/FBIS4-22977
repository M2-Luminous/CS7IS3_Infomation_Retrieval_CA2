M. Achasova, Computing Center of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC 681.322] [Abstract] Synchronized interpretation of parallel microprograms with different microinstruction execution times over cellular arr ays is studied. A description of asynchronous implementation of parallel microinstructions and the definition of its correctnes s is contrasted with a model of synchronized interpretation. A number of examples are presented. A method of resolving the situation of possible command conflict is outlined. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the correctness of the interpretation are formulated and a method is presented to recognize incorrect interpretation using the text of the microprogram.
