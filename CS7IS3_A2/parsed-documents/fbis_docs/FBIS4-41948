"Isamaa's separation into different directions is saddening and profits no one," Laar said while adding that the party was there to stay as the number of its supporters had at places increased. Isamaa has been in a crisis for around eight months and the debate has fuelled after the Conservatives left on Monday. Estonian press on Tuesday predicted that the Republicans were to follow leaving Laar only with his Christian Democrats. Isamaa was formed on the basis of four parties: the Republican Coalition Party, the Conservative Peoples Party, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Democratic Party whose close cooperation before general elections in September 1992 brought them to power. A solution to the crisis was expected to be reached at party congress on June 11 which brought victory to Laar who was re- elected as chairman beating Republican Ulo Nugis (parliamentary speaker) and Conservative Kaido Kama (former Justice Minister). Laar said on Tuesday he intended to decide whether to remain premier in August or September.
