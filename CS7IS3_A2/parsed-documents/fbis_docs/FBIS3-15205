The Russian delegation included the Russian president's envoy Vladimir Kazimirov and Deputy Russian Defense Military Georgiy Kondratyev. According to well-informed sources close to the president's office, the Azerbaijani party pointed out that the formula of settlement being worked out during the negotiations did not pay appropriate attention to the Azerbaijani position. For instance, no concrete terms for withdrawal of the Armenian troops from the occupied Azerbaijani territories were mentioned. The Azerbaijani president stressed that Baku stood for immediate ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh, for troop withdrawal and for negotiations. However, he believes this must be carried out along with the Armenian troop withdrawal and return of refugees to these regions. Azerbaijani also seeks guarantees for security of returning refugees.
