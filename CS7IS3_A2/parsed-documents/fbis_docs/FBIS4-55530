I expect the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to meet. According to the Constitution, it should take up the duties of the federation's assembly with the proviso that at that session, duties will be divided into two categories -- tasks covered by the republic's Assembly and those relating to the future federation. I believe that -- if political agreement is reached -- it will be possible to appoint top-level officials of the future federation. Some issues relating to the Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina will also be examined, Lazovic said at a news conference in Zagreb. The news conference was organized by a delegation of the Serb Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Miro Lazovic is its member. He stressed that in the Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament there are deputies who had been elected in the 1990 elections. He said he expected Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] deputies to come and take part in the assembly's work -- in their capacity as representatives of a party that contested the 1990 elections rather than as representatives of Herceg-Bosna. Lazovic pointed out that the federal concept outlined in the Washington agreement should be extended to the whole of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that this is a concept that suits the Bosnian Serbs, too, as they are the second largest population group in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this concept is not accepted, a huge number of the Serbs who stay to live in the territory of the Croat-Bosnian federation will fall into the category of other peoples, although they will account for almost the same percentage as the Croats.
