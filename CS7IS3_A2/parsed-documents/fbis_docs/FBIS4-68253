The meeting lasted more than an hour. Pavel Grachev noted the importance of comprehensive cooperation, including military, between Russia and Israel. Of course, he said, after the first meeting we could not examine in detail the possibilities that are opening up to us. But there is already a mechanism to put these plans into effect: An Israeli military attache has begun to operate in Moscow and the staff of the Russian military attache in Israel will go to work in Israel at the end of April or beginning of May. We will entrust them with the elaboration of the corresponding program. As minister of defense, our guest asked me to make an official visit to Israel and there we will sketch the outline of our future bilateral relations in the military area. The prime minister of Israel declared that the Russian leadership and above all President of Russia Boris Yeltsin assured him of Russia's striving to achieve peace in the Middle East. That same striving is something that we share, I. Rabin said, although we have different ties and relations with third countries. But when the goals are identical, the corresponding interests arise, which, I hope, will lead to the successful conclusion of Arab-Israeli negotiations.
