The majority parties in Flanders did not suffer big losses compared with the November 1991 national elections. And the parties which had made national politics the issue in these elections scored badly in comparison with 1991. In any case it was striking that the parties which at first used the European elections to render a verdict on the national elections, changed tack as the evening continued and eagerly reached for the results of the 1989 European elections. In addition, on the national level, these elections did not see the expected breakthrough of the blue wave of the VLD [Flemish Liberal Democrats] nor a further massive increase for the VB [Flemish Block]. In comparison with previous European elections, the rise of the single issue parties was confirmed. WOW [Getting Old With Dignity] did strikingly well and the VB climbed a few percentage points. Thorough analysis will have to establish whether this time WOW picked up the protest votes which went to Rossem before. The winners in the European election campaign compared with 1989 are WOW, the VB and to a lesser degree the VLD. The biggest losers were the CVP [Christian People's Party], SP [Flemish Socialist Party] and Agalev [Flemish Greens]. Another striking aspect is that the VU [People's Union] managed to hold its position. However, the percentage changes find very little expression in how the seats in the European Parliament are divided. The most striking point in these European elections is the large degree of absenteeism in countries where voting is not obligatory and the considerable lack of enthusiasm among voters in countries where voting is obligatory. This is the biggest challenge for the newly elected candidates: To translate Europe to voters in a more comprehensible way. One piece of good news is the massive Austrian "yes" vote for membership in the European Union [EU]. Perhaps the countries which are not yet members have a better understanding of what the extra benefits of a united Europe can be. Probably we must return to the EU's basic principles, rather than lose ourselves in petty discussions which have little to do with the essence of unification.
