Radetskiy assumed the post of defense minister, we must admit that at this stage the Army's social problems have not only exacerbated but also acquired a specific quality. Over the last two years, we spared no effort to return thousands of Ukrainian servicemen from the hotspots of the former USSR to Ukraine, in accordance with a presidential edict. About 20,000 servicemen returned home while we were expecting 150,000. Thus, our expectations fell flat. Very rapidly, the number of those who wanted to serve in the Ukrainian Army dramatically plummeted. Today, a contrary process is gaining momentum: A mass drain of officers has started. Some 60 percent of young officers have recently requested dismissal. In Odessa Military District alone, some 2,500 officers resigned in 1992, while in 1993 this figure increased by 30 percent. It is sad that among those who do everything in their power to resign, there are many high-skilled professionals who only yesterday dreamed of coming back to Ukraine and continue serving under the national banner. Enlisted men also do not wish to serve in our Army. Most military units are 30 percent under strength. Desertion continues to be a commonplace phenomenon. The number of young people who want to enter military high-education institutions has decreased threefold. Even those whose dissertations are almost ready are leaving. What makes our servicemen shun the Army that we created? Of course, some of the reasons are widely known, including the acute housing problem (we have more than 80,000 homeless servicemen), low wages, and a dramatic downturn in the prestige of the military profession. However, there is another reason which is equally important. The point is that over a long period of time, officers have been living in a state of uncertainty. They feel that nobody needs their professional skills. What will happen to them tomorrow? What does the upcoming reduction of the Army have in store for them? Will their social problems be resolved? Nobody gives them any answers. Besides, the Army has no ideological platform, which in turn causes complete confusion. The servicemen's uncertainty is aggravated with serious mistakes made by the Defense Ministry leadership in the sphere of personnel policy. In the initial stage of forming the Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the initiative of the Officers' Union led by General Major V. Mulyava, an open purge of the officers' corps was carried out. Preference was given to people recommended by those political forces that supported General Colonel K. Morozov. Since General V. Radetskyy came to the Army, there have been attempts to improve the situation. However, very soon, ministerial offices were manned by people from the new minister's team. Incidentally, these people do not always have necessary education and experience. For example, we once resolutely opposed the policies of General V. Mulyava who arranged it so that specialists employed in his department were not responsible for anything. Nobody was allowed to hold them responsible for desertion of soldiers, hazing of conscripts, or conflicts in military units. We hoped that the appointment of General V. Kobzar would bring positive changes. However, the ministry has started to form bodies that resemble former political departments, which is even more dangerous than former inaction. People in the Army are enraged by the fact that military colleges that had a long tradition of training officers are being closed down and their property looted. At the same time, it is hard to understand why the ministry appoints a professional commander who has no concept of resolving pedagogical and scientific problems to the post of Department of Military Education chief. This person's lack of flexibility can do more harm than former chiefs' activities. It is hard to put up with the return of those military chiefs who were lying in wait while our Army was being built. Today, they all rushed to divide the spoils of victory. This leads to never ending reshuffles and fights for cushy jobs. I understand that this overabundance of generals seems quite natural to Defense Ministry officials, but among the military this trend meets with ever growing indignation. Officers keep asking me: Is this a feast in times of trouble or intoxication with success? Are the degeneration of military training in units, the deterioration of combat readiness, and the destruction of the system of military education considered accomplishments? I understand perfectly well that General V. Radetskiy is making his first steps in his new post and it would be unfair to blame everything on him. I also understand that after the publishing of this article I am going to become an object of harsh criticism. However, being one of those who initiated the fight for the creation of a new Ukrainian Army, I cannot put up with the fact that our most elated ideals may be rejected as worthless junk and buried under the trash of personal ambitions and militant nonprofessionalism. I am grieved to see that having discarded many useful things that existed in the Soviet Army, we have inherited solely its negative traits. The people hoped that we would build an Army from which servicemen would return home unharmed, where officer's honor would be the most valuable virtue, and where brotherhood in arms would not be a meaningless phrase. It seems that today, we are farther from this ideal than we were two years ago. The Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen is not going to turn a blind eye to these drawbacks. We will continue to fight for rooting out these disgraceful phenomena, even if somebody does not like this. The Defense Ministry Chief Personnel Directorate can serve as a vivid example of an over-staffed department. In the former Soviet Army, 100 specialists were dealing with personnel issues of servicemen deployed in three military districts. The same number of officers led by Lieutenant General A. Ignatenko resolved the complex issues of the formation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Right now, when the numerical strength of the Army has been reduced twofold, the number of personnel clerks has doubled. The race for ranks and posts has reached exorbitant dimensions. I remember how we were planning that there would be no more than 100 generals in the Ukrainian Army. However, as early as this year, there are more than 300 of them. Thirty two officers were promoted to the rank of general on Ukrainian Army Day alone. I want to point out that there are only 200 generals in all of NATO. We have become accustomed to breakneck careers. The unheard-of promotion of V. Mulyava from sergeant to general has become the talk of the town, but the fact that V. Kobzar in three months covered the distance between colonel to lieutenant general is also far from normal. I, for one, was a regiment commander for 13 years before being promoted to general. K. Paustovskiy once wrote that in times of flourishing, states produce heroes and in times of decline -- bureaucrats.
