FBIS3-4938 "dreas041_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-041 Document Type:Daily Report 2 Mar 1994 Thailand Police Complete Saudi Jewelry Case Investigation BK0103024494 Bangkok THE NATION in English 1 Mar 94 p 1 BK0103024494 Bangkok THE NATION Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Police have concluded their investigation of the Saudi jewellery scandal and submitted an official report to Interior Minister Gen Chawalit Yongchaiyut, an informed Interior Ministry source said yesterday. Chavalit received the report on Sunday. He is studying it in detail before deciding what to do next, the source said. "The minister said he will need two days to study the report," the source said. A high-ranking Foreign Ministry source yesterday said Saudi officials have told the ministry that Thai-Saudi diplomatic ties would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level in seven months. This is if the police fulfilled their promise to settle the case within this month. The account could not be confirmed by Saudi Charge d'Affaires Mohammed Said Khoja yesterday. "I don't know anything about it," he told The Nation by telephone. Chawalit yesterday would not confirm whether he had received the official report from police. "The results should be known in two days," he said without elaborating. The same source said police are preparing to arrest an elderly woman who was once the wet nurse of a police general. They have acquired evidence pointing to her possession of some of the missing jewellery. The same Foreign Ministry source yesterday confirmed that Chawalit had received the police report concluding the years-old investigation into the disappearance of the Saudi jewellery. The source said the Foreign Ministry had consistently kept Saudi Arabia informed of progress in the case and the latest details, but not including the final report submitted to Chawalit, were translated and sent through the Thai Charge d' Affaires in Riyadh, Mahadi Wimana. The ministry has told its Saudi counterpart that the Thai police were wrapping up the jewellery case and preparing to arrest those suspected to be involved in the crime, he said. The Saudi side was also told that Thai officials had promised good news in March, understood to mean the arrest of culprits, including some police officers, the source said. Riyadh has expressed appreciation for Thailand's efforts to settle the case and urged a continuing attempt to bring the culprits to justice, he said. "The Saudis have said if Thai authorities could settle the case in March as they have promised, Thai-Saudi diplomatic ties would be restored and upgraded to full ambassadorial level in seven months," the source said. Thailand and Saudi Arabia currently have charges d'affaires as the head of their respective embassies. Thai-Saudi relations have been strained by the disappearance of some of the jewellery retrieved by Thai police in early 1990 after it was stolen by a Thai worker in Riyadh, and by the murders of three Saudi embassy officials in Bangkok in the same year. Riyadh has stopped issuing visas to Thai workers while pressing for settlement of the jewellery and murder cases. Seven policemen and one civilian are on trial in connection with the suspected embezzlement of the missing jewellery and more arrests are expected. Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday said he was waiting for official results of the investigation.
