The statement says, in particular: "... Paying no attention to the fact that the president of Ukraine has revoked Clauses 1 and 2 of Article 2 in Yuriy Meshkov's decree on conducting a poll of Republic of Crimea citizens on 27 March 1994, as counter to the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine, the poll is about to be held under the pressure of chauvinist forces. We consider a poll on the issues referring to the jurisdiction of Ukraine's Supreme Council as a step towards dangerous confrontation in the relations between Crimea and the central power bodies, as a call for continuing separatism. The poll will not be conducive to the ideas of interethnic concord, friendship and mutual trust, and to resolving the problems of the Crimean-Tatar people, but will become a serious weapon in the political struggle and will lead to even greater deterioration of the situation in Crimea. Moreover, any poll without the participation of native Crimeans, the Crimean Tatars, cannot be regarded as valid. The poll's initiators aim to distract attention from the critical situation, from the economic and social problems... The fact of conducting a poll itself ... is pushing the people of Crimea towards a dangerous borderline. "Therefore, we who stand firm on the foundations of unity between Crimea and Ukraine, appeal to Crimeans against taking part in the poll and urge local executive power bodies to strictly adhere to the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine."
