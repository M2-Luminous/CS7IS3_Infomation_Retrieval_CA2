Raul Iturria stressed that information received from throughout the country indicates that nothing like that exists, adding that rumors of transfers and retirements in the Coraceros Guard are absolutely false. "Transfers, if they exist, are normal within the functions of the institution. For example, we have the penitentiary security service, but this is a normal everyday occurrence. No officer of any rank has been transferred, other than those transferred for service reasons," he stressed. On 4 February the minister had a very full agenda, first in Rio Branco and during the night he visited Melo, where he met with Intendant Rodolfo Nin Novoa. He then officially dedicated the refurbishment of Urban Precinct No. 1 and gave a news conference in the office of the chief of police, Lieutenant Colonel Luis A. Esteba, retired. [passage omitted]
