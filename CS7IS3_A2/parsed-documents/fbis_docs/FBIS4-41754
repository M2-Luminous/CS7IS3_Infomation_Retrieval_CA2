The latter's contribution to the bank's incorporation capital is $170 million. What we are seeing happening before our very eyes is the rapid transformation of what used to be a narrowly specialized sectoral enterprise engaged in the extraction and transport of gas into Russia's largest financial and industrial group, whose interests are beginning to extend to all spheres of economic life. IZVESTIYA recently reported on Gazprom's desire to become involved in the delivery of energy resources in the European market direct to the consumer, the construction in Germany of its own pipeline, and the acquisition of real estate there worth 1.7 billion German marks. Now there are these new facts, providing evidence of Gazprom's penetration of the banking sector. Incidentally, the $170 million in incorporation capital means that Russia's largest commercial bank will now be more than one-third owned by the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company. This is a very appetising morsel, especially if you bear in mind that the bank specializes in foreign economic operations and controls a considerable proportion of them. As Russian Vneshtorgbank Chairman Yuriy Poletayev said, they now service approximately 30 percent of the country's entire foreign trade turnover. The Russian Vneshtorgbank is also an appetising morsel because last year, for example, it made a profit of 178.2 billion rubles [R], or an increase of 9.4-fold. In the first five months of this year alone, the bank's profit was R162 billion. Of course, a major contributory factor to the growth of all the bank's indicators was that in 1993 a vast number of the former clients of the USSR Vneshekonombank, some of its largest ones, furthermore, brought their business here. They thus brought money and lucrative operations and ensured a rapid increase in revenue. However, the fact that Gazprom has become a shareholder in the Vneshtorgbank does not mean that the joint-stock company will henceforth trample the bank underfoot. On the contrary, it will go at least a small way toward balancing out the influence of the state, which, in the form of the Russian Central Bank, previously held more than 90 percent of the incorporation capital and, of course, was able to exert a definite influence on the bank's leadership. Furthermore, none of the other shareholders was physically able to invest in the incorporation capital a sum large enough to significantly reduce the state's share. Only Gazprom has managed to do that. It is interesting that, in Yu. Poletayev's words, the Central Bank's contribution to the Vneshtorgbank's incorporation capital consisted of 50 tonnes of gold, which for a long time lay in the vaults like a dead weight, and it was only recently that the bank was given permission to send the gold abroad, where it began to work and bring the bank revenue. But it is also equally interesting that when last year's profit was distributed, the Central Bank received nothing -- its gold deposit was not put to work last year and thus did not earn anything.
