The document reads as follows: The proceedings of the inaugural conference on the stability pact in Europe concluded in Paris on 27 May 1994. Thirty-nine states and five international organizations adopted a political document whereby they reasserted their pledge to make a contribution to the efforts aimed at ensuring peace in Europe by promoting and expanding relations of cooperation and good-neighborliness. Teodor Melescanu, minister of state and minister of foreign affairs, headed the Romanian delegation at the conference of initiating a stability pact in Europe. The Romanian Government reasserts its support for the basic goals of the stability pact in Europe, the first initiative of foreign policy and joint security of the European Union. The draft initiated by France and promoted by the European Union is part and parcel of the actions aimed at preparing the integration of the Eastern and Central European states that today enjoy the status of associate members of the European Union in the European and Euro- Atlantic structures. Romania's participation in the stability pact, the act of signing the Partnership for Peace, and the status of associate partner in the Western European Union are important steps to ensure our country's integration in European and Euro-Atlantic structures. The endorsement of the initial declaration is the result of the joint efforts of the states that are members of the European Union, associated states -- including Romania -- and of the other countries interested in European stability. Romania has participated in a constructive manner and embarked on the process of defining the orientations of this initiative, that has a pragmatic character of preventive diplomacy. Romania's Government displayed its political will to contribute to the success of this initiative by continuing negotiations on the conclusion of bilateral treaties with its neighbors, by including in the pact those treaties that have been concluded so far and by organizing certain meetings that are specific to the process of the pact regarding the rights of people who belong to ethnic minorities and the improvement of transportation and communication infrastructure. The future pact of stability in Europe is based on the principles generally accepted by the United States, the CSCE, and the Council of Europe. Romania's Government learned with satisfaction that this ample project promoted by the European Union is aimed at putting value on the already established institutions and mechanisms, and the CSCE institutions first of all. Romania's Government believes that the endorsement of the Paris Declaration will give an impetus to the continuation of negotiations on the conclusion of basic treaties with neighboring countries, taking into account the principles expressed in the initial document of the pact. Romania's Government believes that stability in Europe is directly determined by the success of the transition processes in the eastern and central parts of the continent. Therefore, it believes that direct support granted to the process of reform in the countries whose economies are in the middle of transition must be one of the major lines of action of various European structures. This will also lead to the creation of the necessary conditions for integration into the European Union. The whole process, by emphasizing its economic dimension, can lead to the consolidation of European stability, of prosperity of all states in our region, and to the creation of the appropriate conditions for practicing the rights and fundamental liberties of each citizen.
