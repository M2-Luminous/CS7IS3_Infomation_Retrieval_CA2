Armed with an arsenal of ideas contributed by the parliaments in the workplace and the report presented by Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, Cuban deputies had enough arguments to propose solutions to reduce the deficit and the amount of excess money in circulation, which jeopardize the island's economic efforts. In the midst of this heated debate, Cuban President Fidel Castro spoke in his role as deputy. Fidel said the policy of justice and social solidarity, maintained by the revolution even during times of crisis, is basically responsible for the imbalance that now afflicts our internal finances, adding that the time has come to solve the situation once and for all. [Begin Castro recording] Above all, we must be courageous. We must be not only intelligent but courageous. If we are afraid, we are lost. If we implement half measures we are lost. History has given us the responsibility of solving this problem. We have to solve it, and in the end we must assume the responsibility with political sense, with revolutionary sense, and with an (?technological) sense. [end recording] Referring to this, he said we must adopt the necessary measures, even those that are unpopular. [Begin Castro recording] This is not a matter of simply putting our finances on a sound basis; it is also a matter of revaluing money. It is necessary to revalue workers' salaries; to revalue the peso. They are equally important issues. They are (?decisive) things, and I believe we should be willing to adopt whatever measures are necessary [applause] even if no one wants to speak to us the next day. [applause] Even if they do not want to greet us the next day or even in the coming months. None of the measures will be welcome, nor will they be understood in only one day. Only the sum of these measures will be understood. Only the sum of these measures will yield results and increase the people's understanding. These measures must have an order. It is not a matter of adopting any measure today and any other measure tomorrow. The measures must have a [word indistinct] order, because the order of the steps has an impact on the results in this case. [end recording] To conclude, Fidel Castro emphasized that every effort has been made to carry out the most democratic process of discussions, to hear various criteria, and to take the people's opinion into consideration. In other words, the strategy is well-known, but discretion must prevail at all times, he said. The special session will continue tomorrow with the discussion of a draft agreement on the issue, which will be undoubtedly improved by the contributions from Sunday's debate.
