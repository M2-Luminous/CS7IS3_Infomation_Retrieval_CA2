The AFD holds the government responsible for the failure and states that the bill, which required a two-thirds majority of votes, was improperly prepared. The AFD says the government ignored all suggestions from the liberal party. According to the AFD, the government's original proposal would not have made it possible for all minorities to have parliamentary representation. Adopting it would have put minorities of smaller numbers into a detrimental position. Larger minorities would receive representation almost automatically, which would jeopardize the existence of the unicameral parliament. Furthermore, the "one minority -- one list" proposal ignored differences of political views within minorities. According to the AFD's proposal, representatives of minorities would get a seat in Parliament by winning half of the votes usually necessary for an MP. Also, the proposal would give minorities outside of Parliament a right of consultation in Parliament's human rights committee. The AFD seeks to launch coordination talks on minority parliamentary representation with the participation of the minority roundtable and parliamentary parties.
