The full text follows: Originally I did not intend to speak at the current standing committee session. The chairmen's meeting yesterday decided that it would be better if I gave a speech and suggested that I address ways to properly convene the upcoming Second Session of the CPPCC National Committee. The upcoming Second Session of the CPPCC National Committee is a very important meeting. Issues to be discussed at the meeting are major issues affecting the overall situation and concern China's reform, development, and stability. People across China and all CPPCC members pay great attention to the meeting and have expressed the hope that the meeting should be convened properly. To properly convene the upcoming meeting, the CPPCC National Committee has submitted a special report to the CPC Central Committee, proposing guidelines to facilitate a proper convening of the meeting. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the guidelines will promote democracy, realism, unity, and motivational atmosphere. The CPC Central Committee approved the report and the guidelines. I believe that to properly convene the upcoming meeting, we must thoroughly understand and earnestly implement the guidelines. As I see it, the reasons why the guidelines stress "democracy" are first, the CPPCC organizations' nature mandates such decision. The CPPCC is an organizational format that facilitates a basic system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the CPC's leadership, and is an important channel that promotes socialist democracy. Therefore, a CPPCC meeting should certainly stress democracy. Second, the meeting's contents require such a move. The upcoming meeting will discuss many important issues. Only by thoroughly promoting democracy and pooling the wisdom of the masses can the meeting make correct decisions. Third, people across China hope for such characteristics. The annual "sessions of the National People's Congress [NPC] and CPPCC" have become a major political event for the Chinese people and a hot public topic. The Chinese people hope the "NPC and CPPCC sessions" will be enthusiastically held and will yield substantial results. They hope that the CPPCC session will strictly implement democratic procedures, that the execution of democratic rights is earnestly guaranteed, that a much more democratic atmosphere [nong hou de min zhu qi fen 3426 0624 4104 3046 0031 3049 3050] will be formed, and that the principle stressing the masses of people as masters of their own destiny can be truly displayed. The guidelines stress "realism" because our meeting is not a formality merely for show; it aims to truly study and explore issues. At present, we are striving to establish a new socialist market economy. During the process, we are facing many major, new, difficult, and complicated issues. We need to comprehensively consider, carefully weigh, and repeatedly compare these issues. While studying and deciding on the issues, we should consider both the present and the long-term future, both the overall and partial situation, both their advantages and disadvantages, and both the current requirements and various possibilities. Additionally, while listening to the majority's views, we should also pay attention to the minority's ideas. Therefore, during the upcoming meeting, we should adopt a scientific attitude, and warmly, extensively, specifically, comprehensively, and thoroughly conduct in-depth discussions in an effort to fully demonstrate our strong sense of responsibility and the extent of our involvement in participating in and discussing government and political affairs. We stress "unity" because we stress that democracy should be promoted at the CPPCC session where participants should freely express their views and study and discuss issues conscientiously and in a responsible way. This being the case, controversies over different opinions, criticism, and counter- criticism will be difficult to avoid. We think this is necessary and beneficial; at the same time, we must realize that all these are for better results in studying and solving issues, and are aimed at realism and achieving unity by proceeding from the desire for unity. Unity concerns the overall interest, and the overall interest is unity. The People's Political Consultative Conference is a symbol of great unity. A CPPCC session should embody and promote unity; and the result of such a meeting should promote unity among the people of the whole country. We hope that the participants to the session will respect and learn from one another; they should show more understanding and tolerance and reduce arguments. Through the session, they should enhance understanding, eliminate misunderstanding, promote consensus, and strengthen friendship. In short, they should unite to make the session a success and promote unity through the session. The reason we stress "motivational atmosphere" is that since the introduction of reform and opening to the outside world, the achievements we have scored are universally recognized. Our achievements last year were outstanding, and the current situation in all fields of endeavor is good. However, in embarking on undertakings which are unprecedentedly complex and arduous in such a huge country with a large population as ours, there are bound to be successes and failures; there will be encouraging news and matters that concern people; there will be a positive side and a negative side; and there will be a good side and an ugly side. It is necessary for us to be soberly aware of these objective phenomena in social life and to thoroughly analyze, accurately judge, and properly handle them. We allow criticism and exposure of all negative and evil phenomena, but at the same time we also hope that in the act of criticizing and exposing negative and evil phenomena, we should not lose sight of the positive and correct aspect -- or the mainstream. The purpose of criticism and exposure is study and solution of problems. We should pay attention to social effects, to the methods of solving problems, and to boosting morale and enhancing aspirations. We should bring the drive of the CPPCC members into full play during the entire process of the session and, through our session, instill the motivational atmosphere into the people of the whole country. These eight characters -- "democracy, realism, unity, and motivational atmosphere" -- are interconnected and supplement each other, comprising an organic entity. They must be thoroughly understood. To strengthen democracy and realism, we must not neglect unity and motivational atmosphere; to stress unity and hard work, we must not cast aside democracy and realism. If we neglect unity and motivational atmosphere, we cannot achieve good results in holding a meeting; but if we abandon democracy and realism, it is meaningless to hold a meeting; democracy and realism should help promote unity and motivational atmosphere, while unity and the motivational atmosphere should promote democracy and realism. "Democracy, realism, unity, and motivational atmosphere" was the principle adopted in 1990 for publicizing reports on the NPC and CPPCC sessions. In publicizing reports on these two sessions, we have applied this principle since 1990. In fact, it has become a guiding principle for convening the two sessions successfully. In recent years, these principles have been applied when people's congresses and CPPCC committee meetings were held by the provinces and cities. The implementation of this principle in our current session is required by the objective fact and also conforms to the desire of all CPPCC members. It is hoped that all of you will thoroughly understand it and conscientiously implement it. Under the leadership of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, let us conscientiously strive to make our session a meeting for democracy, realism, unity and motivational atmosphere.
