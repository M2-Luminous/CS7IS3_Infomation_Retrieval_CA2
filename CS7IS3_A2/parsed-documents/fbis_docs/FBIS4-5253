There are eight key tasks to carry out as follows: 1. Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the need for industrialization and modernization. -- It is necessary to combine industrialization with modernization because we must carry out not only the industrialization program, but we must also change the structures of all sectors, areas of activities, and the national economy as a whole based on the need for the acquisition of modern technologies. It is important not only to go through the stages of mechanization, automation, and computerization, but also to apply scientific- technological innovations to different areas of activities and make efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with scientific and technological progress in the world. It is necessary not only to apply modern technologies, but also to make full use of and modernize traditional technologies. -- Do we have enough money to carry out the industrialization and modernization program? The important premises rest with the fact that the renovation undertaking has recorded many achievements and the socioeconomic situation in our country has been stabilized to an important extent. The practical results are as follows: The grain problem has been resolved in a relatively comprehensive manner. There has been an increase in the supply of agricultural, forestry, and sea products to support processing industries. The domestic market has been broadened a step further. The national economy has begun to achieve some capital accumulation. The export index has increased considerably and provided enough foreign currency to import materials and staples. Diplomatic relations have been broadened, thereby enabling us to have access to many sources of capital from foreign countries and international organizations. The period from now until the year 2000 is not yet a stage of far-reaching and large-scale developments, but only a step forward in which efforts will be concentrated on projects that are necessary and that can yield effective results and create momentum for fast economic growth in the next decade. What is the significance of our efforts to accelerate the industrialization and modernization program a step further? -- Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the need for industrialization and modernization constitutes a key task of primary importance in the days ahead. This move helps create more jobs, quickly increase the economic growth rate, improve the material and spiritual life of the people, firmly maintain political stability and social order, safeguard independence and sovereignty as well as socialist orientations, and eliminate the danger of being left farther behind compared with neighboring countries. Based on past experiences, what are the concepts that we must firmly grasp to enable the industrialization and modernization program yield effective results? The political report clearly puts forth a number of concepts on industrialization and modernization as follows: -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must go along with the broadening of international cooperation, building an open-door economic development policy both at home and abroad, multilateralizing and diversifying relations with other countries, combining economic activities with national defense and security, and linking economic growth with the achievement of social progress and social justice as well as with cultural development and environmental protection. -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts at exports while at the same time replacing imports that can be produced locally. It is necessary to take socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard for determining the course of development and for selecting investment projects and technologies. -- Appropriately gathering resources for the various fields of activities and various key areas to promptly produce high results while paying attention to meeting the essential requirements of localities which have difficulties. -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size projects that require small investment capital or capital that can be recovered quickly. It is necessary to build a number of necessary, large-scale projects that can yield effective results. -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. From now until the end of this decade, great attention must be paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports. Is it true that if we regard industrialization and modernization as a key task of primary importance in the days ahead, we will belittle the role of agriculture? This concept is not at variance with the strategy of directing vigorous efforts at agricultural development. Agricultural production still remains one of the decisive factors for stabilizing the socioeconomic situation and for creating the groundwork for industrial development. Nonetheless, agricultural development should be understood in a broad sense, not as development that is based solely on agriculture or worse still, on backward agriculture. The party Central Committee Fifth Plenum has pointed out: It is necessary to take comprehensive measures to promote agricultural development and rural socioeconomic development, regarding this move as a very urgent task. To this end, we must necessarily accelerate agricultural industrialization and modernization; develop the rural economy; and boost agricultural, forestry, and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to promote processing industries and other industrial and service sectors in the countryside itself, bearing in mind the need to coordinate action and achieve cooperation with other sectors and areas.
