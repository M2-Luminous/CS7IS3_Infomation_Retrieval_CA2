Mikhaylov: "Our Men in the Duma: Impressions, Opinions, and Assessments From Deputies Expressed After the Opening of the Yeltsin Parliament"] [Text] Aman Tuleyev, Deputy of the Federation Council I did not want to go to the elections knowing that they were illegal. But still they were elections in which the people had the right to vote, and I entered my candidacy. Why? In order to appear here again, in Moscow, and tell the executive power: You drove me away with tanks but I returned. I returned not by my own wish. The people sent me--80 percent of all the voters of the Kuzbass. I represent their interests, and I ask that you not consider me--policy must be corrected for them and at their behest. My word of honor, right up until the first session of the Federation Council I thought the bureaucrats would look out from the Kremlin and Old Square at me and others like me and declare: We are beginning to adjust our political course. We respect the will of the voters who voted for a multitude of candidates from the opposition and we are making a commitment to cooperate with them. Well, you cannot go on endlessly with the same old song and dance, which nobody wants to hear either in Siberia or outside the Moscow Ring! It turns out that they can. The regulations had not even been worked out properly before the democrat Chernichenko demanded from the main microphone: We must elect a chairman of the Federation Council--the world is waiting. And they began to elect one. Shumeyko's candidacy never got off the ground. And that same Chernichenko was turning himself inside out: The repeat vote had to be postponed. The world immediately stopped waiting for the chairman to appear because it was necessary to lobby the deputies so that they would look more favorably on Shumeyko. I did not see how they twisted the arms of the deputies who were hanging from the administrative hook. But I heard many times: After Shumeyko had received 81 votes, and Romanov 79, there were endless negotiations and dinner parties with the deputies whose positions depended on the president and the government. And the next day 17 more votes were cast for Shumeyko. The executive power drew no conclusions from the results of the elections. Yeltsin's people grabbed tightly onto the steering wheel, they do not intend to let anyone else get near it, and they do not wish to turn in the direction of common sense. I place my hopes in just one thing: There are quite a few intelligent people in the Federation Council, including those who have been granted power in the regions. And perhaps, taking advantage of their deputy mandates, they will at least change something in the country. Anatoliy Lukyanov, Deputy of the State Duma I can see how little power the Duma has. I know how many people want to stand in the way of its work. But I do not feel pessimistic. The Duma did not end up in anyone's pocket. Judging from the first days, the authorities should not count on subduing it. That is the first thing that consoles me. And the second thing is that the Duma, while elected according to principles of purely Western parliamentarianism, did not abandon the traditions of domestic democracy. I came to politics when Molotov was still alive and well. Much of our history is stamped on my memory. I can say that not everything in it was bad and not everything needs to be repudiated. The Duma has preserved the merits of the Soviet system--the connection between the deputies and the labor collectives, the use of the voters' mandate, and the possibility of interaction among the deputies regarding territorial and branch interests. But at the same time the Duma is a completely new institution of power for us, where group and party interests "rule the roost." I will not try to predict whether or not this peculiarity will play a favorable role. But I think it is absurd to find fault with the Duma and revile it from its very first steps, as the democratic press is doing. The Duma should be allowed to stay and work peacefully. Yuriy Lodkin, Deputy of the Federation Council I was dismissed from the position of head of administration of Bryansk Oblast the night before the House of Soviets was fired upon. Let me emphasize: I was dismissed by an edict from Yeltsin even though he did not appoint me; I was elected by all the population of Bryansk Oblast. Since then I have been unable to get a minute of air time either on oblast radio or on television. The elections gave me the opportunity to have a rostrum--to speak on the air and to meet with people. And for me there was no question as to whether or not to participate in the elections. But after becoming a deputy to the Federal Assembly I still think that the Federation Council and the State Duma are temporary parallel organs of representative power along with the now banned Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet. To forget about their existence and about the way they were removed from the political scene would mean to legitimize arbitrary rule. I thought that the meetings of our chamber, like the meetings of the State Duma, would begin with a detailed report on the results of the referendum on the new Constitution. The figures from this referendum for the various regions have not been made public yet and, consequently, it has not been confirmed that there was no falsification when the votes were counted in the Central Electoral Commission. But we have not managed to raise the question of verifying the referendum in the chamber. They immediately began dividing up portfolios, and in an unpardonable way. Just look at the attempt to count Galazov's telegram as a vote in favor of Shumeyko. The executive power has obtained the main post in the Federation Council. But I do not think that it will control it completely and therefore I expect that fairly soon a campaign will begin to defame the new deputy corps. And actually it has even already begun. As I was riding to the first meeting I heard on the radio in the bus: $500 million has been allotted for the construction of a new parliament center. How wonderful! They have not yet managed to find $60 million to build a medical rehabilitation center for the eight oblasts that were contaminated with radiation from the Chernobyl disaster. But for the parliament center--help yourself. Listen, you sick and dying residents of Bryansk, your Deputy Lodkin will be living and working in comfort while you are quietly dying. From the very first days the deputies have been acting like parasites, eating up the people's money. But will this continue? Yuriy Vlasov, Deputy of the State Duma The authorities did not get the State Duma they planned to get. And now it is becoming clear that they will try to bury the Duma. From the first days it was clear: The government faction Russia's Choice are not at all squeamish about dragging out, artificially complicating, and stultifying the work of the chamber. What next? The democratic deputies will go over the structures of executive power and start eating away at the Duma. It is now written in the draft regulation that the chamber's decisions will be made by half of its members. And I hope that the Duma will avoid the kind of legitimized depopulation that befell the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies. In my opinion there are many strong and intelligent people in the Duma. The opposition factions and the deputy groups are fairly heterogeneous. But regarding the major issues their interests converge, and the Duma can solve the problems facing it. And, without ingratiating themselves to the now almighty executive power, it is important to preserve and protect the Duma, for its existence is our guarantee of freedom of speech and protection from arbitrary behavior and theft by the new democratic nomenklatura. Petr Romanov, Deputy of the Federation Council During the first two days, when I was running for the post of chairman of the chamber, along with Shumeyko, I was frequently asked whether, if elected, I would be in conflict with the government. I answered: I am against confrontation with anybody. I came to the Federation Council to fight "for"--for a normal course of reforms. And I think I and other deputies of the Federation Council still have a chance to do this, regardless of who heads up the chamber. I began my work biography as a laborer and became the manager of an extremely large combine, having climbed all the steps on the career ladder at my enterprise. I did my work to the glory of the great Russian weapon during the years of the so-called stagnation, and I am doing it now as well. After the reduction of the defense orders our combine mastered the production of several kinds paints and industrial lighting items and created large shops for producing furniture. On the territory of the combine we have 37 bath houses and 10 swimming pools for the workers, we have 40,000 rose bushes, and we breed sturgeon. I am mentioning all this in order to say that it is not one system or another that decides everything. The people and their ability to work decide everything. Therefore I am against all kinds of jumps and leaps and about-faces, which can create nothing but interference with normal work. I am confident that my viewpoint is shared by all who are doing their work and answering for its results. And there are quite a few of these people in the Federation Council. It has a chance to do something so that we can stop trembling from shock therapy and so that the responsible producer will be protected. But a very great deal will depend on who is in charge of the chamber's activity, who is sitting on both sides of the chairman, and who occupies the chairs of the committee leaders--theoreticians with rosy pie-in-the-sky ideas or practical people with immense work experience. Everything is being decided by the cadres now. Aleksandr Nevzorov, Deputy to the State Duma There are more of our people in the Duma. Our people are smarter and stronger. But those who oppose the opposition are pure hooligans who see their role as subverting, talking to death, and impeding all of the Duma's work. We can and should stop and silence the members of Democratic Russia. And the main thing is that we must make sure that the people know about everything that is done in the Duma. In brief, we must have television broadcasting from the Duma, for otherwise it will become a puppet theater in some remote location. Vasiliy Starodubtsev, Deputy to the Federation Council I came to the Federation Council for one purpose--to put a stop to the insanity of the so-called reformers, to stop the destruction, disintegration, and theft they are perpetrating. As a peasant farmer who has already been severely burned by politics, it is rather unpleasant for me to crawl back here. But I cannot sit with my hands folded and be silent and watch how our immense production potential accumulated over the decades is being shattered and how thieves in the bureaucracy are making off with public property bit by bit. The composition of the Federation Council is fairly complex. According to my extremely rough estimates, half of the deputies are people who, as before, are hungering to destroy everything and close their eyes to the thievery, and the other half are those who are against both extremes and want normal reforms. The former half are better organized. The election of the chairman of the chamber showed that. When Shumeyko was nominated to the post of chairman, I spoke out and said: Arguments have been given here as to why Vladimir Filippovich deserves to be chairman, including that he has an excellent knowledge of the political kitchen. And there are not many people like this in the Federation Council. In my view, Shumeyko is not only an expert on this kitchen but is also one of the most talented cooks in it, who will successfully prepare a broth that will poison a large part of the country's population. After all, everyone can see the results of Shumeyko's activity in the government. But they are making him the number one man in the upper chamber of parliament. And now how can this chamber demand answers from the government when it is headed by one of the top government bureaucrats? It seems to me that the future of the Federation Council is fairly cloudy. I have no grounds for thinking that reason will inevitably take the upper hand in the chamber, but one can still hope for this. There are both experienced managers and talented administrators in the Chamber and it is possible that their patience and submissiveness will run out sooner or later. Sergey Baburin, Deputy of the State Duma The spectrum of political forces in the Duma reflects fairly precisely the attitudes of various social strata in society. The number of supporters and opponents of the government in the chamber in terms of percentages is approximately the same as it was in the Supreme Soviet and the Congress of People's Deputies. During the recesses between the sessions when I see the restored building of the House of Soviets I ask myself: Why did Yeltsin have to start shooting and spill the blood of hundreds of people? Was it not so that the authorities could steal the property of the Supreme Soviet and make money on repair contracts? The organization of the work in the Duma went much more quickly than when the Supreme Soviet was established. The experience in parliamentary procedure was in evidence here. The disorder among representatives of various factions and deputy groups, it seems to me, will soon come to an end. There will be a consolidation according to interests and the position of the majority of the Duma will be clearly demonstrated. In spite of my expectations, the formation of the deputy group of patriots called the Russian Way is proceeding fairly successfully now. As of today it has more than 20 deputies, and I do not rule out the possibility that this group in conjunction with representatives of other groups and factions will make up the patriotic majority of the Duma. Nikolay Gonchar, Deputy of the Federation Council According to plan, the Federation Council should be an organ of conciliation--conciliation between the executive power and the Duma, whose laws it is supposed to ratify. But what have we seen during the first days? Deputies of the Federation Council are unable to reach an agreement on regulations and they were split right down the middle in the election of the chairman. What kind of conciliation can there be when they have to approve, say, the principles of the tax policy? Here branch, regional, and political interests immediately make themselves known. And how can they adopt anything if each deputy votes only according to his own scenario? We need to learn the art of compromise. That is the main condition without which the Federation Council cannot exist as the upper chamber of parliament. And to learn to compromise is a quite realistic task. But we must remember that compromise requires talent and work. Mikhail Lapshin, Deputy of the State Duma Even at the first session one could see the aggressiveness and destructiveness of deputies from Russia's Choice, who took the presidium literally by storm trying in spite of all rules of decorum to dislodge the presiding elder of the Duma. The aggressiveness of Russia's Choice shows its powerlessness. The alignment of forces in the Duma was clearly not to the advantage of the pro-government bloc, and the results of the voting showed this. The Duma did not allow them to create a multitude of small factions and it thwarted attempts to use all kinds of regroupings to subject it to endless shakeups. By now we have every possibility of working constructively and fulfilling the promises we made to our constituents. Vitaliy Sevastyanov, Deputy of the State Duma The Duma has many fewer rights than the former parliament of the Russian Federation. In the Supreme Soviet and at the Congress of People's Deputies it lost essentially everything it could lose, and when it came to its senses it was back where it started: All the levers of power had been seized by the president and the government. But now that the opposition has a clear idea of what it needs and what it does not need and organizationally it is completely combat ready, even with modest authority it is quite capable of having a real effect on politics. Gennadiy Zyuganov, Deputy of the State Duma I dare say that three-fourths of our present deputy corps are people with common sense, who understand that the country has reached the edge of a precipice and that it must be saved not according to schemes from across the sea but taking into account the real circumstances of our life. During the past year Russian society has been experiencing a difficult recovery of mental health and public opinion has changed to the favor of state-patriotic forces. This is confirmed both by the composition of the Duma and by the results of the first votes in it. Even in the Russia's Choice bloc, the bloc that was conceived and created in order to justify presidential policy regardless of anything else, one can see quite healthy motives for behavior. Russia's Choice did not succeed as a monolithic pro-presidential faction. It contains people who are inclined to reassess the values imposed on society, and it is possible to cooperate with them. I think the Duma's open opposition to the executive power will soon be a fait accompli. Will it perhaps share the fate of the disbanded Supreme Soviet? Quite possibly. But the Duma's viability will depend only on itself. If during the first weeks of its work it demonstrates fidelity to the will of the voters and proves its ability to develop a policy of common sense, there will not be another version of Edict No. 1400. The authority of the Duma is with the people--this is the only thing that can save parliamentarianism in Russia. Will we win this authority?
