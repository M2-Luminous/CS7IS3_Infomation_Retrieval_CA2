The Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] conducted a survey at the end of March using a list of politicians, and Kwasniewski gained the highest support (17 percent). His "presidential popularity" has not changed since January. But there are clearly far fewer people (compared with the beginning of the year) who would be willing to support Lech Walesa or Krzysztof Skubiszewski in the race for the Belweder (or, as the case may be, to Namiestnikowski Palace). Apart from Kwasniewski, only [Prime Minister] Waldemar Pawlak managed to gain the "votes" of at least one in 10 prospective voters, during the March poll. Support for Zbigniew Religa, chief of the Non-Party Bloc in Support of Reforms, increased slightly since January; Religa now occupies third place on the list of presidential candidates. Respondents' views continue to be very diversified. Therefore, no one from among the personalities named by CBOS can regard himself as a definite favorite on the basis of the poll only. It is worth stressing that just 2 percent of respondents say Jacek Kuron, who leads in popularity polls, would make a good future president. No politician of the center right enjoys significant support. Respondents do not have anyone "in reserve," either. Just 7 percent of respondents said they would vote for somebody who is not on the CBOS list. The CBOS poll was conducted on 25-28 March (1,230-person representative random sample of the country's adult population) and 27-31 January (1,172-person sample).
