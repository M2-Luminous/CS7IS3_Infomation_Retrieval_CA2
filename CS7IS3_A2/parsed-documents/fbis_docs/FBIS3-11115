During a meeting with Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, who made a stopover in this capital before continuing his trip to Laos, Prasong termed his colleague's visit as "timely in discussing trade links." At the same time the chief of the Thai Foreign Ministry expressed his regrets the United States is still maintaining its blockade against Cuba when the international scene is totally different than in 1962, when the pressures were initiated, the source has said. Although Robaina's visit was not official, the local authorities seemed interested in talking with the Cuban foreign minister, who said: "We have come to learn and receive an update on the economic transformation process that is occurring in the region, of which there are matters we can learn and assess." Cuba has a great interest in strengthening its political relations and trade ties with the Asian nations, the Cuban foreign minister said. Likewise, Robaina said a visit such as the one to Indonesia and a passing through Thailand during the first leg of his tour through Asia guarantee the tour's success, which began this week. This tour includes seven regional nations. Robaina termed as very satisfactory the results of his visit to Jakarta, saying there are export possibilities of products Cuba can offer, such as pharmaceuticals. Thailand, a founding member of the organization of the Southeastern Asian Treaty, maintains together with Indonesia an accelerated economic growth and stands out as one of the followers of the so-called Asian Dragons or new industrialized nations.
