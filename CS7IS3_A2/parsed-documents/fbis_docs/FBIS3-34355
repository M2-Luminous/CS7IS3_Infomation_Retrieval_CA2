In a statement it issued today, the party, which is closely monitoring the painful events in Sudan, stressed to the whole world that the Islamic Front's government is ultimately responsible for what happened in the mosque and that the government's claims that foreign elements were responsible for the incident do not absolve it from this responsibility. The statement added: Even if this accusation is true, who opened the country for extremists, fanatics, and terrorists from every corner to come and spread corruption, anxiety, and threats in the country and the region? The statement appealed to the international community and world conscience to exert pressure on the Khartoum regime to stop its evil actions against innocent citizens and called for an immediate and urgent investigation. It also demanded punishment for the responsible criminals and killers who can only be the extremist groups that have been massed in the country.
