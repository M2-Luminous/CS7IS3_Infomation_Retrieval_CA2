And no wonder. As it turned out, the top brass regard the Games as a kind caprice of the St. Petersburg authorities. This pertains to several ministries, for example, the Ministry of Communications, which under the aegis of the Games is trying to run telephone lines through almost all of Russia, leaving St. Petersburg with only part of the funds allotted for solving this problem. And the departments responsible for providing for the security of the guests and participants in the Games are not much better. Thus the Ministry of Internal Affairs is trying to shift the entire burden of the financial costs for placing and keeping its additional contingent in St. Petersburg onto the city budget. This will amount to R46 billion and could never be covered by the funds already allotted by Russia, all of which have been used to revamp the sports facilities for the Games. In Vitaliy Mutko's opinion, such an attitude toward the forthcoming sports forum on the part of Russian power structures must be overcome. And it is possible that this will be done in the next few days, since the government commission will arrive in St. Petersburg today. It will clarify the real costs to the city for preparing for the Games, which will place on the federal budget the costs it should rightfully bear. Perhaps the last "i" in the discussions of the question of who should pay for what will be dotted this weekend during the visit to St. Petersburg of Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, who is responsible in the Government of Russia for preparing for the Goodwill Games.
