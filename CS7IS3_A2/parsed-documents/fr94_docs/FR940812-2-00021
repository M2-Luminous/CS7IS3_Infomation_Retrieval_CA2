FR940812-2-00021 FR940812-2-00019 [Docket No. CP94&hyph;161&hyph;000] Avoca Natural Gas Storage; Notice of Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the Proposed Avoca Gas Storage Field Project August 5, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the natural gas storage field facilities proposed by Avoca Natural Gas Storage (Avoca) in the above-referenced docket. The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of the construction and operation of the proposed Avoca Gas Storage Field Project. The project involves construction of five solution-minded caverns in a rock salt formation about 4,000 feet below the surface. Up to 3 million gallons per day of fresh water would be used to dissolve the salt, and an equivalent volume of brine would be produced and disposed of by injecting it into deep geologic formations about 10,000 feet below the surface. The proposed facilities include: Storage Cavern Facilities •ten solution-mining/storage cavern wells (2 per cavern); •1.82 miles of 12-inch-diameter water injection pipeline; •1.82 miles of 12-inch-diameter brine disposal pipeline; •1.82 miles of 2-inch-diameter diesel injection pipeline; and •1.82 miles of 20-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline. Leach Plant Facilities •a pump building; •three 400-horsepower fresh water injection pumps; •six 600-horsepower brine disposal pumps; •a brine settling pond; •storage tanks within concrete containment areas; and •1.5-miles of electric power service line. Water Source Facilities •three large-capacity fresh water source wells; •eleven aquifer monitoring wells; and •1.48 miles of 12-inch-diameter water pipeline. Brine Disposal Facilities •six brine disposal wells; and •5.23 miles of 12-inch-diameter brine disposal pipeline. Gas Injection/Withdrawal Facilities •0.22 mile of 24-inch-diameter natural gas pipeline; •a 25,000-horsepower compressor station; •gas dehydration facilities; and •a meter station. The purpose of the proposed project would be to offer a stand-alone service for storing natural gas which would enhance the availability of clean-burning natural gas for industrial and utility customers in the Northeastern United States. Avoca would interconnect the storage field with Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company's pipeline system. Potential storage customers could then use this system as the transporter for gas into and out of the Avoca Gas Storage Field. The EA has been placed in the public files of the FERC and is available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7312, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1046. Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;161&hyph;000 and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than September 6, 1994, to ensure consideration prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should also be sent to Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental Project Manager. Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commenter a party to the proceeding. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214). The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by section 385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered. Additional information about this project is available from Mr. Steve Grape, Environmental review and Compliance Branch II, Office of Pipeline Regulation, at (202) 208&hyph;1046. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19692 Filed 8&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
