Li Changchun, secretary of the provincial party committee, held separate discussions with officers of unprofitable enterprises, officers of enterprises which have had to completely or partially suspend production, and with the competent departments in charge of textile enterprises in Zhengzhou at the offices of the provincial party committee on 12 and 13 April to help enterprises find solutions to their problems and offer suggestions for enterprises to recover as soon as possible. During the discussions, Li Changchun frequently chipped in, giving his views on the questions raised by meeting participants. Comrade Li Changchun pointed out: Enterprises suffering losses and are having to suspend production is, in the final analysis, an inevitable phenomenon as the old structure is being replaced by the new, and is the result of the failure of enterprises to change operational mechanisms and manage themselves well. The solution to the problem lies in deepening reform. For this purpose, he made three suggestions: 1. First, to intensify reform and speed up the pace of changing enterprises' operational mechanisms, we should emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts, make bold explorations, and enhance our sense of urgency and responsibility. Enterprise operators and employees must conscientiously study the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and the theory of the socialist market economy and clearly understand in both theory and practice the urgency of changing enterprise operational mechanisms so that everybody will willingly get involved in the reform. Second, we should intensify reform by starting with the property rights relationship and modes of asset operation. Some enterprises must backtrack from the old structure characterized by large size and a higher degree of public ownership and restore the shareholding cooperative system at an accelerated pace. Various contract systems can be introduced such as [word indistinct]. Third, we should intensify reform in the selection of enterprise operators and appropriately introduce the competitive mechanism. In selecting enterprise operators, we should adopt the method of "choosing horses at the horse track" instead of letting those removed from the enterprise decide, set operational goals, and let the best candidates distinguish themselves through competition and take up their posts. We should introduce a democratic election mechanism in an organized way, under which a factory director is elected democratically so that he can share ups and downs with his employees. We should devote efforts to the reform of the three systems in enterprises and really ensure that employees can be both hired and dismissed, cadres can be promoted and demoted, and people can be assigned to higher or lower jobs. We should deeply cut the administrative structure and reduce the number of nonproductive personnel. As far as enterprises suffering losses and suspending production completely or partially, no units or individuals should interfere in their internal structural setups. 2. We should expedite the readjustment of the product mix in accordance with market demands. While changing enterprise operational mechanisms, we should promptly readjust the product mix, gear to market needs, and develop the products which are marketable and promise high efficiency. 3. We should strengthen ideological and political work among enterprise employees and maintain social stability. In difficult times, enterprise operators should share ups and downs with their employees. In regard to major expenditures, enterprises should follow the mass line and talk with the masses of employees. Enterprises should find ways to help the employees who have special financial difficulties to solve their difficulties. Li Changchun urged leaders of economic departments and competent departments in charge of enterprises at all levels to correct their guidance, help enterprises suffering losses and enterprises suspending production, try every possible means to eliminate trouble and solve difficulties for them, and earnestly create conditions for them to turn losses into profits. Fan Qinchen, standing committee member of the provincial party committee and vice governor, and Vice Governor Yu Jiahua attended and spoke at the meeting which was held on the afternoon of 13 April.
