Last week Iran made its last attempt to persuade Syria to abandon the U.S.-sponsored peace talks, when a senior mullah visited Damascus. The mullah in question, Hassan Rohani, met with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and delivered to him two messages from "Supreme Guide" 'Ali Khamene'i and President Hashemi Rafsanjani. He said that the two men asked al-Asad in their messages to "reconsider" the Madrid process before visiting Tehran. But contrary to what was rumored at the beginning, no agreement has been reached on a date for al-Asad's visit. The Syrian leadership is still determined to pursue the line discussed in detail at the al-Asad-Clinton summit in Geneva in January. On his return to Tehran, Rohani, who holds the posts of deputy speaker of the Iranian Majles and secretary general of the Supreme National Security Council, described the peace process as a "conspiracy." But Syrian authorities said later that Rohani's statement describes "just the PLO-Israeli agreement," not the peace process as a whole. Over the past two years Iran has tried to establish a "rejectionist front" under its leadership. Iranian leaders say that they understand that Syria does not want to impose isolation on itself by pulling out of the talks. However, they believe that Damascus is capable of adopting "courageous stands" on the establishment of a new "rejectionist front." Five high-ranking Iranian delegations have sought to stress this point to the Syrians during visits to Damascus over the past six months. One of these delegations was headed by Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati. One was headed by Hassan Habibi, first assistant to Rafsanjani. But these visits did not produce joint statements on their conclusion -- which indicates the existence of differences over vital topics. There are two disagreements between Damascus and Tehran over two other issues in addition to the peace process question. The first is to do with Lebanon's future in general and Hizballah's role in particular. It seems that Syria is determined to disarm the party in question in all Lebanese areas, except the south, where it is confronting the Israeli-occupied "security belt." But Iran wants Hizballah to remain free in all Lebanese areas. Tehran is alarmed at the failure of Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri to visit Iran despite their agreement "in principle" to do so. The cause of the second disagreement between Tehran and Damascus is Syria's support for the United Arab Emirates' position on the dispute over the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa] situated near the Strait of Hormuz.
