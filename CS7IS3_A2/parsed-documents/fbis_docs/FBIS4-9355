A few days ago, the Radio and Television Broadcasting Council decided to take the medium wave frequency away from Czech Radio and allocate it to a private operator. I would like to know how you feel about this business. [Havel] [passage omitted] The result of taking the medium wave frequency away would be a constraint on the broadcasting potential of Czech radio. What occurs to me against the background of some other matters, such as the deputies' sponsored proposal to privatize Czech Television Second Channel, is whether this issue is not a rather dangerous or exaggerated passion for privatization, the consequences of which could turn not only against the public, but eventually even against the political power itself. After all, if we have only private radios broadcasting all the time pop-music and advertisements, and if we have television broadcasting American horror films and so on and so forth, one day it could happen that important political information does not at all reach the public. [passage omitted] Naturally, this is linked to the fact that the legislation covering the non-profit making sphere in our country has not been completed yet. As you know, I often recollect this topic. One of the many types of non-profit making organizations are public institutions. While we have the law on television and radio, these laws are bit intangible and I am not sure about their quality. This applies mainly to the decisionmaking mechanisms operating through the [Radio and Television Broadcasting] Council. The Council's decision is thus primarily a reminder of the importance of regulating this sphere, of thinking out well and without bias what position should be given to the public institutions and of comprehending that they are absolutely irreplaceable. I regard the trend leading to imposing an excessive constraint on their potential for the benefit of commercial media as very dangerous. It is a trend which could turn against all of us. [Hulkova] [passage omitted] Now we know what the president's view is. This view is unequivocally in line with the view held by the prime minister, parliament speaker, all the representatives of all political parties, and by the broad public. All of them unanimously agree that the Council's measure is not very good. What occurs to me in this context is -- where is the law, where is the justice? Pardon me for using such grand words. [Havel] It appears that the Council, which as far as I know cannot be dismissed, has been given disproportionate powers. It seems to me that the Council set up by the parliament should not be the last, the highest, and only decisionmaking body. Undoubtedly, it has a million reasons to justify its decision. But all the same, it seems to me, that just as everywhere else, in this case there should also be a chance to appeal and to evaluate its decision on a higher level. [passage omitted] [Hulkova] This week was very dismal for the population of Gorazde. As the world is admitting its powerlessness, I would like to ask whose turn is it now to solve this? [Havel] As you well know, for a long time I have been feeling the world community's bewilderment and helplessness and I have found it difficult to come to terms with. I consider the fact that the world community is pulling itself up only now, when the things went as far as they did, to be sad, tragic and almost shameful. The Karadzic army is more or less ridiculing the whole world, doing whatever it wants. It is only now that there is any really serious debate about decisive steps to stop this. My view is that the evil has to be fought, the sooner the better, if possible at the very beginning. The stakes in this issue are very high; above all, those thousands of innocent people who are suffering and are being murdered, including patients at medical points that are being attacked and shelled. However, there is much more at stake here -- this is something explosive, something that might represent a political threat to the whole of Europe if nothing is done about it. I do believe, that at least at this late stage the world community will after all take a course of action decisive enough to open the door for really serious talks, not just pseudo-talks when one side deals with the other with the knowledge that they are liars and that they will deceive them the next day anyway. This is just a negotiating game. It is clear that it is always better to negotiate than to bomb somebody. However, unfortunately, sometimes there is a situation when there is no other way to force somebody to engage in serious talks than to use a tough threat against him. [Hulkova] Mr. President, do you think that the Americans who are still traumatized by the Vietnam experience will be prepared to wage a real war, prepared for sacrifices for this issue, if necessary? [Havel] This is America's traditional and big problem, it has been America's problem before Vietnam and after Vietnam. [passage omitted] Everybody understands that the American public is very reserved regarding U.S. involvement in the world. However, at the same time it is clear that this big state has some sort of an indirect responsibility for the fate of freedom, democracy, human rights, and basic moral decency of human coexistence on this globe.
