The trial began on 18 April but was postponed because of complaints by the attorneys, who are demanding that the prosecutor and deputy prosecutor of the Serb Prosecution Office for the Prishtina region be removed from the trial. The attorneys have confirmed that the trial will continue, even though a request for defense has not been approved. The attorneys of the accused have denied the charges and consider the trial to be a politically trumped-up one against the Albanians in Kosova.
