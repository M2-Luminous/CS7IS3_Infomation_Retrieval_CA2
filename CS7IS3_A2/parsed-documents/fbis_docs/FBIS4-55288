FBIS4-55288 "dreeu092_b_94001" FBIS-EEU-94-092 Daily Report 11 May 1994 BULGARIA SDS Submits No-Confidence Motion in Assembly SDS Submits No-Confidence Motion in Assembly AU1105172994 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network in Bulgarian 1600 GMT 11 May 94 AU1105172994 Sofia Khorizont Radio Network Bulgarian BFN [Text] Today the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] parliamentary group deposited at the office of the National Assembly a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Lyuben Berov due to his inability to organize and lead the Council of Ministers. The aim of the SDS is evidently to forestall the prime minister's statement on structural and personnel changes in the cabinet that he is expected to make next Thursday, our reporter Antoaneta Puncheva points out. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal for structural and personnel changes in the government will be discussed at a special plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], BSP leader Zhan Videnov stated at today's meeting of BSP deputies. The BSP deputies reported after the meeting that the plenum will be scheduled for the day when the prime minister officially presents his cabinet's program intentions in parliament, so the exact date is not clear at the moment. The deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] decided at their meeting today not to support Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's expected proposal on structural and personnel changes in the Council of Ministers. All the political forces, especially those in the parliamentary center, should reach a consensus on the cabinet shuffle, even at the cost of making compromises -- this was the common view of Ahmed Dogan, DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] leader, and Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic Alliance for the Republic. They had a long discussion in parliament today, the main subject of which was the government changes. According to Tomov, Dogan and he found that they shared quite a number of common viewpoints in their positions. Regarding the hardline position of the NSD deputies not to take part in the vote on Professor Berov's program, Aleksandur Tomov expects a slow but sure evolution in the views of the parties and organizations in the NSD group, and Ahmed Dogan predicts the same. The idea of forming a new cabinet within the term of the present parliament is not a bad one, Aleksandur Tomov thinks, but at the moment it is simply unrealistic.
