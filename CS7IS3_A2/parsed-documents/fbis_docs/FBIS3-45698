Speaking at a news conference held here on Thursday afternoon, Chernomyrdin said his government expects inflation to run at 15-18 percent a month for the first half of 1994, and 12-14 percent for the second half of the year, falling to perhaps 8-9 percent monthly by the end of the year. "Inflation is and remains the biggest problem" in Russia, he pointed out, noting: "Everything else depends on curbing the biggest problem." The inflation rate has wavered up or down 20 percent in the country in the past months. The government head stressed: "Inflation in Russia no longer depends on the activity of one or another government official." It is "now fluctuating on its own inertia," he added. Chernomyrdin said attempts at financial stabilization were being undermined by two things: on the one hand, the structure of the economy and structural problems which have led to stagnant investment rates and a decline in production, and on the other hand, federal organs of power which sometimes make promises which are impossible to fulfil. He told reporters that the newly-formed cabinet proposed to "correct the course of reforms." According to him, the essence of the correction in the fight against inflation will be that -- "we will move from primarily monetaristic tactics to non-monetaristic ones, which have been used in many European countries." The head of the Russian Government specified that this means the foundation of a real competitive market in the Russian economy. "That is, in fact, a step towards an increasingly open Russian market. All artificial barriers to the entry of foreign investments and goods into Russia will be removed." He also stressed that the "president's course of deep and democratic reforms in the Russian society has been, is, and will be consistently pursued." At the news conference, the prime minister read out the list of the new Russian Government signed by President Boris Yeltsin. In the new line-up, Chernomyrdin has one first deputy -- Oleg Soskovets, and three deputies -- Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Anatoliy Chubays, and Yuriy Yarov. He also listed names of ministers. But the final government reshuffle has not finished completely, well-informed sources here said. In order to raise the government's effectiveness, the number of its members was reduced from 93 to 29, the sources confirmed.
