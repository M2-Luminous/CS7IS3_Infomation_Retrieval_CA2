"If the Crimean president fails to understand this and begins to demonstrate his power or exceed Ukraine's laws and Constitution, this will pose the start of confrontation. The entire responsibility for it will lie on the person who starts it," Kravchuk declared. Nevertheless, Kravchuk pointed out that "we shall not resort to the use of force toward the Crimea." He is "calling for common sense," the Ukrainian president said. "The Crimea continues to receive subsidies from Ukraine," Kravchuk noted, and added that "there is no political independence without economic freedom." According to him, the issue of dual citizenship, that was to be decided by referendum in the Crimea, "is within the competence of Ukraine and Russia, not that of the Crimea." During his first meeting with Yuriy Meshkov, Kravchuk said, he reached agreement to come into contact when working out political decisions. "Evidently there are forces which directed the Crimean president to a different road," Kravchuk said. "If some people think that they will become a state as soon as they proclaim it, they are deeply mistaken," he said. The Ukrainian president referred to the experience of Trans-Dniester, which, he said, "proclaimed itself a state, but failed to become one in practical terms."
