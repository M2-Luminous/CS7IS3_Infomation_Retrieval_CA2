That is fine, but your economy is coming apart--the strings have been tightened too much, no more is possible." This is how Croatian businessmen in the Zagreb region, specifically those who export their products, talked to Prime Minister Nikica Valentic and the competent minister, along with representatives of the National Bank of Croatia [NBH] in the meeting organized in Zagreb on Tuesday by the Croatian Chamber of Commerce. Some 50 businessmen in the state and private sectors were straightforward, frank, and at times temperamental in expounding to Valentic how they are managing to do business within the framework of his stabilization program. The list of problems pinching them in conduct of their business is lengthy. The businessmen were unanimous in letting Valentic know that the low rate of foreign exchange is causing them the greatest losses in doing business with foreign countries. So that they might do business with the outside world successfully, the businessmen want the exchange rate to be at least 4,000 dinars for 1 German mark [DM], because a lower rate, in their experience, jeopardizes not only the operation of their firms, but indeed the entire government program. Tax Evasion Ante Pesa, director of the firm Mega, cited the example of his firm, which has superb technology, but still cannot cover operating costs because of the low exchange rate of the mark. He reproaches Valentic for having wanted to achieve many objectives all at once with his program, in spite of the small market and the low purchasing power of our public: stabilization of the dinar and growth of production, and he warned him that if the unrealistic exchange rate is maintained, we will experience complete economic collapse instead of the goals that were planned. Pesa therefore proposes an exchange rate of 5,000 dinars per mark and a slow rate of inflation that would stimulate production. Marko Zupan, representative of Export Drva, reminded Valentic that a firm must meet its obligations to the budget every 15 days, while it must wait as long as two months for money it earns through sales abroad. And while the NBH and commercial banks are making charges against one another because of difficulties in making payments, the firm must borrow money even at an interest rate of 10 percent to support its regular business operation. The businessmen call upon the banks in future to pay them money collected 24 hours after the money is credited to the account. Ante Kljajic of the firm Unitas blames the NBH for having created a shortage of dinars artificially, thereby also causing a drop in the exchange rate, because there are no clear records of the money supply. He proposes that the operation of firms which have uncollected claims from the other republics of the former Yugoslavia be given relief through collection of those claims from those Croatian firms which have debts to the other republics, and later the government, when relations with the other states are normalized, would settle this through bilateral treaties. He also said that government-owned firms are carrying the heaviest burden of appropriations for the budget, while the private firms are evading taxes. He publicly asked the president of the city chamber of commerce how many private firms in Zagreb have been shut down because of tax evasion? Zdenko Pervan, representative of Almerija, a leather and footwear factory, asked the prime minister why the competent government departments are allowing 2 million pairs of shoes to enter Croatia through smuggling channels every year without customs duties or tax, with a large amount of this being sold at booths in open-air markets under the very eyes of the Financial Police? Unless the government controls smuggling channels for distribution and sale, the Croatian economy, Pervan says, will quickly turn into a speculative economy. For all these reasons, production in Croatia is dropping, as the statistics show. In 1993, production was on the average 5.9 percent below 1992, and in last December alone that drop was all of 11.9 percent. The businessmen warn the government of a drop in exports as well: In January of this year, they were down 27 percent from January of last year. Financial Rescue of the Banks Nikica Valentic thanked the businessmen several times for their frankness and promised that the government would do everything to guarantee them market-oriented conditions for the conduct of their business, but he stuck to the view that he will not yield to demands that jeopardize the basic goal of the government economic program -- stabilization of the Croatian currency. The alternative to that goal, Valentic said, is uncontrolled printing of money and financial chaos. According to the prime minister's promise, the government will try to ease the troubles of the businessmen through numerous measures on a smaller scale. According to the government decree, as of 1 April the maximum interest rate must not exceed 50 percent, and all the conditions for the conduct of business will be known before the summer. Valentic will request from the NBH the clearest possible monetary production for the coming period in order to put an end to the constant sliding of the exchange rate. In the coming period, the government will try to restore the banks to health, which is a precondition for restoring the health of the entire economy. The government plans to set aside DM70 million in cash and DM50 million in bonds from this year's budget for financial rescue of the banks. The government will also provide an injection of money for shipbuilding, DM500 million will be furnished for spring planting, the government will also help preparation for the coming tourist season, and it was announced that construction is being invigorated. Over the next 10 years, in Croatia, according to Valentic, 30,000 new housing units are to be built. The government will take extreme measures to speed up the privatization of large government-owned firms, but the strongest light of hope for the Croatian economy is coming from international financial institutions. According to the prime minister's promise, by the end of this month Croatia will know how much aid it will get from international financial institutions. There are prospects of a loan of $500 million, and Valentic is issuing firm guarantees that not a single dollar will go for government expenditure, but all will go for the infrastructure and investments.
