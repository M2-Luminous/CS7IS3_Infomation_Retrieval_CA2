Action: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requests comments on proposed amendments of right-of-way regulations containing procedures for setting fair market rent for communication uses located on public lands. The proposed rule would establish rental schedules and procedures for 11 categories of communication service for which fair market value is required for the use of public lands. The proposed schedule has been developed in cooperation with the Forest Service (FS). The proposed schedule is an attempt to improve the processing of right-of-way authorizations for communications use of public lands and reduce agency appraisal costs associated with setting and updating rental payments on approximately 1,500 authorized communications uses for which rent is currently required. DATES: Comments should be submitted by September 12, 1994. Comments received or postmarked after the above date may not be considered in the decisionmaking process on issuance of a final rule. ADDRESSES: Comments should be submitted to: Director (140), Bureau of Land Management, Room 5555 MIB, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240.
