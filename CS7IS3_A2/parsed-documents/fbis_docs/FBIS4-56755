In addition to increasing by more than 100 percent the number of personnel who will be trained annually in antiguerrilla warfare and jungle survival, the leading military training school in this area, which was created in 1964, has increased the number of courses from three to seven. CIGS Commander Luiz Roberto Fragoso Peret Antunes is a 42-year-old lieutenant colonel. He reports that the students are trained to fight in an area of 1,500 square kilometers of jungle located between the municipalities of Manaus and Rio Preto. He adds: "Instructors show them how to take advantage of the flora and fauna of the jungle and to take precautions against its natural dangers." For over 30 years, CIGS has also trained 184 foreign servicemen. Attending a course that started yesterday are two students from Argentina, three from Ecuador, two from Paraguay, one from Guyana, two from Uruguay, three from Mexico, and five from France. According to Peret, they learn "only general rules about how to operate in the jungle." Strategic information on how to fight in the jungle is given only to Brazilians.
