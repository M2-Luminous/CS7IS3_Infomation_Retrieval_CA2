This is the opinion of a working group at the Ministry of Defense that has studied the need for reforming the arms export legislation, particularly in view of the European Union. The group submitted its memorandum to Defense Minister Elisabeth Rehn on Wednesday [20 April]. If required for reasons of foreign or security policy, the license could also in the future be issued by the government, says the working group. The working group included representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry, as well as the Interior Ministry and the General Staff.
