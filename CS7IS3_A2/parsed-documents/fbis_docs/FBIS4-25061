The province should not only ensure the reasonable increase in the province's revenues to enhance the provincial government's ability in macroeconomic regulation and control, but also take into consideration the interests of cities and counties to mobilize their enthusiasm for developing the economy, increasing revenues, and reducing expenditures. According to the provincial party committee's guiding ideology that to make the province rich, we must first make the grass roots rich, we must ensure that three aspects must not be changed when the new tax distribution system is carried out. That is, the original pattern of distribution of interests between the province and cities and counties must not be changed; the basic frame of the tax distribution system, defined by the central financial department, must not be changed; and the ratio of revenues shared by the province and cities and counties as defined by the central financial department as well as the coefficient of the progressive increase rate of the refund on tax revenues must not be readjusted. Second, we should persist in the principle of linking unified policies with management by various layers. The legislative powers of central taxes, sharing taxes, and some important local taxes as defined by the central financial department must be concentrated in the central financial department so as to ensure the unified implementation of government decrees and to safeguard the coordination of markets throughout the country and the equal competition between enterprises. Tax revenues should be collected and managed by various layers. Central taxes and sharing taxes should be collected on a responsibility basis by the central tax affairs organization. Of the sharing taxes, the portions obtained by the localities should directly be distributed to the treasuries at various layers by the central tax affairs organization. The local taxes should be collected on a responsibility basis by the local tax affairs organizations at various levels. The revenues that belong to the provincial level should directly be transferred to the provincial treasury. Third, we should persist in the principle of combining overall design with step-by-step advance. On the basis of defining reform targets, the central financial department should define to set up the basic frame of the tax distribution system through step-by-step reforms and to perfect the system in a step-by-step manner in the course of implementation. The methods for division of revenues, refund on tax revenues, and transfer of payments should be standardized throughout the country. So far, we should first divide major tax categories and standardize, in a step-by-step manner, the division of other revenues. In the course of transition from the old tax system to the new one, items on subsidies, delivery to higher levels, and some accounts as stipulated in the old tax system should continue to be implemented. The specific contents of this new tax system are as follows: First, division of revenues -- Revenues should be divided between the province and cities and counties according to the power to manage affairs exercised by the province, cities, and counties and in line with tax categories. The provincial level's fixed revenues include the income taxes of provincial-level enterprises (excluding the income taxes of local and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary enterprises), the profits handed over to higher levels by these enterprises, the income taxes of the grain enterprises under the special management of the province, the profits handed over to higher levels by these enterprises, the regulatory taxes on the orientation of the investment in fixed assets, the business taxes paid by the banks at various levels and the insurance departments, the taxes on natural resources, and some other provincial-level revenues. The revenues paid by Daqing city (excluding three counties) should temporarily be divided according to the original methods. The fixed revenues of the city- and county-level financial departments (excluding that of Daqing city) include the income taxes of local enterprises (excluding the income taxes of local and foreign-funded banks and nonbanking monetary enterprises), the profits handed over to higher levels by local enterprises, the income taxes of individuals, and the taxes on utilization of urban land. Taxes for city maintenance and construction (excluding the portions concentratively paid by head offices of banks, railway departments, and general insurance companies), the taxes for real estate, the taxes for use of vehicles and ships, stamp taxes, the taxes on slaughtering animals, the taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry, the taxes on special agricultural products, the taxes on occupation of cultivated areas, the taxes for contracts, and the revenues from paid use of state-owned land. Revenues shared by the province with cities and counties are as follows: The 25 percent of the value added tax paid by petroleum, power, petrochemical, and nonferrous metal departments to be retained by the local authorities belongs to the provincial-level revenue. The 25 percent of the value added tax paid by enterprises to be retained by local authorities is shared by the province with cities and counties 50 to 50 percent, the same ratio as they shared the former indirect tax. Business tax (excluding the business tax paid by the head offices of banks, railway departments, and head offices of insurance companies), inheritance tax, bequest tax, land value added tax, and the agricultural tax resulting from increase of grain price are shared by the province and cities (counties) 50 to 50 percent. Second, division of the expenditure -- Based on the division of power between the provincial government and city and county government, the provincial finance department chiefly takes charge of the expenses needed in the operation of provincial-level state organs, the expenditures needed in restructuring the economy, coordinating the development of various localities, and exercising macro regulation and control, and the expenditures on the development of the undertakings directly managed by the province. City and county finance departments take charge of the expenses needed in the operation of local organs of political power and the expenses needed in the development of the local economy and other undertakings. Third, delimitation of the tax revenues returned by the provincial finance department to cities and counties. To maintain the vested interest of cities and counties and gradually attain the goals of the reform, the amount of the tax revenues to be returned by the province to cities and counties is determined with 1993 as the base period. Based on the actual 1993 revenues of various localities, the tax reform conditions, and the division of revenues among the central, provincial, and city and county authorities, the net revenues turned over to the central authorities and the province by various localities are determined (namely consumption tax plus 75 percent of the value added tax plus the part to be retained by the province of the revenues shared by the province with cities and counties minus the revenues refunded by the central authorities and the province to cities and counties). The net revenues turned over to higher authorities by various localities in 1993 are all returned to the localities to ensure their vested financial strength, and the amount will be taken as the base figure of the tax revenues to be returned by the province to various localities in the future. Beginning 1994, the tax revenues to be returned will increase every year based on the 1993 base figure. The increase rate is determined on the basis of the coefficient of 1:0.3 of the average growth rate of the province's value added tax and consumption tax. That is, when the average growth rate of these two types of taxes rises by 1 percent, the tax revenues to be returned to cities and counties should grow by 0.3 percent. After 1994, when the net revenues turned over to the central authorities and the province are lower than the 1993 base figure, the tax revenues to be returned to cities and counties will be reduced accordingly. The measures for the central authorities to return tax revenues to the province remain unchanged. Fourth, the handling of the fixed-quota subsidies, the revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to systems, revenues to be turned over to higher authorities for special purposes, and matters related to final accounts. In line with the central guidelines of "keeping the distribution pattern of the original system unchanged for some time after implementation of the tax distribution system and gradually standardizing the work after a transitional period," the fixed-quota subsidies from the province to cities and counties according to the original system will continue; and the progressive decrease of the fixed-quota subsidies applied to some cities and counties will remain unchanged. The various revenues to be turned over to higher authorities according to the original system will continue; the progressive increase of the revenues to be turned over to higher authorities applied to some cities and counties will also continue, and this method will be applied for the time being to the prefectures and cities which retain a certain amount of the total. A progressive increase rate will be determined based on the actual amount turned over to higher authorities by these prefectures and cities in 1993, and these prefectures and cities will hand revenues over to higher authorities according to this progressive increase rate every year.
