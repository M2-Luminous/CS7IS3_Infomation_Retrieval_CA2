The Latvian Citizenship and Immigration Department has confiscated from General Anatoliy Gaponov his USSR passport. Yesterday KOMMERSANT-DAILY learned some details of the incident. So far there has been no reaction from the Russian Defense Ministry. It is noteworthy that the decision to confiscate the passport from the general was made by Andrejs Rucs, chief of the Vidzemsk district in Riga. Rucs is known for the fact that at the end of January he ordered two Russian generals, Vodopyanov and Taylakov, to be handcuffed and arrested. Their arrest led to the disruption of a regular round of the Russian-Latvian negotiations on the status of the Russian radar station in Skrunda while Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put troops stationed in Latvia on high alert. After that incident the Latvian government ruled to dismiss Rucs from his post while the prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against him. Later on, however, deputies of the local council reinstated Rucs in his post. Apparently, after receiving a vote of confidence, Rucs has launched a harassment campaign against the Russian generals. Rucs' first step in this direction has been an order to confiscate the passport from Russian General Anatoliy Gaponov. First, the local Latvian authorities invited General Gaponov to vacate his apartment. After the general's representative arrived at the Citizenship and Immigration Department with General Gapanov's passport to obtain documents confirming the legitimacy of the general's presence on Latvian territory, Latvian officials confiscated Gaponov's ID. According to the department leadership, he is simultaneously a private individual (by his passport) and a military serviceman (by his ID), which contradicts Latvian law. A department employee, who asked not to be identified, said in a conversation with KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he has no information on this case: "The question of legality or illegality of confiscating the passport will be decided at the working level." Furthermore, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent has learned, the Latvian prosecutor's office is undertaking its own investigation into the incident with the Russian general. Dmitriy Rogozin, chairman of the Congress of Russian Communities, told KOMMERSANT-DAILY's correspondent that he was not surprised by what has happened: "This is not a precedent but a relapse which will recur again and again. The arrest of Generals Vodopyanov and Taylakov and the seizure of Gaponov's passport is aimed at humiliating Russia and its officials."
