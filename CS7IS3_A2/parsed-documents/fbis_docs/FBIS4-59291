FBIS4-59291 "drnes092_s_94010" FBIS-NES-94-092 Daily Report 2 May 1994 SOUTH ASIA Iran BBC Report on Sirjani Debunked; Charges Cited BBC Report on Sirjani Debunked; Charges Cited NC0805130294 Tehran RESALAT in Persian 2 May 94 p 2 NC0805130294 Tehran RESALAT Persian BFN [From the news desk] [Text] The British Government radio [BBC] announced last night that 100 writers and broad-minded [rowshanfekran] persons abroad, who have fled Iran, sent a letter to Butrus-Ghali expressing concern about the fate of 'Ali Akbar Sa'idi-Sirjani. Support for Sa'idi-Sirjani by this group of broad-minded individuals comes at a time when a number of so-called writers in Iran have also tried to lobby for Sa'idi-Sirjani. It is worth mentioning that Sa'idi-Sirjani has been charged with smuggling of drugs and with corruption and was arrested a while ago by antidrug officials. One of these broad-minded persons who supports Sa'idi-Sirjani told our correspondent: The charges leveled against Sa'idi-Sirjani are not unforgivable sins, as most of the writers and broad-minded persons indulge in taking drugs. In answer to a question on his views about the smuggling of drugs, he said: The court should prove this charge. When asked what was the meaning of the collecting of signatures at home and abroad, he said: If the government arrests people for these reasons, there are many who will be concerned! It may be mentioned that on 25 April the director general of internal security of the Information Ministry announced in an interview that Sa'idi-Sirjani and Niaz Kermani were members of the SAVAK [shah's intelligence organization] and have admitted to the transporting, distribution, and use of drugs. They have also confessed to producing, stocking, and distributing liquor and to immoral acts.
