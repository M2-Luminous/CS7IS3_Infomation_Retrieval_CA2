One candidate for this office is Stanislav Shushkevich, ex-chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belorussia, who chatted with a ROSSIYA correspondent and shared his thoughts concerning the country's present and future. My recall from the office of chairman of the Supreme Soviet was nothing more than a well-staged political intrigue. I cannot agree and never will agree with the reasons that allegedly brought about my dismissal. The charge of corruption is a clever and skillful lie. The true reasons for my dismissal go deeper, of course. My disagreements with the majority of the Supreme Soviet came to light long since, in the first months of business even. And in the final period the conformist deputies of the supreme legislative body no longer bothered to keep up a "good," democratic appearance even. My entire activity in the office of chairman was a succession of compromises in the name of the solution of fundamental questions making it possible to look for progress in the development of the republic. In a situation of constant opposition my main task was, perhaps, to push through as many laws as possible making the process of transformations irreversible. I went along with much for the sake of this, but the differences with the nomenklatura majority of the Supreme Soviet were too serious. My resignation from the office of chairman does not mean that I have renounced political struggle. Now, when the government and the Supreme Soviet have brought the republic to the most severe economic crisis, I believe that to quit politics would be irresponsible. The very low level of political literacy of the population is a dangerous symptom. Events could begin to develop in unpredictable fashion, especially since the republic has, truly, been reduced to a deplorable condition and many people have lost all bearings as to what is going on. Many people like simple, more precisely, primitive, speeches, but not everyone wishes to think about what follows them. One presidential candidate, for example, Aleksandr Lukashenko, proposes the same simple and eye-catching solutions for all problems as V. Zhirinovskiy in Russia. Without military pushes to the Indian Ocean, it is true, but the rest is the same. The instability in society is being stoked by inflation, which is running at 50-60 percent a month. The needy and the retirees are suffering particularly. How can the state protect them? After all, we have to have something in order to be able to give it out. There's nothing to be gotten from an empty pocket, and Belorussia's pocket is now empty. Structural reforms and privatization are needed, but how is all this to happen? The Belorussia People's Movement, which has nominated as presidential candidates A. Lukashenko and V. Novikov, secretary of the Party of Communists of Belorussia, is enjoying success in the indoctrination of the electorate against the background of the impoverishment of the people. They are promising everything, and all at once, what is more: the restoration of order, a fight against corruption, wages for all who want them. Aside from this populist demagogy and the customary promises of a "bright tomorrow," the Belorussia People's Movement is preaching postulates that are fraught with serious complications with other states of the CIS, primarily with Russia. It is sufficient to mention the rhetoric concerning the building of Belorussian socialism or the restoration of the USSR according to the prescriptions of the Moscow red-brown opposition. And S. Gaydukevich, chairman of the Belorussia People's Movement, is declaring publicly that other winds will shortly be blowing from Moscow. It is the needy and socially unprotected strata of society that are becoming the social base of these forces, unfortunately. Very characteristic of Belorussia today are charges against the democrats, who have "reduced".... But permit me to ask: Where in Belorussia are there democrats? And how could they have "reduced" anything if they have not yet held power even? The party apparatus and the nomenklatura are the basis of the present government and Supreme Soviet. Party officials of all ranks, who were swept from their positions by the events of August 1991, have come to head all local government--oblast, city, and rayon--authorities. These people are continuing to do what they have done their whole lives: to solicit credit and then to distribute it, stealing in large and varying amounts. In a normal society responsibility for what is happening in the state is borne by the government. With us, however, some mythical democrats are to blame for all misfortunes. I have always opposed a vetting act and I do not believe that, had it been adopted in Belorussia, as in certain postcommunist states of East Europe and the Baltic, we would have avoided the crisis. I am convinced that no person should bear the stigma of his past activity because this was legitimate activity. A person is entitled to any ideological convictions, communist included. The Belorussian People's Front has always insisted on a vetting act, I do not share this opinion. Such is my approach also to the national question, which has engendered tumultuous processes in many post-Soviet republics. Those who want to impose Belorussian by extremist methods are hardly doing Belorussia or this language any service. Everything should develop naturally, not forcibly, we should avoid only adopting any decrees. The Belorussian people are, generally, very tolerant, and now, against the background of the ongoing national battles in other countries of the CIS, and not only of the CIS, Belorussia could set an example of interethnic relations. If I am elected president, I shall begin, I believe, with three most important matters. First, I shall dismiss all the industrial manager-ministers. The time for empty prattle is past. People with market thinking and education who have no connection with the party school of the Communist Party of Belorussia Central Committee must, finally, assume the positions of the ministers connected with economics, finances, agriculture, and foreign economic relations. Second, the privatization of everything subject to privatization is essential. There can be no more demagogy on this problem, and the creeping nomenklatura "plunderization," at which the Soviet authorities have become so adopt over these years, must end. And, of course, elections for a new Supreme Soviet. The 13th Supreme Soviet of the Belorussian SSR--and it is this that is still operative in its full composition of 300 people's deputies elected in USSR times even--can no longer remain the supreme legislative body of the republic.
