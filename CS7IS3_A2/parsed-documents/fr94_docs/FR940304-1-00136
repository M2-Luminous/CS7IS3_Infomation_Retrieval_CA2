FR940304-1-00136 FR940304-1-00014 At those levels of efficiency, the consumer price increases for gas water heaters are zero for level 1, since it is the same as the baseline, $7.35 for level 2, $24.05 for levels 3 and 4, $59.60 for levels 5 and 6, $108.55 for level 7 and $901.80 for level 8. For electric water heaters the consumer price increases are $6.85 for level 1, $42.04 for level 2, $361.36 for level 3, $394.38 for levels 4 and 5, and $834.31 for levels 6 through 8. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is zero for a gas water heater because it is the same as the baseline; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $2.87; standard levels 3 and 4 by $7.46; standard levels 5 and 6 by $9.20; standard level 7 by $13.32; and standard level 8 by $53.02. For electric water heaters standard level 1 would reduce energy expenses by $14.66, standard level 2 by $26.78, standard level 3 by $195.01, levels 4 and 5 by $207.13 and levels 6 through 8 by $250.79. See Technical Support Document, Tables 4.1 and 4.2. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturers Impact Model results for all classes of water heaters show that any of the revised standards would cause a prototypical manufacturer to have negative short-run return on equity. This is caused in part by the very low base case return of 0.4 percent, indicative of an industry which is extremely price-competitive. The negative short-run return on equity's are especially severe at the three most stringent levels. Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce negative short- run return on equity's of 0.2 percent, 0.3 percent, 3.3 percent, 3.5 percent, 3.7 percent, 17.1 percent, 18.1 percent and 31.7 percent respectively. However, revised standards will slightly increase the prototypical manufacturer's long-run return on equity at standard levels above level 2. Standard levels 1 through 8 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 0.4 percent, 0.4 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 0.8 percent, 1.6 percent, 1.7 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Furthermore, most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. Also, DOE based its assumptions for the prototypical firm strictly on information regarding water heater manufacturers. The Department seeks comments on how to better characterize a prototypical firm when heat pump water heaters are included in the mix of products. For example, it may be that room air conditioner manufacturers become the system manufacturer, with the water heater tank becoming a purchased part. In that case, at those levels where heat pumps are assumed, it may be reasonable to introduce some of the financial characteristics of the room air conditioner industry since the heat pumps in question are very similar to room air conditioners. B. Life-cycle cost and net present value . A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For the representative classes, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 8, the max tech level, for gas water heaters are less than the baseline unit. Of the eight candidate standard levels, units meeting levels 4 and 5 have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for electric water heaters and units meeting levels 3 and 4 have the lowest consumer life-cycle costs for gas water heaters. See Technical Support Document, Figures 4.2 and 4.1.
