Watanabe, leader of the LDP's third largest faction, said in a lecture that the government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "should not hate the LDP and (should realize that) it cannot live without asking help of the LDP from the front entrance." He apparently balked at coalition's attempt to lure the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to return to the coalition and pressed the government and the LDP leadership to promote cooperation between the LDP and the coalition. "The cabinet, with a support of only one-third (members) in the House of Representatives, could not stand for the people's view," Watanabe said. He said that there is the possibility that the LDP will propose a no-confidence motion against the cabinet following the Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 state budget. In April, Watanabe threatened to leave the LDP in a bid to seek the premiership, hoping to gain possible backing from some of the coalition. Despite the abortive bid for the premership, he has not lost his aspiration for power, saying in Saturday's lecture "if there are more stages to push through my own principles, I will do so."
