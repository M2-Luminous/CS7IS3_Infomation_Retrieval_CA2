"Our decisions were made in full accordance with the applicable Community regulations," the ministry states. "If the United States were to take retaliatory measures against France, it would be responsible for escalating tensions at the very time we are preparing the Marrakesh conference, which will make it possible to sign the GATT agreements and create a world trade organization. One might wonder whether that was a good signal to send," the ministry added. Yesterday, the United States officially threatened France that it would take retaliatory measures against it as a result of the severe sanitary controls applied by Paris on cargos of American fish. The American National Fisheries Institute estimated that losses for American fishermen, whose products have been turned back by the French health authorities since 5 February, total 1.2 million francs per week. Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Jean Puech accused the United States of exporting fish treated with a chemical substance used to retain water, which is illegal in France and throughout the European Union.
