The sources said that technical experts from the two countries will meet shortly to agree on the method of paying Syria's military debts, which total some $11 billion. This sum includes overdue payments totaling $1.5 billion owed to the former Soviet Union for weapons exported to Damascus. The sources went on to say that, "despite the two sides' agreement during the meeting early last month between Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and President Hafiz al-Asad on the principle of solving the problem, the two sides still have not solved it." The sources said: "We need tireless negotiations." Regarding the claim that Moscow has agreed to write off about 90 percent of the debts, the diplomatic sources said that "it is not an agreement. It was an offer made during the negotiations." The sources pointed out that the "Syrians wanted to pay about 8 percent of the debts in Syrian pounds or local commodities, but the Russians insisted that the Syrians make 20 percent of every payment in foreign currency." The sources said that the talks "are continuing between us and our friends in Damascus." In a statement to AL-HAYAH well informed Russian sources expected an agreement to be reached on writing off about 75 percent of the Russian debts, provided Syria pays the remaining 25 percent and the value of the deals between the two countries "in hard currency and immediately." The sources commended the military and trade agreements signed recently in Damascus during Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets' visit to the Syrian capital. The agreements provide for exporting spare parts for Syria's Russian weapons and Syrian factories. They also provide for Russian companies' participation in international tenders announced by Syrian public establishments, as well as participation in extracting Syrian phosphate. The Russian sources described what has been reached so far as "an achievement" compared with the situation a few years ago. They pointed out that "the differences were big" between the two sides with regard to resolving the debts issue. The Syrians linked it with the political role played by the former Soviet Union and with whether Russia is its heir. The sources said that the two sides have now agreed to solve the issue. They have also agreed that the Russian Federation is the heir of the Soviet state. They have agreed on separating the debts question from the other questions and from the political role Moscow is seeking to play in the peace process. The sources said that the CIS' agreement on its share in the Soviet Union's legacy has contributed to reaching an understanding with the Syrians. As for the Russian initiative to convene a "Madrid-2" and the active Russian role in the peace process, the sources said that Moscow is seeking "to compete with Washington in the peace negotiations." They said that the Russian role is leading to a balance, and "any balance is not going to hamper the peace process or cause any party to adopt a hard line. On the contrary, it will give the parties self-confidence and enable them to take courageous decisions."
