Their objective is to build dynamic management personalized systems of information flow inside enterprises and administrations, by making their applications, until now independent, communicate. These programs, which operate through DPX/20 (machines), have been accessible since the existence of UNIX platforms, G-COS 7 and 8 servers and IBM/MVS machines. To operate them Bull had set up a partnership program to which Syseca and Ibsi are already subscribers. For the industrial users and distributors Bull has officially launched PDM (Product Data Management)--the SGTD (Data Transmission Management System) result of its agreement with Metaphase--and Aris, an analysis, conception and planning tool for information systems restructuration. PDM and Aris are integral parts of the DCM model. Finally, the constructor has added the new electronic signature safety services to ISM (Integrated System Management).
