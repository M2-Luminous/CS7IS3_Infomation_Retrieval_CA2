MACT Floor Determination In a March 9, 1994, Federal Register notice reopening the public comment period for determination of ``MACT floor'' for NESHAP source categories (59 FR 11018), the Agency considered more than one interpretation of the statutory language concerning the MACT floor for existing sources and solicited comment on them. The MACT floor decision that the EPA will make on the basis of this March 9, 1994, notice will have broad precedential effects, and will presumptively be followed by the Agency in any rulemakings subsequently promulgated under Title III of the Act. The MACT floor determinations proposed in today's rulemaking may therefore be affected by the Agency's final interpretation of ``MACT floor.'' Sections 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act require that the EPA set standards no less stringent than ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources'' if there are at least 30 sources in a category, or ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 5 sources'' if there are fewer than 30 sources in a category. During the development of this proposed rule, the EPA considered two interpretations of this statutory language. One interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation achieved by'' together in a single phrase and asks what is the ``average emission limitation achieved by'' the best performing 12 percent. This interpretation places the emphasis on ``average.'' It would correspond to first identifying the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources, then determining the average emission limitation achieved by these sources as a group. Another interpretation groups the words ``average emission limitation'' into a single phrase and asks what ``average emission limitation'' is ``achieved by'' all members of the best performing 12 percent. In this case, the ``average emission limitation'' might be interpreted as the average reduction across the HAP emitted by an emission point over time. Under this interpretation, the EPA would look at the average emission limits achieved by each of the best performing 12 percent of existing sources, and take the lowest. This interpretation would correspond to the level of control achieved by the source at the 88th percentile if all sources were ranked from the most controlled (100th percentile) to the least controlled (1st percentile). For today's proposed regulation, the Administrator is using the first interpretation described above, which interprets the statutory language to mean that the MACT floor for existing sources should be set at the level of control achieved by the ``average'' of the best performing 12 percent. In establishing the MACT floor for today's proposed regulations, the EPA also considered two possible meanings for the word ``average'' as the term is used in section 112(d)(3) (A) and (B) of the Act. First, the EPA considered interpreting ``average'' as the arithmetic mean. The arithmetic mean of a set of measurements is the sum of the measurements divided by the number of measurements in the set. The EPA determined that the arithmetic mean of the emissions limitations achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources in some cases would yield an emission limitation that fails to correspond to the limitation achieved by any particular technology. In cases where this limitation existed, the EPA decided not to select this approach. The EPA also considered interpreting ``average'' as the median emission limitation value. The median is the value in a set of measurements below and above which there are an equal number of values (when the measurements are arranged in order of magnitude). For the subcategory of sources emitting 1 Mg/yr or more of HAP, the Agency determined that the derived arithmetic mean, for all practical purposes, is equivalent to recovery technologies and thus the Agency used the mean to determine the MACT floor for this subcategory. The EPA selected the median for the subcategory of sources emitting less than 1 Mg/yr of HAP because the arithmetic mean yields a value that does not correspond to a particular emission control technology. The EPA solicits comment on its interpretation of ``the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources'' (section 112(d)(3)(A) of the Act) and its methodology for determining the MACT floor. 9.
