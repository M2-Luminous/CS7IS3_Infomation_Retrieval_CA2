The incident indicated that early precaution was desperately needed in order to prevent such a tragedy from happening again. Serious incidents concerning safety problems that occurred in foreign-funded enterprises since the beginning of last year highlighted the urgent need for precautionary measures. Two separate fire cases occurred in a Hong Kong-funded factory in Kuiyong Township of Shenzhen and in a Taiwan-funded enterprise in Mawei in Fuzhou last November. A sudden collapse happened in a toy factory in Shaoguan of Shenzhen early this month. All these incidents were very shocking. Worries are aroused because there are so far over 100,000 foreign-funded enterprises in operation across China, and the safety problem is highlighted following these incidents. Surveys carried out by the Shenzhen authorities showed that several of these incidents were attributed to man-made factors which were in violation of regulations and law, while a survey conducted by the Fujian authorities went further to indicate that the safety problem facing foreign-funded enterprises was very serious, including the locking of fire exit, illegal occupation of staircase area, combination of warehouse and workshop and no separate storage of inflammable articles, which were often kept together with other items. The potentially dangerous situation, which had existed for a long time, mainly lay in several reasons. First, a rush of introduction of foreign capital led to a simplification of the procedures required, which in turn caused neglect of industrial safety. Second, it is difficult for supervision and law enforcement to be carried out because Chinese management personnel employed by a particular foreign-funded enterprise were not legitimately empowered to take care of safety affairs. Third, foreign-funded enterprises generally tended to re-construct their buildings in an unauthorized way, mainly out of consideration for profit making. Some foreign businessmen went further, ignoring safety of employees because they had their factories insured overseas.
