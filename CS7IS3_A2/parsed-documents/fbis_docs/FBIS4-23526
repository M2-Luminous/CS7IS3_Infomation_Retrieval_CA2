Destined to become part of South African legend is the "Armscor [Armament Corporation of South Africa] Man"...now hanging up his hat after 17 years of foot-in-the-door international canvassing to convince the world that South Africa needed military equipment and offering, in return, top-of-the-range systems to anyone with the capability to pay cash or barter. Like the cosmetics lady and the brush salesman, "Armscor Man" has on occasion been spectacularly successful, but has also, at the same time, endured a hard, long slog in representing a beleaguered armaments industry trying to reach out internationally during years of weapons sanctions imposed by the United Nations as part of the campaign to end apartheid. Last month, the UN decided apartheid had ended and, as a result, the imposition of crippling sanctions should also be terminated. That was, of course, due in no small measure to the stunning victory at the polls of President Mandela's ANC. -- The story of how Armscor -- the Armaments Corporation of South Africa -- developed its expertise in a number of fields will probably remain classified for years, but from what little is known the company has taken South Africa into the big league of arms manufacturers, exporters and procurers. -- Executive general manager Tielman de Waal went on record immediately after the lifting of sanctions as saying: "Armscor will be able to conduct its business in an open and transparent way. "We do not foresee that the lifting of the (UN) embargo will substantially change the procurement pattern of the past, except that foreign procurement will no longer have to be conducted in secret, and it can be conducted in a more cost-effective manner." The organisation is at pains to emphasise that its staff did not conduct highly secretive meetings in the back alleys of Baghdad, Casablanca or other such mysterious cities but rather "worked the room", as the saying goes, finally getting what it wanted in the boardrooms of the world. What has been acquired overseas remains a matter for conjecture. Armscor calls its acquisitions operations (or sales pitch, in plain English) the "value-for-money option", with expertise on tap to provide specialist guidance to ensure maximum cost-savings, without sacrificing quality and product capability. During the last five years, the organisation has made acquisitions totalling R30 billion [rand], the bulk of which has been for South Africa's defence force. Armscor says: "This was made possible through a well-developed system comprising dedicated teamwork, the highest technical expertise, strict financial discipline, advanced project management and marketing, quality assurance, logistical support and product-lifecycle management." Behind those claims are the men and women who have put South Africa at the cutting edge of international armaments, as well as of commercial products. Peet Smith, the company's general manager for import and export control, puts it rather quaintly: "We can assist in bringing the horse (the international client) and the water (the South African product) together. In the end, the attractiveness and the taste of the water will determine how much the horse is going to drink." The water has certainly been tested by many governments. Horses such as Iraq have liked our long-range artillery pieces, such as the G5 used in the Kuwaiti war and earlier in the 10-year battle between Iraq and Iran. Oman is buying Rooivalk attack helicopters, regarded as far more efficient than anything else on earth (Britain is evaluating the machine as well). Certain unnamed countries have battle-tested armoured equipment and mine-resistant vehicles, and assault rifles have been sold to many others. Also coming to light is how Armscor coped with the international leaders in the armaments field, as well as with the end of the Cold War, and what it has been doing since in the local and international markets. With the disintegration of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the end of Russian influence in Angola, the end of the total onslaught era and the abolition of apartheid, the organisation had to find something else to do other than sell weapons, which had suddenly become a dirty word in the maelstrom of international politics. It decided that to guarantee the survival of the highly focused local armaments industry, and at the same time ensure continuing state-of-the-art technology, adaptation was the name of the game. Armscor decided to split into two: the original company continuing to acquire armaments and related products and services, and the new firm -- known as Denel (Pty) Ltd, with a host of subsidiaries -- the manufacturer. During the 1980s, Armscor was a "fully fledged player in the international arms market", but was winning customers in the marketplace "through liaison at ministerial and other levels." As part of its legacy as an armaments organisation, Armscor at the end of March last year had paid R3.6 billion for armaments out of its share of the Special Defence Equipment and Activities Account (SDA) -- part of the R10 billion defence budget. The SDA is an account which, unlike many in other government departments, need not be fully spent during the fiscal year. Eighty percent of the money can be committed for the following year, and the year thereafter. Outstanding commitments on contract at that time stood at R4.2 billion and approved commitments not yet contracted totalled about R668 million, with a further R93 million in fixed assets with contractors. The effort now is concentrated on technological sophistication, which could in fact be of help in non-military products and processes, similar to the United States's space programme, which has helped bring many products to the consumer marketplace over the years.
