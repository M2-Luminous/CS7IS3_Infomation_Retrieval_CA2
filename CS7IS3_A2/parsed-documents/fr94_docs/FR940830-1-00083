ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Shore Protection Act of 1988 requires that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prescribe waste handling regulations for waste sources, receiving facilities, and vessels handling or transporting municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters. The EPA is requesting comments on these proposed regulations which: Require that waste sources, receiving facilities, and vessels provide the means and facilities to minimize waste deposited into coastal waters during loading, offloading, and transport; require the development, adoption, and, as appropriate, submission by each responsible party of an Operation and Maintenance manual identifying procedures to be used to prevent, report, and clean up any deposit of municipal or commercial waste into coastal waters, including record keeping requirements; and as necessary, require use of tracking systems to assure adequate enforcement of laws preventing the deposit of municipal or commercial waste into coastal waters. DATES: Written comments on the proposed rule must be received on or before October 31, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments on the proposed rule should be addressed to Waste Handling Practices Comment Clerk; Water Docket MC&hyph;4101, United States Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460. Comments should include the name and address of the person commenting, identify this proposed rule by name (Waste Handling Practices for Vessels and Waste Transfer Stations), and cite the specific section of the proposed rule to which each comment applies. Commenters are also requested to submit any references cited in their comments. Commenters are also requested to submit an original and three copies of their written comments and enclosures. Commenters who want receipt of their comments acknowledged should include a self-addressed, stamped envelope. All comments must be postmarked or delivered by hand by October 31, 1994.

Introduction On November 18, 1988, Congress enacted the Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601, Public Law 100&hyph;688, 102 Stat. 4139 hereinafter referred to as ``SPA'') to minimize trash, medical debris and other unsightly and potentially harmful materials from being deposited into the coastal waters of the United States as a result of inadequate waste handling procedures by vessels transporting wastes on U.S. coastal waters and associated loading and off-loading facilities. SPA is Title IV, Subtitle A of P.L. 100&hyph;688. The Congressional Conference Report on P.L. 100&hyph;688 stated that landfills and their attendant barging operations are a major source of floatable waste in harbor areas. The report concluded that this type of waste has fouled the beaches of this country on several occasions, reducing the quality of coastal waters, endangering the health of humans, marine mammals, waterfowl and fish, and causing severe declines in coastal economies dependent upon tourism and recreational uses. Section 4102 of SPA, titled Vessel Permits and Numbers, establishes that a vessel may not transport municipal or commercial waste in coastal waters without: (1) A permit from the Secretary of Transportation; and (2) displaying a number or other marking as prescribed by the Secretary under Chapter 123 of Section 12502(b) of Title 46, United States Code. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has promulgated an interim regulation on vessel permitting and vessel numbering system (33 CFR part 151, subpart B). Section 4103(a) of SPA requires owners and operators of waste sources, vessels transporting waste and waste receiving facilities to take all reasonable steps to minimize the amount of municipal or commercial waste deposited into coastal waters both during vessel loading and unloading operations, and during vessel transportation from a waste source to a receiving facility. EPA and DOT have been given authority to implement certain provisions of SPA. DOT is responsible for issuing permits to the appropriate vessels and for prescribing the number or marking which the vessel must display under section 4102 of SPA. EPA is responsible for developing the regulations, in consultation with DOT, which prescribe waste handling practices pursuant to section 4103(b) of SPA. This proposed rule, when promulgated, will fulfill EPA's obligation under SPA section 4103(b). DOT is responsible for enforcing SPA, although the Secretary of Transportation may authorize other officers or employees of the United States Government to enforce provisions of SPA under title 14 U.S.C. 89. The Secretary of Transportation has designated the United States Coast Guard (USCG) as the lead entity in implementing SPA on DOT's behalf. Vessel permits under SPA are issued by the USCG in accordance with 33 CFR part 151, subpart B. Under Sections 4102(d), (e) and 4104(a) of SPA, EPA has a consultation role on USCG permits and can request that the USCG deny, suspend or revoke a permit. Specifically, SPA section 4102(d) provides that DOT (USCG) and EPA can deny a permit if the owner or operator of a vessel has a record indicating a pattern of serious violations of any of the following statutes: The Shore Protection Act (33 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.); The Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.); The Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act of 1972 (33 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.); The Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 401 et seq.); or The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). SPA directs the USCG to provide a hearing process for denial, suspension or revocation of a permit. The EPA is proposing these regulations to set waste handling practices for municipal and commercial waste transported in U.S. coastal waters. SPA permits will require the permittee to comply with these EPA regulations when they are promulgated in final form.
