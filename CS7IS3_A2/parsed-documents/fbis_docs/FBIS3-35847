Nozhikov's Pointed Action"] [Text] Irkutsk Oblast has been forced to withhold payments to the social insurance and employment funds, as well as the federal budget. Irkutsk Oblast Administration Head Yuriy Nozhikov announced this Sunday evening. Withholding payments to the center, the administration head explained, will make it possible to concentrate finances so as to remove the strain of paying wages to budget-funded employees and resolve some other questions. "If this measure is not taken, the consequences will be grave," Yuriy Nozhikov emphasized.
