Tangun is the father of the Korean nation who was the first king of Kojoson (ancient Korea) (3,000 B.C.-108 B.C.). Situated in Kangdong County, Yongyang municipality, the 22 meter high tomb will occupy an area of over 800,000 square metres when reconstructed. The great leader President Kim Il-song personally studied the legend of Tangun and materials about his tomb and saw to it that the tomb was excavated. After the remains of Tangun and relics were excavated and identified scientifically, President Kim Il-song went out to the spot and gave instructions to rebuild the tomb splendidly to be handed down to the generations to come. Thus, Tangun who had long been known to be a mythical man was proved to have been a real man and the history of Kojoson distorted by the Japanese imperialists when they occupied Korea was established correctly. Under the wise guidance of President Kim Il-song, cultural heritages which had been severely destroyed by the U.S. and Japanese imperialist aggressors have been reconstructed to be preserved as treasures of the country and the nation. In recent years, the tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder of the Koguryo Dynasty (277 B.C.-668 A.D.) which was the strongest country in the East, the tomb of King Wang Kon, the first king of Koryo (918-1392) which was the first unified state in Korea, the tomb of King Kogukwon (a king of Koguryo in the middle of the 4th century), the tomb of King Kongmin (the 31st king of Koryo) and tombs of other kings have been restored to their original state. The Kwangbop temple in Mt. Taesong (392), the Pohyon temple in Mt. Myohyang (1042) and the Pyohun temple in Mt. Kumgano (670), Buddhist temples showing the equisite architecture of the Korean nation, and the wall on Mt. Taesong belonging to the Koguryo Dynasty and the wall on Mt. Ongbang belonging to the Koryo Dynasty and many other architectural heritages have been splendidly rehabilitated. The Songgyungwan Academy of Koryo (992), one of the first universities in the world, was recently rebuilt on an expansion basis to be turned into a university training light industrial technicians. The chronicles of the Yi Dynasty of 900 books in 1,763 volumes, the world largest governmental diary covering over 500 years of the feudal state of the Yi Dynasty, not omitting a single day, has been published in modern Korean language. The bibliographical book (25 volumes) of the "80,000 Blocks of Complete Collection of Buddhist Scriptures" of 6,793 volumes, a library of Buddhism belonging to the Koryo Dynasty, and the selected translation of major sutras of the collection have been published and a modern house for preserving the collection was built in the scenic Mt. Myohyang. Many classical books of history, culture, medical sceince and other fields such as "Tonguibogam", an encyclopedic book of Koryo medicine, "The History of the Three Dynasties" "History of the Koryo Dynasty", and "The Tale of Chun Hyang" have been collected and arranged.
