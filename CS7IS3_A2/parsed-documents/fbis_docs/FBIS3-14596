"All the evidence shows that Armenia is responsible for the tragedy, the most important of which is the fact that the site of the crash is occupied by Armenian forces," JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI said. The C-130 Hercules transport plane was carrying 13 crew members and 19 relatives of Iranian diplomats in Moscow when it crashed March 17 near Stepanakert, capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority enclave in Azerbaijan fighting for independence since 1988. The plane was on a flight from Moscow to Tehran. Armenians and Azerbaijanis have accused each other of shooting down the plane, but Tehran has remained silent pending an investigation. Iranian foreign ministry and air force experts have visited the crash site to investigate the incident. However, Tehran Radio said Sunday that the investigation committee had not been able to find the plane's black box. The team met Armenian Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan in Yerevan on Saturday and were to leave for Georgia on Sunday and then on to Azerbaijan to continue their investigation. A foreign ministry official said last week that the plane had exploded in mid-air, denying earlier reports that the crash resulted from technical problems. The daily JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, close to Islamic hardliners, criticised the ministry for keeping silent and urged it to "reveal the truth and not allow the Armenian crime to be eclipsed." It also urged the government to pressure the Armenians into accepting responsibility for the "crime" and compensating the relatives of the victims. Meanwhile, the English-language TEHRAN TIMES blamed the war over Nagorno-Karabakh for the "spilling of Iranian blood" in the crash and urged Armenians to show "goodwill" in accepting an Iranian-mediated settlement. More than 20,000 people have been killed in six years of fighting between Armenians and Azerbaijani forces. Iran has launched several peace initiatives but without success.
