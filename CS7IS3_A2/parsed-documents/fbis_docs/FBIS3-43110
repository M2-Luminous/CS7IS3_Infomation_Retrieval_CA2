Maykapar, Moscow; UDC 533.6.011.5] [Abstract] The importance of estimating the attainable lift-to-drag ratio and the facilities for increasing it in order to determine the aircraft shape which ensures the necessary lift-to-drag ratio at the design flight path section prompted an analysis of lift-to-drag ratios at supersonic velocities. To this end, flows behind a diagonal (oblique) shock and rarefaction wave are considered ignoring friction loss for a wing shaped as an infinite wedge and a triangular plate with supersonic leading edges. The advantages of an oblique wing over a delta wing are employed in a symmetric wing. The study shows that the lift-to-drag ratio of an infinite oblique plate may be considerably higher than that of triangular plates with subsonic, sonic, and supersonic edges whereby a wing with characteristic side edges is the simplest swept wing but only until the velocity component behind the shock normal to the edge reaches the speed of sound. Overall, a straight wedge with lateral washers is the optimum bearing airframe shape. Analyses shows that a combination of straight wedge airframe and plate wing produce a noticeable lift-to-drag ratio gain due to a lift redistribution between them.
