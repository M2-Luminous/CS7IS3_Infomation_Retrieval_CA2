But he said that "this decision is an act of political struggle and a challenge to the president and to the policy he is conducting. It cannot fail to act as a means of political destabilization." In Sobchak's view, "the point is not that people should be in prison; the main thing is that the actual crime should be condemned. "There is no doubt that a crime was committed on 3-4 October last year against the individual and the state, an armed rebellion that led to numerous fatalities. That fact cannot be erased by any amnesties at all." Anatoliy Sobchak recalled that the first draft constitution stated that an amnesty could be declared by the Federal Assembly, i.e. the State Duma and the Federation Council. Unfortunately, he said, in the final version of the Constitution, that stipulation fell by the wayside, and only the State Duma retained the right, which the opposition took advantage of. Nevertheless, St. Petersburg's mayor stressed, the State Duma had the right to declare an amnesty, and there are only a number of questions connected with the wording of the amnesty declaration. "It's one thing when it covers people who are involved in mass disorders; it's quite another thing when they are involved in violence and murder. That is precisely the charge brought against a whole string of participants in the events of October." According to Sobchak, an actual amnesty can be applied only to persons who are guilty of committing crimes. "But if they do not acknowledge their guilt, an amnesty cannot apply to them." This legal problem should have been resolved by the Procurator-General's office before the organizers of the October rebellion were released."
