FR940810-0-00288 FR940810-0-00021 (i) Vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters to collect all debris and dust containing ACM or PACM; and, (ii) Wet methods, or wetting agents, to control employee exposures during asbestos handling, mixing, removal, cutting, application, and cleanup, except where employers demonstrate that the use of wet methods is infeasible due to for example, the creation of electrical hazards, equipment malfunction, and, in roofing, slipping hazards; and (iii) Prompt clean-up and disposal of wastes and debris contaminated with asbestos in leak-tight containers. (2) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the employer shall use the following control methods to achieve compliance with the TWA permissible exposure limit and excursion limit prescribed by paragraph (c) of this section; (i) Local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter dust collection systems; (ii) Enclosure or isolation of processes producing asbestos dust; (iii) Ventilation of the regulated area to move contaminated air away from the breathing zone of employees and toward a filtration or collection device equipped with a HEPA filter; (iv) Use of other work practices and engineering controls that the Assistant Secretary can show to be feasible. (v) Wherever the feasible engineering and work practice controls described above are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the permissible exposure limit and/or excursion limit prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section, the employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels attainable by these controls and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (h) of this section. (3) Prohibitions. The following work practices and engineering controls shall not be used for work related to asbestos or for work which disturbs ACM or PACM, regardless of measured levels of asbestos exposure or the results of initial exposure assessments: (i) High-speed abrasive disc saws that are not equipped with point of cut ventilator or enclosures with HEPA filtered exhaust air. (ii) Compressed air used to remove asbestos, or materials containing asbestos, unless the compressed air is used in conjunction with an enclosed ventilation system designed to capture the dust cloud created by the compressed air. (iii) Dry sweeping, shoveling or other dry clean-up of dust and debris containing ACM and PACM. (iv) Employee rotation as a means of reducing employee exposure to asbestos. (4) Class I Requirements. In addition to the provisions of paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the following engineering controls and work practices and procedures shall be used. (i) All Class I work, including the installation and operation of the control system shall be supervised by a competent person as defined in paragraph (b) of this section; (ii) For all Class I jobs involving the removal of more than 25 linear or 10 square feet of thermal system insulation or surfacing material; for all other Class I jobs, where the employer cannot produce a negative exposure assessment pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section, or where employees are working in areas adjacent to the regulated area, while the Class I work is being performed, the employer shall use one of the following methods to ensure that airborne asbestos does not migrate from the regulated area: (A) Critical barriers shall be placed over all openings to the regulated area: or (B) The employer shall use another barrier or isolation method which prevents the migration of airborne asbestos from the regulated area, as verified by perimeter area surveillance during each work shift at each boundary of the regulated area, showing no visible asbestos dust; and perimeter area monitoring showing that clearance levels contained in 40 CFR Part 763, Subpt. E, of the EPA Asbestos in Schools Rule are met, or that perimeter area levels, measured by (PCM) are no more than background levels representing the same area before the asbestos work began. The results of such monitoring shall be made known to the employer no later than 24 hours from the end of the work shift represented by such monitoring. (iii) For all Class I jobs, HVAC systems shall be isolated in the regulated area by sealing with a double layer of 6 mil plastic or the equivalent; (iv) For all Class I jobs, impermeable dropcloths shall be placed on surfaces beneath all removal activity; (v) For all Class I jobs, all objects within the regulated area shall be covered with impermeable dropcloths or plastic sheeting which is secured by duct tape or an equivalent. (vi) For all Class I jobs where the employer cannot produce a negative exposure assessment, or where exposure monitoring shows that a PEL is exceeded, the employer shall ventilate the regulated area to move contaminated air away from the breathing zone of employees toward a HEPA filtration or collection device. (5) Specific control methods for Class I work. In addition, Class I asbestos work shall be performed using one or more of the following control methods pursuant to the limitations stated below: (i) Negative Pressure Enclosure (NPE) systems: NPE systems shall be used where the configuration of the work area does not make the erection of the enclosure infeasible, with the following specifications and work practices. (A) Specifications: ( 1 ) The negative pressure enclosure (NPE) may be of any configuration, ( 2 ) At least 4 air changes per hour shall be maintained in the NPE,
