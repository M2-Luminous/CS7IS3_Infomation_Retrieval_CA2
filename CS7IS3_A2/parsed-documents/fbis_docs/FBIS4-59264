In the opposition's absence, the prime minister's speech was endorsed by a majority of 52 versus zero opponents. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht notes that some opposition MK's, including Dan Meridor, Beni Begin, Yitzhaq Shamir, and David Levi, were sharply opposed to abandoning the plenum. They maintained that the step is a violation of parliamentary rules. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who closed the debate, said that in the Likud era, 120,000 Palestinians were locked up in prisons, which were schools for nationalism and the reason for the emergence of a Palestinian nation and a Palestinian entity in Gaza.
