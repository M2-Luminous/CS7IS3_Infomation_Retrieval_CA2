The bishops criticized the conditions being imposed on some branches of government and asserted that this pressure is also undermining the legitimacy of the future constitution. The Church's pronouncement topped a tension-filled day on which one Supreme Court justice repelled an attack by President Menem, who in Tokyo had called for his resignation, and the retirement of another justice of the court was postponed indefinitely. The Supreme Court handed down a judgment declaring that a Constituent Assembly cannot have unlimited powers. The Catholic Church affirmed yesterday that the efforts made so far to bring about constitutional reform are characterized by "conditions imposed on the constituent branches of government that compromise their actions," which "threatens the legitimacy and permanence of a future constitution." The Church's position was publicized in a document released yesterday at the conclusion of deliberations by the Permanent Commission of the Episcopate. The bishops exhorted those responsible for the constitutional reform process "to make their intentions, motives, and procedures transparent so that the constitution that emerges will be the expression of a true social pact." Without mentioning the protagonists, but alluding to the pressures the executive branch has exerted on Congress and the judiciary, among other issues, the bishops' communique mentioned the political coercion that took place on Tuesday with the removal of the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Antonio Boggiano, and on Wednesday with the resignation of Justice Rodolfo Barra. Yesterday's is the first official document issued by the Catholic Church regarding the constitutional reform, and it comes more than three months before the opinion of the Church is expected to be made public. The first draft of that document is being prepared by a committee chaired by Cardinal Raul Primatesta. In just 35 lines, the Episcopate sums up ecclesiastical displeasure with the current negotiations on the reform. After mentioning the conditions imposed on the branches of government, the document points out that they also compromise "the responsibility of the legislators, the stability of the judges, and even the legitimacy and permanence of the future constitution." The bishops briefly praised the political dialogue, and then focused on the formal aspect of the reform negotiations undertaken by the Justicialist Party (PJ) and the Radical Civic Union (UCR). The Permanent Commission is an entity chaired by Cardinal Quarracino that makes decisions in representation of the plenary assembly. The statement shows signs of the internal debate that is going on in the Church. This controversy was not apparent at the October assembly, when the bishops merely described the basic dogmatic themes without alluding to any current issues. The statement of 27 October noted that "the Constitution itself governs the procedures for its eventual reform" at a time when the political cauldron was boiling because the government was trying to move forward with the amendment of the Constitution with just two-thirds of the members present in Congress. The Olivos accord between President Carlos Menem and Radical leader Raul Alfonsin forced the committee headed by Primatesta to rethink its position. The committee, also made up of Bishops Emilio Bianchi Di Carcano (Azul), Jose Maria Arancedo (Mar del Plata), and Juan Carlos Maccarone (Lomas de Zamora), decided to release part of the draft early. Signals also came from other prelates, such as Edgardo Storni, archbishop of Santa Fe, who termed the agreement between Menem and Alfonsin on constitutional reform "unethical." "The only goal is reelection, and to achieve it, they throw out crumbs of power to maintain themselves as the political class," said Storni in a harsh tone not usually heard in Church officials. Yesterday's statement from the bishops recalled that "any agreement should be a step forward, and should in and of itself mean the creation of a propitious environment for a fruitful debate on the issues involved in the common good and the requirements for true democracy." This first official opinion on the reform from the episcopal leadership contends that "the Argentine people are not very familiar with the reform proposals or their motivations," and that, on the other hand, "they desire a decent future in a united society." The document also states that the desire for reform "should not distract government officials or the governed from daily attention to the tasks that ensure life and the quality of life for all inhabitants." Another thrust, this one aimed at emphasizing that "the leaders' political skill must be supported by exemplary ethical standards, which become more and more necessary as the consequences of their decisions become more serious for the country."
