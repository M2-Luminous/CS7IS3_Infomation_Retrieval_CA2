Howe, who arrived here Friday for an eight-day China visit, said he had made clear in a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji that "an Australian citizen being held and not charged is unacceptable." Zhu had acknowledged it was "a poor reflection of the (Chinese judicial) system" and pledged to do his best to resolve the issue, but stressed that Peng's suspected involvement in corruption was "very serious," Howe told journalists. His understanding was that charges would be brought soon, he said. Peng, 35, was seized by police in Macao in October and then handed over to Chinese police. He has since been held in the Meiling Detention Centre in the southern city of Shenzhen. Under Chinese law, suspects may be held for no longer than five months without charges. Howe said he had discussed human rights more broadly during a meeting with Chinese Premier Li Peng on Monday, but acknowledged that the talks had not progressed beyond a "philosophical" debate on the importance of mutual concern for problems in each other's countries. The official said the overall development of bilateral relations remained limited by this "inability to communicate effectively around the issue of human rights." He received little response when he reiterated Canberra's long-standing invitation for a Chinese human rights delegation to visit Australia. On China's nuclear test last Friday, Howe said he had once again expressed Australia's concern, telling his Chinese interlocuters that such actions were inconsistent with Beijing's commitment to move towards a test ban by 1996. Chinese officials responded by reiterating that other nuclear powers had carried out many more tests and that the ball was in their court to reduce their stocks to achieve "a situation of parity," Howe said, predicting that more Chinese tests may well be in the pipeline. During Howe's visit the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding on the potential of cooperation in the construction sector. How is to travel to Shanghai after visiting Yantai in northeastern Shandong province. He is to attend the signing in Shanghai of a joint venture agreement to manufacture steel building rods. Howe was to leave Beijing for Yantai Monday evening.
