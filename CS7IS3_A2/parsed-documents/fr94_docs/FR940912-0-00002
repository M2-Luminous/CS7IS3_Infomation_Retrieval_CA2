FR940912-0-00002 FR940912-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service 7 CFR Part 301 [Docket No. 94&hyph;034&hyph;2] Pink Bollworm Regulated Areas AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document makes final an interim rule that amended the pink bollworm regulations by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas, Concordia Parish in Louisiana, and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas, and removing Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined because of the pink bollworm. The interim rule was necessary to relieve restrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles from certain previously regulated areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Sidney E. Cousins, Senior Operations Officer, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, room 643, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;6365. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In an interim rule effective and published in the Federal Register on May 31, 1994 (59 FR 27965&hyph;27966, Docket No. 94&hyph;034&hyph;1), we amended the pink bollworm regulations in 7 CFR part 301 by removing Craighead, Cross, Greene, Monroe, Poinsett, and St. Francis Counties in Arkansas; Concordia Parish in Louisiana and Washington County in Mississippi from the list of suppressive areas in ยง301.52&hyph;2a. We also stated that the interim rule would remove Louisiana and Mississippi from the list of States quarantined to prevent the spread of the pink bollworm since there would not be any areas in those States regulated because of the pink bollworm. We stated that change would affect ยง301.52&hyph;2a; it should have stated it would affect ยง301.52(a). However, we inadvertently left that action out of the amendatory section of the interim rule. This final rule corrects that omission. Comments on the interim rule were required to be received on or before August 1, 1994. We did not receive any comments by that date. The facts presented in the interim rule still provide a basis for the rule. This action also affirms the information contained in the interim rule concerning Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Orders 12372 and 12778, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. Further, for this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the review process required by Executive Order 12866. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301 Agricultural commodities, Plant diseases and pests, Quarantine, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Transportation. Accordingly, the interim rule that amended 7 CFR 301.52&hyph;2a and that was published at 59 FR 27965&hyph;27966 on May 31, 1994, is adopted as a final rule with the following changes: PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES 1.
