I now welcome on the telephone Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Good morning, Herr Kinkel. [Kinkel] Good morning, Frau [name indistinct]. [Announcer] Clinton and Yeltsin decided yesterday not to target their long-range missiles at each other but toward the sea. How do you evaluate this decision? [Kinkel] Extraordinarily positive. Everything that contributes toward reducing tension and disarmament as a whole can only be profoundly welcomed by us. I am pleased that the U.S. President went directly to Russia following the NATO summit. I welcome greatly the agreement due to be reached today with Ukraine as well. That is quite an important area of tension, particularly between Russia and Ukraine: the question of nuclear arms, the question of the fleet... [Announcer, interrupting] Perhaps we will come to that in a moment... [Kinkel, interrupting] There was at least a solution to part of this. [Announcer] Is the agreement between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton also a first step toward ending the doctrine of deterrence, Herr Kinkel, or is it more a matter of cosmetics, because the missiles can be retargeted very quickly? [Kinkel] No, I don't think that is a cosmetic move. Rather it is a sign that We can say goodbye to the East-West conflict. It is very, very important that the two countries, the United States and Russia, understand each other well, and I am very pleased that the U.S. Government is quite obviously making great efforts to involve the still great and important Russia in all significant and important issues, particularly in the security of Europe. [Announcer] Is Russia still a superpower? [Kinkel] Russia was a world power and it still has huge dimensions, 50 times as large as unified Germany, twice as many people, and a huge country. [Announcer] Was the atmosphere at the talks between Clinton and Yeltsin, the careful NATO approach on new members in Brussels, justified in your view, Herr Kinkel? [Kinkel] I think it was. That was our policy, too. Again and again I have pointed out that we need a new security structure in Europe, that we must not create any new breaks or rifts, that we must make a balanced effort to meet the security needs of the Central and East European states on the one hand, and also meet the interests of Russia and Ukraine on the other hand, and I believe the decisions made in Brussels represent a good and important beginning. [Announcer] How would you describe the position of Yeltsin in Moscow, who must proceed carefully and who does not exactly have a stable majority? [Kinkel] Well, I think it is a success in the first place that there were elections, it is a success that the Constitution was adopted. Now we must hope that the forces of reform are successful against the extremists, who gained astonishingly good results in the Duma elections. I am working on the assumption that the forces for reform will win the day; we will support them, we must support them, so that the process there toward democracy and a market economy becomes irreversible. [Announcer] Is it right then that President Bill Clinton should not talk to Zhirinovskiy, should avoid him? [Kinkel] I think that is absolutely right. [Announcer] Let us turn to the nuclear renunciation treaty with the Ukraine, Herr Kinkel. How do you evaluate the signing today, if it actually happens, after all it is not absolutely certain. [Kinkel] That will be a very, very important step toward the pacification of that region. During my visit to Russia on 19 and 20 December I remarked to my opposite number, Kozyrev, how much Russian-Ukrainian relations were burdened by the SS-18 and SS-24 missiles, and by the issue of the fleet in Sevastopol. We were always the ones who strongly urged that Ukraine should sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This would be a great step forward, one we should not underestimate, and which I welcome very much. [Announcer] Herr Kinkel, in view of the fact that the agreement still has to be approved by the Ukrainian Parliament, how reliable is a signature on such a controversial document against the background of political conditions, which are still unstable? [Kinkel] Well, Mr. Kravchuk thinks he can get the treaty through Parliament. It is no secret that there are very conservative forces in the Ukrainian Parliament, and it may well be that one or the other, as in the past, will attempt to speak against it. I hope that won't happen, I hope that the treaty gets through. [Announcer] What does the Ukrainian renunciation mean from your point of view for the debate on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons? [Kinkel] It is quite a decisive step forward. One should not forget that Ukraine is still a country with a population of 350 million, the third largest nuclear power. Ukraine has enormous economic difficulties and has quite obviously insisted on keeping its nuclear arsenal as a bargaining counter. We must see to it very quickly that we help not only Russia but also Ukraine. We need a cooperation treaty with the European Union and we must do all we can bilaterally as well. You see, the foreign ministers at the NATO meeting in Brussels pushed extremely strongly for dealing with Ukraine. The economic conditions there are much, much more difficult than here. I constantly remind people that the hourly wage here is worth half a day's wages in Leipzig, a day's wages in Budapest, a month's wages in Breslau [Wroclaw], and the same in Ukraine, so you see the economic comparison. [Announcer] What is the time span for such aid, realistically, because several have to sit down at one table together? [Kinkel] It has to be soon. [Announcer] When is soon? [Kinkel] I cannot give you a timeframe in which that will happen. Such processes are difficult, it is a problem for the G-7, it is a problem for the Europeans. I have pointed to the cooperation treaty we are concluding with Russia -- we also need one with Ukraine. We must do bilaterally all we can. And I must say others will have to do their bit. I am pleased that the U.S. President has made such major promises. I would point out that we have already pumped in over 80 billion German marks into the former Soviet Union, mainly of course into Russia and Ukraine. We have done by far the most -- 53 percent of aid so far comes from Germany. We do not have to put our light under a bushel, the others should do their bit, too.
