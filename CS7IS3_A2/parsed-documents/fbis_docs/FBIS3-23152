[Fadlallah] Lebanon's stance regarding the compromise is closely linked to that of Syria, and therefore, Lebanon will not sign anything before Syria does. This is because there is an agreement between Syria and Lebanon on the basis of which the Lebanese Government will not sign any accord with Israel unless it has been previously agreed to by Syria. [KEYHAN] What steps will the Lebanese Islamic Movement, especially Hizballah, take against the signing of a compromising accord by Syria or Lebanon? [Fadlallah] It is obvious that in such circumstances, the Islamic Movement will be forced to appraise the situation in a precise and perceptive manner. This is because in that case, it will have to reappraise and assess the situation from its own vantage point and stance and to view the outcome and repercussions of such a step on the Islamic Movement. Of course, this will be affected by changing circumstances and certain exigencies. However, it is natural that we will not endorse any accord between Israel and Arab countries. Even if such an accord takes place, we will continue our opposition but the tactics and means of combatting such an accord or the fallout of this opposition or its expression will all depend on the conditions and exigencies that arise, and the Islamists will appraise them with regard to the interests of Islam in general. This is exactly the same as the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran which has repeatedly expressed its overt opposition to the official recognition of Israel and has even stressed that it will not directly deal with those who have compromised. [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] At present, the strategy of the White House is to eliminate the Islamic Movement in the Middle East and from the countries contiguous to the Zionist regime. It appears that the compromising accord between the Zionist regime and the PLO can be considered a step in this direction. What is the modus operandi envisaged by the Islamic Movement in combatting such a strategy? [Fadlallah] In my opinion, the United States cannot eliminate the Islamic Movement from the region, as the White House does not have the necessary means to do so. We observe that the U.S. foreign policy has encountered many obstructions and complexities in numerous countries in such a manner that it has been unable to implement its policies there. We do not consider the United States to be very versatile in the region. This is because the nations still have freedom of action to the extent that if they cannot defeat the policies of the White House, they can at least disrupt them. In addition, I do not believe that the United States has envisaged the elimination of the Islamic Movement in its current calculations. Instead, it appears that the United States is moving along two lines. The first line is to approach the Islamic Movement and to explore possibilities of establishing contact with it. This is evident from the current efforts being made to establish relations with the Egyptian Islamic movement. The second line involves U.S. efforts to undermine the Islamic Movement for its ultimate disarmament and embargo. This is because the United States is not able to eliminate the Islamic Movement which has such deep roots among the Islamic masses. I believe that the Islamists will gain more popular support as a result of the U.S. pressure and thus the White House's pressure will not be able to undermine the Islamic Movement. [KEYHAN] The people of southern Lebanon are still being subjected to daily attacks by the Zionists. In the event of an accord between the Zionists and Lebanon what will be the fate of southern Lebanon? [Fadlallah] [passage omitted] Obviously, southern Lebanon is suffering from daily savage attacks on southern Lebanon and this is why the Islamic Resistance Movement came into being, that is, in order to prove a firm impediment to the domination of the Zionists on southern Lebanon. If this Resistance Movement had not been active in southern Lebanon, the Zionists would have occupied all of southern Lebanon by various means. [passage omitted] We, in the Arab world, and in the Islamic Republic of Iran, should be very vigilant [passage omitted] because once the Arab-Zionist compromise takes effect, then precise planning for exerting pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran from the economic and security point of view will be carried out. The Arabs may be incited through various means to impose an embargo on Iran. In this regard, the American lackeys, especially the countries in Iran's neighborhood, will be enlisted to put more pressure on Iran. [KEYHAN] Recently, Turkey announced that it is willing to cooperate with Israel in order to combat terrorism. [Fadlallah] Of course, by terrorism they mean the liberation movements in the area. [passage omitted] [KEYHAN] What is your message to the Iranian nation? [Fadlallah] My message to the Muslim Iranian nation on the 15th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution is that Imam Khomeyni -- may God be pleased with him -- was able to deal a blow to the powers of world arrogance with the support and the steadfastness of your nation. When the Iranian nation stood alongside the imam the Islamic world and the oppressed of the world stood by you and the imam. I believe that the Islamic Republic of Iran is a divine trust for the Muslim people of Iran. I hope that God Almighty bestows this bounty on us as well. [passage omitted] I consider His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i to be a personality endowed with immense acumen and exceptional qualities that are necessary for Islamic leadership. He has immense knowledge of the international issues, especially of the Islamic world which he studies and follows intensively and continually. I believe that the Muslim nation of Iran and the other Muslim nations who follow him provide that strength which is necessary for such leadership and for combatting the plots and designs of the infidels and the powers of world arrogance.
