According to Churin, the agreement is the first of its kind between Thailand and Vietnam's Public Health Ministry on the registration (patent) of medicines in both countries. "This will help protect the trademarks of Thai medicines, and its import process (into Vietnam) will be convenient, too," said Churin who just returned from an official visit to Vietnam. By signing the agreements with Vietnam and holding talks with two major Vietnamese medicine importers, Churin is hopeful that Thai medicine will be able to tap the Vietnamese medicine market estimated at around 20 billion baht annually. Another agreement that the deputy commerce minister has entered into with Vietnam's Commerce Ministry is on intellectual property rights. Churin said that Thailand plans to enter into similar agreements with all the Indochinese countries, Myanmar [Burma] and China. After agreements are made with all these countries, Thailand will host a meeting among these countries about property rights and copyrights. While in Vietnam, the Thai deputy minister also held talks with Vietnamese commerce ministry officials on the rice issue. Both Thailand and Vietnam produce about three million tons of low-quality rice, so both countries have to compete in the world market. To avoid fierce competition, Jurin has invited the Vietnamese commerce minister to talks in Bangkok.
