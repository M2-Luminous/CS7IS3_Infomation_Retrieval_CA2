She thinks that following its Congress the FSLN "has an opportunity to draft a better program for the 1996 elections. We now have all the necessary elements for establishing a new party that will create more democratic possibilities." Baltodano added, however, that the idea is not to subtract from but to add to the party. When asked about the possible removal of certain cadres from the party, Monica Baltodano admitted that there will be "some separations, but only of mid-level cadres, not of national figures." "Any defeat involves frustrations and negative responses," Baltodano noted. She added that the group which until yesterday was called Current of the Majorities suffered "a political defeat." Baltodano rejected any possibility of implementing a policy of "revenge" against those she termed political losers. "If we were not vengeful toward the Somozist guardsmen, how can we be vengeful against companeros in our own ranks?" The Media Baltadano said the ambiguous ownership of certain media such as Radio Ya and Canal Cuatro will be among the topics discussed at the new Sandinist Assembly. Reporter William Roiz asked Baltodano whether there will be changes in BARRICADA. She replied: "Definitely, because most of the new DN members think BARRICADA's editorial policy should be changed. We will discuss it in the next few days, but by no means are we talking about a sweep." [BARRICADA Director] Carlos Fernando Chamorro was on Canal Dos' "Good Morning" program yesterday, and a viewer called to ask about his possible dismissal in view of Baltadano's statements. "Is that the democracy of Sandinism you have spoken about?" the viewer asked. Chamorro replied that he had not heard Baltodano's statements so he could not answer the question. "I refuse to believe this is true. But if it is, the alleged unity and democracy proclaimed at the Congress would be a complete farce," he added. Chamorro admitted, however, that there are profound differences of opinion about the media. "Some think that newspapers such as BARRICADA should be para-partisan [parapartidario] instruments of power subject to the party's control. I think BARRICADA is a democratic newspaper that has gained broad credibility in this country and that it must endure without becoming a propaganda tool again," he added. Doris Tijerino Speaks Out Doris Tijerino, who was not elected to the DN despite having been nominated by nearly all departments, said the Congress achieved some important things, including electing women to 30 percent of the positions and a high Atlantic Coast representation. "Most importantly, for the first time there were currents with different positions voicing their views. This had never happened in the FSLN before, but that doesn't mean the unity was broken," Tijerino said. She added that more needs to be done in terms of tolerance of political ideas. As for her exclusion from the DN, Tijerino said the Congress delegates were not wearing a straitjacket, and although much was said about respecting the results of consultations with the rank and file, "the decisions of the Congress are sovereign, and I respect them." Contrary to Baltodano's claim that one current dealt a "political defeat" to another, Tijerino said that "when two different ideas clash within a party, the goal is to find the truth, not to defeat each other. Commander Baltodano's assessment was wrong," Tijerino added.
