The French Defense Ministry said a total of six Serbian Galeb jets were in the process of shelling a weapons factory near the central Bosnian town of Vitez when NATO warplanes intervened and downed four of the aircraft. A NATO spokesman here said the six Serbian aircraft had ignored orders to land and four of them were shot down at 0548 GMT by the two U.S. F-16 Flying Falcons which fired six missiles and then safely returned to their base in Aviano, Italy. "The NATO pilots issued, in accordance with their rules of engagement, two `land or be engaged' orders to the aircraft, which ignored them," a NATO communique issued in Italy said. "The NATO Flying Falcons engaged the planes, shooting down four of them." [passage omitted] In Sarajevo, UN sources said one of the Galeb aircraft was shot down over the central town of Zenica after taking off from Banja Luka. A Serb military official in Banja Luka said, "we cannot either confirm or deny for the time being" that any Serb jets had been shot down, and he asserted that Serb planes had abided by operation Deny Flight. NATO aircraft have been flying daily sorties over Bosnia since April 1993 to enforce UN resolution 816 banning all unauthorized flights over the war-torn former Yugoslav republic. The UN ban has however been repeatedly been violated by Serb aircraft. The NATO spokesman said Resolution 816 authorized "all necessary measures" to ensure respect of the no-flight ban. In Athens, Liberis told journalists that he regretted the shooting down of the Serb planes and said the incident "justifies our decision not to be involved in any military operations in Bosnia." He recalled that Greek crews had been pulled out of allied AWACS radar planes after Athens dissociated itself from a NATO ultimatum threatening air strikes against all heavy weapons not withdrawn from around Sarajevo or placed under UN control by February 21. Pressured by this ultimatum, Bosnian Serb forces besieging Sarajevo and mainly Moslem Bosnian army declared a ceasefire on February 9, the same day the NATO deadline was issued. A spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said in Sarajevo that the humanitarian airlift into the Bosnian capital and all movements to Serb-controlled areas were being suspended in the wake of the downing of the four Serbian aircraft.
