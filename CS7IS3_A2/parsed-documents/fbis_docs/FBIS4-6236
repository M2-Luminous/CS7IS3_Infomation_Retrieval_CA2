College students in Seoul and Kwangju Districts have staged violent anti-U.S. demonstrations, chanting slogans such as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!" According to Seoul radio reports, on 19 April, the college students in Seoul and Kwangju waged violent demonstration struggles, protesting the arrival of Patriot missiles in the port of Pusan and U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's junket to Seoul. In Seoul, a group of students, breaking a tight police cordon, waged a demonstration struggle in front of the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, chanting anti-U.S. slogans with placards such as "We hate Patriots!" and "We hate Perry!" In the meantime, on the morning of 19 April, some 500 members of the Kwangju Chonnam District General Student Council staged a protest rally in front of the Kwangju American Cultural Center. Branding the U.S. defense secretary's junket to Seoul and the deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea as a criminal act of increasing the danger of war, the students threw some 200 bottles of paint at the American Cultural Center building. The puppet clique, perplexed by the students' strong protests, mobilized numerous combat policemen to brutally suppress the student demonstrators. However, the demonstrators did not yield to this and continued their struggle, chanting slogans calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces.
