This represents an increase of 12.7 percent over the same period last year calculated in accordance with comparable prices. However, if adjustments for seasonal factors in the first quarter caused by the low ratio of agriculture and the high ratio of industry are made, and if the growth rate is converted into an annual rate, the current economic growth rate is between 9 and 10 percent, the range sought after through the exercise of macroeconomic regulation and control. According to an authoritative analysis and appraisal, while maintaining an appropriate growth rate, China's economy is approaching the target sought after through macroeconomic regulation and control. The economic operation indicator [ping fen zhi 6097 0433 0237] has shifted from the border line between the "green and yellow lights" at the end of 1992 to the border line between the "yellow and green lights" at present. Judging from the internal structure of the economy, production, construction, and marketing, which have been growing at an excessive rate, have slowed down somewhat. The statistical data reveal that in industrial production, the added value of industry in the first quarter was 533 billion yuan, up 16 percent over the same period last year. Heavy industry increased 15.3 percent, and light industry rose by 16.8 percent. Coastal areas in the east maintained their lead in growth rates. Because of the fall in industrial production, the strained situation in the supply of energy and raw and semifinished materials and in transportation was alleviated to varying degrees. In fixed asset investment, state-owned units invested 81.5 billion yuan in the first quarter, up 36.2 percent over the same period last year, but the growth rate is 34.5 percentage points lower than the same period last year. Judging from the investment pattern: first, the growth of localized investment items has slightly declined, while centralized items maintained a quicker growth rate; second, transportation, postal, and telecommunications projects were strengthened; and third, as a result of efforts to streamline the real estate industry, the chaotic situation in which development zones, high-class villas, and vacation villages were recklessly undertaken has been checked. According to the statistics, as a whole, market sales in the first quarter remained stable but declined slightly. The total sales of consumer goods amounted to 352.2 billion yuan, up 25.2 percent over the same period last year -- or an actual increase of 4.2 percent after allowing for price rises, a growth rate lower than the average rate of a normal year by 3 to 4 percent points. At present, except for a few agricultural and sideline products whose supply is slightly short of demand, about 90 percent of the other commodities remain in a condition in which supply and demand are basically balanced or supply surpasses demand. At the same time, along with the development of the rural and urban economy and the increase in the wages of the workers of administrative departments and institutions, the income and living conditions of the urban and rural population have improved. In the first quarter of this year, the average amount of per-capita income that city dwellers used for living expenses increased 35.5 percent over the same period last year and the average net cash income of the rural population rose by 31.1 percent, an actual increase of 9.3 percent and 13.1 percent, respectively, after allowing for price rises. The operation of the economy shows that the reform of finance, taxation, banking, and foreign trade which the state introduced from the beginning of this year has advanced smoothly and that the economy is basically normal. Export growth has accelerated; the exchange rates have remained basically stable; there has been an increase in the balance of the nation's spot exchange; and more money has been withdrawn from circulation. In the first quarter of this year, loans granted by banks to support industrial and agricultural production and key state construction projects amounted to 35.1 billion yuan. New bank deposits totaled 207.2 billion yuan, of which 186.3 billion yuan are savings deposits by urban and rural residents. The currency issued prior to the Spring Festival was totally recovered from circulation by the end of March. Revenue income increased steadily, and expenditures were basically normal. In the first quarter, revenues rose by 21.4 percent, while expenditures increased 23.8 percent.
