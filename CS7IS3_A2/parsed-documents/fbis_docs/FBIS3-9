Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-04MAR94-CHINA-UK-HK China-UK-Hong Kong Beijing Rejects Political Compromise, Plays Down Economic Threats SUMMARY PRC authoritative media have reacted strongly to the Hong Kong Legislative Council (Legco)'s adoption of the first stage of Governor Christopher Patten's democratic reforms and to a Hong Kong government "White Paper" on the contents of the aborted 1993 China-British talks, ruling out further negotiations with the British and reaffirming China's previous decision to dismantle any political institutions based on Patten's reforms after 1997. At the same time, in an apparent effort to reassure foreign investors and avoid actions that could jeopardize the European Community's support for Beijing's GATT application, PRC media have portrayed senior Chinese leaders as backing away from recent threats to retaliate against British firms. END SUMMARY Beijing's rejection of further negotiations with Britain over Hong Kong's political future was authoritatively conveyed by a spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council on 24 February and reaffirmed by a Foreign Ministry spokesman the same day. The Chinese were reacting to the passage by Legco on 24 February of the first stage of Patten's political reforms and Patten's announcement the same day that he would formally submit the remainder of his reforms to Legco on 9 March and would publish a White Paper on the contents of the 17 rounds of talks with the PRC in 1993 on Hong Kong's political future (Hong Kong Asia television, 24 February). Asserting that Beijing would make good on its previous threats to terminate negotiations and dismantle political institutions established without Chinese consent if Legco adopted Patten's proposals, the Foreign Ministry spokesman declared that "the door of the negotiations has been closed by the British side" and "the framework of the political system" established by Legco "cannot last beyond June 30, 1997." Responsibility for "the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain" on this issue, he said, "rests entirely with the British" (Xinhua, 24 February). Signaling Beijing's determination to accelerate plans to establish its own institutions to govern Hong Kong after the takeover, Premier Li Peng declared on 25 February during a session with members of the Preliminary Work Committee (PWC)--a group established last summer under the National People's Congress to prepare for the Hong Kong transition--that the "PWC's burdens and responsibilities have become even heavier and greater" and called upon the members to "work harder and make even greater contributions to Hong Kong's long-standing stability and prosperity" (Xinhua). Similarly, Lu Ping, director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office, warned that the British were "trying to mislead Hong Kong people" by "spreading the view" that the Hong Kong government based on Patten's reforms "will not be terminated after 1 July 1997" and called for "speeding up the working pace of the PWC" (Zhongguo Xinwen She, 26 February) Countering the White Paper In an apparent effort to bolster its political support in Hong Kong, the PRC also mounted a media campaign to discredit the British White Paper's version of the 1993 talks, first attacking its credibility and Patten's motives, then issuing its own version of the talks on 28 February (Xinhua). Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of Xinhua's Hong Kong branch, said in a 24 February interview that Britain's "unilateral move" to publicize its version of the negotiations was intended to "deceive Hong Kong people and mislead public opinion" (Xinhua). On 28 February, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, commenting on a lengthy Foreign Ministry version of what he claimed were the "facts" concerning the talks, asserted that Patten's decision to publish the White Paper was "designed" to "shirk its responsibility for the rupture of the talks" (Xinhua, 28 February). In the text of the document, publicized by Xinhua that day, Beijing reiterated its position that the "core of the controversy" was not about "whether democracy should be promoted" as claimed by the British but "whether international commitments should be honored." Economic Reprisals Played Down Despite the current political deadlock between the Chinese and British over Hong Kong's political future, Beijing has, at least for now, backed away from its recent threats of economic reprisals against British firms and signaled its interest in longterm British investment. For example, backing away from Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) Wu Yi's 28 January warning that the British Government's "uncooperative attitude" on Hong Kong "is likely to affect Sino- British trade ties" (Xinhua, 28 January), PRC Vice President Rong Yiren was depicted by Xinhua on 24 February as cautiously optimistic about the prospects for British investment opportunities in China. In a meeting that day with the chairman of the prominent British multinational company John Swire and Sons, Rong reiterated Beijing's contention that Britain's "uncooperative approach" was to blame for the "current difficulties on the Hong Kong issue," but he went on to emphasize that both China and the British firm were "confident" about the economic prospects of Hong Kong and China and to observe that Swire "had been enlarging its business" in the region. Xinhua portrayed the British chairman as "willing" for his company to engage in "long-term investment in Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland." Further suggesting a return to a more conciliatory approach on economic relations, top Chinese officials have assured foreign investors and the Hong Kong business community that its uncompromising attitude on political reforms in Hong Kong will not adversely affect economic ties. For example, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji reaffirmed China's commitment to the territory's capitalist system after the takeover during a 25 February press conference in Tokyo when he "reiterated" that China "will not change the system in Hong Kong after 1997" (Xinhua, 25 February). He went on to reassure the business community that "the Chinese Government will continue to protect the interests of foreign- funded firms" in Hong Kong. Beijing's efforts to play down prospects of retaliation against British firms may be linked in part to China's desire for continued European Community (EC) support for its membership in GATT. PRC media used the recent visit to Beijing of EC Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan to provide an upbeat assessment of EC backing for China's application to GATT. Xinhua of 28 February reported that Brittan, at a joint news conference with MOFTEC minister Wu Yi that day, announced that it would be "economically beneficial" for "China and the whole world" to have China in GATT. Suggesting Beijing's efforts to avoid any overt threats of economic reprisals, PRC media were not observed to carry Western media accounts that EC Commissioner Brittan--in a response to Wu Yi's assertion during the press conference that the political row with Britain could affect economic ties--warned sharply that retaliation against British firms would be "completely unacceptable" to Europe (London Daily Telegraph, 1 March). Implications Beijing's refusal to compromise on Patten's political reforms and determination to proceed with the establishment of a shadow government in preparation for restructuring Hong Kong's legislative institutions after 1997 reflects both Beijing's drive to ensure total political control over Hong Kong after the takeover and the acute sensitivity of China's ageing leaders to perceived threats to China's "sovereignty," including political pressure on senior leader Deng Xiaoping who has staked his reputation on reclaiming Hong Kong from its colonial past. At the same time, China's decision to return to a more conciliatory approach on economic relations likely reflects efforts to avoid jeopardizing EC support for its GATT membership, and may signal a leadership view that, given the failure of economic reprisals to deter Legco from passing democratic reforms and Patten from submitting his remaining proposals for a vote, Hong Kong's stability is best served by maintaining strong ties to the British business community.
