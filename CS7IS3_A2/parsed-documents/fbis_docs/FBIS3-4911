Han, responding to lawmakers' questions at the National Assembly's Committee on Foreign Affairs and National Unification, said the exchange of special envoys is a clear precondition for the third round of Pyongyang-Washington high-level talks. According to an agreement between North Korea and the United States reached last Saturday, the two nations are scheduled to hold the third round of high-level talks late this month. Han said, "Pyongyang and Washington can discuss the possibility of improving their bilateral relations at the third round of high-level talks, but now is not the time to discuss setting up diplomatic relations. It is not an issue that can be realized in the near future, either." He also commented on the alleged construction of a North Korean-Iranian plant to jointly produce North Korea's Nodong-1 missile. "The government conveyed its concern to the Iranian Government through direct and indirect channels. Cooperation between North Korea and Iran has not been realized yet. It has not been decided on yet." Han denied remarks made by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Economic Planning Board Chong Chae-sok, who said on Monday that the government will announce an important plan on inter-Korean economic cooperation soon. "There is no plan for the government to make any important announcement related to inter-Korean economic cooperation," he said. Meanwhile Paek Nak-hwan, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's European Affairs Bureau, said revision of government guidelines on handling asylum seekers is under study to deal with North Korean loggers who have escaped from logging yards in Siberia to come to South Korea. "The government is also studying various international laws and will revise domestic laws if necessary. The Russian Government admitted that there are problems including infringement of human rights in North Korea's logging yards (in Siberia), and is studying ways to revise the forestry agreement it concluded with North Korea to insert a provision on protection of human rights," Paek said.
