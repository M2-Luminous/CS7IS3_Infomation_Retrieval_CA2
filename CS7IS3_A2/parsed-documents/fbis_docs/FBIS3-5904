As one noteworthy example, he recently decided to discontinue subsidies to civil organizations thus far supported by the government such as the Saemaul (New Village) Movement without consulting beforehand with Chongwadae. And on Thursday, he made important remarks on the internationally sensitive North Korean nuclear issue, a significant departure from his predecessors. Widely known as a man of principle and conviction, Yi ordered Home Minister Choe Hyong-u on Tuesday to stop giving financial support to the Saemaul Movement, the Association for Just Living and other civil organizations, and to take steps enabling these movements to stand on their own feet. The decision took many in the government by surprise, because he announced it without prior consultation with Chongwadae. President Kim's aides at Chongwadae were unhappy, not only because they were not consulted in advance but also because they think it premature for the government to discontinue subsidies to civil movements. "Civil movements should, in principle, be self-reliant and free from the government's influence and of the nature of volunteer services," he told reporters on Thursday. "When they use government funds for their programs, they can invite public distrust and misunderstanding, however good their cause may be, and this is why I decided to stop supporting them." One of Yi's aides said, "It's true that he did not discuss the decision with any Chongwadae officials, but he must have had sufficient communication with President Kim on this matter." Yi's way of announcing the decision was unique: He personally issued an order to Home Minister Choe, unlike his predecessors who made such announcements at cabinet meetings -- almost without exception. By giving an order to Choe, known as "a strong man" in the Kim Yong-sam government due to his long relationship with the president, Yi made it clear that Choe is but one of the cabinet members under his control. All cabinet ministers are "real power," he remarked only days after he took office late last year. In a meeting of related ministers just before the recent extraordinary parliamentary session, Yi hinted at a plan to reform government-funded civil movements. When Home Minister Choe discussed a plan to reduce subsidies to civil movements gradually over a period of four to five years, Yi asked, "Is there any need for such a gradual approach?" Then came his decision to stop handing out government funds to them once and for all. On the North Korean nuclear issue, he warned on Thursday that the third round of high-level U.S.-North Korea talks would not take place and the suspended South Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" this year would be held if the ongoing inter-Korean dialogue fails to make any headway. This was an unexpected and exceptional warning by a premier, because almost all of Yi's predecessors made it a rule to avoid commenting on sensitive political and foreign policy issues. Yi issued the warning at a press conference where he disclosed the results of a high-level strategic meeting of unification-related ministers he presided over that morning, indicating that he has a voice in any matters the government deals with. He recently said he would meet the press at least once a month to make known his views on major problems facing the government. One of his aides, who served several premiers before Yi, said, "He's a premier of the new generation," pointing to two things that make Yi different from his predecessors. One is that Yi cares little about the reactions of senior presidential aides when he makes a policy and the other is that he asks for an exclusive meeting with President Kim whenever he considers it necessary. Premier Yi, as the government's No. 2 man, ought to be that way in running the administrative branch. But his predecessors did not act similarly. For instance, one of them asked for the presidential secretariat's permission when he gave a small present to each reporter covering his office. In addition to his weekly meeting with President Kim, Yi often has special in-depth talks with his boss, according to the prime minister's close associates. Thanks to his frequent communication with President Kim and his firm grip on the cabinet, Yi can fully exercise his power as No. 2 man. His grip on the cabinet is based on an ability to keep his wits about him when pressing tasks facing the government and his experience as a court judge passing judgement in criminal and civil cases. His experience as a judge, which necessitates reading many case reports, helps him quickly understand many reports submitted by cabinet ministers and others. He is particularly good at pinpointing faults in reports and is rather cold when criticizing his subordinates for making mistakes. Recently, Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok felt Yi's wrath for an error in his anti-inflation report, according to Yi's aides. Yi ordered his aides to make a list of the steps he had promised to take at the recent interpellation session of parliament, saying he would check the list periodically to see if the steps have actually been taken. Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang is a man of his word.
