What was the story at the time? [Muto] We opposed setting such numbers. We felt the same as the chief cabinet secretary, and we stuck to the position that we would not accept any measure which would lead to managed trade. What is now happening is an extension of that position. Government officials have persisted with that line, and I would like to praise Prime Minister Hosokawa for doing the same. I think it was good the talks broke off in failure. What is wrong, after all, is wrong. I think Mr. Hosokawa said the same. Both countries believe in free trade. I think the semiconductor agreement was wrong -- I mean the fact such an agreement should have been made. Once you have such an agreement it becomes a precedent. So it would have been better never to have concluded such an agreement. Government procurement is done by the government, but workings of the automobile industry belongs entirely to the private sector. I think it would, indeed, be wrong indeed to set numbers that deal with this industry. Besides, the U.S. auto industry has become more competitive than the Japanese internationally. I think it was good he spoke against setting target numbers. [passage omitted on Takemura commenting further on the summit and Japan-U.S. relations] [Yamamoto] Minister Takemura, I understand you have another appointment. Shall we conclude our discussions here? Thank you so much for having been with us here today. [Takemura leaves] Mr. Shiokawa, we have heard the government's point of view. What is your view of the Japan-U.S. summit meeting? [Shiokawa] I am very concerned. Just now the chief cabinet secretary said every effort should be taken to ensure the matter does not affect basic elements in relations between the two countries. The government must do everything toward that. Another point is that the general public is not clear about why the Japan-U.S. talks ended this way. If we look at what the government has done recently, it is obvious that the process by which it decides on important matters is far from clear. Things happen suddenly. Take taxes as an example, while people were asleep, the government, out of the blue, announced it was instituting a national welfare tax. It is only natural that people became angry as a result. As I said, the process is unclear. Even in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the government has known from the beginning about the numerical targets demand. The government should have been able to say it had made a counter- proposal to the United States but that talks broke down because this counter-proposal had not been accepted. The problem is that the United States does not know what Japan wants. I think we should explain to the United States what we want and this will be the best way to restore the trust relationship between the two sides. [Yamamoto] Mr. Watanabe, Mr. Shiokawa has criticized as confused the way the government makes decisions, even those connected with the Japan-U.S. talks. What is your response? [Watanabe] There is no basis at all for such criticism. Mr. Muto, who has experience as international trade and industry and foreign minister, made a fair comment a little earlier. While serving as minister of international trade and industry, I also had hard time because of U.S. demands on numerical targets. Each time there was pressure, I told them the United States had the world's most liberalized economy and that if it and Japan agreed to doing something that led to managed trade, there would be reaction in Asia and Europe as well. I told them that when the overall world economy is taken into consideration numerical trade targets were not acceptable. The outcome of the recent summit is not a rupture in relations, but an agreement not to have an agreement. A Japan-U.S. relationship in which the United States does as it pleases because Japan has a trade surplus exceeding $100 billion cannot be said to be a truly friendly relationship. Even though the government must make every possible effort to reduce the surplus by deregulation or expanding domestic demand, what cannot be done cannot be done. Each country must work together in areas where government can legitimately act. The recent Clinton-Hosokawa meeting was unsuccessful, but I think it marks the start of a process in which relations become more mature and warmer. I am sure people in Japan understand this. There are many who tell me they find the outcome of the summit acceptable. [passage omitted on comments by Dietmen from the Japan Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party of Japan] [Yamamoto] Mr. Muto, in the wake of the Japan-U.S. talks, what do you think the future Japan-U.S. relationship should be like? [Muto] As you, Mr. Yamamoto, noted earlier, I had a chance to serve as minister of international trade and industry during the Bush administration and also as foreign minister after the Clinton administration was inaugurated. I see a difference between these two administrations. I think Mr. Bush was an excellent politician, even in the area of diplomatic affairs, who thought about the United States while also thinking about the world. I receive the impression, even though I have not had close contacts with him personally, that Mr. Clinton thinks more about the United States and less about the world. I have met people around him such as Mr. Kantor and Mr. Christopher. I think it would benefit Japan if the government takes note of this in its future actions. I think Japan should strongly propose that the United States consider the rest of the world as well. Europe would welcome such an attitude, and so would people in Asia. There was criticism, even, of the Seattle conference of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation [APEC] which said that all Clinton did in bringing together the Asian leaders was to use them to make himself look good. I think Japan should strongly advise the United States it should think globally. Another point. What I want to say to the government is that if the yen value went up suddenly while we were in power, we used to ask the G-7 to intervene in the market. The current government has not taken such actions, even though the yen has risen sharply in value since last July. I think the government should have taken some action. I have a feeling a high yen will be the result of the current dispute. [passage omitted on discussion of tax issues]
