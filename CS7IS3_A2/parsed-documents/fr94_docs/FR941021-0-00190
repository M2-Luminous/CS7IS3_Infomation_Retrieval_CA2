Section 25.114 is amended by revising paragraphs (c)(6), (c)(18), and (c)(26), and adding new paragraphs (c)(28) and (d), to read as follows: §25.114 Applications for space station authorizations. * * * * * (c) *␣*␣* (6)(i) For geostationary satellite orbit satellites, orbital location, or locations if alternatives are proposed, requested for the satellite, the factors which support such an orbital assignment, the range of orbital locations from which adequate service can be provided and the basis for determining that range of orbital locations, and a detailed explanation of all factors that would limit the orbital arc over which the satellite could adequately serve its expected users. (ii) For non-geostationary satellite orbit satellites, the number of space stations and applicable information relating to the number of orbital planes, the inclination of the orbital plane(s), the orbital period, the apogee, the perigee, the argument(s) of perigee, active service arc(s), and right ascension of the ascending node(s). (iii) For 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service space stations, the feeder link frequencies requested for the satellite, together with the demonstration required by §§25.203 (j) and (k). * * * * * (18) Detailed information demonstrating the financial qualifications of the applicant to construct and launch the proposed satellites. Applications for domestic fixed-satellite systems and mobile-satellite systems shall provide the financial information required by §25.140(b)&hyph;(e), §25.142(a)(4), or §25.143(b)(3), as appropriate. Applications for international satellite systems authorized pursuant to Establishing of Satellite Systems Providing International Communications, 50 FR 42266 (October 18, 1985), 101 FCC 2d 1046 (1985), recon. 61 RR 2d 649 (1986), further recon. 1 FCC Rcd 439 (1986), shall provide the information required by that decision. * * * * * (26) Applications for authorizations in the Mobile-Satellite Service in the 1545&hyph;1559/1646.5&hyph;1660.5 MHz frequency bands shall also provide all information necessary to comply with the policies and procedures set forth in Rules and Policies Pertaining to the Use of Radio Frequencies in a Land Mobile Satellite Service, 52 FR 4017 (Feb. 9, 1987), 2 FCC Rcd 485 (1987). * * * * * (28) Applications for authorizations in the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service shall also provide all information specified in §25.143. (d) Applicants requesting authority to construct and/or launch a system comprised of technically identical, non-geostationary satellite orbit mobile-satellite service space stations may file a single ``blanket'' application containing the information specified in paragraph (c) of this section for each representative space station. 4. Section 25.115 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: §25.115 Applications for earth station authorizations. * * * * * (d) User transceivers in the NVNG and 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service need not be individually licensed. Service vendors may file blanket applications for transceiver units using FCC Form 493 and specifying the number of units to be covered by the blanket license. Each application for a blanket license under this section shall include the following: (1) A general narrative section describing the applicant and the overall system operation, (2) A Form 430 (Licensee Qualification Report), if not already on file in conjunction with other facilities licensed under this subpart, (3) A Form 493 for each representative type of user transceiver terminal unit, (4) A designation of a point of contact where records of individual users will be maintained. In addition, applicants in the NVNG MSS service shall provide the information described in §25.135. Applicants in the 1.6/2.4 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service shall demonstrate that the stations comply with the technical requirements specified in §25.213. 5. Section 25.120 is amended by revising paragraphs (d) and (e) to read as follows: §25.120 License term and renewals. * * * * * (d) Space stations.
