He said, in particular: "...The new parliament's priority is to form a government that will assume full executive power and work to stabilize the socioeconomic situation, elect a head of government, decide whether he should be the head of the executive power branch (and I adhere to the view that the prime minister should be the head of executive power) and instruct him to form a working government within the shortest possible period of time. "Another priority step would be to amend the law on the president. We need to decide what the president of Ukraine should do, and then pass a law on the powers of local power bodies dividing powers and functions between the central and local executive power bodies..." In reply to a question on Ukraine's relations with the CIS, Plyushch said: "A summit of CIS heads of state is due to be held soon, and Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk will go there with a whole package of proposals on the integration of our economic system with other countries."
