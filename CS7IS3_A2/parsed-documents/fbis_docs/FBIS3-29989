The Ministry said that many local autonomous governing bodies besides the six cities and counties in Kyonggi Province, in which misappropriation cases had already been revealed by the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), used charity funds contributed by the public for other purposes between 1991 and 1993. The BAI announced Tuesday that heads of central government agencies and local autonomous governing bodies had used charity funds intended for the poor as "confidential expenses" or for other reasons. The Home Ministry has decided to begin a full-fledged investigation into 46 government agencies and local autonomous bodies in which the Board of Audit and Inspection has already exposed scandals. The Ministry is also studying ways to expand inspection by the BAI to include 275 local autonomous governing bodies, citing the principle of equity. It plans to rebuke public servants found guilty of committing irregularities and misappropriating charity funds who are uncovered by the BAI.
