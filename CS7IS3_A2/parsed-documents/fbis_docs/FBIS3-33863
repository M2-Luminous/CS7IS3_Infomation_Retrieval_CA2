During this session some proposals of the deputies and Majles commissions were approved on revenue figures of the budget bill for the year 1373 [Iranian year beginning 21 March 1994]. On the basis of these proposals various ministries, state organizations, and companies are permitted to hire out or sell at least 20 percent of their vehicles so as to meet their service costs in the year 1373. The said organizations are obliged to sell at least 12 percent of their equipment, which are not fully utilized, to the value of 400 billion rials in the year 1373. The income from such sales should be deposited in the state general revenue account. On the basis of another ratified note, in the year 1373 all imported goods should be registered. The registration fee for the essential commodities is five rials per every dollar, or its equivalent in other hard currencies, of the commodity's value. For the non-essential commodities the registration fee is 40 rials per dollar. Any person importing a vehicle, in addition to the existing taxes and customs charges, should pay 10 percent of the basic value of the vehicle to obtain a number plate for the vehicle. On the basis of another ratified note, any passenger entering the country, even from the free ports, can import goods up to the value of 150,000 rials without having to pay customs charges and tariffs. According to our correspondent's report, on the basis of the notes approved during this session of the Islamic Majles, in order to improve the quality of higher education and for more efficient utilization of the country's educational establishments, higher education institutes are allowed to charge the students who fail some subjects. That is, if a student fails in one or several subjects, he must pay cash or promise to pay later all the charges incurred by the state to enable him to repeat the subjects. The universities and the research and higher education institutes are also permitted to let their premises and facilities at the fair market rate, provided their own research works and operations are not undermined.
