Guliyev, chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan, by Anatoliy Blyudin, under the rubric "Visits"; place and date not given: "Rasul Guliyev: We Will Not Yield a Single Square Meter of Land"] [Text] Rasul Guliyev, in Soviet times a prominent functionary of the oil industry of Azerbaijan, and currently the chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and, they say, the second most important person next to Aliyev in Baku, will be arriving in Moscow today on an official working visit. Rasul Guliyev has given an interview to NOVAYA YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA. [Blyudin] Rasul Bayramovich, what is your attitude toward the present-day problems of the CIS? In general, do you believe in the viability of this union? [Guliyev] This is not the first case in history of an empire falling apart. The same thing happened in Italy, England, and other countries. Indeed, this process is proceeding very painfully here, and there are many reasons for this: Some of the new states are still young, and do not have adequate experience in statehood. Strong mutual mistrust is the second factor. Let us not dwell on explaining the reasons for this mistrust; let us acknowledge that it exists. Well, the third factor--it seems to me that there are still many people who would like to return to the past--a single Union, centralization, etc., once again. A general economic crisis is, to my mind, the main reason for difficulties in the CIS. In the Union, the economy was completely subordinated to political interests. Important economic decisions were made not only without any serious scientific analysis but also contrary to common sense. We are now having to pay for this. We must reconcile ourselves to this because there is no other way to a better life. History indicates that time passes, wounds caused by the disintegration of empires heal, and life returns to normal. Look at India, it now has normal economic relations with England. The old enmity has been forgotten. We should now have courage to admit that we will be drawing closer to one another for a long time to come and with difficulty and, well, also to believe that this will happen anyway. [Blyudin] Numerous facts have been reported in our newspaper which testify to the anti-Russian sentiment in Baku: Russians are being evicted from their apartments, they are leaving the republic. What is your attitude toward this? [Guliyev] Yes, the Russian-speaking population emigrated from Azerbaijan during the reign of the People's Front. However, the situation has changed since Geydar Aliyev was elected president. We see that people are already coming back. There are about 200,000 Russians in our country; some of them have lived here for more than 200 years. Our parliament will pass laws that will securely protect their interests. Nobody asks you in America what your ethnic background is; everybody is American there. We should build approximately the same relations in Azerbaijan. The idea of mononationalist politics is a dead end. We want the Russian-speaking population to feel that Azerbaijan is their motherland. I am convinced that the parliament will pass the necessary legislative acts as soon as the first half of the year. [Blyudin] What role do you assign to Russia in stopping the Armenian-Azerbaijan war? [Guliyev] Of course, we believe that the Russian state will assist in solving all the problems that have accumulated in our region in recent years. I am convinced that Russia has such an opportunity; both its political and economic resources are sufficiently powerful. International organizations could take part in these issues, shall we say, arithmetically, to the tune of 20 percent. We understand that complex and contradictory processes are underway within Russia. However, we see that the above notwithstanding, the real political forces are striving to solve the problems peacefully. Nonetheless, political stabilization is underway in Russia, and I attach great hopes to the growth of the role of Russia in the peacemaking process along with this. [Blyudin] What are the objectives of your visit to Moscow? [Guliyev] First of all, I would like to become better acquainted with my colleagues in Russia and share our views on our common problems, learn where we are close to each other and what we differ on: We must simply know each other before anything is resolved. I would very much like a regular businesslike relationship to develop between our parliaments. Strong economic relations have historically evolved between us. This is why borders between Russia and Azerbaijan should not exist as far as investment and the economy are concerned. Naturally, the laws our parliaments pass should promote rather than hamper the processes of integration. Russia is our big neighbor; we want to open all borders for the economies. There will be no barriers to Russian investment, but Russia should not throw up barriers to Azerbaijani investments, either. We are in favor of civilized relations. I worked for 12 years as the director of an oil refinery. At that time we reported to a Union ministry; I know many Russian oilmen well and have many friends in Russia. I come to Moscow with great hopes because I believe in the power of common sense; I believe that if there is enough will, a compromise may be reached on any difficult issue. Naturally, discussing the issue of stopping the war is also an objective of my visit. Neither the Azeri nor the Armenian people need this war. People are dying on both sides. I think that everybody has ascertained this: We will not yield a single square meter of our land. This should be understandable. If they try to compel us to make a certain decision by forcible methods, this means that we will fight. However, I would like to say again that the war is not needed. Political decisions are needed.
