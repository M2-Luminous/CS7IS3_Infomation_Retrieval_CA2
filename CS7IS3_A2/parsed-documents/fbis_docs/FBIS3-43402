The Mozambican media have long reported that the public feels some figures are involved in dealings which range from somewhat shady to very dark. No one has, however, been able to piece together enough evidence to point out specific names and place the dots on the i's. In his news conference in Maringue, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama took a step forward and indicated one name, that of Domingos Fondo, whom he accused of being involved in smuggling arms to South Africa. The Renamo leader went even further and said that President Joaquim Chissano was aware of it. Nothing can stay quite the same in the face of this new situation. Beginning with the attorney general, our legal structures simply cannot stand and wait for some unidentified person to come up with evidence. At this stage, the matter rests between two citizens: Afonso Dhlakama, who has made an accusation in public and who must be in possession of the relevant evidence, and Domingos Fondo, who has been publicly accused and who must respond to Dhlakama's evidence with other evidence and witnesses to prove his innocence. That is what one calls a legal state. The normal thing to do under such circumstances is for Gen. Domingos Fondo to institute legal proceedings against Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama for defamation and offensive remarks that could jeopardize his reputation. In turn, the court must establish who is in the right and penalize whoever is in the wrong. Things could follow a different path, though: Were the accusation only about purely individual interests, the matter could be laid to rest. It would be enough for Gen. Fondo to ignore those accusations. That accusation, however, involves a very serious crime and the simple fact that such an accusation has been made in public should force the Attorney General's Office to open an inquiry to investigate the truth of the charges. There is no escaping that responsibility. What is more, we all hope that the Attorney General's Office will not tell us yet again that it does not have the material means for conducting the investigation.
