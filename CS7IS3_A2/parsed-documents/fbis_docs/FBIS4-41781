Marakutsa favours the conclusion of an appropriate agreement with Russia that would specify the status of her troops in the region. "This may be a military base of Russia or of a peacekeeping force of the CIS," said the leader of parliament of the republic unrecognised by Moldavia. A Russian Army came to the region in the days of Empress Catherine the Second, and ever since has been the guarantor of peace and stability, Marakutsa said. An overwhelming majority of the population of left-bank Moldavia agree with this. They know quite well who "dampened hot-heads and stopped bloodshed in the Dniester area in the summer of 1992," he said. "The 14th Army is not an expeditionary corps temporarily deployed on foreign territory," Marakutsa emphasised. "The Army officers are rooted in this land. Their houses, families and relatives are here." His opinion is that those who press for the earliest withdrawal of the Army from the Dniester area know well that one can take away only its combat banner and a smaller part of hardware but that people would not go. Speaking about the role of Russia in a settlement of the Dniester problem, Marakutsa pointed out that hardly any other state could play a more positive role than Russia. "Not every country would agree to expose its soldiers to danger to help a stranger in misfortune. The role of Russia in this respect is great and it will grow stronger," the Dniester parliament speaker stressed.
