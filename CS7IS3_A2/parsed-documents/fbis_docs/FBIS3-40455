The main details are described below. The Structure of the Industrial Technology Council's Industrial Science and Technology Development Section's Meeting The establishment of a section for each project in the meeting was agreed to. Since a comprehensive evaluation of the advanced material processing program, and mid-term evaluations of advanced chemical processing technology and manufacturing methods for high performance chemicals (for marine life activity) are to be performed, an evaluation committee was established for this purpose. The Industrial Science and Technology Frontier Program (ISTF) The purpose of the program was explained and the details of the research and development were reviewed. It was decided to extend the research and development period for basic research and development in the propulsion program for supersonic transport by two years. Note: (1) The Industrial Technology Council was established as an organization affiliated with MITI on July 25, 1973, with the task of examining crucial issues related to science and technology for the mining and manufacturing industry in response to an inquiry from the Minister of MITI. The head of the Council is Hiroshi Inose, director of the Japan Information Center for Science and Technology (JICST). (2) The Industrial Science and Technology Section, which is organized as one divisional section, will review the ISTF Program, which began in 1993. The ISTF Program ISTF Office 1. Background In order to contribute to the advance of fundamental and original research and development that will contribute to the future development of industry and society as well as provide measures to address the quickening pace of society and the aging society, the former National Research and Development Program (Large-Scale Project), the Research and Development of Basic Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the Medical and Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project were consolidated in 1993, and a new R&D system, the ISTF Program, begun. 2. System Overview The consolidation and revision of the former National Research and Development Program, the Research and Development of Basic Technologies for Future Industries Project, and the Medical and Welfare Equipment Technology Development Project mainly covered each of the following areas: - Fundamental and Original Research and Development This is fundamental and original research and development to contribute to new social and economic developments by constructing and fostering new technological systems, or implementing technical breakthroughs. - Research and Development in the Public Interest This research and development is needed to address societal tasks such as providing the foundation needed to improve the lives of the citizens, to guarantee the stable supply of resources, and to promote science and technology. Exploratory research which provides preliminary basic research and investigation in the preproject stage is carried out in order to systematically and efficiently advance projects. 3.
