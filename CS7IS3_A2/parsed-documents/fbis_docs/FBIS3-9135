Calling it a "big violation", Major Simon MacDowell, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the Canadians had found the arms late Sunday [20 March] in the area where six 120 mm howitzers had been found on March 4. He said: "They determined that there are a considerable number of weapons there more than the six." These included four tanks, three anti-aircraft guns, one 405 mm howitzer and 18 mortars. Although the weapons were on the outer edge of the exclusion zone, near Cisluk 19 kilometres (11 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, they were very near the Sarajevo-Visoko road, which is supposed to be opened to civilian travel on Wednesday [23 March]. "At the local level, Canadians and the Serb commanders are in contact," MacDowell said. "The local level has not achieved any results in getting the weapons moved out or put under UNPROFOR control." The spokesman said the UN tried to arrange a high-level meeting between Bosnian Serb leader radivan Karadzic and top UNPROFOR officials at Serb headquarters in Pale later Monday to resolve the situation. "The Serbs cannot withdraw straight back out since they've backed up right to HVO (Croat) [Croatian Defense Council] lines," MacDowell said. "We don't know where the weapons came from. It's a big violation," he added, making clear however that "these guns are not capable of engaging Sarajevo. We have them now under observation." The spokesman added: "But these weapons are where we say they shouldn't be. The situation is not satisfactory from our position. Absolutely not."
