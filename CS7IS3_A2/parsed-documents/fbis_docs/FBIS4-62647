Given the floor by a majority decision in the Russian parliament's chamber he urged the three countries to set up a joint parliamentary group and to go to work on the documents, on the basis of which the three republics, which initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, will be able to reunify. Lukashenko called that decision "a mistake made in December 1991", which should be recognised as such. Chairman of the Duma Committee for Commonwealth Affairs Konstantin Zatulin then proposed that a record be made in the minutes of the chamber's plenary meeting to the effect that the speech of the Belarusian colleague "in no way reflects the State Duma's position". Russia's Choice also disavowed Lukashenko's statement. Its representative Boris Zolotukhin called for declaring Lukashenko's address to the Duma "inappropriate, as being directly connected with his presidential election campaigning". He recalled that according to parliamentary standards, the Duma can only be addressed by a representative of the official parliamentary delegation from Belarus.
