Mr Ramaphosa, 42, will oversee the two-year process which is to draw up the country's final constitution. He was the ANC's chief constitutional negotiator, a former security detainee and headed the National Union of Mineworkers before becoming prominently involved with ANC-aligned politics in the late 1980s. According to ANC Chief Whip Mr Arnold Stofile, Mr Ramaphosa would act as a "political rudder", ensuring that the principles in the interim constitution and those of the ANC were adhered to. The constitutional assembly is convened by a joint sitting of the 400-member National Assembly and 90-seat Senate. Former Minister of Manpower Mr Leon Wessels was elected deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly on Tuesday. His nomination, by Minister of Environment Affairs Dr. Dawie de Villiers, was unopposed.
