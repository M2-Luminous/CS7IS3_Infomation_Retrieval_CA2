FR940429-2-00097 FR940429-2-00071 Accordingly, a member firm with three stock execution machines, executing 7,500 trades in a non-specialist account, would be entitled to a credit of $375.00. In this example, the charges for the stock execution machines would be $750 ($250 fee multiplied by the 3 machines) minus the credit of $375 (1/2 [$250 fee] multiplied by 3 machines. If, however, in the above example the member firm had operated only two stock execution machines, the credit given would be $250 because the credit per member would be capped at 50 percent of the member's total stock execution machine billing charges. Thus, in the latter case, the total charges would be $250, which equals the total fees ($500) minus the credit per each machine (2 multiplied by $125). The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend the Phlx's current schedule of fees and charges and to also enhance the Exchange's equity floor as a highly attractive floor of execution for a member firm's business. 2. Statutory Basis The proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members and other persons using its facilities. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any inappropriate burden on competition. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants or Others No written comments were either solicited or received. III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action The foregoing rule change establishes or changes a due, fee or other charge imposed by the Exchange and therefore has become effective pursuant to Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the Phlx. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;19 and should be submitted by May 20, 1994. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
