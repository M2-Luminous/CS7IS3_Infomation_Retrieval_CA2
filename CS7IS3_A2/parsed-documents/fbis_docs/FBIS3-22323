Now in Maritime Kray submarines that have served out their useful life will be dispatched for eternal storage not to the bottom of the sea, but into the rocky soil of the Far East. The kray is short of electric power, to the tune of 400 mwt/hr; where to get the needed capacities? At the same time, 27 nuclear reactors are idle at decommissioned Pacific Fleet submarines; they can still produce electricity but are no longer transportable, plus they cannot be put to sea on rusted-through old vessels. On the other hand, to simply mount used reactors at existing AES [nuclear power stations] means making oneself a subject of justified criticism of the "greens" and add worries to local population. It has been decided that if these reactors are to serve for the good of the national economy, it is only from underground. It has not been decided yet where the underground AES will be placed: in old mines or specially built tunnels.
