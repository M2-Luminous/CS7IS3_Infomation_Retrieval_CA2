He said our Yemeni people adhere to unity and democracy because this is their fate and future, and because they emanate from Islam. Therefore, he said, they will stand by them and protect them against all secessionists. The brother House of Representatives speaker explained that Saudi Arabia and other fraternal and friendly states support legitimacy and view the issue as one between the state and rebels. He noted that this does not mean they (?hesitate) to exert efforts, individually and through the Arab League. He said his visit to Saudi Arabia yielded good results and that the ties between the two countries are eternal and strong. Therefore, we have to exchange views with our brothers to put them in the picture. Additionally, the visit fell within the context of strengthening and activating these ties. He explained the interaction by Arab capitals, both near and far, with the events in the Yemeni arena emanates from the brotherly (?ties) and the desire to stop this bloodshed. The brother House of Representatives Speaker praised the stand of all Arab brothers who exerted and are exerting efforts and are showing concern for [words indistinct] the efforts of King Husayn and his great and effective roles to contain the crisis since it started.
