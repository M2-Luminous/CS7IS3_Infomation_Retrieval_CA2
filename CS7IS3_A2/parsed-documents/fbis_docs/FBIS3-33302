"We are not putting them against the wall or imposing deadlines, but we hope it does not take too long because everything could fall apart," General Ortega said in a conciliatory tone after turning over a former military installation to the Nicaraguan Ecologist Brigades. Ortega said, however, that the disarmament process of the rebels from the 3-80 Northern Front could begin in the next few days. The 3-80 Northern Front staff sent the government a list with 10 demands, including "the post of police chief in Jinotega and Nueva Segovia Departments, as well as in the Municipalities of Quilali, Jicaro, Murra, San Juan de Rio Coco, Yali, Pantasma, Ciudad Antigua, Concordia, San Rafael del Norte, Cua, Mancotal, and Bocay." According to the rebel leader's letter, the Army could continue to keep garrisons of up to 60 men in those municipalities, except Quilali. No One Has Been Defeated The rebel leader Chacal also demands that the EPS return to its barracks and a subsequent demilitarization of northern Nicaragua. The list of demands is signed by Esteban, Piloto, Franklin, Musun, Chele Gringo, and Rafael. The document also includes the creation of new settlements for development in Quilali and road repairs in the area. The EPS chief said that once the rebel groups have disarmed, the only remaining troublesome groups will be the criminal bands, therefore there will be no reason to have EPS combat units in the area. "We are willing to decrease the Army's military presence as long as they return to civilian life," Ortega said. The EPS chief said: "Just as I told Talavera -- Chacal -- in the letter I sent him, no one is being defeated here. They will be returning to civilian life with dignity, and Nicaragua will be the winner." According to Ortega, total peace will only be achieved by resolving the economic and social crisis. "If unemployment and poverty continue, peace will remain threatened," the military chief said. Meeting Next Monday A meeting between the chiefs of staff and the government, in which Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command of the EPS, could participate, will be held next Monday in Ciudad Antigua, a government source told BARRICADA. As for the controversial Military Organization Law, the Army chief said the draft bill is almost finished and will soon be turned over to the government for review.
