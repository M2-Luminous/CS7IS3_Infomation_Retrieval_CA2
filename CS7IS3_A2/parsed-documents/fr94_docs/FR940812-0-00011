FR940812-0-00011 FR940812-0-00005 There are approximately 47 producers of South Texas onions under this marketing order, and approximately 34 handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of South Texas onion producers and handlers may be classified as small entities. The budget of expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period was prepared by the South Texas Onion Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of South Texas onions. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The Committee, in a mail vote, unanimously recommended a 1994&hyph;95 budget of $80,000 for personnel, office, and compliance expenses, the same as last year. The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects will be recommended at the Committee's organizational meeting this fall. These funds, along with the administrative expenses for personnel, office, and compliance, will comprise the total budget. Funds in the reserve as of May 31, 1994, estimated at $346,415, were within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. These funds will be adequate to cover any expenses incurred by the Committee prior to the approval of the assessment rate. Since no assessment rate is being recommended at this time, no additional costs will be imposed on handlers. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register because: (1) The fiscal period begins on August 1, 1994, and the Committee needs to have approval to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) this action is similar to that taken at the beginning of the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action.
