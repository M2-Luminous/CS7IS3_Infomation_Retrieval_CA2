Ivan Rybkin May Receive Their Leaders"] [Text] Aleksandr Tikhonov, chairman of the "Consolidation" party; Igor Karpenko, leader of the "Slavic Unity of Ukraine"; and Nikolay Sergeyev, chairman of the "`Belaya Rus' Slavic Assembly" party, yesterday circulated an "Appeal to the Heads of State and Parliaments of the Republic of Belarus, the Russian Federation, and the Republic of Ukraine." The appeal contains a call to pass "legislative acts on the unification of the sovereign states to form a confederation or some other mutually acceptable state entity." In the opinion of its authors, "the creation of a confederation will make it possible to prevent disintegration of the unified community and to solve political, economic, and defense tasks." Speaking at a press conference devoted to the promulgation of the appeal, the leaders of the parties stated that the pro-integration feeling prevalent among the peoples of the three countries does not always meet with adequate understanding among members of the political elites of Russia, Ukraine, and Belorussia [Belarus]. At the same time, according to the assurances of the "Consolidation" chairman and State Duma deputy Aleksandr Tikhonov, Speaker Ivan Rybkin intends to meet with the authors of the appeal as early as 21 June. Mr. Tikhonov thinks the speaker's stance is drawing closer to proposals expounded in the appeal. As for practical steps to create a unified state entity, it is suggested that referendums be held in all the three republics following which the supreme organs of representative power could take specific actions to carry into effect the peoples' will. In the view of the authors of the appeal, the new Slavic statehood ought to have unified armed forces, a unified "ruble" system, and equality of state languages. It is worth pointing out that the very fact of signing such an appeal is, to a certain extent, a new method in the political struggle both in Russia and in the Ukraine, as well as in Belarus. Until recently pro-integration and unification sentiments were mainly exploited by radical-communist and national-patriotic organizations, so the same sentiments expressed by "centrist" associations may have greater repercussions.
