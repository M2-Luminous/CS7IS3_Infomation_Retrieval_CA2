In the area of N'dalatando, the capital of Cuanza Norte Province, the regime's troops are still trying to occupy the city. However, the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] are meeting with a firm response from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces. Our correspondent reports on the situation over the last 48 hours. [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] 1. The enemy forces have over the last 48 hours tried to recover the body of (van den Berg), a South African mercenary who was killed on 26 April; 2. In their first attempt on 27 April, the defeated FAPLA forces left another seven soldiers confirmed killed on the ground. There were also indications that several wounded men may have been dragged away from the battleground as the Luanda regime's forces fled in disarray [words indistinct] ammunition belt, and a number of rucksacks with assorted equipment; 3. At 0730 on 28 April, the enemy once again tried to get near the area. They used three T-55 tanks and intense fire from three Luanda air force combat fighters to provide cover for the FAPLA forces. Those aircraft dropped phosphorus and napalm bombs. The fire caused by those bombs could be seen some 40 km away. Our forces on the ground say they saw fresh vegetation burning and an area of 600 square meters was completely burned. There were no victims, thanks to our forces' technical and tactical skills, and now the siege is tightening. 4. Taking into account the human and material losses that Luanda's Futungo de Belas Palace is suffering in its attempt to recover the body of (Van den Berg), the aforementioned South African mercenary, we can only assume that he must have been a very important person. The forces of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola government will experience even more losses, should they continue to [word indistinct] lives. The morale of the brave Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola could not be higher and they are determined to see that the watchword is observed in this province: whether it is attacked from land or from the air, N'dalatando will not fall. N'dalatando is with UNITA. N'dalatando is with Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. N'dalatando is with the patriots. [end recording]
