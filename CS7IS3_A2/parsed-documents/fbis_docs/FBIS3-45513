In light of the fact that such projects do not fall under the domain in which the state encourages foreign investment, the wide area covered by the projects, and their complicated nature and in order to properly guide the flow of foreign capital so that it can help national economic development, such projects must be subject to strict scrutiny before approval can be granted, and management must be strengthened. Henceforth, it will not be suitable to grant any more approvals for the establishment of joint-venture and cooperative projects that involve the simple dismantling of metals and determine which are useful for reexport or for the establishment of foreign-funded enterprises (solely owned enterprises) that engage in the processing of waste metals. Various economic and trade commissions (offices and bureaus) should maintain strict standards in the examination and approval work. Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade 10 July 1991
