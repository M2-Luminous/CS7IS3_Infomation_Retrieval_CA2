According to Lula da Silva, the PT-PSB alliance that will be approved in a few days during a meeting of the two parties' executive boards will be a national alliance. Lula da Silva said he still does not know who will be the ticket's vice presidential candidate for the presidential elections, but he praised Senator Jose Paulo Bisol, who was his running mate in the 1989 elections. Da Silva said: "I am not the one to choose but Bisol has become a better known and consolidated figure in national politics." Lula da Silva also said he hopes to attract other parties such as the PPS [People's Socialist Party] and the PCdoB [Communist Party of Brazil] for a large leftist front but he discarded agreements with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party], which have their own candidates. He said: "[PDT leader Leonel] Brizola has shown some repulsion for the PT and said more than once that he is a candidate and is not interested in making alliances."
