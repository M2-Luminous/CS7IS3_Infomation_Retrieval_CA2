The program of discussion includes military, humanitarian, economic, and border problems. The Estonian side is primarily interested in a detailed schedule for the pullout of Russian troops from Estonia. The Estonian delegation is ready to agree to the Russian proposal on the final withdrawal date (31 August 1994) only if Estonia gets a schedule providing for a priority pullout of combat units and subdivisions. Vasiliy Svirin, chief Russian negotiator, said last week that such a detailed document has been prepared and it specifies the date for the relocation of each military unit. The schedule will be presented during the talks. Vyano Reynar, Estonia's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, who has replaced Juri Luik at the post of chief Estonian negotiator, has expressed the hope that in spite of a number of contradictions, the main treaty on the pullout of Russian troops will be ratified after all. At the same time Ago Tiyman, the delegation's executive secretary and head of its military group, stressed that Estonia would like the Russian side not to link economic and political problems, in particular the issue of human rights. It is precisely for this reason, he thinks, that the fully elaborated and prepared agreements and treaties on economic matters have not been signed yet.
