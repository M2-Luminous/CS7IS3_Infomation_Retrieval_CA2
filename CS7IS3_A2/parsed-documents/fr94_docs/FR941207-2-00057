FR941207-2-00057 FR941207-2-00043 [TA&hyph;W&hyph;29,931] Dresser Industries, Incorporated Guiberson-Ava Division Dallas, Texas; Notice of Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration On October 24, 1994, one of the petitioners requested administrative reconsideration of the Department of Labor's Notice of Negative Determination Regarding Eligibility to Apply for Worker Adjustment Assistance for workers at the subject firm. The Department's Negative Determination was published in the Federal Register on October 14, 1994 (59 FR 50624). Findings show that the company is engaged in on-site field supervision and consultation of down-hole equipment for drilling. Conclusion After careful review of the application, I conclude that the claim is of sufficient weight to justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. The application is, therefore, granted. Signed at Washington, D.C., this 22nd day of November 1994. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;30099 Filed 12&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
