For not starving? For not silencing our misery? These are questions asked by "Sub-Commander Marcos," spokesperson for the Zapatist National Liberation Front (EZLN), reacting in a public letter to the amnesty offered by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. The letter sent to the independent newspapers LA JORNADA, EL FINANCERO, EL TIEMPO of San Cristobal de las Casas, and the magazine PROCESO contains 50 questions regarding the president's amnesty offer which was approved this morning by the Chamber of Deputies. "Marcos," whose real identity is unknown, wore a ski cap during the 1 January occupation of San Cristobal de las Casas and has signed off on all the communiques issued thus far by the EZLN directorate. "What will they pardon us for? What do we have to ask pardon for? For not having humbly accepted the gigantic historic charge of rejection and abandonment? For rising up in arms when we found all other paths closed? These are some of the questions asked by the mysterious guerrilla leader. "For showing the rest of the country and the world that human dignity is still alive even in its poorest inhabitants? For being mostly Indians? For struggling for liberty, democracy, and justice? For not following the patterns of the previous guerrillas? For not surrendering? For not selling ourselves? Who must ask for pardon and who can grant it? Those who for years and years have sat down at a full table and have sated themselves, while we sat down with death, on a daily basis, so near that we ceased fear it. Those who filled our pockets and souls with statements and promises? Those who are dead, our dead, so mortally dead of "natural" death, that is, of measles, whooping cough, dengue, cholera, typhoid fever, tetanus, pneumonia, malaria, and other gastrointestinal and pulmonary ailments? Those who tortured us, arrested us, assassinated and despised us for the serious "crime" of wanting a piece of land, not a large piece, not a small piece, only a piece that could allow one to grow something to put into one's mouth. Who has to ask for pardon and who can grant it?."
