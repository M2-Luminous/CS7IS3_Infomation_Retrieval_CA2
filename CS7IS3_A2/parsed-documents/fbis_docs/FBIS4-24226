The South African leader is willing to help resolve the Angolan dispute by peaceful means. Beye is about to leave for Luanda to meet President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos, probably this afternoon. Beye will go to Huambo tomorrow to meet Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. A UN Angola Verification Mission source told Radio Nacional de Angola a while ago that for the time being there will be no summit as was reported. There will be consultations, either in Angola or South Africa. Government and UNITA negotiators did not meet this morning. They could meet this afternoon to begin discussing the application of national reconciliation modalities. These include the integration of Jonas Savimbi into Angola's political life.
