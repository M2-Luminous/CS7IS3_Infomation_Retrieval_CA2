At the end of the talks, the head of Romanian diplomacy said: [Begin Melescanu recording] It was a discussion whereby Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg briefed us on the results of the Geneva talks on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We had a discussion on the prospects for a peaceful solution of this conflict. Of course, the two mediators also expressed the desire to discover the opinions, views, and suggestions of Romania and the Romanian Government on the continuation of the peace process. I believe that I can sum up the visit by describing it as an integral part of the efforts undertaken by the two mediators to examine the way in which the countries in this region, the countries neighboring the former Yugoslavia, can contribute to the progress of the peace process. [end recording] In his statement, Lord Owen said that, at the beginning of the year, the explicit decision was made for the two cochairmen to pay visits to all the countries in the vicinity of former Yugoslavia, since there is a very strong imperative demand in the region to solve the conflict. Here is Lord Owen's answer to a question put to him by our radio station correspondent Doina Saiciuc regarding Romania's possible contribution to a resolution of the Yugoslav crisis: [Begin Owen recording, in English with superimposed translation into Romanian] I believe that Romania has a considerable contribution to make. You have good relations with the countries in the region and the countries of former Yugoslavia. Obviously, this includes the relations with Hungary and Bulgaria, too, but not only with them. In a broader sense -- I am now referring to the whole region -- I know that there is a strong relationship between Romania and Turkey. You are feeling the economic consequences of the sanctions. These contacts with your foreign minister are not the first such contacts with Romania. I would like to introduce a dose of self-criticism here, since this is indeed my first visit to Romania. However, I have been in constant touch with Romania and I now believe that Romania's influence on this conflict should become more palpable. [end recording] The two mediators in the Yugoslav crisis also had talks with Adrian Nastase, president of the Chamber of Deputies. At this time, they are meeting with President Ion Iliescu, our correspondents inform us.
