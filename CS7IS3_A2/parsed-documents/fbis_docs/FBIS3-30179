South Pacific correspondent Erina Reddan reports that Fiji's Constitution guarantees indigenous Fijians political dominance over the country's Indian population. [Reddan] Rabuka called this snap election just 18 months into his five-year term after a leadership challenge last November. He returns to parliament with the same number of seats in his coalition, counting two independents and four general voter seats, but his SVT [Fijian Political Party] party is down by two seats to 31. Josevata Kamikamica, who mounted the leadership challenge, has lost his seat, but his newly launched Fijian Association did pick up five seats. The anti-Indian Nationalist Party lost all of its five seats and the All Nations Congress won one seat. Rabuka says he'll find it easy to work with the National Federation Party, which won 20 seats at the expense of the Labor Party, which is down from 13 to seven seats. Prime Minister Rabuka says he's very happy with his win. [Begin Rabuka recording] Well, any victory is good. I had hoped that we would get 33 or 34 seats. A four majority in the house is still enough to run a government and its very, very satisfying, very comforting to know that people still have a lot of confidence in the party. [end recording]
