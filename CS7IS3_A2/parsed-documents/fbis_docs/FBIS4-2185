Jiangsu's township enterprises have so far absorbed more than 7.3 million workers, accounting for 80 percent of the total staff members and workers of the province, and their economic scale has rapidly expanded. Jiangsu Province established 110 provincial-level township enterprise groups in the past few years. All these trans-regional and even trans-national large groups have fixed assets worth over 50 million yuan, and more than a half of them sell over 200 million yuan worth of goods a year. In the southern part of the province, which has become one of China's most important industrial areas, counties (cities) whose township enterprises create more than 20 billion yuan in industrial output value account for 50 percent of the total, and those where township enterprises' industrial aggregate exceeds 100 million yuan account for over 90 percent. Since the beginning of the 1990's, Jiangsu's township enterprises have greatly enhanced their capacity for participating in the international economic exchanges. According to statistics, they provided over 56 billion yuan worth of goods for export in 1993, accounting for about 30 percent of the total value of the goods provided by all the township enterprises in the country for export. So far, 10,000 township enterprises of Jiangsu Province have developed joint investment and cooperation with foreign firms, and the foreign capital to be brought in according to contracts totals more than $7 billion. In addition, they have established 230 enterprises in 36 countries and regions in the world. As was learned, one-third of the township enterprises in Suzhou city had been transplanted with the funds and technology from abroad, and one-fourth of the income of the city's industrial township enterprises was earned through the world market. The technology and equipment and the technological development capacity of Jiangsu's township enterprises are also gaining more respect. According to pertinent departments, Jiangsu has invested more than 10 billion yuan in the technical transformation of its township enterprises over the past few years to enable over a half of them to purchase advanced domestic and foreign equipment. In Wuxi County, which is at the top of China's 100 strong counties, all the enterprises whose annual output value exceeds 50 million yuan have established research institutes to make the county China's largest rural scientific research base, with several hundred new products with fairly high technology content being developed yearly. Since last year, Jiangsu Province has begun to reorganize the property rights of its township enterprises and has promoted the innovation of their systems through the shareholding system and the shareholding cooperation system. Nearly 10,000 township enterprises have experimented with the shareholding system. They have drawn in over 2 billion yuan by selling stocks, and a large number of rural private and individual enterprises have also purchased stocks from township enterprises. As was learned, Jiangsu's township enterprise groups organized through the holding and buying of shares and joint investment possessed 10 percent of the total assets of all the province's township enterprises. The high-quality development of Jiangsu's township enterprises is effecting a change in local rural society and accelerating its rural industrialization and modernization. According to a research report provided by the Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Agricultural Science, judging from the economic level, social structure, population quality, life quality, and other indicators adopted in the world, the rural areas in the southern part of Jiangsu Province have entered a stage of modernization ahead of others. As was learned, Wuxi city's per capita GNP exceeded 10,000 yuan last year, and the per capita income of its peasants was 2,240 yuan.
