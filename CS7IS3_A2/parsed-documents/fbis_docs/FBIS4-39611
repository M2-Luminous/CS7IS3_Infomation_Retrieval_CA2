This has been confirmed once again by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in a telephone conversation, and details are now being finalized for this operation, which will unfold just as planned. Any breakdown in the peacekeeping operation would undermine the authority of the Commonwealth of Independent States as a regional organization and would be a great blow to Russian policy, the Georgian head of state stressed. Shevardnadze noted that a breakdown in the peace process would affect Russia deeply, as Russia's ethnic interest has preserved its status as a peacekeeper in the former USSR.
