The New Year began with reports on probable agreement among OPEC members on production cutbacks and an early meeting -- prior to the previously determined date. The combination of these factors brought about a slight rise in the price of oil in the early days of the year. In transactions concluded on the final days of 1993, oil prices sank to the lowest level in the past five years, and the average price for OPEC oil basket was fixed around $12.67. The 30 percent decline in oil price in 1993 created serious difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting countries. Iran and Saudi Arabia have always played key roles in OPEC since the creation of this highly significant world economic organization in 1960. In fact OPEC is the only international organization which sets price on a single raw material that is produced mainly by a number of Third World countries. The industrially advanced countries of the world have never really liked this system of price determination. They had been accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was their natural right to determine prices both for the raw materials they imported from the Third World countries as well as the price of the industrial commodities they exported to those countries. That is why they have always been trying to weaken OPEC and undermine its very foundations. Even before the Islamic Revolution in February 1979, the industrial powers of the world tried to create tensions between Tehran and Riyadh, and although at that time government systems in both countries were monarchies attached to the West, for the reasons cited above the industrial powers of the world did everything and mostly succeeded in keeping bilateral ties between the two countries in a strained condition, specially during the 8 years of Iraq's war of aggression against Iran. Nevertheless, in spite of all the casualties and the losses to which the countries in the region had been subjected, the events of the war had the ironic effect of lifting the veil of deception and exposing the bare truth. The countries in the region, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia which perform key roles, realized the problems of the region and its security needs will have to be settled and resolved through peaceful cooperation among themselves. And once the regional countries have learned to settle the basic issue of the regional security through peaceful strategies, more expanded cooperations such as preserving their natural right to set the price of oil will automatically follow. No doubt small groups in both Tehran and Riyadh will try to create tension and crisis between the two countries. But these groups are not in decisive positions in either of the two capitals, and in the final analysis what counts is the decisions reached at the level of the leaders of the two countries regarding the creation of cordial relationships.
