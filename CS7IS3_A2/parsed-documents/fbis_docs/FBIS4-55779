They said the decision had been made at today's session of a faction of the Liberal Democrats, adding that the reason was a bribery scandal involving members of the faction. "Vladimir Volfovich must stay in Moscow for the time being. This is a fault of the irresponsible journalists who are as always slandering the Liberal Democratic Party," head of the party's faction in the State Duma (lower house of parliament) Andrey Losev told CTK. "The visit has been postponed at the moment. It is difficult to say when it will take place," he added. Commentator Nikoli Svanidze said last week on Russian Television that Zhirinovskiy had promised each member of his party $500 if they voted in favour of the government-submitted draft state budget. The Liberal Democrats want to lodge a complaint against Svanidze and they demand that he be barred temporarily from the television screen at least. Zhirinovskiy was to come to Bratislava at the weekend at the invitation of private businessman Ladislav Mojzis and Jozef Lauko, who was a guest at the April congress of Zhirinovskiy's party in Moscow. Originally Zhirinovskiy was also to visit Prague on March 20, but the visit at the invitation of the extreme-right Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) was cancelled after a representative of the Liberal Democrats met with a Czech Embassy official. According to unofficial sources in Moscow, the representative informed the Liberal Democrats that the Czech Government considered their leader's visit to Prague "most inappropriate" and that it would use all legal possibilities to prevent it. Zhirinovskiy explained the indefinite postponement of this visit by the SPR-RSC's refusal to finance his trip.
