FBIS3-7506 "dreas060_a_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-060 Document Type:Daily Report 29 Mar 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Diet Boycott Predicted Until Loans Discussed OW2803214194 OW2803214194 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo TV Asahi Network in Japanese at 0100 GMT on 27 March, in its regularly-scheduled "Sunday Project" program, carries a 20-minute interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], by political commentator Soichiro Tahara. In the interview, Mori discusses the LDP policy to continue pressuring Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa over questionable loans totalling 100 million yen received from the scandal-tainted trucking company Sagawa Kyubin. Asked why the LDP is so eager to pursue Hosokawa's responsibility, Mori stated: "We are just following a Diet resolution. When we enacted the fiscal 1993 supplementary budget, Lower House Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] proposed a resolution according to Article 104 of the Diet Administration Law." He adds: "The resolution was adopted at the lower house plenary session with no opposition. All parties--including Hosokawa's Japan New Party [JNP], the Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Komeito, and the SDPJ--said yes to the resolution." "The Diet is formally demanding the government--the tax office, the prosecutors, or the prime minister himself--make up for deficient documents submitted by the prime minister, but the government has not shown an appropriate response. This is why Diet sessions are deadlocked." Mori adds that sooner or later "Hosokawa will have to take responsibility" for the political turmoil. Regarding the LDP's future course of action, Mori stresses his stance to continue boycotting Diet sessions as long as Hosokawa remains silent about the issue, saying: "If Hosokawa keeps refusing the Diet's request, the enactment of the 1994 budget will be further delayed." Asked if he intends to urge Hosokawa's resignation, Mori replies: "To take responsibility for his actions, Hosokawa will be forced to dissolve either his administration or the lower house." Mori continues: "When a person wants to borrow money, he or she usually goes to a bank. If somebody borrows a large amount of money from a trucking company, this person may have a special relationship with the company, or the loan may be given under favorable conditions. Hosokawa did that while a public official, yet he is advocating visibility in politics and elimination of corruption. If those are still regarded as the basis of political reform, he must speak out. The LDP is not responsible for the turmoil."
