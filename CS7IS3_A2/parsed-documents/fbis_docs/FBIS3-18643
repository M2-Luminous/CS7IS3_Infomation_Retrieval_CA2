Writing in the 21 February Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, he notes that while the CDS has always had good members, it has lacked electoral exposure and weight and never succeeded in attracting voters. The CDS, which has also been unable to create a party machine, has suffered from ideological "confusion," Rebelo de Sousa continues. In fact, never "populist," the party includes a "measure of Christian democracy, some conservatism, a degree of liberalism and social-Catholicism, as well as centrist tendencies." Rebelo de Sousa concedes, however, that the CDS/PP fields good candidates in municipal elections, many of whom have won the race. Finally, under the leadership of present chairman Manuel Monteiro, the party has modified its original Europeanist principles, which now have taken an antifederalist tinge. Reviewing the results of the party congress, Rebelo de Sousa notes that it brought about the CDS's reconciliation with former leader Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who resigned from the party some years ago. Secondly, the congress stressed the importance of the next European Parliament elections, in which Monteiro will lead the CDS list, despite the fact that his domestic policy lacks "weight, density, and credibility." Rebelo de Sousa also notes that one of the CDS's problems is the attempt to deprive the PSD of an absolute majority. Were Monteiro to fail, the CDS would lose its bet. Were he to succeed, the PSD could seek an alliance with the CDS, but Prime Minister Cavaco Silva would never lead such an alliance. It would thus be "bad business" for the CDS to ally itself with a party in crisis without Cavaco Silva at its head, Rebelo de Sousa contends. Finally, were Monteiro to succeed, the CDS would again lose because the alternative would be a leftist government, he concludes.
