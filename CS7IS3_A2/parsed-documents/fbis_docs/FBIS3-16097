For the first time in a long while the general public will finally get the chance to find out whether the new Russia has a new policy in the Near East, and if so what it is. However, on the subject of the public, there was no intention of actually informing it: The visit was planned as secret. A Foreign Ministry staffer literally flew into a rage when he learned that information about it had nevertheless been leaked to news agencies. Sanctions followed immediately -- press representatives were deprived of the chance to accompany the minister. All the signs of preparations for a major step in the Near East sphere have been visible of late: To begin with, First Deputy Minister Igor Ivanov visited Tunisia and Israel, and then Viktor Posuvalyuk, leader of the Near East and North Africa Department, held talks with Yasir 'Arafat in Tunis itself. In Moscow Ivanov unveiled a plan for staging a new international forum for settling the Arab-Israeli conflict, intended to develop the principles agreed at the Madrid Conference in 1991. This idea was greeted without particular enthusiasm by Washington and Tel Aviv. Among other things, the Israelis are noticeably concerned about the clear linkage between the upsurge in diplomatic activity on the part of Moscow and the tragedy in Hebron, which prompted increased sympathies for the Palestinians. Yitzhaq Rabin's government fears that, while promising to bring 'Arafat back to the negotiating table, Russia will try to win certain concessions for the PLO, striving to win back the authority in the Arab East which was lost in the years of rapprochement with the West. There is no doubt that Andrey Kozyrev will get a warm reception in Tunis, site of PLO headquarters: The Palestinians are still nurturing illusions, hoping for a resurrection of Russia's regional role as a counterbalance to American influence. By contrast, the discussion in Tel Aviv promises to be difficult -- the degree of distrust in Israel toward Moscow, for decades the main sponsor of Arab dictators, is very great. Given all this, it is hard to imagine that Kozyrev's mission can culminate in any significant results.
