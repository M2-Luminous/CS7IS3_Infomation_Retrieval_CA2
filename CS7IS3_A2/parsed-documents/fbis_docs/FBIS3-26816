Last year, they made great strides in attracting funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. Last year, our region formally approved 41 projects to attract funds from abroad and develop lateral ties at home, reaching agreements on bringing in more than 100 million yuan. The funds brought in by those projects were intended for Tibet's communications and transportation sector, light industry, textiles, machinery and electronics, and commercial sector. Tibet, known as "the roof of the world," is a virgin land that waits to be developed. As the policy of reform and opening up has deepened constantly, the high plateau has thrown its doors open and attracted the attention of people at home and abroad. To accelerate reform and opening up, actively attract foreign and domestic capital, and promote rapid economic development, in 1992 the autonomous regional people's government formulated "Several Provisions on Encouraging Domestic and Foreign Investment in Tibet," as well as the "Interim Measures for Rewarding People Who Are Instrumental in Bringing in Domestic and Foreign Investment Into Tibet." Moreover, it set up an office in charge of concrete work under the autonomous regional economic coordination committee for introducing funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. In the past year, Tibet has begun to show good progress in attracting funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home. Hong Kong's Shiheng Group began investing in our region in 1992, the year in which Tibet took initial steps toward bringing in funds and developing lateral ties. Together with the Lhasa City Electrical Power Bureau and the tourist company affiliated with the autonomous regional physical culture committee, it developed the Hongjingtian series of products for use on highlands, as well as mineral water. This marked the beginning of Tibet's efforts to introduce funds from abroad and develop lateral ties at home. Shortly afterward, businessmen from other countries and regions, such as the United States, Japan, Germany, Nepal, and Malaysia, came to the plateau to negotiate business ventures. The autonomous regional economic coordination committee for introducing funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home launched 49 projects to attract investment. Last June, Atewufei [transliteration of name as received] Company from the United States invested 9.5 million yuan to set up Tibet Yak Meat Products Limited Company in conjunction with the autonomous regional association of self-employed laborers. Preparations for this business venture are now under way. Nepalese businessmen invested 7.5 million yuan to set up Tibet Carpet Limited Company with the Chengguan District Ethnic Handicrafts Administration in Lhasa City. Construction of the factory premises is near completion. Hong Kong's Dadi Real Estate Development Company, and Liyuan Scientific and Technological Development Company under the autonomous regional economic research center jointly set up the Tibet-Hong Kong Yishou Products Limited Company to produce a series of health care products, the mass-production of which has commenced. Last year also saw the establishment of Tibet Qomolangma Carpet Limited Company, Tibet Kawajian Carpet and Woolen Handicrafts Limited Company, and Tibet Zhihui Cultural Development Limited Company. A number of enterprises from other parts of the country also set up companies in Tibet. China Ferrous Metals Corporation and Chengdu Qiaofeng Modern Office Equipment Company also invested in Tibet and achieved notable economic results. The policy of attracting funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home has somewhat alleviated the shortage of investment funds in some of Tibet's industries, has brought in technology and information, injected vitality into our region's market economic development, and promoted economic construction. It has been reported that although Tibet is making rapid progress in introducing funds from abroad and developing lateral ties at home, most of the projects involve short periods between technology development and application, are of medium technological levels, and yield speedy economic results. Medium- and long-term investment projects are relatively rare. However, it is believed that as Tibet accelerates its pace of reform and opening up, it will become a much-sought-after destination for domestic and foreign investors. It will not be long before Tibet develops and utilizes its abundant resources.
