As expected, the debate was primarily devoted to Clause 14, which regulates the general arrangements for the naturalization of non-citizens. [passage omitted] The quota principle could be an obstacle to admission to the Council of Europe. This was pointed out in a speech by Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs. In a secret ballot, this quota was removed from the law by majority vote. Thereby, the Saeima this evening accepted the law on citizenship. The voting in the secret ballot was: 66 deputies for; 11 against; three abstentions.
