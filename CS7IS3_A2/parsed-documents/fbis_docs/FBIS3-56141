Birkavs conceded that the incident harmed relations between Latvia and Russia. Its authors were thoughtful enough to choose the most advantageous moment for a provocation, taking into account the coincidence of the Latvian-Russian withdrawal talks, the NATO summit and President Bill Clinton's East European trip, said Birkavs. Latvia will do all it can to remove the incident's consequences and avert similar misdeeds in the future, said the premier. Birkavs also acquainted the meeting with resolutions approved in last night's emergency session of the Latvian Cabinet. The prime minister said that it was possible to prognosticate the incident but it was impossible to prevent it because of the legislative drawbacks. Last night's resolutions at least allow for the prosecution of the responsible persons, Birkavs said. Latvian Foreign Minister Goergs Andrejevs said he hoped that Russia would not draw a link between the incident and the Latvian official policies. Interior Minister Girts Kristovskis noted that Latvia's military structures were "haphazardly arranged" because of various historical and political circumstances. The National Security Council finished to define rights and duties of armed formations Monday, Kristovskis added. The Russian response was "adequate to the status quo of bilateral relations," said Birkavs. The Latvian Foreign Ministry prepared an answer to the Russian Government on the yesterday's conflict, Birkavs concluded.
