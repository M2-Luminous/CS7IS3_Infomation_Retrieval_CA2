This statement was made by Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia [KSCM] Chairman M. Grebenicek at a news conference. He expressed his dissatisfaction with the Czech Government's immediate agreement to this proposal without a public debate and called for a referendum. According to Deputy Chairman M. Ransdorf, the Partnership will make considerable claims on the Czech Republic's budget. He emphasized the likelihood of a "certain yielding of part of our state sovereignty" without clear security guarantees. According to the KSCM, collective security should be based on the CSCE. M. Stiborova, chairwoman of the Left Bloc Party, said that Partnership for Peace will not resolve our entry into NATO. In her opinion, not even the expansion of NATO is a path toward collective European security. According to Stiborova, the CSCE should form the basis for European security.
