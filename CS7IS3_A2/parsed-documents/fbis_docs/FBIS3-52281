He promised that efforts would continue to obtain the closure of these two centers. Bara said that the implementation of the anti-terrorism law had led to abuse in some cases, especially with regard to the way in which searches were conducted and the failure of the authorities to respect the duration of preventive detention, which does not exceed 12 days according to the anti-terrorism law. The chairman of the National Human Rights Monitoring Group did not conceal the fact that there were abuses and a number of suspicious deaths. According to him, the monitoring group had asked for judicial inquiries to be opened in this regard. On the question of torture, which the monitoring group condemns, Bara stressed that no incriminating complaints had been made to the judicial authorities, which would have made it possible to open a judicial inquiry against those accused of practicing torture. He said that the only thing in this respect was that about 12 complaints of ill treatment had been recorded. Judicial inquiries had been opened on these issues and those against whom the accusations had been proven had been punished. Bara said that the detainees he had mentioned were those remaining from an original total of 9,000 detainees who had been sent to seven different security centers last March.
