We welcome, Chigwedere said at the air terminal, someone who represents a state that has shown its solidarity with Zimbabwe since its struggle for independence and with which we share many positions. The high-ranking official spoke on behalf of Foreign Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, who will be abroad until tomorrow. Robaina described as a privilege the visit of the delegation he is heading, because it affords the opportunity of a direct contact with something that is part of our African history and traditions. "We aspire to know each other better, to explain how my people live and work, and to exchange mutually beneficial experiences," he stated. The Cuban minister will complete a three-day visit during the third leg of an area tour which started in Ghana and Angola and will continue in Zambia and Namibia. The welcoming ceremony was attended by Cuban Ambassador Designate Pedro Nunez Mosquera and Charge d'affaires Marcos Rodriguez Costa, among other officials.
