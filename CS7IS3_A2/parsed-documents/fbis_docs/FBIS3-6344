The Bank of Thailand and the Securities Exchange of Thailand will render cooperation to and closely coordinate with the Vietnamese national bank. Such exchanges of experience and information will help strengthen the financial services of the two countries. I believe we all agree that the present world economic system will advance firmly if we can build up and develop a strong base in financial services. We must be prepared for rapidly increasing competition. The cooperation which exists under the principle of good understanding and mutual benefit will form an important foundation for multilateral relations, which will lead to a collaboration of quality power [khunaphap phalang]. I believe that good relations among the countries in the region, especially the countries in the Mekong River basin, will enable us to cope with problems that may arise in sharing the use of natural resources. We will work to jointly preserve and improve the environment to benefit our present and future generations. [passage omitted] During my visit to Vietnam, leading figures from business institutions in major fields are joining the trip so they will be directly informed of certain policies of both Thailand and Vietnam that will promote trade and investment. This will create mutual benefit within a definite framework and regulations. They will be able to observe the economic potential of Vietnam. Furthermore, both sides must carry out necessary activities to promote trade and investment cooperation by supplying each other with clear and correct information. Therefore, I am pleased that Thai and Vietnamese investment promotion organizations have jointly organized a seminar to seek ways to further expand trade and investment cooperation.
