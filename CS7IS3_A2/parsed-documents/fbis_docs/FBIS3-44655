They were addressing the opening session of the Second National Women Workers Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). Xue Zhaojun, vice-chairman of the ACFTU, presided over the meeting and was elected chairman of the Second Women Workers Committee. The National Women Workers Committee directly under the ACFTU was founded in 1991. So far, similar committees have been set up in all the 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities across the country. According to statistics from ten of the provinces, the economic returns created by women workers over the past five years amounted to 4.3 billion yuan. This came about because women workers provided 3.87 million suggestions, increased productivity, practiced economy and carried out technical innovations. The meeting called for close attention to be paid to protecting the legal rights and special interests of women workers, and to raising their abilities. Wei Jianxing, chairman of the ACFTU, and other union leaders also attended and made speeches at today's meeting.
