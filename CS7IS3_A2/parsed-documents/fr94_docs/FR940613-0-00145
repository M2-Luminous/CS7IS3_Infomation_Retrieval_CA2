FR940613-0-00145 FR940613-0-00018 Response. The Department agrees that the potential applicability of the definition of ``land modification'' to utility maintenance activities is unclear. Indeed, while ``land modification'' was included in §292.21 of the proposed rule, it was not used elsewhere; therefore, it has been deleted from the final rule. Absent this term, the Department construes the standard at §292.23(a)(4) of the final rule as accommodating reasonable road access to utility facilities provided that such access is associated with the routine and necessary maintenance of these facilities. In addition, further review of the definition section disclosed that the terms, ``Comprehensive management plan,'' ``seasonal feedlots,'' and ``zoning'', were not used in the proposed rule; accordingly, those terms have not been retained in the final rule. All other terms and their definitions are retained without change in the final rule. Section 292.22␣Land Category Assignments The proposed rule established four categories to which private lands in the HCNRA would be assigned and would require that maps showing private lands and the categories to which they have been assigned be on file and available for public inspection at the Ranger's office. Comment. One reviewer complained that the map identifying the private lands in the HCNRA and the land use category to which they had been assigned was not available for review during the comment period on the proposed rule. Response. The Department regrets that the map was unavailable, since this could have been of some assistance to the parties in the preparation of their comments on the rule. The Department has modified this section in the final rule to require the map (or maps) to be prepared and available for review not later than 60 days after the effective date of this regulation and also to require the Ranger to give notice of the availability of the maps in the local newspapers of record. If any parties are concerned about a specific land category assignment, they can make their concerns known to the Forest Service at that time, and the Forest Service will consider these concerns prior to the adoption of a final map. No other changes were made to this section. Section 292.23␣Standards of Compatible Land Use and Development The proposed rule would establish standards of private land use and development that reflect traditional and valid uses of private lands in existence as of December 31, 1975 for four categories of land use. These categories were farm/forest/grazing, mining, residential, and commercial land. The standards for these land categories were intended to guide the Ranger in determining whether uses of a private parcel are compatible with the purposes for which the HCNRA was established. Some standards applied to all categories of private lands, while others were specific only to a particular land category. Standards were prescribed to allow conformity of private land uses and developments with the laws of various jurisdictions. Among other things, the proposed rule set standards for the screening and blending of new and replacement structures, banned solid waste and hazardous substance disposal sites, required utility lines to be buried, disallowed new or replacement structures in wilderness, and provided for the protection of historic and archaeological sites. Comment: Expense of underground utility installation. One reviewer noted that the standard in §292.23(a)(4) regarding the placement of new or replacement of existing utility lines underground could be prohibitively expensive and environmentally damaging. Response. While this standard clearly establishes a preference for underground utility installation wherever feasible, the Department is well aware of the rugged and varied terrain in the HCNRA and the difficulty, if not impossibility, of installing utility lines underground in certain areas. It is for that reason that the standard in the proposed rule regarding underground utility installation included the caveat ``where ground conditions and topography permit.'' Therefore, a change in the final rule was necessary. It is recognized that, by necessity, the evaluation of the location of utility lines must be made on a case-by-case basis. Comment: Wilderness structures. One reviewer opposed the standard in §292.23(a)(5) which provided that no new structures could be developed on private lands within the boundaries of the Hells Canyon Wilderness in the HCNRA. This reviewer stated that this standard oversteps the professed bounds of the law. This reviewer further contended that such a restriction should apply only if the structure would be visible from the wilderness, since otherwise there would be no negative effect on anyone's wilderness experience. The reviewer also stated that nothing in the Wilderness Act permitted wilderness visitors to trespass on private lands.
