[Al-Husayni] I believe that this will take place within the next few days, whereby this authority will be able to take over all its powers when Israel concludes its withdrawal. Great tasks lie ahead of the authority that is to be established. These include implementation of the Cairo agreement, rebuilding the infrastructure in the areas from which the Israeli forces will pull out, preparing for deployment in the other areas from which Israel will withdraw in the future, and preparing for free and democratic elections that will be held in the middle of October. [Ben-Menahem] Will you participate in the future Palestinian authority? [Al-Husayni] If I am assigned to this authority I will discuss the assignment and see what my duty will be. If this is within my capabilities and abilities I believe that it will be incumbent upon me to accept. [Ben-Menahem] According to reports, a large number of West Bank and Gaza Strip figures have expressed reservation in accepting participation in this authority. What is your position regarding this reservation? [Al-Husayni] I believe we have the right to have reservations. I myself have reservations on the Cairo agreement, but we should not have reservations on performing our duties if this chance is provided to us in an open and good manner and if the powers and responsibilities are determined. If such an opportunity is offered to me and if the powers and responsibilities are determined and clear, I believe that I should accept. [Ben-Menahem] Then according to your assessment those figures will not refuse the appointments by Yasir 'Arafat? [Al-Husayni] I believe that the position of a large number of those figures in terms of whether to accept or not stems from their lack of confidence that the picture and the responsibilities will be clear. Therefore, I believe that entering a new stage in which the responsibilities and powers are defined in a pyramidal way can serve the coming stage. [Ben-Menahem] Is there a split between the residents of the occupied territories and the diaspora regarding the issue of the future Palestinian authority? Is it true that the residents do not accept those from the outside to arrive and govern the people? [Al-Husayni] There is absolutely no such thing. In fact, I have met many people outside who hold opinions similar to those inside. I have also found many people inside who hold different opinions but they are identical with those of the outside. The issue is not inside or outside but how one thinks. A Palestinian may affiliate himself with the inside or outside irrespective of a position. [Ben-Menahem] But do most of the figures in the West Bank fear that the outside, the PLO, will come here and govern the people? [Al-Husayni] No. I do not believe there is such a thing, although if some are objecting it is against the decisionmaking approach. Some here have such reservations, but not so much against personalities as against the decisionmaking approach.
