In an interview with Interfax in Bucharest where Brazauskas arrived for taking part in the international forum on the burning economic and political problems, the Lithuanian leader noted that after the resignation of the chairman of the Belarussian parliament Stanislav Shushkevich "meetings suspended" between corresponding intergovernmental delegations and experts of Foreign Ministries. The Lithuanian president intends to discuss this subject with the head of the Belarussian parliament Mechyslaw Hyrb now visiting Bucharest and hopes that corresponding talks will resume in the near future. Brazauskas made it clear that he intends to insist on the division of the border railway station Adutiskes claimed by both states and on its joint use. Interfax has information that the dispute over this station occurred during the delimitation of the Belarussian-Lithuanian border at the level of experts.
