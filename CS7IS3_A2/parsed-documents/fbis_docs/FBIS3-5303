"There are still some concrete problems that will be discussed at the next meeting at the working level," a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP without specifying when or where the next round of discussions would take place. U.S. State Department officials refused to comment on the talks. The bilateral meeting, the first since Washington lifted an economic embargo on Vietnam on February 4, lasted two days and brought together State Department, Treasury and Justice Department officials with their Vietnamese counterparts. Claims by the two sides are estimated to total more than 500 million dollars in assets seized or frozen following the fall of Saigon in 1975. The opening of reciprocal representative offices in Hanoi and Washington, proposed by US President Bill Clinton, has already been accepted in principle by Vietnam. U.S. delegation leader, James Hall, at his own request visited sites of searches for American servicemen missing in action, said the Vietnamese spokesman.
