Only the PS absolutely refuses the possibility of resignation. The party of the French-speaking socialists repudiated former Minister Philippe Moureaux, who provided material to investigating Magistrate Vronique Ancia for the Agusta case. MP's from Flemish majority parties told DE STANDAARD they would find it difficult to vote no to a proposal calling for the dismissal of Come. The official CVP [Christian People's Party] position is that any judgment on political and criminal responsibility should be suspended until Come has defended himself before the parliamentary committee on Thursday [13 January]. However, the CVP does want the investigations to speed up "as requested by investigating Magistrate Ancia." The SP [Dutch-speaking Socialist Party] says that the matter must be clarified and has "full confidence in the SP MPs and senators in the parliamentary committees" which are judging the question. Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes, who was minister for economic affairs when the helicopters were purchased, did not attend the meeting due to the NATO summit. When asked by DE STANDAARD, most CVP MPs said that in any event it would be best for Come to resign voluntarily. If a proposal was made to parliament demanding his dismissal, most of them would find it hard to vote against. The same answer was heard from numerous SP MPs. The party bureau of the Flemish liberals said the three PS ministers mentioned in the Agusta case -- Federal Deputy Prime Minister Guy Come, Walloon Minister-President Guy Spitaels, and Walloon Regional Minister Guy Mathot -- should resign. "They no longer have the moral authority for their position," the party leadership said. "If Come does not reach that decision himself, then Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene must force him to resign." The Volksunie [People's Union] said the PS ministers should resign and noted "with amazement the corrupt partners with which the Flemish Government parties" remain in government. The VU pointed to the differences in political culture which "are an obstacle to living together in a federal state." The Vlaams Blok [Flemish Block] wondered why the blame was being shoved onto Come, while former Economic Affairs Minister Willy Claes (SP) was jointly responsible for the purchase of the Agusta helicopters. For Agalev [Dutch-speaking Green Party], Deputy Prime Minister Come should resign at least temporarily. Agalev said it was unacceptable that "PS President Philippe Busquin is denying there is a problem." The French-speaking liberals [PRL] said that "a situation should be avoided where a scandal which affects a few leading figures spreads to the whole political system." The PRL said the matter should proceed quickly, "with respect of the rights of the suspect." The PSC [Social-Christian Party] said that "calm was necessary to uncover the truth."
