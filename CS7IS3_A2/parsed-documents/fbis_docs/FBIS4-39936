The program was recorded 10 June. Reception is good. Yavlinskiy is speaking with an unidentified correspondent in the lobby of the Duma. He begins by summing up the budget debate in the State Duma. Yavlinskiy then asserts that the Russian parliament was not properly equipped to debate the matter properly. He says that "the Duma was not sufficiently prepared to debate each budget amendment individually. This is linked with the fact that neither the Duma nor, in my opinion, any of the other representative bodies are in any way ready to tackle the budget question as such. We lack a control chamber, a real budget control committee. Strictly speaking, there is no one in Russia's representative bodies independently analyzing the budget in detail. This is a serious problem, as the budget contains the money of every citizen of this country of ours. Under proper conditions, there is always control over how a government uses the money entrusted to it." After outlining his faction's proposals to amend the budget, noting that 73 percent of these proposals were adopted, Yavlinskiy stresses the incompetence of the Duma to tackle the budget. He then responds to a question on the political battles in the budget debate. Yavlinskiy replies: "From our point of view, this budget does not mirror the priorities we need to get the country out of crisis. We have consistently said that a budget like this is not worthy of the country. It does not expand reform, it does not make life any easier for people, it puts up taxes, and does not address our pressing problems. Moreover, it lacks any priorities whatsoever. That was our stance on the budget as a whole. so we decided that such a budget should not be passed." Yavlinskiy then turns his attention to the military budget and the failed attempt to increase it by 18 trillion rubles. He portrays this as an attempt to destabilize the Russian political situation. He says: "As for the 18 trillion, then an amendment to the budget on that scale should be decided by the president as the supreme commander in chief. It happened that neither the government nor the president wanted to make such an amendment. Strictly speaking, what were the grounds for allowing this question to become a topic for debate? I don't think that an individual deputy can make an amendment on that scale when the budget is in the process of being adopted. "The time up through 10 June has been used to create an atmosphere of confrontation. This is a policy we are familiar with. We have already gone through one tragedy in connection with this policy and it is unfolding again as follows. "There was--and there remains--a problem linked to funding defense and the defense industry. The Duma debated the matter. Neither the president nor the government had any amendments to make on the matter in question. We took the decision we were able to take within the limits of the revenue and expenditure approved. Then, out of the blue, it was said that the upper chamber was principally opposed to the Duma's decision, that it was accusing it of some sort of non-statesman-like behavior's, and that it was possible that events might so develop that the president would address the upper chamber to say that the Duma was not up to its job and that the real champions of the people's happiness were in the upper chamber. "I want to emphasize that this confrontational situation has been created absolutely artificially. The political situation has been aggravated for no good reason. It is hard to explain why then, for instance, Mr. Rybkin and Mr. Shumeyko signed such a grand treaty on accord if the impression is given that they are constantly looking for a pretext to create a new enemy. "As for the president, he has still to make his position clear on this issue. The last thing I want to see and the thing that worries me most is that this whole situation being might be used to whip up a gigantic confrontation, between the chambers of the Federal Assembly, and then with the president taking the side of one of the chambers. That's the most unpleasant aspect of this affair."
