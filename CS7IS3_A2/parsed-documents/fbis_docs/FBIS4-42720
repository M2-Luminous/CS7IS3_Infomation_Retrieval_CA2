Linda Mottram reports from France: Mr. Keating stepped back from comments last year in a trade row that France had forgotten the sacrifice made for it in the Second World War. [Begin recording] [Mottram] Mr. Keating has praised French President Francois Mitterrand for his thanks during the D-Day celebrations to those countries whose people fought and died in the liberation of Europe in World War II. Mr. Keating says it's now clear to him the French have not forgotten the war sacrifice, as he had claimed in France last year at the tense end of the Uruguay Round of international trade negotiations. Mr. Keating's next engagement in France is a meeting with President Mitterrand. [Keating] This is a good opportunity, I think, to, you know, again go over common ground with the government of France and I'll be looking forward to meetings with President Mitterrand and Prime Minister Balladur.
