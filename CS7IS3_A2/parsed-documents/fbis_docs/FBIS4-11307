The legislative leader explained the Cuban Government's position during the first session of the The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which began this morning with the participation of 210 Cubans living in 27 countries. Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the three-day event, the proceedings of which will be private, noted that Alarcon described the idea that a society must have a multiparty system to be democratic as a myth. He said the multiparty system divides people into groups separated by interests that are not necessarily those of the nation. Regarding Cuba, the single party is not a creation of the revolution (begun in 1959) but has its roots in the turn of the last century, when Jose Marti began our struggle for independence, Alfonso stated. He explained that in Cuba's special case, when we have a powerful nation so close to our coasts that has never renounced its intent to take over the island, anything that could undermine national unity must be carefully studied. The president of the National Assembly of the People's Power [ANPP] was the first important Cuban leader to speak at the event, the fundamental objective of which is to promote the normalization of ties between emigrants and their country. In his speech, the text of which was distributed by organizers of the event, Alarcon explained the real participatory nature of the county's existing democratic system. This is the essence of our system of the people's power: the real connection between the persons chosen by the electors and the real, effective, and systematic participation of the people in all the activities of their government system, he noted. He noted that such principles were demonstrated again in the past few months while the people were discussing measures to improve the country's internal financial situation, basically imbalanced by an excess of money in circulation equivalent to 14 paychecks [salarios], over 11 billion pesos (equal to U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate). He stated that millions of people participated in the process, exercising the authority of the people and direct democracy. Alarcon said the dreams of social equality that have existed since the age of the forefathers of independence of the last century still exist today. The ideals of equality and solidarity are based on humanism, on the humanist tradition of our culture. Such ideals were born with Cubans as part of their nationality, he stated. For Cubans to renounce them, he said, would be more than renouncing a just, noble society worth any sacrifice. It would be renouncing their own identity; it would be renouncing being Cuban. The National Assembly president said that despite the adverse economic situation in Cuba, no school or hospital has been closed and no citizen has been evicted. He said that during one of the assemblies held to analyze solutions to national problems, one of the peasants asked him to tell the conference participants that they would never agree to returning to the past of poverty and sickness that existed before 1959. I know that I express the feelings of millions of Cubans when I say that we will be able to resist and that we will know how to resist, that we will defend the right to dream and will defend the dreams that we have made a reality with so much love and sacrifice.
