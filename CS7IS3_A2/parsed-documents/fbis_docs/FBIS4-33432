Robaina said that Qatar is a very special country because, despite the pressure applied on Cuba and countries that have relations with Cuba, Qatar decided to establish diplomatic relations with the island, relations that led to the establishment of a Cuban Embassy there. "It takes courage to do something like this, and Qatar is brave," Robaina said. He reported that during his stay here negotiations were held on cooperation in the fields of health, sports, and biomedicine, and new methods were discussed to expand bilateral cooperation. Official talks were held in the evening between the Cuban delegation and Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabir Al Thani, during which the friendly ties between the two countries and willingness to strengthen these ties were affirmed. In addition, on Monday Robaina inaugurated the Cuban Embassy in Doha, where diplomatic relations with neighboring Oman will also be handled.
