We are talking about the president's Edict "On a State Land Registry and the Registration of Documents on the Rights To Own Real Estate" and, following that, the government-issued Statute "On the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the Sale of Land Parcels and Other Land Transactions." A land registry is the pride of any country. In the former USSR, it arose over a long period of time and with difficulty and its basis was the rated appraisal of the land's fertility. Today, however, all these efforts have proven to be of little use. Nikolay Komov, the chairman of Roskomzem [Russian Federation Committee on Land Resources and Land Management], expressed his opinion on this matter quite definitively: "The state is the property and the property is the registry." So, the former system could not ensure the rights of an owner to the land -- there was no actual owner. And if the leadership demanded that a birch grove appear on the registry instead of a clearly existing field, then the land managers did what was desired, in any event, on paper. I will not conceal the fact that it was strange to hear this from the head of Russian land management. But it is precisely such revalations which are giving rise to a certain optimism -- now, if the leadership were to demand that a ravine be called a plain, the Russian Federation [RF] Committee on Land Resources and Land Management, we would hope, would not permit this. And 1.7 million hectares of Russian land will be described and, consequently, appraised accurately and impartially. The only cause for concern is the fact that, now, the appraisal of the land's fertility is going, as it were, on the back burner. Meanwhile, the specialists' opinions on the matter of the Statute "On the Holding of Competitions and Auctions for the Sale of Land Parcels and Other Land Transactions" have been sharply divided. For example, the experts from Minselkhoz [Ministry of Agriculture] believe that a number of statutes, adopted government decrees and ones currently in preparation on matters involving the buying and selling of land substantially infringe on the rights of citizens and lay a foundation for turning the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management into the largest land speculator in the country. The document may stimulate a surge of bribery and, in the final tally, discredit the idea of a land market, in particular, because local land committees, along with the functions of monitoring land use, have received the right to buy land and to resell it. And the mechanism for holding the competitions and auctions is also adding problems. For example, "when there are buyers who have a preferential right to purchase a land parcel," a closed auction is held and only in the remaining instances can a seller sell a parcel independently or at a public auction. Since the document does not distinguish lands by categories, this means that any transaction involving the sale of land, including even a vacation parcel, will require authorization from the organs of the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management. The granted right to sell land, the Ministry of Agriculture's experts conclude, is giving rise in Russia to "one more area of corruption" and is curtailing the rights of individual types of owners. Such harsh assessments make it necessary to turn for a commentary to the chairman of the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management, Nikolay Komov. [Gavrilyuk] The edict on the land registry and the government statute on the holding of competitions and auctions for the sale of land parcels went into effect simultaneously. What kind of connection is there between these documents? [Komov] The president instructed the government to prepare, in all, around 10 documents and it is impossible to consider any of them separately. I would call all this a mechanism for the implementation of the president's edict on the regulation of land relations. And the government statute is, if it can be put this way, just a fragment. It will not, for all practical purposes, pertain to lands under agricultural cultivation. Worthless land falls into its domain. Indeed, just as before: the head of an administration decided to give someone a land parcel -- and no one can prevent him from doing this, to build for free a house or a cottage. Now, however, the land will be shown off at auctions. They are already being prepared in the Krasnogorsk, Odintsovsk and Podolsk rayons of Moscow Oblast. Quite a bit of money will go into the treasury. Even now, in some rayons, a plot of land with a cottage being built on it costs several million rubles [R]. Just in Moscow, we are receiving around R40 billion for the right to lease. [Gavrilyuk] What is the special feature of the Edict "On a State Land Registry and the Registration of Documents on the Rights To Own Real Estate"? [Komov] This is an historic document, first of all, because now relations between a citizen, a legal person and lands will be regulated by the Civil Code. It has already been prepared for consideration in the State Duma. The land has been declared real property and, likewise, everything located on it. Prior to the emergence of this edict, land parcels were registered in the land committees and structures in the housing and municipal services organs and everything was broken up, which made it impossible to determine the true value of the land parcel: some got the land and others got the structures on it. Now both have been declared real property and will be appraised together. We will register not just the land, but also everything which has been built on it. For example, in Moscow, the amount of the land tax is being raised by tens of factors. In the near future, a presidential commission on real property matters will be established. [Gavrilyuk] And who will appraise this real property? [Komov] We have two alternatives. First, a special agency for appraising both the land and the structures on it, that is, the real property, will be established. Second, the currently existing technical inventory bureaus will work for us under contract or will transfer into the system of the RF Committee on Land Resources and Land Management. Now, however, in many territories, outright deception of the peasants is occurring, since no one knows the true value of the land and it is being purchased at times for next to nothing. [Gavrilyuk] What will the appraisal mechanism be like? [Komov] A person who wishes to find out the value of his land should turn to us, to the committee, where he will find out the approximate value of the land and the approximate registry for the entire country, but soon it will be precise. The president has already approved a sample copy of a certificate of the right to own land, there will be 80 million of them and all the landowners will receive them in the first half of 1994. Only this document gives the owner of the land parcel the right to lease it out, to mortgage it, to exchange it or to sell it. And so, now, many kolkhozes, sovkhozes and joint-stock companies are buying up from the pensioners their land shares. But what can be bought up when their owners do not have the document for the right to own these shares? Such transactions will not be valid. [Gavrilyuk] Yet, all the same, when will the Russian Land Registry be ready? [Komov] We are introducing it in 1994-1995, but the registration process is very lengthy and, in essence, it is constant. [Gavrilyuk] Why is real property linked with the registry? [Komov] Because not only in our country, but throughout the entire world, no other mechanism has been devised: when land is registered, everything on it is also appraised. And later, supposedly, a data base will be created so we can know what is on the land and under the land; otherwise, it will be absolutely impossible to manage the entire infrastructure. [Gavrilyuk] Let us return, however, to the statute on public and closed auctions. What is the difference here? [Komov] Whereas, with public auctions, everything is clear, who is profiting and who is paying more, when closed auctions are held, there are certain special features. To illustrate, I will cite an example. In Moscow, quite a few gasoline service stations are being opened now. But look -- a third of them, if not half, are not operating -- there is no gasoline. So now, in order to obtain land to lease for that same gas station, the person wishing to open it has to produce during a closed auction a quota, certified in the Ministry of Economics, which certifies that the gasoline service station will be supplied with gasoline, oil and everything needed for normal operation.
