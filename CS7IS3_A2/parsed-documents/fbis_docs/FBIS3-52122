The sources say that it is part of a scheme to undermine Egyptian-Libyan relations by blaming the operation on Libya and paving the way for a military strike against the Libyan Jamahiriyah. The circles noted that an eight-member team from the U.S. intelligence service (CIA) will arrive in Cairo within a few days to investigate the disappearance of al-Kikhya. This is part of the U.S. Administration's plan to highlight the issue to adopt a military plan to strike at Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's regime under the pretext of his violations of human rights. U.S. President Bill Clinton had instructed the U.S. intelligence service to adopt a speedy plan to identify the location of al-Kikhya and investigate claims that Libyan elements kidnapped him in collaboration with Egyptian security elements. He asked President Mubarak to intervene to clear up the mystery of al-Kikhya's disappearance. The visit to Libya of Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's Office for Political Affairs, came within this context. In the past few days Cairo has received several U.S. reports accusing Libya of being involved in al-Kikhya's disappearance. The U.S. reports accused Libyan diplomats in Cairo of planning the operation and called on the Egyptian Government to downgrade its relations with Libya as a quick reaction to the operation. However, Egypt told Washington that it would not adopt any measures against Libya before the accusation is confirmed.
