FBIS4-56579 "drlat088_b_94005" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 5 May 1994 Barbados Haiti Deputies Analyze Clinton `Warning' Deputies Analyze Clinton `Warning' PA0505203694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 1851 GMT 5 May 94 PA0505203694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Port-au-Prince, 5 May (EFE) -- Haitian parliament President Frantz Robert Monde has asked the United States and the United Nations to pressure ousted Haitian President Jean Bertrand Aristide to appoint a prime minister, otherwise the deputies will fill the void in the executive branch. Monde's request, contained in letters sent to President Bill Clinton and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, was disclosed in Haiti on Wednesday. This is one day after the United States presented the UN Security Council a draft resolution for a total trade embargo against Haiti to pressure the military to give up power. Monde indicated to Clinton and Butrus-Ghali that he favors negotiations between Haiti to save whatever is left of the nation. He also asked Clinton not to be influenced by members of what he called "the black caucus" in the U.S. Congress because they are defending their own interests through the Haitian crisis. Meanwhile on Wednesday, a group of deputies analyzed President Clinton's warning to the military coupists to relinquish power. Duly Brutus, from the Progressive Nationalist and Revolutionary Haitian party, socialist in leaning, said the best way to avoid the loss of sovereignty is to request General Raoul Cedras, Armed Forces chief, to fulfill his promise to resign -- in keeping with the agreement signed at Governor's Island in New York in 1993. Nevertheless, other deputies, such as Pierre Francois Vital, have proposed the appointment of a temporary prime minister by parliament until Aristide designates one, as provided for in the Constitution. Legislator Joseph Lambert suggested Aristide be asked to order the Armed Forces to take a position to defend the country in light of possible U.S. military intervention. Lambert said that if Aristide does not issue this order, he will be blamed for the U.S. intervention and tried for it. Senator Bernard Sansaricq reiterated his petition that Constitutional Article No. 149 be implemented, and that Supreme Court President Emile Jonassaint be appointed temporary president. In addition to the critical political situation, two sympathizers of deposed President Aristide were arrested arbitrarily in Port-au-Prince at the end of April. The OAS-UN civilian mission, which is in Haiti supervising the human rights situation, denounced these arrests. The international mission expressed "great concern" over these arbitrary arrests and the illegal detentions, and asked the Armed Forces to respect legal dispositions regarding human rights and the mental integrity of individuals. The wave of violence heightened in the past hours when the body of Jean Verdy Bastien, head of a lottery company, renowned businessman, and owner of the "Celeste F.M" radio station, was found. Bastien, a wealthy businessman who was linked to political groups opposed to President Aristide, was shot to death in Port-au-Prince the night of 4 May. The motive for this murder remains unknown. In April, five employees of another lottery company were also shot to death under circumstances still unknown. Today, local media reported that on 4 May, three bodies riddled with bullets were found in various areas of the country.
