He clearly stated that if North Korea accepts the additional International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection, the third round of U.S.-DPRK talks will begin. In a news conference with foreign reporters at the Press Center on 20 April, Foreign Minister Han said that South-North dialogue is very important for a comprehensive and complete resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue, but the South-North dialogue can be a long-term precondition to solve it. Minister Han also said that what is important under the current situation is for North Korea to accept the IAEA's inspection so that it can prove that it is not developing nuclear weapons. In addition, he stated that if North Korea shows the will to comply with the UN Security Council's president statement, the U.S.-DPRK contact can resume.
