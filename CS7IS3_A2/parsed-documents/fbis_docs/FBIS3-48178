Chokwang Trading Co. originally operated, paying what amounted to only token rental charges, from one of the properties of the late Ho Yin, perhaps the richest and most influential pro-Beijing Chinese businessman in Macao, he explained. Following Ho Yin's death close to 10 years back, some of the properties are being redeveloped and Chokwang will soon move to a property that it had acquired in recent years, according to business sources here. "It is almost certain that the North Korean will continue to use Chokwang as a bridge to the Western world after 1999," the North Korean watcher said. For years, there have been reports that Chokwang had been active as the purchasing or selling agent for North Korea. Back in the early 1970s, North Korea had requested to set up a shop which was intended to act as an intelligence gathering agency in Hong Kong, but the Hong Kong Government declined, he explained. North Koreans were undaunted and set up a shop in a Chinese name with personnel traveling either as Hong Kong citizens or Chinese holding Chinese passports. After their attempts in Hong Kong were thwarted, North Korea finally set up a shop selling North Korean bric-a-brac on one of the main roads in northern Macao, the source disclosed. Later it was expanded and while the shop still functioned, more North Koreans came and set up the Chokwang Trading on Ho Yin's property, according to the watcher. According to him, it had been a common joke that one of the paramount duties of Chokwang was to buy luxury goods for the Kim father and son, the son being particularly prone to a special brand of Swiss chocolate. North Korean watchers first sensed Kim Chong-il's absence from public scene in the mid-1970s, when those involved in monitoring chocolate shipments from Switzerland to North Korea noticed that the shipments had suddenly ceased. At one time, the business activities of Chokwang were so robust that its staff multiplied -- from a mere 11 or 12 in 1975 to more than 100. After the series of terrorist accidents such as KAL bombing and Rangoon assassination attempt, not to mention the kidnapping of a popular Korean actress Choe Un-hui in Hong Kong, the Macao authorities, using a newly promulgated law on residency of aliens as a stick, restricted North Koreans' presence here, according to him. Mario Soares, the Portuguese president, visited Korea in October last year and openly blasted North Korea while visiting the truce village of Panmunjom. Before he flew into Seoul as the first Portuguese president to have ever visited Korea, he spent two days in Macao as part of his itinerary, which culminated in a ceremony in Tokyo to mark the 450th anniversary of Portuguese arrival in Japan. North Korean watchers here said that Soares' outburst at Pyongyang would not materially affect Chokwang's activities in Macao. Nevertheless, the Portuguese security agency appears to be doubling its watch for any intelligence or subversive activities by the North Koreans. "As far as I know, not only is it closely watching Chokwang but also keeping surveillance on all North Korean residents here," he said. Today, according to other sources, Chokwang has a permanent staff of about 30. However, this does not necessarily mean its activities have been curtailed, a North Korean watcher stressed. It means only some annoying inconvenience for them as the North Koreans who arrive in Macao for a day or two's visit now have to go to the nearby Zhuhai Special Economic Zone only to return the next day to continue their business, he concluded.
