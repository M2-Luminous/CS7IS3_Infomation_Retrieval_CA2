The deal is worth a total of from 25 billion to 30 billion francs. The French equipment manufacturer unveiled technical details at the Dubai Air Show regarding two agreements signed with Mikoyan and Sukhoi (see our issue No. 1439) to retrofit MiG-21's, MiG-23's, and Su-22's in partnership with the Phazotron firm, which produced the Doppler radar used on the MiG-29. Those modernization programs are aimed primarily at Asian and East European countries wanting to upgrade their combat fleets consisting basically of older generations of Russian aircraft. In charge of the project at Thomson-CSF is Gerard Le Breton, director of operational projects. He estimates that the potential market (excluding the PRC and the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]) totals from 550 to 600 MiG-21's, from 400 to 500 Su-22's, and a few hundred MiG-23's. That comes to over 1,000 aircraft in all, not counting the related opportunities that will arise if the same program is extended to first-generation Mirage F1's and Mirage III's (from 200 to 300 aircraft)--all told, a gold mine worth from $4 billion to $5 billion. One coveted customer, India, has already expressed a need to modernize between 100 and 150 of the 450 to 500 MiG-21's it still has in flying condition. But while described as a priority, that program has not yet been the object of any official call for bids. Indian intentions regarding an industrial effort expected around 1995 should become clearer in coming weeks or months. Thomson-CSF is not the only beneficiary of special agreements with Mikoyan. Dassault Electronics, in partnership with the Russian research institute GosNIIA, signed a three-party agreement last June covering a more limited modernization program (see the end of this article). There is also especially stiff competition with the Israeli firms IAI and Elbit. They have joined with Romania's Aerostar to propose in particular an independent modernization program for from 100 to 120 MiG-21's belonging to the Romanian Air Force. The Israelis have a letter of intent for four prototypes. Russian participation is not out of the question. The competition also includes Great Britain's GEC-Marconi, which is offering retrofits centered on the Blue Hawk radar, and Italy's FIAR with a variant of its Grifo. In the face of their competition, Thomson-CSF and Sextant Avionics are banking on an extensive and particularly ambitious modernization program. Le Breton says: "We are the only ones proposing a multirole weapon system based on a complete architecture meeting the needs of each customer and capable of being adapted equally well to MiG-21's, MiG-23's, Su-22's, Mirage III's, and Mirage F1's. Each deal is subject to a prior authorization request depending on the customer. The only restrictions imposed absolutely are political in nature and concern such `sensitive' countries as Libya, Iraq, or Syria." The proposal by Thomson-CSF/Sextant includes no fewer than 20 different items of equipment meeting the Mil-Std-1553B bus standard, many of which are already certified (or in service) on French and foreign aircraft. Other items of equipment, including radar, are in development. At the heart of the architecture in question is a wide-angle (26 degrees) so-called smart head-up display [HUD], all of whose functions (symbol generation, display, and keyboard interface with the inertial system) are integrated within a single unit. That HUD is being offered with an OTAL200-1300 camera for image interpretation. The head-down display, consisting of multifunction liquid-crystal displays, is capable of displaying images from the Rubis navigation and targeting system. Also as part of its package, Thomson-CSF is offering the Totem gyrolaser inertial guidance system--which its subsidiary Sextant is also producing for a retrofit of the Air Force's Transall aircraft--combined with a NSS100 Code P GPS [global positioning system] receiver that comes as a separate unit and is capable of horizontal accuracy of 18 m. Another piece of equipment being offered and meeting NATO standards is an SC10 Mk-XII IFF [identification friend or foe] unit in protected mode (Secure). The field of electronic warfare is covered by the installation of a Sherloc radar warning detector, a Barem jamming transmitter, and an ER/IR chaff dispenser. In cooperation with Phazotron, Thomson-CSF is currently developing the Phathom multifunction and multitarget Doppler radar based on Russian Kopyo (MiG-29) and French RDY technology. In that development work, Thomson-CSF is directly involved in the refinement of digital and signal processing systems, while Phazotron is working on the transmitter, receiver, antenna, and power supply. The two equipment manufacturers are working together to refine an analog processor. Characterized by a compact, small-diameter antenna weighing no more than 120 kg, the Phathom is a radar in the generic 40 Nm class with a detection range of from 50 to 60 km in the case of aerial targets, 100 km in the case of ground targets, and 30 km in the case of targets at sea. In air-to-air mode, it is reportedly capable of detecting 24 targets and tracking six using discontinuous data and four in intensified pursuit with the possibility of engaging two at a time using target-seeking missiles with active warheads. According to Mikoyan, the weapon system on the modernized MiG-21 (MiG-21-93) will be able to reach targets flying at an altitude of between 30 and 20,000 meters. In air-to-surface mode, the Phathom, combined with a head-down display, can be connected with the Rubis FLIR navigation and targeting pod, the TMV630 laser rangefinder, and the CLDP laser designator (day/night) pod with modular capability (TV/IR). In the two last-named configurations, it can also be combined with the HMD (helmet-mounted display) (20 degrees) that is being offered as an option. Thomson-CSF feels that the Phathom is currently the best radar available in the retrofit market. "Its performance puts it in the same class as the RDY, although it has less detection capability because of the small diameter of its antenna." Although the current tendency is to use existing armament (air-to-air and air-to-surface) of Russian origin, the weapon systems on the modernized MiG's and Su-22's will make it possible to use missiles or laser-guided bombs made in the West. Thomson-CSF is adding to that the possibility of using a subsidiary infrastructure: mission simulator, NCS (Matra) flight preparation systems, and peripheral equipment. In Gerard Le Breton's opinion, mounting the Phathom on Russian fighter planes of an older generation is only the first stage of a long-range development that it will be possible to apply to more modern aircraft such as the MiG-29, the Su-27, and even the Mirage-2000 10 years from now. But despite that, Thomson-CSF rejects any idea of competing with anything currently in production: "Our proposal is directed at air forces whose temporarily limited budgets do not permit them to consider the acquisition of modern fighter planes, which cost in the neighborhood of from $20 million to $35 million per unit." Depending on the options requested by each particular customer, retrofitting a MiG-21 or Su-22 may cost from $3.5 million to $8.6 million (from 20 million to 50 million francs). The price of the radar alone borders on $1 million, to which can be added $3.5 million for an air-to-surface mission profile based on a CLDP with TV/IR head. "We are more than open to various forms of financing and industrial cooperation that may include subcontracting or technology transfers," says Le Breton, expanding his remarks to encompass the future: "By offering modern equipment on old aircraft, Thomson-CSF is also making a number of potential customers aware of our firm's capabilities and of the most recent products that French aircraft manufacturers have available in the market for new products." The architecture being proposed by Thomson-CSF/Sextant for the Sukhoi Su-22 consists of the following: 1. Radar warning detector (Sherloc). 2. GPS/Glonass (NSS 100P) receiver. 3. Radio altimeter (AHV-6). 4. Gyrolaser inertial guidance system (Totem). 5. Helmet-mounted display (HMD). 6. Smart head-up display (SHUD). 7. Multifunction liquid crystal displays (MFD-55). 8. Radio navigation: VHF/UHF (ERA 2000); VOR/ILS (NR-810A); TACAN (NC12); and IFF MK XII (SC-10). 9. In-flight refueling system and probe. 10. On-board instruments. 11. Multifunction Doppler radar (Phathom). 12. Laser rangefinder (TMV630). 13. Digital mapping. 14. Mission preparation system (CINNA 3PN). 15. Mission computer with recorder and mission playback. 16. FLIR navigation and targeting pod (Rubis). 17. TV/IR laser designation pod (CLDP). 18. Armament (missiles). 19. ECM pod (Barem). 20. Electric generator (Auxilec). 21. Equipment cooling system. 22. Chaff dispenser (cartridges). Dassault Electronics: Different Philosophy In its program for modernizing the MiG-21-93 in cooperation with Mikoyan and the Russian research institute GosNIIAS, Dassault Electronics has taken a different approach than Thomson-CSF. Considering "the urgency of the demand," Dassault Electronics is focusing on "fast response" with a program that is less ambitious in terms of both cost and deadlines. "Rather than proposing a retrofit that might take 30 months, we prefer to offer a more focused modernization available in less than two years." The program announced in June 1993 has two parts: a modular bus/computer (bus 1553) unit that can handle Russian or Western digital weapon systems and a sophisticated electronic warfare unit developed in close cooperation with Mikoyan and based on a new EWS-21 radar warning detector that was inspired by a system recently adopted (over its competitor Sherloc) by the French Air Force for modernizing its Mirage F1's. The entire package has an estimated cost of 15 million francs.
