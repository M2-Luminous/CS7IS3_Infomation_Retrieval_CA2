FBIS TRENDS-03MAY94-EGYPT Government Combating Extremism on the Cultural Front Government Combating Extremism on the Cultural Front SUMMARY The Mubarak regime has launched an unprecedented proactive campaign against extremist groups in government-controlled television and the semi-independent film industry by airing and encouraging productions--including a TV serial, an interview with a ''repentant'' extremist and a movie starring a popular Egyptian actor--that openly address the issue of Islamic militancy. Editors and columnists of the government-owned news media have effectively built on the campaign by lavishly praising the government's efforts and calling for more, while Islamist opposition writers have predictably expressed cynicism over the productions. The campaign's success has been somewhat undermined by al-Azhar's strong criticism of the TV serial's handling of an otherwise arcane issue of religious doctrine- -criticism that appears to have been intended in part to win the institution greater censorship authority over artistic productions. END SUMMARY Government Press Lends Support to "The Family" Cairo's pro-government press offered strong support for the government effort through its strong expressions of approval of "The Family" and published little negative commentary. The 12 March issue of the government-owned weekly Akhbar Al-Yawm conducted a "man-on-the-street" survey to assess reaction to "The Family." The article claimed that the series caused "a tremendous uproar" among Egyptians who identify and sympathize with the central character's efforts to protect his family from extremist influence. Mothers, professionals, and retired civil and military workers expressed "shock," the paper maintained, at the series' portrayal of extremist recruitment and operational activities, and demanded more air time for similar programming. One mother from Upper Egypt, for example, was quoted by Akhbar Al-Yawm as lamenting that "The dangers shown by 'The Family' still surround us in the real world." She stressed that mothers "live in utter fear for their children who are at the vulnerable primary and secondary school years. After they are pulled into following the extremist groups, hundreds of them live in numerous mosques pretending to be devout Muslims, having left school and home. No one knows what happens to them after that!" Also interviewed was Major General Sa'd al-Jayyar, former head of the Police Narcotics Department, who said that with the 'shocking TV showing of loathesome extremist ideas on 'The Family'" he felt "for the first time that all of Egypt will confront terrorism." Clerics Criticize Program Islamic leaders, both establishment and opposition, took Egyptian TV to task for allowing actors instead of Islamic scholars to deal with religious issues. Traditionally sensitive to the public release of any Islamic ideas without its blessing, the al-Azhar establishment followed up its complaints by repeating persistent demands on the government for a greater role in sanctioning Islamic-oriented programming. Muhammad al- Ghazali, an independent shaykh who has at times supported and at times undermined government efforts against extremism (see note 1) simply deemed television drama a non-venue for an anti- terrorism campaign. He stressed in the anti-government biweekly Al-Sha'b, organ of the Socialist Labor Party and principal mouthpiece for its ally the Muslim Brotherhood, that "if the culture of some religious people is faulty, it is established scholars, and not farcical artists, who can correct it" (5 April). (Note 1) Al-Ghazali, who has at times joined in government efforts to preach Islamic moderation, sent shockwaves through Egypt last June when in court testimony he appeared to justify the killing of secularist writer Faraj Fudah by implying that Islamic law prescribes no punishment for an individual who kills an apostate (Al-Jumhuriyah, 23 June 1993). According to Akhbar Al-Yawm, many Egyptian clerics were abroad "directing missionary activities" for Ramadan and, therefore, did not watch the series (12 March). Al-Azhar officials nonetheless voiced strong theological objection to one episode's treatment of the Islamic concept of "torture in purgatory" ['Adhab al-Qabr]. Mufti of Egypt Shaykh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawi, who was in Egypt during the program's airing but said he had not watched it, told Akhbar Al-Yawm that he "received thousands of phone calls and letters at his home and office from people complaining that the series causes them to doubt their religious beliefs" and "mocks and denies the existence of torture in purgatory." Supporting al-Azhar's denouncement of "The Family," he added, "I believe religious doctrinal issues must not be shown on television." When asked why he did not watch the series to verify the complaints he had received, the mufti responded, "Unfortunately I do not have free time to watch TV but I will try to watch in order to form an opinion." The debate between al-Azhar officials and the Ministry of Information over treatment of Islamic issues on television continued in late March. In a 19 March interview with weekly TV magazine Al-Idha'ah Wa Al-Tilifisiyun, Information Minister al- Sharif said in defense of "The Family": "Egyptian media have bravely probed various problems through their presentation of the extremism issue. 'The Family' is not a religious series but a social one which treats many different issues and problems." He emphasized, "The only goal of 'The Family' was to deal with issues through a multi-faceted approach." However, al-Azhar rector Jad al-Haqq 'Ali Jad al-Haqq announced that "al-Azhar is officially responsible for reviewing TV scripts whose episodes discuss religious affairs" (Al-Siyasi Al- Misri, 20 March). Jad al-Haqq stressed that al-Azhar is protesting that "television broadcasted episodes of 'The Family' without its review," particularly in the case of the "torture in purgatory" episode. Al-Siyasi Al-Misri also reported that some telephonic wrangling subsequently occurred between the al-Azhar shaykh and information minister over the shaykh's demands for script review and editorial privileges for religious-oriented texts before and during productions, as well as an al-Azhar- approved revision to the final episode of "The Family" to "change people's understanding of the 'torture in purgatory' concept." Although maintaining his earlier defense of the program, Information Minister al-Sharif acquiesced to Jad-al- Haqq's demands and revised the final episode of the program. Several columnists in the government-owned press, all of whom praised "The Family" for its handling of extremism, took issue with al-Azhar clerics for their "unwarranted" preoccupation with this seemingly minor theological detail in view of "The Family"'s greater goal. For example, Al-Ahram columnist Salamah Ahmad Salamah, who has at times criticized the government for its handling of Islamic extremism (see note 2), addressed the controversial discussion of "torture in purgatory" between "The Family"'s main character and a young boy, asking, "In view of the real problems and concerns which the Islamic World faces, couldn't the questions in this dialogue have passed unnoticed?" (Al-Ahram, 13 March). Al-Jumhuriyah's chairman of the board Samir Rajab criticized the program's detractors, writing on 14 March, "They have found in the series an opportunity to strike at future TV productions instead of commending television for making superior achievements." (Note 2) For example, Salamah criticized the government early on in the current wave of Islamic violence for blaming Islamic extremism entirely on outside sources and ignoring the internal societal and economic roots of the problem (Al-Ahram, 3O June 1992). Television Interview In addition to "The Family," Egyptian television aired in Egypt and regionally via satellite on 27 March an interview with 'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi, a defector from the Islamic extremist group al- Shawqiyun. Several prominent Al-Ahram columnists praised 'Abd- al-Baqi's detailed account of the group's philosophy, recruitment practices, and criminal misdeeds as a "coup" for the Egyptian media war on extremism. Al-Ahram editor-in-chief Ibrahim Nafi' described the televised interview as "a success" which "probably enjoyed the highest viewership in recent years" (1 April). Nafi' thanked and praised Egyptian TV for taking this "wise step . . . without attempting to steer 'Abd-al-Baqi toward denouncing this way of thinking and these crimes, relying instead on his earnest desire to atone for his former role with these groups." In Al-Ahram of 4 April, Salamah Ahmad Salamah described the interview as "perhaps the first time that TV has dared to put a personality like this in a question-and-answer setting before millions of eyes." The columnist deemed the interview a success "in giving broad graphic insight to viewers who base their attitudes about terrorism on what goes on in dark corridors," adding, "This interview is an example of what 'intelligent media' can do to expose some of these misguided people." Columnist Salah Muntasir on 6 April countered the anti-government biweekly Al-Sha'b's claims that 'Abd-al-Baqi was a government spy (Al-Sha'b, 1 April), suggesting that Al-Sha'b's condemnation of the terrorist's defection but not his story lends credence to the visual images of extremism he conveyed in the interview: "'Adil 'Abd-al-Baqi may be an agent for the authorities, but does this deny the ugly picture of extremist groups which he has drawn?" Film Angers Militants Finally, a newly released film, "The Terrorist," is a controversial portrayal of the violent life of an extremist, played by popular Egyptian actor 'Adil Imam, who ultimately renounces militancy. The film has thus far provoked commotion at the nine heavily guarded movie theaters where it is being shown. Scriptwriter Lenin al-Ramli in an 8 April interview with weekly magazine Al-Musawwar claimed that the movie is not about terrorism, nor is it a "propaganda film to mobilize people against terrorism." Nonetheless, various press reports indicate that the movie has angered Islamic militant groups. Several papers reported the arrest of terrorists heading for Cairo to blow up several theaters showing the movie (Al-Akhbar and Al- Wafd, 18 March; Al-Ahrar, 21 March). The Arabic London-based daily Al-Hayah on 26 March reported from "a security source" that at the Normandy Theater "a dispute broke out between some moviegoers and security guards," ending in "the two sides clashing" and "one guard wounded." Implications The recent productions dealing with Islamic extremism represent a clear milestone in the government's attempt to use the media against the militants. While the government will probably make good on Interior Minister al-Alfi's promises to forge ahead on the media battleground, the effectiveness of its campaign will largely be determined by how honestly it confronts the broader issues surrounding extremism--including its societal and economic roots and the government's past mistakes in addressing the problem--and how much credibility any future productions are likely to enjoy. As it has previously done, the government will likely further appease al-Azhar clerics by allowing them to review future programs that address religious issues, but only to the extent that anti-terrorism campaign objectives are still achieved.
