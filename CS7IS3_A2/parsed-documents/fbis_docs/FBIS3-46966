The CMIT is one of five finance-related OECD committees whose observer status Korea requested in July last year as a step to becoming a full member of the body composed of 24 advanced economies in 1996. A ministry official said that the Paris-based OECD is expected to allow Korea observer status to the remaining four committees soon. The four are the committee on international investment and multinational enterprises (CIME), the insurance committee, the committee on financial markets and the committee on fiscal affairs. The gaining of observer status to the CMIT, a key move for a country seeking to join the OECD, is expected to promote internationalization of Korea's financial and capital sectors, the official said. Now, Mexico, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are active as observers to the CMIT. The OECD has a total of 26 committees and four organs, of which Korea is a regular member or observer to 10.
