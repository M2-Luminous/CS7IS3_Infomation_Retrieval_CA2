FBIS4-60341 "drnes100_n_94005" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 9 May 1994 LEBANON Iranian Aid to Islamic Jihad `Completely Severed' Iranian Aid to Islamic Jihad `Completely Severed' NC2005184294 Beirut AL-SHIRA' in Arabic 9 May 94 p 10 NC2005184294 Beirut AL-SHIRA' Arabic BFN [Text] Iran has completely severed its financial aid to the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. The movement has traditionally had good relations with Iran. Its secretary general, Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, was given a head-of-state welcome when he visited Tehran two months ago to participate in celebrations marking the international Jerusalem day. He was also given the honor of delivering his speech right after the Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i gave his. Al-Shiqaqi left Tehran with many promises of support for his movement but none of these promises came true. On the contrary, all assistance was cut off, a Palestinian source told AL-SHIRA'. According to the same source, the Iranian move can be explained either by there being differences among various factions within the Iranian authority or by a change in Iranian policy. The latter is more likely, the source said, because Iran is giving more priority to the Arab Gulf region, the (formerly Soviet) Islamic republics, and Afghanistan. The source added that Iran wishes to allay western pressure on Iran by declining to play a direct role in the Middle East. The United States had advised Iran not to oppose the Gaza-Jericho agreement, or to obstruct the agreement signed in Oslo and the peace process. According to the same source, Iran made a number of promises to the alliance of Palestinian forces but it failed to deliver. This indicates that Iran is not serious in what it says. The source said Iran determines its policy in light of its own interests, not the interests and designs of those vying for its help. The source predicted that Iran will eventually discontinue its already reduced aid to Hizballah. Iran used to pay pensions to the families of those killed in the course of the intifadah through the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, in appreciation of the latter's role in the intifadah and the impressive operations it mounted against Israeli forces and settlers. Two years ago, however, this assistance was discontinued. The reason was that Iran supported a split within the movement's ranks in which Shaykh Sayyid Barakah, a former leader of the movement, announced the establishment of Hizballah (Palestine). Barakah failed to win over al-Jihad members, however, and al-Shiqaqi refused to give in to his breakaway group. Consequently, Iran shifted its support away from al-Shiqaqi, giving Barakah command of al-Shahid [martyr] institution in Lebanon. Meanwhile, it gave the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] the responsibility of distributing the pensions to the martyrs of the intifadah. According to press reports, PFLP-GC Central Committee Member Mustafa Khamis, who lives in Jordan, recently broke away from the PFLP-GC, and formed an Islamic General Command [qiyadah 'amah islamiyah]. No reason was given for the split. Khamis spent 15 years in Israeli jails, and was released in 1979 in an exchange of prisoners between Israel and the PFLP-GC. Khamis' motives for the split are said to be linked with PFLP-GC suspicions surrounding his role in forging documents and embezzling funds allocated to the martyrs families in the occupied land. Iran has no remaining allies in Palestine and Lebanon who are not so employed.
