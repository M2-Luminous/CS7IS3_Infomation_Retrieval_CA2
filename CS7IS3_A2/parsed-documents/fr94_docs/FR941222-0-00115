FR941222-0-00115 FR941222-0-00018 50 CFR Parts 611, 672, and 676 [Docket No. 941249&hyph;4349; I.D. 112894C] Foreign Fishing; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Limited Access Management of Federal Fisheries In and Off of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Interim 1995 initial specifications of groundfish, associated management measures, and closures. SUMMARY: NMFS issues interim 1995 initial total allowable catches for each category of groundfish and specifications for prohibited species bycatch allowances for the groundfish fishery of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). NMFS is closing specified fisheries consistent with the interim 1995 groundfish specifications. The intended effect is to conserve and manage the groundfish resources in the GOA. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1995, until the effective date of the final 1995 initial specification, which will be published in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: The preliminary Stock Assessment and Fishery Evaluation (SAFE) Report, dated September 1994, is available from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kaja Brix, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The domestic and foreign groundfish fisheries in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA are managed by NMFS according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP). The FMP was prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. The FMP is implemented by regulations for the foreign fishery at 50 CFR part 611 and for the U.S. fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672, 676, and 677. General regulations that also pertain to the U.S. fisheries appear at 50 CFR part 620. This action provides certain specifications for the 1995 fishing year on a preliminary or interim basis, including: (1) Specifications of total allowable catch (TAC) for each groundfish target species category in the GOA and apportionments thereof among domestic annual processing (DAP), joint venture processing (JVP), total allowable level of foreign fishing (TALFF), and reserves; (2) apportionments of reserves to DAP; (3) apportionments of the sablefish TAC to vessels using hook-and-line and trawl gear; (4) apportionments of pollock TAC; (5) apportionments of Pacific cod TAC; (6) ``other species'' TAC; (7) halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limits; (8) seasonal allocations of the halibut PSC limits, (9) interim groundfish harvest specifications, (10) the opening date of the directed fishery for sablefish for hook-and-line gear, and (11) closures to directed fishing. A discussion of each of these measures follows. 1. Proposed Establishment of TACs and Apportionments Thereof Among Domestic Annual Processing (DAP), Joint Venture Processing (JVP), Total Allowable Level of Foreign Fishing (TALFF), and Reserves Under §672.20(c)(1)(ii), NMFS, after consultation with the Council, publishes in the Federal Register preliminary specifications of annual TACs and interim harvest limits. These preliminary specifications indicate apportionments of TACs among DAP, JVP, reserves, and TALFF for each target species and the ``other species'' category. The sum of the TACs for all species must fall within the combined optimum yield (OY) range, of 116,000&hyph;800,000 metric tons (mt), established for these species. Species TACs are apportioned initially among DAP, JVP, TALFF, and reserves under §§611.92(c)(1) and 672.20(a)(2). DAP amounts are intended for harvest by U.S. fishermen for delivery and sale to U.S. processors. JVP amounts are intended for joint ventures in which U.S. fishermen deliver their catches to foreign processors at sea. TALFF amounts are intended for harvest by foreign fishermen. Existing harvesting and processing capacity of the U.S. industry is capable of utilizing the entire 1995 TAC specification for GOA groundfish. Therefore, the Council recommended that DAP equal TAC for each species category, resulting in no proposed amounts of TALFF or JVP for the 1995 fishing year. The reserves for the GOA are 20 percent of the TACs for pollock, Pacific cod, flatfish target species categories, and ``other species.'' Given that the GOA groundfish TACs have been utilized fully by DAP since 1987, NMFS has reapportioned all the reserves to DAP. The Council met from September 28 to October 5, 1994, to review scientific information concerning groundfish stocks. The preliminary SAFE Report, dated September 1994, prepared and presented to the Council by the GOA Plan Team (Plan Team), summarizes the best available scientific information. The September 1994 SAFE Report contains revised stock assessments for all species except sablefish and demersal shelf rockfish (DSR). New assessments for these two species are discussed in the final SAFE Report issued in November. New stock assessment models were used in the assessments for Pacific cod, arrowtooth flounder, and thornyhead rockfish. Additional information, based on 1993 trawl surveys, was presented for pollock, slope rockfish, Pacific ocean perch (POP), pelagic shelf rockfish, and the flatfish groups. Details of the assessments can be found in the September 1994 SAFE Report. The total ABC amount recommended by the SSC and accepted by the Council was a range from 481,090 &hyph; 533,690 mt. The range accounted for the recommended ABC range in the Pacific cod stock. The total TAC amount recommended by the Advisory Panel (AP) was 326,515 mt. The AP recommended a 1995 TAC equal to the 1995 ABCs, as recommended by the SSC, for pollock, rex sole, sablefish, shortraker/rougheye, other rockfish, northern rockfish, pelagic shelf rockfish, DSR, and thornyhead rockfish. The AP recommendation for a 1995 TAC for Pacific cod was equal to the upper end of the range (103,000 mt) recommended by the SSC. The Council considered information in the SAFE Report, recommendations from its SSC and its AP, as well as public testimony. The Council then accepted the ABCs as recommended by the SSC and, with the exception of ``other rockfish,'' the TACs as recommended by the AP. The Council chose a TAC range for ``other rockfish'' that ranged from the 1994 TAC amount of 2,235 mt to the 1995 ABC amount of 6,930 mt. This range was recommended to recognize the need for conservative management of this group. However, NMFS must manage the fisheries based on a single TAC amount, rather than on a range of numbers. NMFS has chosen to propose a TAC of 6,930 mt, which is the number proposed by the AP and is the ABC that was recommended from the 1994 stock assessment. Even though this number will be used to establish the 1995 interim TAC until the final specifications are implemented, no practical difference exists in choosing any number within the Council's recommended TAC range. The hook-and-line fisheries typically do not harvest other rockfish and the trawl fisheries for rockfish do not open until July 1, by which time the final specifications will be published. NMFS also revises the Council's recommendation for the 1995 flathead sole TAC. The Council approved the AP recommendation of adopting the 1994 TAC amounts for flathead sole for the 1995 TAC amounts. In the GOA Eastern Regulatory Area, the 1994 TAC amount (3,000 mt) is higher than the Council's recommended 1995 ABC (2,740 mt). To maintain consistency with the accepted policy of setting TACs lower than or equal to ABC amounts, NMFS is proposing to establish a 1995 TAC of 2,740 mt for the Eastern Regulatory Area. This number is equal to the 1995 ABC recommended by the Plan Team and the SSC and approved by the Council. Adjustment of the flathead sole TAC in the Eastern Regulatory Area changes the total 1995 flathead sole TAC to 9,740 mt. This also results in a revised ``other species'' TAC amount of 15,535 mt and a revised 1995 total GOA TAC of 326,242 mt. The 1995 ABCs, TACs and interim TACs, as well as the ABC and TAC apportionments, are shown in Table 1.
