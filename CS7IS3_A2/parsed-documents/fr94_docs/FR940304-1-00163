FR940304-1-00163 FR940304-1-00014 At those levels of efficiency, the incremental consumer price increases are $87.13, $213.97, $1,025.41, and $1,839.60 for standard levels 1&hyph;4, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The per-unit reduction in annual cost of operation (energy expense) at level 1 is $32.77; standard level 2 would reduce energy expenses by $42.51; standard level 3 by $59.53; and standard level 4 by $68.16. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.1. The Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model results for pool heaters show that revised standards would result in increases in a prototypical manufacturer's short-run return on equity from the 17.9 percent in the base case. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce short- run return on equity's of 18.0 percent, 18.4 percent, 19.7 percent and 19.9 percent, respectively. Revised standards have even greater increases in long- run return on equity. Standard levels 1 through 4 are projected to produce long-run return on equity's of 18.7 percent, 20.1 percent, 26.0 percent and 29.9 percent, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Most financial data of the type needed to characterize the prototypical manufacturer are generally not available because most real firms are subsidiaries or divisions of larger parent companies. Hence, DOE assumes that the prototypical firm has largely the same financial characteristics (e.g. debt-equity ratio, interest rate on debt, etc.) as parent firms. Financial data for the parent firms are based on publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission 10K reports and company annual reports. B. Life-cycle cost and net present value. A life-cycle cost is calculated for a unit meeting each of the candidate standard levels. For pool heaters, life-cycle costs at all standard levels other than level 3 and level 4, the max tech level, are less than the baseline unit. Of the four candidate standard levels, a unit meeting level 1 has the lowest consumer life-cycle cost. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. However, other than at the max tech level, consumers do not purchase units of the same efficiency. At each candidate standard level, the Department determines the average change in life-cycle costs by considering only those consumers who are being forced by the standard to move from a lower efficiency unit to one which just meets the standard level being considered. This is done by assuming in the base case a distribution of purchases of units meeting the efficiencies of the various standard levels. The base case distribution is based on the distribution of current sales as a function of efficiency. As each standard level is examined, the change in life-cycle cost reported is the average change only for affected consumers. Under this scenario, standard level 1 would cause reductions in life-cycle costs for the average affected consumer of $231.13 and standard level 2 would reduce average life-cycle costs by $198.94. These life-cycle cost reductions indicate that standard levels 1 and 2 would not cause any economic burden on the average consumer. Standard level 3 would increase average life-cycle costs by $447.19, and standard level 4 would increase average life-cycle costs by $1,177.57. See Technical Support Document, Table 4.2. While DOE examined the effect of different discount rates (4, 6, and 10 percent) on the life-cycle cost curves and generally found little impact, the Department did not consider higher discount rates, since such rates would be beyond the range of real, after-tax rates that consumers would likely face in financing the purchase of pool heaters. Similarly, DOE did not consider different energy prices, including regional prices, in the life-cycle cost analysis. Since any standard is to be a national standard, DOE believed that national average energy prices were appropriate. The net present value analysis, a measure of the net savings to society, indicates that standard level 1 would produce a net present value of $0.14 billion to consumers. The corresponding net present values for levels 2&hyph;4 are $0.13 billion, negative $1.09 billion, and negative $2.44 billion, respectively. See Technical Support Document, Table 3.6. C. Energy savings. As indicated above, standards will result in significant savings of electricity consumption for pool heaters. D. Lessening of utility or performance of products. As indicated above, DOE established classes of products in order to assure that the standards analyzed would not lessen the existing utility or performance of pool heaters. E. Impact of lessening of competition. The determination of this factor must be made by the Attorney General. F. Need of the nation to save energy. In 1987, 0.8 percent of residential sector natural gas consumption (or 0.04 quad) was accounted for on a national basis by pool heaters. In addition, decreasing future energy demand as a result of standards will decrease air pollution. See Technical Support Document, Appendix D of Volume A. 44 Decreases in air pollution will occur for nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated NO 2 reduction would be 4,000 tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of NO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is less than 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12,000 tons; 31,000 tons and 41,000 tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.03 percent. 44 See, footnote 37. Another consequence of the standards will be the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. For standard level 1, over the years 1996 to 2030, the total estimated CO 2 reduction would be 4 million tons. During this time period, the peak annual reduction of CO 2 emissions that are expected to be emitted by power plants in the United States is 0.01 percent. For standard levels 2&hyph;4 the reductions are 12 million tons; 32 million tons and 43 million tons, respectively. The highest peak annual reduction of these levels is 0.04 percent. Decreasing future electricity demand is also likely to result in reductions in the demand for oil used in electricity generation. Because virtually all sources of oil, on the margin, are foreign, any reductions in oil demand are likely to be reflected in reductions in oil imports. Standard for pool heaters, standard levels 1&hyph;4, are not expected to affect oil consumption. 5. Conclusion. Section 325(l)(2)(A) of the Act specifies that the Department must consider, for amended standards, those standards that ``achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.'' Accordingly, the Department first considered the max tech level of efficiency, i.e., standard level 4 for amended pool heater standards. Of the standard levels analyzed, level 4 will save the most energy (0.78 quad between 1996 and 2030). In order to meet this standard, the Department assumes that all pool heaters will be condensing pulse combustion pool heaters. However, the payback at this standard level of 27.0 years exceeds the 15-year life of the product and causes life-cycle cost increases of $1,178. The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 4 for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. The next most stringent standard level is standard level 3. This standard level is projected to save 0.58 quads of energy. However, the payback at this standard level of 17.2 years also exceeds the product's life and produces an increase in life-cycle costs. The Department therefore concludes that the burdens of standard level 3 for pool heaters outweigh the benefits, and rejects the standard level. After carefully considering the analysis, the Department is amending the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act-imposed 1990 standard for pool heaters with standard level 2 for pool heaters. The Department concludes that standard level 2 for pool heaters saves a significant amount of energy and is technologically feasible and economically justified. There would be significant energy savings at this level of efficiency. During the period 1996_2030, these savings are calculated to be 0.23 quads of primary energy. In addition, the standard could have a positive effect on the environment by reducing the emissions of NO 2 by as much as 12,000 tons, or 0.01 percent by the year 2030. Furthermore, the standard will reduce emissions of CO 2 by 12 million tons, or 0.02 percent, over the forecast period. The technologies that are necessary to meet this standard are presently available. The Department finds the level to be economically justified. The consumer payback of this standard level is 5.0 years or one-third of the product life. This standard is expected to result in a reduction in life- cycle cost of approximately $199. Additionally, the standard is expected to increase the prototypical manufacturer's return on equity from 17.9 percent in the base case to 18.4 percent in the short run and to 20.1 percent in the long run. Since this standard does not involve substantial redesign or retooling, the Department expects that it will not have negative impacts on smaller competitors. g. Fluorescent Lamp Ballasts 1. Efficiency Levels Analyzed The Department examined a range of standard levels for fluorescent lamp ballasts. Table 4&hyph;15 presents the three efficiency levels selected for analysis for the 10 classes of fluorescent lamp ballasts. Level 3 corresponds to the highest efficiency level, max tech, considered in the engineering analysis.
