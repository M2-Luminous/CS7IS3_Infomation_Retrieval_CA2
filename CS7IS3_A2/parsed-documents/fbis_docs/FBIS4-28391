FBIS4-28391 "dreas112_m_94008" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 10 Jun 1994 Thailand Hunger Striker Rejects Proposal Hunger Striker Rejects Proposal BK1006042194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 10 Jun 94 pp 1, 3 BK1006042194 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Parliament President Marut Bunnak's bid to defuse political tension yesterday foundered when his proposal to set up a 21-man "Committee for Democratic Reform" was rejected by hunger striker Chalat Worachat. Immediately after Mr Marut's unsuccessful attempt, the democracy alliance announced it would call another major rally in front of Parliament on Wednesday to push lawmakers to endorse a Phalang Tham MPs' motion calling for a special House panel to redraft the Constitution as demanded by Mr Chalat. The hunger striker rejected Mr Marut's proposal, saying it was not entirely related to his demand for the setting up of a House committee to draft a new constitution. Claiming the Democrats' sudden about-turn on their previous plan to support a motion to form the House constitution redrafting committee was the cause of new tension, the Organisation of Political Reform [OPR] said: "The Government must take responsibility for the problem and the crisis that may follow. The OPR hopes no untoward incidents will take place." The democracy alliance, formed on June 2 at Thammasat University and comprising members from democracy groups, academics and elements of some coalition parties, met yesterday to discuss the latest developments. Dr San Hatthirat, a prominent OPR member, claimed the planned rally was not aimed at applying pressure on the lawmakers and Parliament but stemmed more from the group's concern for Chalat. The OPR has scheduled a major meeting at Thammasat University on Sunday to ask members for its support for the rally on Wednesday. All MPs will be invited to attend. "We are confident a large number will turn up because we are concerned about Chalat's life," Dr San said. The OPR urged Mr Marut put before the House a motion sponsored by 21 Phalang Tham members which was included on last Wednesday's House agenda for immediate deliberation. The MPs submitted a motion calling for the formation of a special committee to redraft the constitution in defiance of the party's resolution after the Phalang Tham leadership joined the Democrats in reversing its previous stand to support the motion. The OPR called for all Lower House members to support the MPs' motion. Mr Chalat, who begins his 17th day of fasting today, said Mr Marut's proposal was irrelevant to his call for setting up of the extra House panel to pave way for a truly democratic charter. It was high time the Democrats pushed for the setting up of the panel since it had all the power necessary to get such things done, he said. The House Speaker and prime minister are Democrats. Mr Marut visited Mr Chalat at the hunger striker's caged shelter outside Parliament and told him he had set up the Committee for Democratic Development which would include renowned physician Prawet Wasi, deans of political science and law faculties of Chulalongkon, Thammasat, Ramkhamhaeng and Sukhothai Thammathirat universities and representatives of all 10 political parties. Dr Prawet and Mr Chalat apparently shared the ideal of a more democratic rule and the nomination of the physician was expected to satisfy the hunger striker, according to the Speaker. The committee, the chairman of which will be appointed by its members, has the duty to compile and study all aspects of the Constitution and to lay the groundwork for developing a monarchical democracy, according to Mr Marut. Mr Chalat and Mr Marut exchanged views for about 15 minutes before Mr Marut crossed back to Parliament and said Mr Chalat needed a little more time to think. Mr Marut said he had not consulted any Government leaders about his new committee. A House committee scrutinizing the charter would amend Article 211 to allow major changes by the new committee. Mr Marut said the committee he had set up and that demanded by the hunger striker could be the same as Mr Chalat's call for a new, more democratic charter would be considered by his committee. "Mr Chalat did not accept the committee (for Democratic Development) at the moment because he's such a resolute man who will not change his mind easily. He needs a little more time to think it over. If Mr Chalat consults other people about this new committee I've set up, he will change his mind." Mr Marut said his committee would not only improve the content of the charter but also pave way for election of provincial governors and correct all various laws. Mr Chalat said the Democrats' ideology was to create greater democracy. "The Democrats have the ideals of opposing all kinds of dictatorship and of strengthening and developing democratic rule. This is the only chance for the Democrats to do it. Only the democrats have displayed this ideology and have fought dictatorships" But he said he was feeling desperate about the Democrats and other politicians.
