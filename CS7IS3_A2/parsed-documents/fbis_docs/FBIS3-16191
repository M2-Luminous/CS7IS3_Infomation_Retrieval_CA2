Today the head of the Armenian parliament held a news conference on its results. [Correspondent Vladimir Nazaryan] Having simply described the meeting on the border as a useful and constructive one, Babken Araktsyan informed journalists of the contents of the conversation that took place in every detail. The main thing that both sides agree upon is that there is an urgent necessity for a lasting truce in the region which would make political dialogue possible. Mutual understanding was achieved with regard to the issue of the Lachin humanitarian corridor which will be in place even when a separating buffer zone is created around Nagorno-Karabakh. As a unilateral initiative and without any preconditions, Armenia is ready to allow Azerbaijan to use its communications to transfer necessary electric power and freight to Nakhichevan. This would allow the unfounded accusations regarding the blockade of this autonomous republic by Armenia to be dropped.
