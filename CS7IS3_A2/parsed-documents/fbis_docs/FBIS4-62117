"For us the fact of forming a delegation led by Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray for talks with the Chechen republic by resolution of the Russian government dated May 3 is just another step of such a policy," the statement says. "However in reality this delegation of the Russian Federation turned out to be formed for talks with the leadership of the Chechen opposition who have already arrived in Moscow," the Chechen Foreign Ministry notes. "The will of the Chechen people and efforts of its legitimate president aimed at the settlement of relations with the Russian Federation are ignored once again." The Chechen Foreign ministry urged all international organizations and the press "to condemn actions by the Russian leadership running contrary to the norms and principles of international law."
