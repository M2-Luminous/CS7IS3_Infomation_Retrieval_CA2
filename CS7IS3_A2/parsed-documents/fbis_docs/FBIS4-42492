Moreover, the minister, who is also responsible for alien affairs, offered some hard facts and figures to justify his buoyant mood: In May 1994, a total of 919 asylum requests were received, according to the latest figures released by the Alien Affairs Department. That is several hundred fewer requests than in previous months. Even greater is the difference between this figure and the one registered in June 1993, when the monthly record of 3,058 was set. Anyway, it was years ago that the number of asylum-seekers was last under the 1000 mark. This brings the sum total of asylum requests received over the first five months of this year to 1,105. Remember, the annual total in 1993 amounted to 26,883, and the 1992 total was 17,647. "What is more, the latest figure released for May even includes around 100 Rwandans," Tobback emphasized. The minister primarily attributes this success to his own firm asylum policy. Exactly one year ago, a new, faster asylum procedure was introduced which, among other things, did away with the possibility of appealing to the Council of State in the asylum request procedure. "However, it was not a question of tightening up the procedure, the sole aim was to limit and dissuade people from abusing the possibility of lodging an appeal." The candidate for mayor of Leuven also considered it to be of great importance to dissociate asylum-seeker status from eligibility for a work permit. [passage omitted] What is the ultimate objective? "Not to set a world record for the lowest number of asylum requests," Tobback said, "but to reach a figure that is as close as possible to the number of people definitively recognized as political refugees." According to the statistics, ultimately something like 5 percent of all asylum-seekers are recognized as refugees. [passage omitted]
