During the informal Council, they assessed the state of the negotiating mandate with Switzerland. The European ministers feel in particular that "the debate on the issue of the transit of Community vehicles weighing more than 28 tonnes must be resumed." The draft negotiating mandate drawn up by the Commission in Brussels on 16 September will be submitted for the approval of the Twelve by 18 April, said European Transportation Commissioner Abel Matutes. The Greek minister said there was "clear resistance from Switzerland concerning the transit problem and the problem of flexibility regarding the matter of the 40-tonne trucks." "However," continued the Greek minister, "Switzerland's presence in the European Economic Area [EEA] is absolutely essential." According to him, "the issue must be revitalized and a standstill must be avoided." "We therefore endeavored," he concluded, "to select the positive points where there is a convergence of views in order to resume the dialogue with Switzerland so that the geographical area of Switzerland would indeed become an integral part of the EEA." Most of the participants in Athens asked Switzerland to relax its regulations in order to make it possible to increase the number of trucks that benefit from an exception to the 40-tonne trucks. For Greece, which is currently EU president, Bern must make concessions. In Swiss diplomatic circles in Athens, the emphasis is being placed on participants' desire to avoid a confrontation with Bern. Negotiating Mandate "I am completely in favor of resolving the Swiss issue once and for all," the European transportation commissioner told ATS. "Today, I noted the willingness of all the member states to conclude the matter and to give the Commission the negotiating mandate for a transportation agreement with Switzerland." In September, the European Commission proposed draft negotiating guidelines. According to this text, the negotiations should mainly pursue two objectives: obtaining more openness from Switzerland for European trucks weighing 40 tonnes, and facilities for Alpine transit. In exchange, Swiss airlines and long distance trucks will be able to gain access to the European transportation market. For the EU, the sectorial negotiations with Switzerland are part of an overall approach. The negotiators will have to seek out a balance on a sector-by-sector basis, as well as globally. It is understood that a transportation agreement will only be able to enter into force at the same time as an agreement on the free movement of workers.
