Both have launched "a cordial appeal to all registered socialists and sympathizers to unite their forces in view of the upcoming elections." In their opinion, "the tragic possibility exists that no socialist on the socialist lists will be elected to parliament. This happened previously only during the fascist era." They added: "We have made errors. However, no humiliation inflicted by the tabloid press can wipe out the results of history."
