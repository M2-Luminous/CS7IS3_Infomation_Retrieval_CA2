The first officers who attended the academy were promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. The second generation of noncommissioned officers of the two armies were also promoted. The ceremony was attended by Radovan Karadzic, supreme commander of the republic of Srpska army and president of the republic of Srpska, Colonel-General Ratko Mladic, chief of general staff of the republic of Srpska army, Major General Milan Celeketic, chief of general staff of the Serb army of Krajina, many other guests, and thousands of Banja Luka citizens, as well as the new officers' families and friends. Addressing the newly promoted officers, Radovan Karadzic said that the humiliation of allowing the international community to draw its maps and offer them under the "take it or leave it" principle was unacceptable. "We want to end this war. Our aim so far has been to defend our own territory, but if our enemies and the international community are forcing us into a counteroffensive, we will not stop," Karadzic stressed. Colonel General Ratko Mladic, Major General Milan Celeketic, and Major General Slavko Lisica, head of the center of military academies in Banja Luka, also spoke at the ceremony. The Center of Military Academies in Banja Luka was opened last year in the premises of the former Petar Drapsin Training Center for Armored-Motorized Units. Personnel from the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serb Krajina are trained there to become officers and noncommissioned officers.
