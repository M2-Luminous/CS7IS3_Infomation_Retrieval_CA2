Kozin: "Results of the `President-94' Survey: In Choosing the President of Ukraine, Oblast Workers Give Preference to Simonenko and Kuchma"] [Text] Of survey participants, 24.1 percent, that is, one out of four, are ready to vote in the presidential elections for Leonid Kuchma, the former prime minister and currently a people's deputy of Ukraine. Another 20.7 percent have firmly decided to vote for making Petr Simonenko, head of the Communist party of Ukraine and Ukraine's people's deputy, the head of state. People's Deputy of Ukraine Vyacheslav Chornovil ranked third in popularity among voters who participated in the survey. He got 13.8 percent of the vote. Yefim Zvyahilskyy, acting prime minister and a people's deputy of Ukraine, also received a rather high rating (11 percent). Vladimir Grinev, former deputy chairman of the Supreme Council and currently a people's deputy of Ukraine, is supported by 10.4 percent of the voters. Seven percent of the voters see the socialists' leader and People's Deputy Aleksandr Moroz as the future president of Ukraine. According to survey results, 3.4 percent of respondents give their preference to the current President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. The same percentage of respondents wrote in People's Deputy Viktor Pynzenyk, who was not included in the main list... What was the main factor in the readers' choices? To answer this question, let us look at the opinions expressed in letters. Naturally, newspaper space does not permit us to quote all the mail we received in connection with the "President-94" survey. But the letters we quote below will probably be indicative enough for the voters and politicians to draw conclusions. (In quoting from the letters, we have retained the authors' style and spelling.) "We are pensioners; our life is not that sweet; we follow the situation in independent Ukraine, read the press, although it is very expensive, and follow the work of politicians and the parliament. In our choice of candidate for president we will give our vote without hesitation to Leonid Danilovich Kuchma. He is a worthy candidate of his people. He is honest, fair, and is not stained with stealing. He attempted to unmask thieves, such as enterprise directors..., for which he was punished by President Kravchuk. We believe that L.D. Kuchma will be able to lead Ukraine out of the crisis, impose order and discipline. Respectfully, pensioners Tvardovskiy, Dzerzhinsk." "I talked to the residents of our apartment building, dear comrades, and the majority of them said that if there are going to be several names on the ballot in the Ukrainian presidential elections, then people said that I should write to you that we would vote for Leonid Kuchma. When I asked them why Kuchma, they could not answer. So it is for Kuchma. His idea was, and he tried, to change everything for the benefit of the people, using his powers. Respectfully, N. Babenko, Kirovskoye." "I do not have time, I am in a hurry, but I will reply. I vote for Leonid Kuchma or Vladimir Grinev. Why? They represent the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, are the only sensible people of all the ones listed. Had the Supreme Council consisted of sensible people, perhaps we would not need the institution of the presidency. And if we had a competent, farsighted president, he would have governed the Supreme Council well, directed them along the right course. T., Donetsk." "We, pensioners from Shakhtersk, are answering your survey. We will vote for Leonid Kuchma. Why? Because he advocated unity with Russia and we have nothing to quarrel with them about; our brothers, children, and parents are there; we do not need bloodshed like Karabakh. Not like one fool who spoke on the tube for the Ukrainian language, cut one's finger--he should have his tongue cut out, this is better. We do not know his name. Our state needs to have a president, to protect our interests, but not like L. Kravchuk protects... interests. We do not need to divide the fleet, it is all people's property. This is our opinion." "Dear AKTSENT! I did not want to write, but I am sick and tired of watching and listening to all sorts of nonsense. You are asking about presidential candidates. And this Chornovil from Rukh yells right away: Do not let the communists into power. Why? How long can we listen to them? They do not pay any attention to our hardworking Donbass [Donetsk Basin]. All one hears is: Canada, Poland, Romania; as to Russia, it is as if it does not exist. We are fingers on the same hand. Our children are in Russia. So how can we not vote for the communists? Let it be Simonenko. But no way "bandery" [Ukrainian nationalists]. For Simonenko! Because we want to live in peace and for our children to have a future. L. Kravchuk. L. Kuchma, V. Chornovil, I. Plyushch, S. Khmara, and Ye. Zvyahilskyy should not be placed on the list of presidential candidates under any circumstances! They should be kicked out... If there is to be a presidential system in our state, I personally can only trust P. Simonenko and A. Moroz. Only communists are capable of leading the country from the dead end--the deep economic crisis. I have always trusted and will trust communists. Our state does not need a president. It is quite enough for us to have a Supreme Council and a Cabinet of Ministers. We do not need an additional staff of presidential loafers. Respectfully, L.N. Granitnoye, Telmanovskiy Rayon." "If the names you listed are put on the ballot in Ukrainian presidential elections, our sympathies are on the side of Petr Simonenko and Leonid Kuchma. We do not need a president like Kravchuk. We need to bring back the Soviet Union. We are waiting for this. I., Donetsk Oblast." "Dear editors. Forgive me for my illiteracy, I only attended school for a year and a half. Dear editors, I and all my relatives and my whole family we only recognize as future president-94 and will vote for Simonenko or Kuchma. Kuchma always was and is for people, while Kravchuk is for America and we do not need people like him. We need those who are for Soviet people. Simonenko we respect because he is a real communist not like other candidates, who said I am not a party member. Had he not been a party member, he would not have reached such a throne. We will vote for these people, and all others are not worthy to be president, they took a wonderful life away from us and instead gave us a concentration camp, the only difference is that we are not behind barbed wire but like this. Real leaders, all the dirt they did they dump on Kuchma. Without Kuchma we do not have such prices as bread for 28 kopeks and milk for 20 kopeks. Why did they not give us back without Kuchma everything that had cost kopeks. They are shameless bazaar women. Soviet power gave them free education and such jobs. And they have fouled it up. Stalin was right that he sent to Kolyma all "bandery." They are afraid of communists. Ts., Kuchayevsk." "If there is a God in this world, the president's job, if he is to be elected, should go to a truly honest man, patriot-communist Petr Simonenko. Respectfully, not a party member but in my heart with the communists, Vasiliy Vasilyevich Frostal, Donetsk." "I want to take part in the survey because I am not indifferent to the fate of my motherland--Ukraine. I am writing in Russian so that our brothers--the Russians--can read this. Dear people, what have we come to--we have walked into a dead end, into a labyrinth, and do not know how to get out, although there seem to be smart people in Ukraine. Why was it necessary to destroy the Soviet Union, one big friendly family? Who is now our "father"?--President Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. He is a good man. But he is cunning, and when he begins to dodge in his speeches--beware. I have a been a Komsomol [All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League] member since I was 18; I have been a member of the Communist Party since 1976. I have not surrendered my party card, and all good communists have remained in its ranks, those who are communists at heart; it is not our fault that former leaders of our party turned out to be traitors, and now they have become turncoats and live in clover. At the election meeting I asked candidates for deputy to resolve in the parliament the question of reunification with Russia and Belorussia. They are Slavic peoples. The language is understandable for everyone, we are of the same faith, or at least let us make one ruble zone, because one cannot even buy mineral water in Ilovaysk from speculators for our coupons, they demand Russian rubles. This is how it is. If the people you listed are to be put on the ballot, I would vote for Petr Simonenko, because under the communists bread cost 24 kopeks, and an envelope--6 kopeks, not 430 karbovantsy. Anyway, dear comrades, maybe we do not particularly need a president, this will create dual power, I think. We have elected a parliament, the people elected it, so let the parliament decide everything, carry out the will of the people. I am 57. A pensioner. A communist--posthumously [as published]. Your newspaper is very good, I mean it. I am a regular reader, S.G.G., Aleksandrovskiy Rayon." "I would very much like to see Vyacheslav Chornovil as president. Here is why. A president must love Ukraine and then he would do everything so that Ukraine would be rich and its people would live well. What is happening now is that the people we have elected expend their energy (like Charodeyev) on symbols, on two state languages. For us, ordinary people, it does not matter what kind of flag we have, just let us live decent life--by the way, the yellow and blue flag is pretty. Since there is a state, let there be our own flag. And also, do not offend other nationalities: Why do some deputies insist on Russian as a state language, there are many Greeks, Jews, and others living in Donbass. How are they worse than Russians? There should be one language--state language, Ukrainian. And all the deputies should be able to speak it, they are smart, instead of creating clashes and inciting interethnic strife. We all want to live in peace and live well. As to the president, we need one. Goodbye. S.A. Tregub, Donetsk." "Although I am not knowledgeable about politics, I decided to take part in the survey. Of the names you listed, I consider V. Chornovil the most appropriate candidate. I voted for him in previous elections, since he was the only candidate who insisted on disbanding the parliament, and the appropriateness of this demand has been confirmed many times with the passage of time. I cannot judge whether the office of president is needed, since I have not read the draft of the constitution and do not know what powers are vested in him. Everything depends on what powers he will have. We do not need a "ceremonial" president as Kravchuk was. By the way, tell us about the powers of the proposed president--this would be very useful. And also: If there is no president, who will have more power--the prime minister or the parliament? A., Donetsk." "In the previous survey you joyfully, on the front page, printed the results of the survey, in which Donbass said "No to Nationalism" and "Yes to Socialism." This is exactly what transpired in the elections on 27 March and 10 April. And what good is there in this? Our Donbass has disgraced itself in front of the whole world. That we said "no" to nationalism is good. But let us look at who our people gave their votes to. To communists-fascists. Why do I say this? Everybody remembers the events of 3-4 October in Moscow; they walked there shoulder to shoulder in closed ranks--Nazis, communists, and fascists. So I ask you: "Who was it our people voted for in the final analysis?" For those who fooled us for 76 years and are still fooling us; those who have destroyed millions of innocent people. This criminal communist regime deserves a second Nuremberg trial. I will vote for Vyacheslav Chornovil, because in my opinion he is the person who can launch a market reform. Until our people learn to separate the truth from dirty lies, there will be a dark night over Donbass for a long time. V.I. Shostak. Miner, 37 years old. Ukrainsk." "I would elect V.V. Chornovil to the job of the head of state, Why? First: Everyone else, with the exception of S. Khmara, is of a communist orientation, communists, whom I do not trust. Second, Chornovil is a brave and decisive person when it comes to implementing market reforms, and please do not label him "nationalist" in the bad sense of this word. Does our state need a president? Yes, it does! As to the soviets, they need to be liquidated. V.P., Russian, Konstantinovka." "I am answering your survey. Of this list, I would vote for Yefim Zvyahilskyy and Kuchma. Behind them is a classic schooling in Donbass--the hardest region in Ukraine. They raise the issue of stopping the downward slide. They occupy priority directions and will be filled [as published] with positive solutions. They raise the issue of implementing reforms for the sake of the people, not at the expense of impoverishing citizens, and especially implementing reforms in the coal industry. Peace-loving foreign policy, primacy of human rights, solid protection of citizens from criminals, and many other things we associate with the notion of normal life. P.D. Melbrod, Torez." "I would vote for Yefim Zvyahilskyy. He got the economy moving for the better. My thanks to him! As to our state, it needs a president. I like presidents of capitalist countries and their senate (parliament), and I want so much for them to live for the country instead of their own shirt, as our president and the former parliament did. Galina Mitich, Yenakhiyevo." "Dear editors! I would like Ye. Zvyahilskyy to become president, because this man does not just talk--he acts; because of all the people who have been in power in independent Ukraine after Shcherbitskiy, he is the only one who has been able to sharply bring down the rate of inflation. I understand that the next necessary step is to stimulate truly needed and important and vital enterprises of all forms of ownership. I think Zvyahilskyy understands this too. To the best of my knowledge, he is not at all a fool. Of course, he is, as they say, not a charismatic leader at all (that is, to put it simply, he lacks charm). Well, so what, Thatcher also was like this and this did not keep her from pulling England out of the crisis. I do not know whether this is appropriate in answering this survey, but I want to say that in Kravchuk, too, I see not only negative traits. He is intelligent and flexible; he is not a chauvinist and not dogmatic, which one could easily expect of the second secretary of the Communist Party of Ukraine. He does not react fast enough to the fast-changing reality. And this has contributed--wittingly or unwittingly--to the impoverishment of Ukraine and all of us. Respectfully, G.I. Chizhina, 61 years old, Donetsk." "I personally will vote for Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk. During the first elections I voted for Kravchuk without hesitation. I believe that we need only a strong presidential authority. Let it even be a dictatorial form in the beginning. Our people need to be taught to work and be responsible for their actions. So far our people are a pack, and they need a strong leader. At this point I do not see a better president for us than Kravchuk. I personally am against early presidential elections. Why throw away money? Better invest this money in health care and science. With all my respect, Valentina Vasilyevna Zhdanova." "I believe that V. Chornovil should become the president of Ukraine. This man and politician has integrity, is honest, and is a man of action. The intelligentsia supports his position. Although for some reason I am convinced that Ukraine, especially the communist Donetsk Oblast, Lugansk Oblast, and Crimea, will elect such a candidate that the whole world will laugh at Ukraine. I believe that we need a president. We cannot place all the authority in the hands of our unprofessional Supreme Council. N.K., Gorlovka." Well, another readers' survey is behind us. The results of political contests in the oblast completely confirmed the trends revealed by our two previous surveys. How will it be this time? One may say that AKTSENT already has held its presidential elections. The political leaders and their teams are just launching their election campaign. We can already see the gap between what readers-voters confidentially tell us in their letters and what is happening these days at enterprises and organizations. Despite-- judging by the results of the survey--the extremely low current rating of Ivan Plyushch, he was nominated as a presidential candidate in the proletarian bastion of Donetsk--Kirovskiy Rayon, at the Imeni Abakumova mine. Time will tell whether the results of our survey will burn up in the flames of miners' hot love for the speaker. President Kravchuk said last week that he does not wish to participate in the elections--he believes that working people do not want to elect a head of state if they are given such a compressed time frame. On Tuesday this week, however, he was nominated as a presidential candidate in Slavyansk. Local collectives took the initiative, in particular, the Farko production-cooperative association. It is not known whether or not the elections will be held on 26 June, but just in case, as they say, it does not hurt to be nominated in a timely fashion. Political reserves do not burden the pocket. And this is considering that the popularity of the current president--again, according to the survey--in our oblast is extremely low... The nomination of candidates, the actions of politicians and their teams are proceeding along the old blueprints, which is quite normal for our land of workers and peasants... Everything repeats itself: Apricots are in bloom in Donbass, and socialist democracy is blossoming again in all its splendor. Before you know it, harvest time will be here...
