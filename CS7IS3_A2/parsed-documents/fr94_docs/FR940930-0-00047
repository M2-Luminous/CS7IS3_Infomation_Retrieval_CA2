FR940930-0-00047 FR940930-0-00007 III. Review of the Guides No member of the factory-built housing industry responded to the Commission's request for comment on the Guides. 17 Part of the explanation for this may be that the term ``shell'' home as it is used by the Commission in the Guides is not familiar to most current members of the industry. 18 17 In addition to publishing the Commission's request for comments in the FR, staff sent copies of the FR notice and the guides to (among others) the trade associations whose members most likely included producers of factory built housing ( e.g., the National Institute of Building Science, the National Association of Home Builders, and the Manufactured Housing Institute). 18 John Samples, President and C.E.O. of Kan-Build, Inc., Osage City, KS, responding to a staff questionnaire concerning the guides said, ``I have been in this industry 20 years, and have never had knowledge of or questions pertaining to the Guide.'' P924219, B&hyph;5, p. 1 (Jan. 19, 1993). Factory-built housing (including homes that are inhabitable upon delivery) constitutes a large segment of the new home market. At this time the Commission does not know what portion of the factory-built housing industry is comprised of structures erected in whole or in part by the seller that lack all the necessary components to make the building inhabitable when delivered to the buyer. Based on the information collected by staff, it is probable that some portion of the industry delivers structures that are not inhabitable. 19 19 According to Curtis McGiver, Associate Director for Building Regulations, Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development, modular housing is sold that is unfinished when installed. He adds that in Virginia the advertising for this housing makes it clear that the price varies with the degree of completeness of the product, and that the consumer must pay a premium to receive a finished inhabitable module. Report of Interview by Joel Brewer, P 924219, B&hyph;12, p. 2 (July 20&hyph;22, 1994). Since adopting the Guides, the Commission has brought a number of actions that, without expressly mentioning the Guides, reflect the principles articulated in them. Specifically, the Commission has prohibited manufacturers of shell, pre-cut or other factory-built housing from: •Representing that housing was complete to a greater degree than it was (Guide 1); 20 20 Best Homes, 77 FTC 6 (1970); H.R. Rieger Co., 75 FTC 168 (1969); Hi-Line, Inc., 74 FTC 1174 (1968). •Using pictorial advertising that confused higher-priced housing with prices of lower priced housing (Guide 3); 21 21 Id. •Representing that unskilled consumers will realize savings on labor, or making false and unsubstantiated claims with respect to the ease, economy or time involved in erecting the housing (Guide 4); 22 22 Insilco Corp. 91 FTC 706 (1978); Lindal Cedar Homes, Inc. , 87 FTC 8 (1976). •Offering financing without disclosing terms, or misleading consumers with respect to the terms of the financing available (Guide 5); 23 23 Insilco Corp., 91 FTC at 723; Hi-Line, Inc., 74 FTC at 1181.
