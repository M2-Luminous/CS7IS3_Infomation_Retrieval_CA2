"It is not a good way to solve the problem by imposing sanctions," China's official XINHUA NEWS AGENCY quoted Qian as telling visiting Maltese Foreign Minister Guido de Marco. Qian said China adheres to the stand of maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula and making it nuclear free, hoping that the nuclear issue will be settled through negotiations, according to XINHUA. Discussions about possible punitive steps against North Korea have intensified at the United Nations since the IAEA said last week it can no longer verify whether Pyongyang has diverted plutonium after its inspectors were blocked from examining fuel rods unloaded at a nuclear reactor. The United States has said it will ask the U.N. Security council to impose sanctions on North Korea for its defiance of international nuclear safeguards. China, as a permanent member of the key U.N. body, could wield its veto to block any measures against its traditional ally North Korea.
