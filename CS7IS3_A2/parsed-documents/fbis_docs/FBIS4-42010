FBIS4-42010 "drsov126_d_94018" FBIS-SOV-94-126 Daily Report 29 Jun 1994 Regional Affairs Accident to Stored Radioactive Waste Under Control Accident to Stored Radioactive Waste Under Control LD2906124494 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1015 GMT 29 Jun 94 LD2906124494 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The accident which occurred with solid radioactive waste products being stored on the Pacific Fleet in Kamchatka was brought under control, the Russian Ministry for Emergency Situations (RMES) told INTERFAX. On June 26 two plates encasing a store of solid radioactive waste sagged as a result of a flash flood. The RMES said that after experts examined the background radiation it was exceeding the acceptable level at only two sites. Before the concrete cover could be restored, the site of the accident was covered with lead sheets in order to minimize possible leakage of radiation. The RMES said that the sagged encasing plates had been changed on June 29. The radiation background had been normal at that time. The department for control over radiation security of military and defense facilities under the State Atomic Control Committee (Gosatomnadzor) told INTERFAX that the department had practically no ability to control nuclear facilities under the Defense Ministry as the Defense Ministry was not observing the provision on interdepartmental state control. According to nonofficial information, a high-ranking official from Gosatomnadzor said that no people had been affected and that the environment had not been polluted during the accident. The same sources said that solid waste of low radioactivity was kept in the storage facility namely special uniforms, spare parts and equipment affected by radiation. This store has received no waste since 1975 and during this period of time all fast-decaying isotopes had dissociated, the official said. He stressed that there would never be any catastrophe with this store of waste.
