In the opinion of former ministers, jurists, and deputies, President Itamar Franco debased the dignity of his mandate and the institution of the Presidency of the Republic by allowing himself to be kissed and embraced by model Lilian Ramos, who was wearing nothing but a short T-shirt. Deputy Sigmaringa Seixas (PSDB-DF [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Federal District]) was the only person to openly admit that Itamar's attitude may justify an impeachment process based on Law 1079/50, the same one that removed Fernando Collor from the presidency. Outstanding politicians and jurists who worked hard in 1992 to maintain political stability during the impeachment of Fernando Collor de Mello, who was president at that time, agree with Sigmaringa. A former minister linked to the judicial field angrily commented: "A president cannot debase the institution and country's image." They explained that the impeachment law is quite clear in stating that the president of the Republic and state ministers commit crimes against probity in administration when "they behave in a manner that is incompatible with the dignity, distinction, and decency of the post" (Clause 7 of Article 7 of the law). The Balcony of the Numbers Game Kingpin Sigmaringa asserted: "The president of the Republic must behave in accordance with the post he holds and cannot appear hugging and kissing a woman who is exhibiting her genitals." "He (Itamar) does not consider the consequences of his actions. He goes in his capacity as president and not as an ordinary citizen to the balcony of the numbers game kingpins and makes passes at all those near him," commented a senator friend of the president. A retired member of the Federal Supreme Court, who fears the consequences of a "thoughtless action" by Itamar, indignantly commented: "Why is it that he, in addition to the photographs that were taken, used a vehicle of the Presidency of the Republic to take that girl home?" Justice Minister Mauricio Correa, may be judged under the same article of the impeachment law, and may even be tried for seduction and sexual harassment. In addition to drunkenness and having told his bodyguards to carry him to his hotel room, a few whiskeys earlier Correa tried to grab some journalists, according to the account of one of them, in the balcony at the Sambodromo. A deputy who participated in the CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] in the PC [Paulo Cesar] Farias case, but who wants to remain anonymous so as not to contribute to the unleashing of a crisis, commented that "journalists have the right and duty to bring charges against individuals who do not respect this symbolically important ministry." Those who have reacted negatively to Itamar's behavior have been very cautious. Senator Jarbas Passarinho (PPR-PA [Progressive Renewal Party-Para State]) said: "I would rather make no comment." He said that any comment "now" may be used ill-intentionally. Celio Borja, the justice minister under Collor's administration, said: "I hope the people will bear the country in mind." Deputy Roberto Magalhaes (PFL-PE [Liberal Front Party-Pernambuco], coordinator of the Budget CPI, tried to avoid commenting, but could not resist the temptation: "He (Itamar) chose a very unorthodox way for a president of the Republic to celebrate Carnival."
