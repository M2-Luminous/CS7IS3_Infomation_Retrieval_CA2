In Brussels, a director of the humanitarian organisation Medecins sans Frontieres-Belgium [MSF--Doctors Without Borders], Georges Dallemagne, said in a statement that "several dozen" Rwandan employees of the aid workers had been killed by members of the presidential guard drawn from the majority ethnic Hutus. Dallemagne said the victims were slain in front of their expatriate employers. But MSF official Dominique Bontriau said later it was impossible to estimate how many workers had been killed. "It is chaotic," she said, but could not confirm that they numbered several dozen. She said Dallemagne had been misquoted as saying there were several dozen victims. Meanwhile, church officials in Kigali, contacted by telephone from Paris, said that at least 22 missionary priests and nuns have been killed in Rwanda since the clashes began there Thursday following the plane crash death of the Rwandan and Burundian presidents. Six priests and nine nuns were killed in Kigali itself and six priests and a nun in the town of Nyundo, in the northwest province of Gisenyi, the official at the papal nuncio's office said. The church official, who refused to be identified, said the Kigali parishes were "full of people seeking shelter." The sound of light and heavy gunfire could be heard in the town and streets were deserted, he said. "The situation is becoming explosive, there is much confusion," he said. He added that UN troops in the capital were keeping to barracks following the death of 10 UN Belgian soldiers on Thursday.
