The fact that the bomb was thrown on a Saturday [5 February], when the people of Sarajevo go out with family, and the fact that it was thrown at a market place where there are large crowds, is irrefutable proof of the absolute necessity to stop the crazed and merciless aggressor. We strongly condemn this latest act of savagery committed against the people of Sarajevo almost as if in provocation. This place was visited by our prime minister and minister a few days ago to observe the unacceptable conditions and problems of these people, and we promised them help. We reiterate to the world the call made by our prime minister to stop these inhuman incidents. The attacks and inhuman acts being perpetrated against Sarajevo can be stopped in two ways: The first is by means of international intervention. Turkey is ready to participate in intervention where NATO's means are also used. The second is this: If the international community is incapable of intervening at this stage, then it must enable Bosnia-Herzegovina to protect itself. Turkey is determined to be on the side of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its just struggle and to continue to support it.
