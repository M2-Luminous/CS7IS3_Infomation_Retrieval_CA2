In its address to the people of Lithuania, the initiative group said early elections "is the only way to stop the pernicious governing of the LDDP (ruling Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party)" and to bring honest, competent and determined people to power. To achieve its goal, the union has to collect 300,000 signatures in two months. The union's representative in parliament MP Leonas Milcius told reporters Monday [2 May] that the nationalists hope to collect signatures and to hold a referendum together with the Conservative Party, which earlier started collecting signatures for a referendum on unlawful privatization and compensation of savings. So far, the union's initiative received support only from the Democratic Party. The nationalists and the democrats have six seats in the parliament. A representative of the Democratic Party declined to comment on the passiveness of the conservatives and the Christian Democrats, but noted that "an observer status is not the best way out." The Nationalist Union expects early elections to take place in February-March next year. The organizers said their are not worried by the results of public opinion polls, which suggest continuing popularity of leftist forces. "A greater part of the nation will come to reason."
