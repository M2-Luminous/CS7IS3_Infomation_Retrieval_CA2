Laar stated that the export of goods and illegal border crossings via Amari are no longer possible because Russian servicemen must first obtain permission from the Estonian Defense Ministry for flights. He rejected claims that criminal forces are using Amari to export cars. According to information available to Laar, five Russian military transport planes have landed and taken off at Amari during the first months of the year, having been first cleared by the Estonian border guards.
