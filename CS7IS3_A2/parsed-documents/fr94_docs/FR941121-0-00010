FR941121-0-00010 FR941121-0-00001 Section 707.4_Account Disclosures (a) Delivery of Account Disclosures (a)(1) Account Opening Comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1 provides examples of events that trigger the delivery of new account disclosures. The final comment differs from the proposal in several respects. Proposed comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1 discussed the effect of a member-initiated change in the term for an automatically renewable term share account. In response to FRB commenters' requests on the Regulation DD proposed comment counterpart to 4(a)(1)&hyph;1, the FRB commentary clarifies that new account disclosures are required when the member changes any account term required to be disclosed (and not merely the duration of a time account). The clarification provides consistency with comment 5(b)&hyph;5, and has been adopted as comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1(ii). FRB commenters expressed concern about having to give new account disclosures when funds are transferred from one account to another, such as when funds in a money market deposit account (MMDA) are transferred to a NOW account because the consumer exceeded transaction limitations on the MMDA. Some requested clarification that disclosures at the time of transfer are not required if disclosures (including change-in-terms notices, if appropriate) for both accounts had previously been given. To minimize possible burdens the FRB adopted that standard in the FRB commentary. For similar reasons, the NCUA Board adopts this position in comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1(iii). The FRB also received many comments regarding the proposed guidance for ``closed accounts.'' New account disclosures would have been required if institutions deemed an account closed and then accepted a deposit from the consumer. FRB commenters noted that consumers with accounts meeting an institution's criteria for a closed account_such as an account having a $0 balance_do not necessarily intend to close the account. FRB commenters believed consumers would be confused if new account disclosures were sent when a deposit is subsequently made. FRB commenters also expressed concerns about the burden of monitoring accounts to ensure compliance. TISA allows institutions not to pay accrued but uncredited interest when a consumer closes an account. (See 12 U.S.C. 4303(c)(9).) Based on comments received by the FRB and upon further analysis, the FRB believes that if an institution deems an account closed and treats accrued, but uncredited, interest as forfeited by the consumer, the institution must deem a new account to be opened when a deposit is subsequently accepted. This approach provides flexibility for institutions and consistent treatment for consumers regarding ``closed'' accounts. Five NCUA commenters agreed with the Regulation DD approach. Five NCUA commenters, including a national trade association, disagreed with the FRB's approach, on grounds that account terms may not have changed between an account's closing and its reopening; that some credit union's data processing systems automatically opened the account with the former account's number; and to modify systems would be a costly, unnecessary expense. While sympathetic to credit union's facing this predicament, because these reasons do not reflect any credit union uniqueness points. NCUA is bound to follow the FRB's rationale, and the NCUA Board adopts the FRB's approach. However, it is the belief of the Board that a credit union is not required to grant a new account number to the holder of a reopened ``closed account''; all that is required by this rule is the distribution of a new set of account disclosures. No data processing changes are contemplated by this commentary, and this is reflected in a revision to comment 4(a)(1)&hyph;1. The Board hopes that this revision will reduce the compliance burden on credit unions.
