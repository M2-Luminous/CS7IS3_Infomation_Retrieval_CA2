FR940119-1-00056 FR940119-1-00014 50 CFR Parts 672 and 675 [Docket No. 940102&hyph;4002, I.D. 122293D] RIN 0648&hyph;AF17 Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Proposed rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: NMFS proposes regulations that would implement Amendment 25 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI). This amendment proposes to eliminate the primary Pacific halibut prohibited species catch (PSC) limit that, when reached, requires NMFS to close Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H of the Bering Sea. NMFS also proposes regulations that would authorize the release of vessel-specific observer data on bycatch of prohibited species, and prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish trawl fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. This action is necessary for effective management of the halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries and to provide better information on salmon and other prohibited species bycatch. This action is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI and the FMP for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). DATES: Comments must be received by 4:30 p.m., Alaska local time, February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be sent to Ronald J. Berg, Chief, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, Juneau, AK 99802 (Attn: Lori Gravel). Copies of the environmental assessment/regulatory impact review (EA/RIR) may be obtained from the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, P.O. Box 103136, Anchorage, AK 99510 (telephone 907&hyph;271&hyph;2809). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan J. Salveson, Fisheries Management Division, Alaska Region, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Fishing for groundfish by U.S. vessels in the exclusive economic zone of the GOA and the BSAI is managed by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) according to the FMP for Groundfish of the GOA and the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. The FMPs were prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801, et seq. ) (Magnuson Act), and are implemented by regulations governing the U.S. groundfish fisheries at 50 CFR parts 672 and 675. General regulations that also pertain to U.S. fisheries are codified at 50 CFR part 620. This action proposes regulations to implement Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI. If approved by the Secretary, this amendment would eliminate the primary halibut PSC limit established for BSAI trawl fisheries. This action also proposes two regulatory amendments that would (1) authorize the release of vessel-specific observer data on bycatch of prohibited species, and (2) prohibit the discard of salmon taken as bycatch in the BSAI groundfish trawl fisheries until each salmon has been counted by a NMFS-certified observer. A description of, and reasons for, each of the proposed measures is presented below. Amendment 25 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI A 4,400-mt primary halibut PSC limit was established for specified BSAI trawl fisheries under Amendment 12a to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI (54 FR 32642, August 9, 1989). When the primary halibut PSC limit was reached, Bycatch Limitation Zones 1 and 2H were closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish species. The intent of this closure was to reduce halibut bycatch rates experienced by the trawl fisheries without prohibiting the groundfish trawl fisheries access to the entire BSAI groundfish resource. When the secondary halibut bycatch limit established under Amendment 12a (5,333 mt) was reached, the entire BSAI was closed to directed fishing for specified groundfish species. A justification for and intent of the primary halibut PSC limit was discussed in the preamble to the final rule implementing Amendment 12a. Amendment 12a expired December 31, 1990, and was superseded by Amendment 16 to the FMP. Amendment 16 and its implementing regulations (56 FR 2700, January 24, 1991) maintained the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits at 4,400 mt and 5,333 mt, respectively. Amendment 19 to the FMP maintained the primary halibut PSC limit at 4,400 mt, but reduced the secondary limit to 5,033 mt. This adjustment was effective only for the 1992 fishing year (57 FR 43926, September 23, 1992). Under Amendment 19, the smaller difference between the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits frustrated NMFS' ability to monitor the primary halibut PSC limit in a manner to allow closures before the secondary limit was reached. As a result, trawl closures ensuing from halibut bycatch restrictions increasingly were implemented under the secondary limit rather than the primary limit. This situation continues under Amendment 21 to the FMP, which superseded Amendment 19 and converted the primary and secondary halibut PSC limits established for trawl gear fisheries from catch limits to mortality limits (3,300 mt mortality and 3,775 mt mortality, respectively) (58 FR 14524, March 18, 1993).
