Speaking at a news conference before the meeting of the Council for Foreign Policy, the Russian minister said, "Russia is set to prevent any weakening of partnership established with the United States" and will "specify its substance on the basis of full equality of rights and duties." Kozyrev stressed that "It is necessary to begin joint efforts to form a strategic partnership in building a new Europe." "President Yeltsin has put forth this initiative, which is now being considered by the leaders of Western countries," Kozyrev added. He said practical headway has been made towards making former enemies into friends and allies. "The idea of cooperation with NATO has been given substance in the U.S. concept of a Partnership for Peace, which opened a period of drafting and implementing programs involving all countries on an equal basis," the Russian minister noted. He went on to say that "Russia is close to signing the relevant documents." Kozyrev warned however that "The NATO mania of impatience in advocating others joining the alliance and the partnership, accompanied by an anti-Russian hysteria, can lead to the strengthening of the position of Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his supporters." The Russian minister rejected attempts of "certain circles in the West, Central and Eastern Europe to speculate on the Zhirinovsky factor and revive the image of a NATO enemy in the face of Russia." "Those who insist on the thesis of a Russian menace begin to believe it themselves," Kozyrev said, adding that the artificially generated threat makes people blind and prevents them from seeing the real problems of security. "The victory in the Cold War was not won by the NATO military machine but by the democratic principles of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (ESCE). It is the ESCE which is bound to win a stable democratic peace in post-confrontation Europe," the Russian minister concluded.
