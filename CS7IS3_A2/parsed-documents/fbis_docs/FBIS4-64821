Gures said he has explained his opinion on the issue on many occasions, adding that when the time comes to transfer duty, `those who conduct this duty with honor, hand it over to the next commander with pride. I have already said this is how it will happen, weeks ago at a meeting where the highest government officials were present.' He said there is always available personnel for every post in the Turkish Armed Forces. `In the armed forces, no one can expect any favor and one does not accept any,' Gures said adding that one refrains as much as possible from showing negative intentions. He also thanked Prime Minister Tansu Ciller who made a statement on the issue. Earlier on Friday, Ciller said that the authority to extend the term of duty of the chief of staff belongs entirely to the political authority. A statement published by the Office of the Prime Ministry said that `we may see it profitable and necessary for the country's well being, to preserve the present command team on duty under its present shape.'
