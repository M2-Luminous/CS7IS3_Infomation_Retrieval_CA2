However, the belligerents are reported to be willing to respect a truce. In any case, it will be a short one and its aim will only be to make the evacuation of foreign nationals possible. Colonel Marchal, the commander of the Belgian contingent within the UN Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR], gives some explanations: [Begin recording] [Marchal] The cease-fire that was negotiated this afternoon has changed names. It is now called a truce that will be implemented as soon as the document is signed. It will be valid for 48 hours. [Unidentified correspondent] When is the document going to be signed, Colonel? [Marchal] The document remained to be drafted and then, of course, signed by the two sides. I assume that this is happening right now. As soon as the document is signed, there will be a 48-hour time limit for the evacuation of expatriates. [Correspondent] This means that this is a 48-hour truce. In other words, fighting may continue, it is likely to continue after these 48 hours, right? [Marchal] Fighting is indeed supposed [as heard] to resume after these 48 hours, unless the political side of the UNAMIR...[pauses] which had the opportunity to use this 48-hour time limit to make progress in the negotiations which have been started.
