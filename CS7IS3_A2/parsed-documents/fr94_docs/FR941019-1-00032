FR941019-1-00032 FR941019-1-00004 There were several other substantive differences between the two proposals. Unlike the Advisory Committee's proposal, the Commission's alternative extended to third-party projections, while concomitantly restricting safe harbor protection to financial projections and similar statements, limiting safe harbor protection to statements made about reporting companies, and excluding statements about investment companies. Significantly, both proposed safe harbor rules covered all oral and written forward-looking information, not just when contained in Commission filings. Neither proposal specifically required inclusion of current projections in registration statements filed under the Securities Act, and no mention was made in the release of the reasons for this omission. In response to the proposals, the Commission received approximately 90 letters of comment. A majority of commenters expressed a belief that a rule incorporating aspects of both proposals would provide the best incentive for projection disclosure. 26 Although a few commenters expressed continuing reservations about the Commission's proposed shift in policy from prohibiting to encouraging projection disclosure, virtually all agreed that a safe harbor rule was desirable and necessary. 27 Most commenters agreed that the safe harbor should be extended to statements made on behalf of the issuer ( i.e. , by third party reviewers). 26 Securities Act Release No. 6084 (Jun. 25, 1979). 27 Id . Several commenters criticized other aspects of the Commission's alternative proposal, arguing that the burden of proof for establishing that a projection did not have a reasonable basis or was not made in good faith should be imposed on the plaintiff, 28 and that the rule's coverage should be extended beyond revenues, earnings, and ``other financial items'' to encompass management's plans and objectives. 29 Commenters argued that the rule's protections should not be limited to companies with a reporting history. 30 Commenters concurred in the proposal to forego conditioning the rule's availability on inclusion of the information in Commission filings on the ground that such a condition could result in a loss of the safe harbor's protections based on a technical or inadvertent filing delinquency. Comments on the propriety of projections by investment companies were mixed. 31 28 Id . Placing the burden on corporate defendants to prove that a projection was prepared with a reasonable basis and disclosed in good faith was viewed as undermining the Commission's goal of encouraging projection disclosure, and possibly worse than no rule at all. 29 Id . 30 Id . According to the release, commenters argued that ``forecast information may be most valuable regarding companies that do not have a history of public information.'' Id . 31 Id . As the Commission observed, ``some commenters did not perceive a basis for distinguishing between investment companies and other issuers␣.␣.␣.␣. Other commenters believed that the type of information generated by investment companies would be more difficult to forecast with reliability and is dependent upon market factors and responses to market events that are inherently unpredictable.'' In 1979, the Commission adopted a safe harbor provision that generally combined aspects of both proposals. 32 Virtually identical safe harbor provisions were codified in Rule 175 under the Securities Act and Rule 3b&hyph;6 under the Exchange Act. 33 These provisions offered safe harbor protection for specified forward-looking statements but only where made, reaffirmed, or later published, in documents filed with the Commission. On this point, the Commission stated that this ``filing'' requirement would provide investors with better access to the information and a more reliable framework within which to evaluate the forward-looking statement, and would enable the Commission to maintain oversight of the accuracy and completeness of the disclosure. 32 See Securities Act Release No. 6084 (Jun. 25, 1979). 33 17 CFR 230.175 (1994), 17 CFR 240.3b&hyph;6 (1994). Second, the final rule incorporated the Advisory Committee's recommendation of placing the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that the forward-looking information lacked a reasonable basis and was made otherwise than in good faith. The Commission reasoned that the liberal discovery procedures available in the federal courts had permitted plaintiffs to elicit the evidence necessary to sustain this burden. The Commission stated that it would monitor the operation of the safe harbor rule to assure that it was not inconsistent with the pre-eminent statutory goal of investor protection. 34 34 Id . The safe harbor provision, as adopted, did not require the publication of assumptions underlying forward-looking statements covered by the rule. In describing the basis for this decision, the Commission ``re-emphasize[d] its position on the significance of assumption disclosures,'' explaining that:
