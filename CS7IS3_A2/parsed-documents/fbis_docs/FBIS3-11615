Ortega Testifies PA2203170794 Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p 1 PA2203170794 Managua LA PRENSA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Report by Eloisa Ibarra A.] [Excerpts] The chief of the Armed Forces has testified for the first time in connection with the Jean Paul Genie case, after refusing to go before a civilian judge and three and a half years later. As you may recall, Jean Paul Genie's death occurred on 28 October 1990 at approximately 2045 on the highway to Masaya, when the young man reportedly tried to pass General Humberto Ortega's motorcade. A barrage of bullets riddled the young man's body killing him instantly. Fifty-two cartridge shells were found where he was killed. Ortega, wearing military garb, arrived at the Army's Public Relations Office where he had been summoned by Dr. Lester Gallo, the military prosecutor in charge of the investigation. Shortly before testifying, as requested by the accusers who were represented by Dr. Daniel Olivas Zuniga, Ortega read a 12-paragraph public letter establishing his position on the events that are currently under investigation. [passage omitted] The Public Relations Office room where the Genie trial is being held was too small for the number of local and international journalists who covered the general's statements. Once Ortega sat in the defendant's seat, he had to answer the customary questions everyone involved in a trial is asked: where he was and what he was doing at the time of the crime. Ortega, like all of his personal bodyguards charged with the crime, told the judge, defense, and prosecution lawyers he was at home on the night of the crime. Ortega said he went to Colonel Lenin Cerna's house that evening but Cerna was not home because he was out of the country. He then went to the general command where he stayed until he went home. He got home early in the evening.
