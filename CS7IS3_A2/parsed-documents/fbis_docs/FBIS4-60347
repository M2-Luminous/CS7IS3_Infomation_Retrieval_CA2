FBIS4-60347 "drnes100_s_94004" FBIS-NES-94-100 Daily Report 22 May 1994 Iran Commentary on Abduction of Lebanon's al-Dirani Commentary on Abduction of Lebanon's al-Dirani NC2205073294 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network in Persian 0345 GMT 22 May 94 NC2205073294 Tehran Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran First Program Network Persian BFN [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries Group] [Text] Yesterday the Zionist regime carried out a new terrorist act by resorting to a kidnapping inside Lebanese territory. Dozens of armed men attacked a village in southern Lebanon on Saturday morning and kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, the head of Lebanon's faithful resistance, from his village home. In reaction to this kidnapping, the Lebanese Hizballah issued a statement yesterday in which it said that the Zionist regime's fresh crime is a manifestation of the terrorist nature of a regime supported by America. Stating that the Islamic ummah has no alternative but to resist the Zionist regime, the Lebanese Hizballah called on all of Lebanon's party and official circles to react to this kidnapping. Also, 'Allamah Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, one of Lebanon's Shiite leaders, described the Zionist regime's terrorist act as a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and called on the UN Security Council to strive for al-Dirani's release. In reaction to this incident, 'Allamah Sayyid Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah, another Lebanese Shiite clerical leader, pointed out that the Lebanese Government's sovereignty has been violated, and he criticized Europe and the United States for their silence vis-a-vis Israel's renewed aggression against Lebanon. Five years ago, in 1989, the Zionist regime took hostage another Hizballah leader, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, in the same manner, kidnapping him from his home. Also, in 1992 a Zionist helicopter violated Lebanese airspace and fired a rocket at the car carrying Hizballah Secretary General 'Abbas al-Musawi and his wife, martyring both of them. The Zionist regime's flaunting of international practice and its aggressive nature has turned the Middle East into a constant hotbed of crisis. Following yesterday's kidnapping, Zionist Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres admitted that the terrorist act had been carried out and lied that the Zionist regime's military ability to strike at its opponents even inside Lebanese territory is very high. Apart from the fact that this overt confession can be used as a proof to condemn the Zionist regime in international circles, it should also not be forgotten that military experts consider this escapade by the Zionist regime to be worthless and an act stemming from weakness.
