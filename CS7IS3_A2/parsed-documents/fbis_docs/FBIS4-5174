The U.S. imperialists, who had broken up [patan] the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, had the UN Security Council release the president's statement, which makes unjustifiable [tangchiannun] demands on us, and are more openly maneuvering to crush [apsal] us. Moreover, the U.S. imperialists are more frantically kicking up commotions for military pressure, while saying that they would resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise and that they would not hesitate to wage another Korean war. In step with them, the puppet South Korean clique intends to stage the nuclear war exercise against us at all cost and babbles that it would offer punitive retaliation [ungjing pobok] against us and use this as an opportunity to achieve reunification if it is necessary. The South Korean puppets put all the puppet armed forces on special alert and even made public a dangerous new plan to invade the North. Teaming up with the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, the Japanese reactionaries, as well, got more deeply involved in the maneuvers to ignite a fuse to a new war on the South Korean peninsula. [sentence as heard] All facts show that the maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries to isolate and crush [apsal] our republic have reached their extreme and that, as a result, a war may break out on the Korean peninsula anytime. However, any maneuver by the enemy cannot frighten our people and the People's Army, under the outstanding leadership of the great commander [yongjang]. If the bastards ignite a fuse to a war after all, our people and the People's Army, filled with a firm resolve to share the same destiny with the party, will resolutely tackle them head on and mercilessly sweep out [mujabihage ssuroborilgut] the enemy. [applause] Responding to the use of force with force and dialogue with dialogue is our firm will and policy [himenun himuro taehwaenun taehwaro tappyonhanun kossi uriui hwakko pudonghan uijiimyo chongchaegimnida]. The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys must not miscalculate [osan] our firm will and policy and act with discretion after clearly seeing the trend of the times. All the people and People's Army officers and men must vigorously wage the struggle to reliably defend the socialist fatherland and the revolutionary gains from the enemy's infringement [chimhae], build the country's defensive forces impregnable, and strengthen the People's Army into an invincible revolutionary army.
