Thank you, Francois Leotard, for being with us this evening. Is such intervention conceivable and envisaged? [Leotard] It is conceivable and envisaged. At this very moment, we have troops taking action or responding to fire in some places when it is necessary. One should know that this action should not be taken without careful consideration because air bombing or action to break blockades would and can have repercussions on our troops on the ground. In other terms, one should be careful when one talks about these issues. We are in a very difficult situation on the ground and the use of force should not be resorted to to worsen the situation of the blue helmets who are still not engaged in hostilities and who are there either for humanitarian reasons in Bosnia or for peacekeeping in Croatia. One should understand that the military situation as such demands a lot of sangfroid, abnegation, and dedication which in fact honor the blue helmets, be they French or from other nationalities. [Masure] It seems that we are heading toward the withdrawal of the Canadian troops, according to what we are hearing this evening. Do you agree with the statement of Jacques Baumel, deputy chairman of the Defense Commission of the National Assembly, who said that the impotent presence of French blue helmets is meaningless? [Leotard] No, I don't share this opinion and I will tell you why. First, we are there because the parties to the conflict asked us. We are there because the role we are playing at this very moment is still useful. We are still protecting women and children. We are escorting convoys that allow them to live or survive. Finally, we should think carefully about the consequences of a withdrawal. I will tell you what the consequences of a withdrawal would be if we are compelled to go: the spread of the conflict to the whole of the Balkans, the likely capture of Sarajevo by the Serbs, and thus a massive deportation of population, the capture of Srebrenica and some other enclaves, and the resumption of hostilities with heavy weapons on some fronts in Croatia. Obviously we are facing something which is not a success; it is undeniable and it hurts the heart when one looks at the pictures. However, as far as I am concerned, and I hope everybody would do the same, I would not say anything that would discourage our soldiers or undermine their action or their morale, and both are needed at the moment. [Masure] You were reminding us a moment ago that we are there because we were asked to go by the main parties to this conflict. At the ceremony when he presented his new year wishes to the press, Alain Juppe said: We have been betrayed by everyone, all the factions. None of the factions wants peace, and all are preparing for war. [Leotard] Unfortunately, what he says is true. That's to say, yet again we have those who are holding discussions in Geneva -- there they are polite, civilized, courteous, very understanding. And then it is the same people, or their associates, who, on the ground, are stepping up attacks against our forces, or stepping up their battles with the other sides in the conflict. So I have every sympathy with what General Cot said. He is right to say it: You have to choose between these two roles. Either you discuss peace with us, or you make war on the ground. But as far as we are concerned -- and I am saying this publicly to the French people, because they have to know it -- we have not declared war on anyone. We are there because we are defending our values, and if we did not, it would be a terrible abdication of responsibility by Europe. We are there because we want to avoid a failure for the United Nations, for NATO, for Europe. And we are there because otherwise we would be abandoning the civilian population. Of course, we are not going to stay there to the point of absurdity. At the proper moment, probably in spring, we will have to discuss with our partners, with the United Nations, the conditions under which we will stay there. [Masure] Next Monday and Tuesday [10-11 January] there is a summit of the Atlantic alliance in Brussels. Alain Juppe has hinted at a new initiative. What might it be? Do you share the pessimism of David Owen, who is very familiar with the case, and who is talking of a possible withdrawal of all the UN peacekeeping forces in spring? [Leotard] That would be an astounding failure, much more serious than today's failure. But of course, we have to look at all possibilities. When we hold this NATO summit next week, we will express the hope, we will ask the United States, for example, to intervene and help us, to ensure that this hotbed of war does not spread over the whole of southern Europe and the Balkans. This is our responsibility. As you know, as everyone knows, this is where the First World War started. So we have to be very careful, and France -- this redounds to its honor -- has stepped up its diplomatic and military initiatives to prevent this conflict from spreading. So let us keep our cool. It is difficult. It is a very thankless task, but personally, I should like to express my support for these soldiers, most of them French, as you know, who are trying today, as best they can, exhausted and demoralized, to save women and children. We must not let them down, these women and children. [Masure] Thank you, Francois Leotard, for having discussed this delicate matter with us.
