[passage omitted] The pro-Meciar government daily REPUBLIKA launches another attack against the personality and past of Moravcik under the page one banner headline "Founder of the Spark of Lenin Club Heads Slovak Government." Moravcik's decision to form a dissident faction within the HZDS [Movement For a Democratic Slovakia] and then to join forces with those who voted no confidence in Meciar shows that the new premier's "realism" lies in his ability to connive and predict the future, the daily writes. The roots of Moravcik's stances which elevated him to the foreign ministry are embedded in the Spark of Lenin Club, "which began its activities -- wonder of the world -- not in the 1950's or the years of normalisation, but in 1988." Moravcik was "also prescient when he later joined forces with Meciar... but was hardened by the political discussions in the Spark of Lenin Club, put out his antennae in time, and behind the back of his movement (the HZDS) he held talks with President Kovac and opposition leaders about bringing down the government he belonged to." "After the lighting of the Leninist spark, the `centering' of the VPN (Public Against Violence, the forerunner of HZDS) and the `realistic alternative,' Moravcik is getting, with the help of college educated Marxist-Leninists (this time in the Democratic Left Party [SDL]), the post he was already modestly longing for around the Leninist campfire," REPUBLIKA concludes. "His rise has its logic. According to the principle: Shake thoroughly before use, after use throw it out." REPUBLIKA continues in the same vein with its attacks on Moravcik's still unnamed government, which it says does not have nor will have either ethical, moral or political legitimacy or authority. The new government did not come to power through parliamentary elections, but through intrigues, and therefore will rush toward populism. Nor will it restrain itself from making promises or insulting the previous government, the daily writes. "Similarities to (the communist takeover in) February 1948 are certainly accidental," REPUBLIKA comments ironically. "Only the `technology' of the strategy and tactics was different then, and the individuals played different roles," it adds, pointing out that one of the main actors in today's drama was a member of the Czechoslovak Communist Party operating in London, later as a financial advisor to Castro's Cuba, and now as president. REPUBLIKA also claims that it was 230 billion crowns worth of national property to be privatised that led SDL Chairman Peter Weiss, who "hides badly his longing for the renewal of communist power," and KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] Chairman Jan Carnogursky, who "voted against the Slovak Constitution, sovereignty and statehood," to join forces. "When money is concerned, brother doesn't know brother. Vladimir Meciar broke with 'morality' because he did not want anything for himself. As they said during the French Revolution: One can't be clean among the unclean." [passage omitted]
