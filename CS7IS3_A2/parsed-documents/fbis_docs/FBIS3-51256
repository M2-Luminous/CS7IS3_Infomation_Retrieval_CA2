Witnesses say six helicopters landed with troops, while two small airplanes overflew the zone. The helicopters landed, one by one, and deposited troops in the village. Certain residences were later raided. Aircraft also overflew the area, and helicopters landed in Gaitan, a poppy and guerrilla forces center located two hours from Rio Blanco. [Begin Hernando Cardenas recording] It has been confirmed that people's money has been seized. It is known that one person's 10 million pesos were taken. [end recording] People living in this zone of Tolima Department say the country's authorities are doing the right thing when they provide protection, but they wonder: Why was such an impressive operation launched? Why did the operation include foreign personnel? [Begin recording] [Father Ivan Rodriguez] I saw helicopters flying overhead. It is true, there were some foreigners. [Jesus Valbuena] The commanders were people who spoke very little, and they were heard speaking some words in English. [end recording] The residents of Rio Blanco are used to many difficult situations, but they are still perplexed by this operation.
