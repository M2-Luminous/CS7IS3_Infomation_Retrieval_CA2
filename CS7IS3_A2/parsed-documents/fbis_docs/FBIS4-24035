Mr. Bihozagara was expected in Paris this morning for talks with French officials, but in the end he declined the invitation. Quentin Dickinson met him in Brussels. He asked him first of all about his feelings, his assessment of the statement issued by the OAU this evening opposing French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. Listen to Jacques Bihozagara: [Bihozagara] We believe that the OAU, as an international institution which was closely involved with the Arusha talks, which ended in the signing of the Arusha peace agreement, has reacted properly in speaking out against French intervention, which in fact goes against the Arusha agreement, and also the UN resolution. [Dickinson] Does this decision by the OAU come as a surprise to you? [Bihozagara] Listen, it is not surprising, and we believe that the OAU has always defended the Arusha agreement against those who in fact wanted to (?upset things). [Dickinson] You were due to go to Paris to meet the cooperation minister, Michel Roussin, and Madame Michaux-Chevry: Why did you not go? [Bihozagara] I believe that this is a misleading report, because in fact France was ready to receive me in Paris, but it was not a meeting with the people whom you have just mentioned, so that is why I did not go. [Dickinson] So, who you were due to see? [Bihozagara] Listen, you know that the Rwandan problem at present requires in-depth analysis by political decision-makers and I believe that if one has to go to Paris one has to see the people who have the Rwandan question among their areas of responsibility. [Dickinson] The Rwandan question is part of the cooperation minister's brief, though. [Bihozagara] However, the cooperation minister was not mentioned as being one of the people that I was due to meet. [Dickinson] You would have met him though, if you were invited. [Bihozagara] As far as I know we have always met the French authorities -- even last year, when I was the RPF's official in Europe with responsibility for foreign policy -- so there is no reason why we do not meet the French authorities if this can bring about understanding. [Dickinson] You know that the European public are quite shocked by the massacres in your country, so how do you answer the people here who say we have the impression that for you putting an end to the massacres is, in a way, a secondary matter compared with the military victory which you are expecting? [Bihozagara] We believe that the RPF was the party most greatly concerned about stopping the massacres, and the RPF went into action on 7 April after the death of President Habyarimana when all the international communities had pulled out of Rwanda [as heard], so I believe that if there are people who are changing their opinion now it is not because of this international community or France, but it is due to the intervention of the RPF, which has been able to save various people without distinction from the assault by the militias and extremists of the Rwandan army. [Dickinson] Do you not think that by the same token French intervention or international intervention would make it possible to save lives? [Bihozagara] I believe we have spoken out in favor of international intervention, but we do not welcome French intervention, for the reasons which we have outlined, because France has been too heavily involved in Rwanda's affairs.
