FR940428-0-00029 FR940428-0-00011 Regulatory Background The 1978 amendments to the PWSA required the Coast Guard to undertake a port access route study to determine the need for TSSs or shipping safety fairways to increase vessel traffic safety in offshore areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The Coast Guard initiated this study by publishing a notice of study on April 16, 1979 (44 FR 22543). The final notice of study results for the TSS in the Approaches to Chesapeake Bay was published on July 22, 1982 (47 FR 31766). The study concluded that the existing TSS was adequate for the foreseeable future. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986, Public Law 99&hyph;662, (33 U.S.C. 2201 et seq. ) authorized the deepening of the Thimble Shoals, Newport News, Craney Island Reach, Norfolk Harbor Reach, and the Entrance Reach Channels in the port of Hampton Roads to a depth of 55 ’ below mean low water (MLW) and construction of a new channel, to be known as the Atlantic Ocean Channel. The Atlantic Ocean Channel will connect deep water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay with deep water in the Atlantic Ocean. Completion of the dredging of all channels except the Atlantic Ocean Channel to 50 ’ (MLW) allows vessels with drafts exceeding the water depths in the existing Southern Approach lanes to call on the ports of Hampton Roads. The COE conducted hydrographic surveys in 1985 and 1986 and found that the water depth in the Southern Approach lanes was only 48 ’ (MLW); however, water depths of 50 ’ were found in the immediate vicinity. To ensure safe navigation for vessels with drafts exceeding the water depth in the Southern Approach lanes, the Coast Guard suspended the Southern Approach lanes (Notice to Mariners No. 31, July 30, 1988). A system of safewater buoys was established, as an interim measure, to direct vessels to naturally occurring deeper waters in the immediate vicinity. The Coast Guard opened a Port Access Route Study on July 12, 1988 (53 FR 26282). The study, conducted by the Fifth Coast Guard District in Portsmouth, VA, evaluated the need for vessel routing measures in the approaches to Chesapeake Bay. The study area encompassed the approaches to Chesapeake Bay, including the TSS. The study results were published on July 13, 1989, at 54 FR 29627. The study, concluding that there is a continuing need for the TSS, recommended that the Southern Approach be realigned and reconfigured to incorporate a deep-water route with specific rules for vessels operating therein. A deep-water route is an internationally recognized routing measure primarily intended for use by ships, which because of their draft in relation to the available depth of water in the area concerned, require the use of such a route. In the Southern Approach, water depths outside of the planned deep water route are insufficient for use by vessels drawing more than 45 ’ of water. It is also a general requirement of IMO that traffic which does not require the use of the deep-water route should avoid using the route. The Coast Guard submitted the amended TSS, as proposed in the NPRM, to IMO's Subcommittee on Safety of Navigation (NAV) for consideration and approval at its September 1990 meeting. The Subcommittee approved the establishment of a deep-water route between the traffic lanes of the southern approach of the TSS as proposed by the U.S., but ``could not agree with the proposal to recommend the use of the deep-water route by certain ships with a draft of less than 45 ’ (13.5 meters) which need not use the deep-water route.'' The Subcommittee amended the U.S. proposal accordingly and forwarded it to IMO's Maritime Safety Committee for consideration and adoption. The Committee adopted the revised proposal at its May 1991 meeting for implementation at 0000 hours UTC, 0500 Eastern Time Zone, on 16 November 1991. The Coast Guard is reconfiguring the Southern Approach, which is crucial to continued navigation safety and protection of the marine environment, and publishing the Precautionary Area and Eastern Approach parts of the existing TSS. The Southern Approach consists of inbound and outbound lanes for vessels drawing 45 ’ of water or less, separated by a 1300 ’ wide deep-water route for inbound and outbound vessels drawing over 45 ’ of water and for naval aircraft carriers.
