The most frequent illegal action is that of buying and selling houses through donations and swaps. The donation of houses among former married couples [ex conyugues] is now regulated. The new resolution of 1994 regulates cases of donations among former married couples: The transfer will not be authorized if they had no offspring and were not married two years. The matter will be submitted to the president of the National Housing Institute for consideration when the donations are made to legal entities. The inheritance of houses through wills: The new resolution of the National Housing Institute states that in all cases of legal entities inheriting houses through wills, the acting notary public will obtain the authorization from the president of the entity. The specialized sectors of the housing system will receive and diligently investigate possible illegal actions intended to deride the current legislation. A complete report will be made when the information received contains enough elements to suggest that an illegal transfer of housing is taking place. The provincial housing authorities will immediately take up the matter and will coordinate with the proper departments of the Justice Ministry, State Attorney's Office, and the Interior Ministry.
