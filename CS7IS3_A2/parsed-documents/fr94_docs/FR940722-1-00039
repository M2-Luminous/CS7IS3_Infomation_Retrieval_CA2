FR940722-1-00039 FR940722-1-00012 Near the end of the effort to harmonize the normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplane airworthiness standards, the JAA requested and received recommendations from its member countries on proposed airworthiness standards for commuter category airplanes. The JAA and the FAA held specialist and study group meetings to discuss these recommendations, which resulted in proposals to revise portions of the part 23 commuter category airworthiness standards. Unlike the European rules, where commuter category airworthiness standards are separate, for U.S. rulemaking, it is advantageous to adopt normal, utility, acrobatic, and commuter category airworthiness standards simultaneously, since commuter category airworthiness standards are already contained in part 23. Accordingly, this NPRM proposes to revise the systems and equipment airworthiness standards for all part 23 airplanes. During the part 23 harmonization effort, the FAA established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991), which held its first meeting on May 23, 1991. The ARAC on General Aviation and Business Airplane (GABA) Issues was established at that meeting to provide advice and recommendations to the Director, Aircraft Certification Service, FAA, regarding the airworthiness standards in part 23 as well as related provisions of parts 91 and 135 of the regulations. The FAA announced, on June 2&hyph;5, 1992, at the JAA/FAA Harmonization Conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that it would consolidate within the ARAC structure an ongoing objective to ``harmonize'' the JAR and the FAR. Coinciding with that announcement, the FAA assigned the ARAC on GABA Issues those rulemaking projects related to JAR/part 23 harmonization that were in final coordination between the JAA and the FAA. The harmonization process included the intention to present the results of JAA/FAA coordination to the public as NPRM's. Subsequently, the ARAC on GABA Issues established an ARAC&hyph;JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR 23 Study Group made recommendations to the ARAC on GABA Issues concerning the FAA disposition of the rulemaking issues coordinated between the JAA and the FAA. The draft NPRMs previously prepared by the FAA harmonization team were made available to the harmonization working group to assist them in their effort. A notice of the formation of the JAR 23 Harmonization Working Group was published on November 30, 1992 (57 FR 56626). The group held its first meeting on February 2, 1993. These efforts resulted in the proposals for systems and equipment airworthiness standards contained in this notice. The ARAC on GABA Issues agreed with these proposals. The FAA received unsolicited comments from the JAA dated January 20, 1994, concerning issues that were left unresolved with the JAR 23 Study Group. The JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group did not address some of the unresolved issues because the JAA had not yet reached positions on those issues. Unresolved issues will be dealt with at future FAR/JAR Harmonization meetings. With respect to other issues unresolved by the JAR 23 Study Group, the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization Working Group recommendations did not reflect harmonization, but reflected the technical discussion of the merits of each issue that had been thoroughly debated at the JAR/FAR 23 Harmonization meetings. (The Working Group Chairperson had been present at the Harmonization meetings.) The JAA comments have been placed in the docket for this proposal, and will be considered along with those received during the comment period. Following completion of these harmonization efforts, the FAA determined that the proposed revisions to part 23 were too numerous for a single NPRM. The FAA decided to simplify the issues by issuing four NPRM's. These NPRM's address the airworthiness standards in the specific areas of systems and equipment, powerplant, flight, and airframe. These NPRM's propose changes in all seven subparts of part 23. Since there is some overlap, interested persons are advised to review all four NPRM's to identify all proposed changes to a particular section. Discussion of Proposals Section 23.677␣Trim Systems Proposed revised §23.677(a) would clarify the need to mark the lateral and directional trim indicators with the neutral trim position. Since trim indicators on most airplanes are currently marked with the neutral position of the trimming device, this proposal would standardize the cockpit markings for all airplanes. Revised paragraph (a) would also add a requirement for the pitch trim indicator to be marked with the proper pitch trim range for the takeoff of the airplane. Some takeoff accidents, including some involving fatalities, have occurred because the pitch trim was not set to the proper range needed for the airplane takeoff. Because of this accident experience, most of the current airplane manufacturers mark the pitch trim indicator with the pitch trim range for takeoff. Therefore, the proposed marking requirement would not have a significant impact on future airplane designs and would ensure that the markings needed for a safe takeoff are provided for the pilots' use. Section 23.691␣Artificial Stall Barrier System This proposed new section would provide standards for stall barrier systems if a stall barrier is necessary to show compliance with §23.201(c). The requirements of §23.201(c) provide criteria for the in-flight demonstration of wings level stall. The requirements also specify the means of identifying when a stall has occurred. Amendment No. 23&hyph;45 (58 FR 42136, August 6, 1993) revised §23.201(c) by adding the activation of an artificial stall barrier as an acceptable means of identifying when a stall has occurred. As the technology of airplane designs improved and engines with increased power became available, airplanes were developed that did not meet the older wings level stall requirement of §23.201. Consequently, these airplanes were equipped with an artificial stall barrier that moved the airplane elevator controls and caused a nose down pitching motion similar to the pitching motion of airplanes that meet the wings level stall requirement of §23.201. The manufacturer selected the airspeed where this pitching motion occurred and flight testing established compliance with the other flight regulations at airspeeds above the speed selected for the push. These stall barrier systems are commonly called ``stick pushers.'' Such systems have been accepted for compliance with §23.201 under the equivalent safety provisions of §21.21(b)(1), since they provide a pitch motion that is equivalent to that experienced during stalls of airplanes that meet the stall requirements of §23.201. Appropriate compliance with other applicable requirements of part 23 has been established by other design characteristics of the stall barrier system. The provisions of the proposed new section are based on system design characteristics necessary to ensure the safe operation of previously approved stall barrier systems. The proposed section also requires such systems to include provisions to prevent unwanted activation of the stall barrier systems. This is necessary to ensure that such systems do not cause downward pitching motions at higher airspeeds when such pitching could be unsafe. The proposed sections would basically codify those provisions that have been found necessary for approving stick pusher systems under the equivalent safety requirements of §21.21(b)(1). Therefore, in effect, no new requirements would be added by this proposed amendment. The proposed new section would be applicable only to airplanes with flight characteristics that need an artificial stall barrier system to ensure safe operation of that airplane. Including provision for the installation of an optional stick pusher system would relieve the manufacturer of the financial burden that would be needed to redesign the airplane so that it would meet the wings level stall requirements.
