[passage omitted] In late December 1993, the personal representative of Abdullah Ocalan, Zahir Bardani, met with political leaders of Armenia in Echmiadzin. The representative of Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh, Levon Melik-Shakhnazarov attended the meeting as well. As a result of the meeting, the KWP headquarters was partially moved to Armenia and 660 Kurdish soldiers appeared in Armenian units fighting against Azerbaijan. But cooperation of Armenians and Kurds began long before the meeting in Echmiadzin. Since 1988, Kurdish soldiers have been training together with Armenian terrorists from "ASALA" [Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia] in Cyprus. Soon, Abdullah Ocalan gave $1.2 million to build an additional base for the training of Armenian and Kurdish soldiers. Earlier, Western journalists having visited Armenian regions neighbouring Turkey, reported that there were 21 bases training Kurdish soldiers. According to the same sources, the Kurds have been conducting subversive acts in Turkey from those bases.
