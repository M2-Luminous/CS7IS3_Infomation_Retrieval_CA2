Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko told the chamber that the Lower House, the State Duma which approved the budget upon second reading, failed to forward it to the Upper House. The Federation Council speaker also informed the members that the Duma refused to hear the Upper House Budget Committee Chairman Nikolay Gonchar who wanted to inform the Duma about objections to some articles of the federal budget. According to Shumeyko, the State Duma plans to return to the draft budget before forwarding it to the Upper House of the Russian legislature. The Federation Council decided to hear Nikolay Gonchar's report on Tuesday afternoon and call upon the Duma to take due account of the proposals made by Federation Council members. The debate about the proposed budget is nonetheless likely to take part when the chamber goes down to the "any other business" item under pressure of the pickets outside the building who demand prompt support for the defence industry.
