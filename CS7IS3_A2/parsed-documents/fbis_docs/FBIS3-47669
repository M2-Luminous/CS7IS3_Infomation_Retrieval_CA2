The seven ruling coalition parties are trying to coordinate their views on "the one pending issue" in writing the package, Economic Planning Agency [EPA] Director General Manae Kubota told a regular press conference. Kubota was referring to a dispute among the seven parties over whether a consumption tax hike should be included in the package to cover proposed income tax cuts. The Social Democratic Party [of Japan], the largest of the seven, has been strongly opposed to raising the consumption tax rate from the current 3 percent. The coalition parties are prepared to "do all they can" toward this weekend in order to prevent a further delay in formation of economic steps, Kubota said. She said a third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 to finance the new economic package will be formulated along with the announcement of the economic measures.
