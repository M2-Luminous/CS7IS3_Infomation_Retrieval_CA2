The recent talk of the town in Guangzhou was that Deng Xiaoping would make another "southern tour," and spend the spring festival in Guangzhou instead of Shanghai as is the usual practice. A renowned expert, who has familiar knowledge of Beijing's political and economic situation, stated that China had already pushed the market economic reform in a comprehensive way in line with Deng Xiaoping's line of thought. However, because relevant plans have involved interest redistribution, extremely great differences remained inside the CPC, with intensified interest contradiction between the central authorities and localities. Deng Xiaoping recently said that he would stand up and speak his mind. Aside from paying attention to various step-by-step reforms that have already been pushed, Deng has also shown great concern for the issue of inflation. Some reports indicate that Deng made a few points about the grain price rise that took place toward the end of last year. He said that the matter showed that the mass mentality remained comparative fragile; he required governments at various levels to pay attention to issues of a universal nature surfacing in the course of reform as well as people's tolerance; at the same time, he praised the central authorities for adopting prompt measures to stabilize grain prices, saying that the action was an expression of the collective leadership's maturity. Deng's remarks have once again backed Vice Premier Zhu Rongji. Not long ago, cadres in China studied Zhu Rongji's recent speech delivered at a CPPCC meeting. In his speech, Zhu stressed that differences in thinking inside the party and between the central authorities and localities remained regarding issues of reform, while frankly acknowledging that the central authorities and he himself were under very great pressure. It was learned that some conservative force had recently impeded relying of reforms on the issue of inflation. While Deng praised the central leadership for its practice, he was obviously backing Zhu Rongji. An official of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government said that Deng was likely to take advantage of his appearance during another southern inspection tour during the Spring Festival to air his opinions. Ever since mid-December, news has spread that Deng Xiaoping would make another tour of Guangdong. The official said Deng southern inspection tour that took place at this time in 1991 started a whirlwind of reform across China. Today, China has already announced that it would build the market economy; in addition, beginning with last July, the central authorities have implemented macroeconomic regulation and control. In a nutshell, the changes in Guangdong over the past two years are worth Deng seeing with his own eyes. Another point is that the finance and tax reform to be pushed in 1994 is not favorable to coastal developed provinces including Guangdong. Should Deng make another southern inspection tour, that might play the role of appeasing localities. Last month, Beijing Vice Mayor Zhang Baifa disclosed that he accompanied Deng Xiaoping touring Beijing last October. Presently, the north has become bitter cold, and Deng Xiaoping should already have gone south to avoid the cold weather, or is he making plans for another "southern inspection tour?"
