[passage omitted] He added that Myanmar [Burma] is a union which comprises various indigenous nationals who reside together. Moreover, in Myanmar the indigenous nationals have been residing unitedly in the union through weal and woe for more than 1,000 years, and it is a country with its own culture. The colonialist-imperialists coveted the country's prosperity, and the abundant natural resources, staging three wars of aggression and enslaving Myanmar. [Passage omitted]. Although it has been over 40 years since independence, regions with the rule of law and tranquility have been developed to a certain extent, while regions infested with insurgency are still lagging behind. He added that The SLORC's objectives are: the brethren who are indigenous nationals in the union must develop evenly, and all indigenous nationals must have a right to enjoy the taste of independence, which is achieved by all indigenous nationals joining hands and working unitedly. It is realized that national reconciliation is crucial in the implementation of these objectives. That is why, jungle-based armed organizations are invited to return to the legal fold. The state government has been extending this invitation with genuine goodwill and is intent on working for the consistent development of all states, including the border areas; allowing all the indigenous nationals to enjoy the taste of independence; and seeking the rapid development of the whole union. He said that due to the invitation, the SLORC will meet and coordinate with some jungle-based armed organizations in the near future. The light of hope for peace is emerging. Every one has to continue to work for the full-fledged emergence of this light of hope for peace. In the upcoming meeting, the SLORC will participate with complete sincerity, and honesty. He added that, while people are needed to support this meeting actively and unitedly, the jungle-based armed organizations are also required to hold discussions with genuine goodwill and an honest attitude. These objectives will be accomplished for sure if both parties base their discussions on honesty, and loyalty. He also said that the cabinet ministers are accompanying him to accelerate development activities in Kayah State if it becomes peaceful and tranquil. He said the light of peace is beginning to emerge in Kayah State and the SLORC is ready to implement rapid regional development in Kayah State once the region becomes stable and tranquil. The SLORC is simply explaining and presenting the state government's genuine attitude and intention to all the indigenous nationals. That is why all people, regardless of their race and religion, and all indigenous nationals who are residing in the Kayah State are needed to work together for the success of SLORC's objectives and aims.
