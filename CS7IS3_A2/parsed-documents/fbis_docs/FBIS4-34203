At a news conference in the aftermath of the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which ended today in Cartagena, Menem commented on the talks the presidents have held on the Cuban issue and said that in order to readmit Cuba into the OAS, this country must first return to democracy. Commenting on the same conversation on Cuba, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria stressed the talks held with Castro and the hope for "gradual changes" on the island. However, Gaviria added the Cuban president could not be persuaded. Menem refused to disclose what was said about Cuba during the closed-door meeting held today by the 23 leaders who attended the summit. As for the conference declaration's last paragraph, which criticizes the "coercive" measures adopted to the detriment of some Ibero-American peoples, Menem said as soon as Cuba becomes democratic "we will exert pressure on the United States to end the blockade on the island." The Argentine president insisted "the only way Cuba can join the OAS is by establishing a democracy." However, Menem reported that the Cuban president said that "once America becomes integrated, he will hold elections to democratize the country." As for Castro's statements, President Menem pointed out: "integration is what took place in Europe," recalling the case of Spain, where democracy arrived before being accepted into the EEC. Meanwhile, President Gaviria stressed "we had never held talks on Cuba such as during these talks, and we all trust there will be a gradual change there; that is, we hope and expect a peaceful change to take place in Cuba." The main issue at the news conference, also attended by Chilean President Eduardo Frei, was the same as that of the summit: Cuba. Fidel Castro was the talk of the town in Cartagena when he appeared wearing a guayabera shirt instead of his traditional army green uniform and when he angrily asked the presidents to respect his country as he respects theirs. President Menem said today that the Ibero-American presidents are "anxious" to see democracy in Cuba, adding that that all depends on the Cubans themselves. As for the next summit to be held in Argentina, Carlos Menem stressed he will extend an invitation to Castro, who has attended the four previous summits, and jokingly said: "Castro already sees we are indeed democratic." As he emphasized the good atmosphere attained at the Ibero-American meeting, Gaviria pointed out the Cuban leader already speaks of "his good friend, President Menem." The Colombian president also commented on the different "positions" on the Cuban issue taken by the Ibero-American countries. However, he underscored that "the objective is the same: we all want political and economic changes in Cuba, and we all want Cuba to return to the inter-American system should these changes take place." President Gaviria told EFE we all have tried to persuade Fidel Castro through dialogue, but there have been no "commitments" whatsoever.
