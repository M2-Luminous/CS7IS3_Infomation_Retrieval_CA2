PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale said the premiers would meet from time to time in different regional capitals. Only North-West Premier Popo Molefe, who is ill, was not present. He was represented by Satish Roopa. The premiers will meet Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer and Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya in Pretoria for further discussions on provincial executive powers. The meeting is a follow-up to a meeting in Cape Town last month and follows the removal by proclamation last Friday of all provincial powers. The powers were temporarily assigned to central government departments in preparation for their being devolved to the provinces. The expectation is that most of the provincial premiers will apply to be able to exercise all of the powers determined by the constitution. While some of these powers can be exercised exclusively, others can only be exercised subject to the approval of the central government. Mr Meyer said at a recent briefing he envisaged a process in which the provinces negotiated for powers from central government. Apart from fulfilling constitutional provisions the provinces have to be able to demonstrate that their administrations will be in a position to administer the exercise of powers. This is especially difficult given that provincial administrations are being amalgamated with former homeland and self-governing territories' administrations. The process is far from complete. In some cases a province might leave a function to the central government even though constitutionally it is entitled to administer that function on its own.
