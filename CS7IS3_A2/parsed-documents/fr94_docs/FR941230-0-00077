FR941230-0-00077 FR941230-0-00016 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 49 CFR Part 1002 [Ex Parte No. 246 (Sub-No. 13)] Regulations Governing Fees for Services Performed in Connection With Licensing and Related Services_1995 Update AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Commission adopts its 1995 User Fee Update and revises its fee schedule at this time to recover the cost associated with the January 1995 Government salary increases. EFFECTIVE DATE: These rules are effective on February 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen M. King, (202) 927&hyph;5493, or for costing questions David T. Groves, (202) 927&hyph;6395. [TDD for the hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Since 1985, the Commission has issued an annual decision that updates its user fee schedule as required by the regulations in 49 CFR 1002.3. In previous fee update decisions, which generally were effective in October, the Commission's fees were revised based on the cost study formula set forth at 49 CFR 1002.3(d). Also, in certain years, selected fees were modified to reflect new cost study data or changes in Commission fee policy. In Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1994 Update, 10 I.C.C.2d 194 (1994), the Commission changed the regulations in 49 CFR 1002.3(a) to provide that the entire fee schedule, or selected fees, could be modified more than once a year, if necessary. Because Commission employees will receive a salary increase of 3.22% in January 1995, we are updating our user fees, effective February 1, 1995, to recover our increased personnel cost. All fees will be updated based on our cost formula contained in 49 CFR 1002.3(d). The fee increases involved here result only from the mechanical application of the update formula in 49 CFR 1002.3(d), which was adopted through notice and comment procedures in Regulations Governing Fees for Services_1987 Update, 4 I.C.C.2d 137 (1987). Therefore, we believe that good cause exists for finding that notice and comment is unnecessary for this proceeding. See Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1990 Update, 7 I.C.C.2d 3 (1990), Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1991 Update, 8 I.C.C.2d 13 (1991), and Regulations Governing Fees For Services_1993 Update, 9 I.C.C.2d 855 (1993). We conclude that these fee changes, which are being adopted here, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the Commission's regulations provide for waiver of filing fees for those entities which can make the required showing of financial hardship. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.
