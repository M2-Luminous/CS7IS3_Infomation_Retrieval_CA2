The resistance of 5'-O,N-protected fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd under the conditions of standard postsynthesis oligonucleotide treatment is examined, and it is shown that exposure of such protected fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd to concentrated ammonia at 55�C for 18 h with subsequent exposure to an 80% aqueous solution of acetic acid at 20�C for 40 min removes the protective groups without altering the fluoridated nucleoside structure. It is speculated that the absence of benzoyl amino group protection makes the nucleoside more stable to subsequent acid treatment. The findings show that oligonucleotides containing fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd in the middle of the chain can be produced rather simply and effectively by a combination of chemical and enzymatic synthesis; this method can be used for producing oligonucleotides not only with a single fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd radical inclusion but also with several fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd radicals spaced from each other by six-to-seven nucleotide links by ligating several oligonucleotides with 5'-terminal fl[.sup]5[/]Cyd. The authors are grateful to V.N. Sergeyev, V.N. Tashlitskiy, and G.Ya. Sheflyan for help with isolating and analyzing oligonucleotides. Figures 1; references 11: 2 Russian, 9 Western.
