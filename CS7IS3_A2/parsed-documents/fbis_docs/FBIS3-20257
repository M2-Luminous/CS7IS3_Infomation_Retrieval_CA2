By sending 2,700 Turkish and 500 Greek soldiers, for the first time "a UN principle is broken that says that neighboring states or countries with historically burdened relations do not send troops," Austrian General Guenther Greindl says. Greindl strictly opposes Austrian Blue Helmets for Bosnia: "Germans and some other nations should stay out of Bosnia. Austria was not asked by anyone to send soldiers." Instead, Austria has successfully provided equipment and humanitarian aid. In Greindl's view, the UN mission in ex-Yugoslavia will drag on for decades "until the crisis is settled." In no case may borders be changed. "As soon as one border is redrawn, the entire Balkans begins to slide." One will probably have to tolerate ethnic cleansing within the republics. In every other respect, however, autonomy, the protection of human rights, and the further cooperation of the United States, Russia, and the European Union are the only way out of the crisis, Greindl noted.
