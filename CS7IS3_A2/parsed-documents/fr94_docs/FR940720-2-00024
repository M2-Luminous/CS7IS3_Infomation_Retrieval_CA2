FR940720-2-00024 FR940720-2-00015 Department of the Army Domestic Personal Property Rate Solicitation_Proposed Changes AGENCY: Military Traffic Management Command, DOD. ACTION: Notice of proposed change. SUMMARY: The Military Traffic Management Command is proposing changes to the Domestic Personal Property Rate Solicitation. This solicitation is the guidelines for interstate and intrastate household services for Department of Defense sponsored shipments. DATES: Comments must be received by September 19, 1994. ADDRESSES: Military Traffic Management Command, Attn: MTOP&hyph;T&hyph;NP, Room 621, 5611 Columbia Pike, Falls Church, VA 22041&hyph;5050. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Janet Nemier, (703) 756&hyph;1190. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: There have been considerable changes in the geographical operating areas where personal property shipments have been traditionally picked up and delivered. These changes have been caused by a myriad of operational revisions within the DOD infrastructure, to include military base closures and realignments and the growth of suburban areas surrounding military installations which have resulted in DOD personnel relocating to areas which are more distant from military installations. Requirements such as those necessitate change to storage-in-transit (SIT) rules in the delivery of domestic household goods. The following changes are proposed to section 7. All related items in D&hyph;3 impacted by this provision will be changed accordingly. a. Paragraph 3. Change 30 miles or less to 50 miles or less. b. Note 1. Change 30 milies or less to 50 miles or less. c. Note 5. The carrier should use a DOD-approved agent's available storage facility within a 50-mile radius of the location shown in Block 18 on the personal property Government Bill of Lading (PPGBL). If no agent's facility is available within a 50-mile radius, the carrier must obtain authorization from the PPSO to use a more distant facility. (1) If no authorization is given, the charges will be assessed as if the shipment was placed in SIT at the location shown in Block 18 of the PPGBL. (2) If an alternate location to Bock 18 on the PPGBL is used for carrier convenience, as shown on the DD Form 619, the Government will pay the lower of the SIT and related service charges. (3) A DOD-approved facility is defined as follows: An agent's storage facility which has DOD approval and is accepting DOD traffic from a carrier. If the agent refuses to accept a shipment, e.g., because of the carrier's refusal to provide a waiver and/or to the carrier's poor payment history, the agent's facility will be considered ``available'' for purpose of determining charges irrespective of what destination warehouse the carrier uses.
