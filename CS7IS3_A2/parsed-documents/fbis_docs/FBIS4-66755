One week after we write about how exporting is the solution, the government comes out with a decision to raise Egyptian exports to 10 billion [dollars] in five years--a 500-percent increase in our exports over their current value! Is it possible, or just an illusion? Is it a dream that can be realized? I immediately say yes. It is no exaggeration to say it is a modest figure, compared to what Tunisia, Morocco, and other even more backward African countries are realizing. A yield of $10 billion for Egypt's exports to all the world's markets, while Turkey, with a population about equal to Egypt's, exports $16 billion! Israel, with 5 million people, exports at the rate of $12 billion. Singapore, with fewer than 3 million people, exported at the rate of $59 billion in 1991. In short, an Egyptian citizen exports the equivalent of $72; an Israeli citizen 30 times as much, or $2,160; and a citizen of Singapore 359 times as much, or $25,848. Today we dream of a yield of $10.15 billion from Egypt's agricultural, industrial, and mineral exports. It must become a reality, for we have no choice. All the opportunities and circumstances are favorable for us. The markets of the world are around us. Where is the problem? What is the solution, so that the dream may become reality, not fantasy? First, a ministry for exports, instead of a ministry for emigration! If we are serious about the economic reform process, want equilibrium in our balance of payments, and are honest in what we say about exporting, we must find unconventional solutions and apply them quickly. An export ministry in a period of five years would create a revolution in thinking and procedures. It would present exhaustive studies of all foreign markets, their specific requirements, and the taste of consumers in them. It would be a ministry to coordinate between those in charge of production policies and marketing. It would be a budgeted ministry to promote Egyptian products abroad with good advertising, elegant catalogues, and participation in all international exhibitions. It would even hold its own international exhibition, to which it would invite all the countries of the world every year. It would be a ministry over all our trade offices. Our embassies would assist it with all their facilities. Today's wars and tomorrow's policies are economic wars and policies. The Egyptian producer abroad is our roving ambassador who enters every house. What one export dollar can accomplish is hundreds of times more than can be achieved by spending on propaganda for Egypt. It would be a ministry with a single goal: at least $10 billion a year! Second, production policy and marketing policy! Production is the starting point. The agencies in charge of agricultural or industrial production operate at a distance from those that serve exports; there is a complete separation between them. From now on there must be coordination between the two policies: for production for the domestic market is completely different in its specifications and schedules and even in its taste in agricultural products. We must produce what foreign markets need on schedules that suit those markets and to their specifications and tastes. In the production process one must attend to quality and again quality. Quality is the pillar of export and the real primary weapon for invading international markets. In short, production policy and export policy must complement each other. They are two sides of one coin. Third, land, sea, and air transportation! The most important problem that faces export in Egypt is finding an appropriate, cheap means of transportation--especially air freight. Here the government can play a role in encouraging our exports. It can do what Tunisia and Jordan have done by subsidizing the transportation process, so that costs can be reduced and the Egyptian product can successfully compete in the face of other competing products subsidized by their governments. For example, it is proposed that two of Egypt Air's old Airbus planes be earmarked for conversion into cargo airplanes. Freight charges should not exceed $500 a ton, rather than the current $1,000 a ton, for a five-year transition period to support exports. As for sea transport, the problem is that all the existing companies belong to the public works sector. There is no significant competition from private companies that would allow the exporter to obtain better prices. Companies in the public works sector monopolize the market and impose their own prices, which are utterly out of line with their services and international market prices that are set by competition and by supply and demand--not to mention that there are no regular lines to Europe! As for the problem of land transportation, has no one found a solution for it? Egyptian exporters and products need coolers that come from Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon; yet we find that all the agencies in Egypt are fighting them! So the freight charge for a single cooler from Egypt to Saudi Arabia has risen from 5,000 riyals to 11,000 riyals, at a time when we are in need of a land transportation fleet. The importance of a land transportation fleet will become apparent when the internal Middle East market emerges. Everyone around us is preparing himself for the wrestling match. Do we have to remain spectators and wake up after the last round to regret that it is too late and that we have missed another opportunity? Fourth, fees and taxes! Exports are more important than the investment companies and new development schemes that are given a 10-year tax exemption. Export activity should be given a five-year exemption from fees or taxes of any kind, except the commercial profits tax. The latter is the right of the state and country: every citizen who realizes net profits at the end of the year must pay the treasury part of his profits for services and security. Exempting export activity from the remaining other fees and taxes will enable it to compete and enter new markets monopolized by countries that are professional at exporting. The government takes in no more than 30 million pounds a year from all these various fees and taxes. It is a paltry amount in the budget, but it affects the competitiveness of companies and causes them to waste time dealing with all these agencies--particularly the Tax Department! Fifth, the export register! The foundation is the exporter himself, with good preparation. There are 20,000 registers that have been recorded for exporters; yet only 1,000 exporters are active in exporting. The export profession in the past became the profession of those who had no profession. Retired senior state employees over 60 and many young people who dream of quick wealth imagine they have succeeded simply by obtaining an export register. Many of them, one discovers, have no experience in any market. One always finds some of them venturing to ship products without knowing the risk involved; and if one does not know the specifications of the market there, or if one has no information and facts about the customer, one will waste the expense of the deal and lose everything--and find oneself involved with courts and lawyers' offices. How many professional swindlers there are in the international markets! Their victims are usually from the Third World. Sixth, insurance! This is the role of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce in protecting exporters from themselves, first, and from professional nonpayers in foreign markets. The federation should find a solution with one of the specialized insurance companies. It could study drawing up a single policy for all exporters recognized by the association. Each exporter might pay 1 percent of the volume of his yearly business. The exporter would become more courageous and at the same time could devote himself to quality, packaging, and marketing. Seventh, financing! Where are the inexpensive sources of financing for export activity? As everyone knows, an exporter does not collect the price of a deal until one or two months after the shipping date. Where is the Exports Bank [Egyptian Export Development Bank] headed by Dr. Hazim al-Bablawi, who is an expert of recognized ability in the problems of exporters? Finally, we note that during the past seven years the value of exports of goods not traditionally exported has increased by 150 percent. This is a leap and an asset to be credited to official and government effort and to businessmen. But by the criteria of the challenge, we must achieve the target. The government, exporters, other official bodies, as well as Egyptian importers overseas must unite their efforts toward this goal, so that Egypt can flourish under a bold liberalization policy.
