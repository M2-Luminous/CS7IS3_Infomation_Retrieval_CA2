In the first nine months of last year, two-way trade amounted to RM [Malaysian ringgit] 6.5 billion. Although statistics for the whole of 1993 are still not available, last year's total trade between the two nations may well surpass the previous year's figures. In 1992, Malaysia's imports from Britain totalled RM4.14 billion. Its exports were RM2.55 billion. Malaysia buys electrical equipment, power generators and heavy industrial machinery from Britain. Malaysia on the other hand, sells primary commodities, machinery, telecommunication equipment, garments and apparel, accessories and sawn timber to Britain. Statistics show that bilateral trade between Britain and Malaysia has been particularly strong in the past four to five years reaching its peak in 1991 with total trade surpassing RM4.4 million. During the same period, British investments in Malaysia have also increased significantly to almost RM900 million in 1990 compared to RM750 million in 1989. Following stiff competition from other foreign investors, particularly Japanese, Taiwanese as well as American, British investors have taken a back seat -- resulting in a downtrend in investments since 1991. British investments in Malaysia dropped to below RM300 million in 1992. Nevertheless, Britain remained the largest European investor in Malaysia. The current trade figures between the two countries are indeed a far cry from the days when Malaysia launched the "Buy British Last" policy in October 1981. Although officials maintained that trade to and from Britain was not really affected during the period, there was only marginal increase in total trade. For instance, bilateral trade was barely above RM2 billion in 1981, 1982 and 1983. This was because the private sector continued to purchase British goods as they were priced competitively amidst the depreciating pound sterling. The "Buy British Last" policy was introduced following accumulative "irritants" that the country faced in its relations with Britain and British companies. The breaking point was when the British Government announced a substantial increase in student fees which severely affected more than 15,000 Malaysian students in Britain. Other factors which had triggered the policy included the failure of British companies to comply with the requirement of the National Economic Policy and the landing rights for Malaysia Airlines (MAS). The policy called for all British contracts to be vetted thoroughly by the Prime Minister's Department together with the second choice non-British bidder. Realising that the policy had caused British companies countless lucrative government contracts, the then British premier Margaret Thatcher personally intervened to patch things up.
