But he added that this was only what the investigators say most likely happened, and that there were several other versions. Kouts said the suspects had not been caught yet. Russian border guards say the shooters were two men who spoke Russian without foreign accent. The incident happened when a Russian patrol unit of three about 3.50 stopped two men some 300 meters from the border with Estonia. The men opened fire from their TT pistols and fled when a patrol car called from the Russian cordon approached the site. One member of the Russian patrol was killed and two were taken to a hospital with serious bullet wounds. Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in by the Foreign Ministry in Moscow the same day, where he received an appeal addressed to the Estonian law enforcement bodies to help find the criminals. Kahn said the Russian side had no doubts that the incident was of a criminal character. Kahn said he had been made clear that the Russian Foreign Ministry leadership did not regard the incident as a provocation.
