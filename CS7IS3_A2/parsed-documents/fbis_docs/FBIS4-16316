Shcherbal report from Sochi; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] It looks as though Dzhokhar Dudayev has decided to begin building ties with Russia by first making contacts with the regions. Recently he visited the Russian agricultural fair in Sochi and had an interview with your correspondent. [Shcherbal] Do you intend to broaden economic cooperation with Russia? [Dudayev] We never intended to break it up. [Shcherbal] I meant -- broadening it. [Dudayev] Of course, we intend to broaden it, and only with the CIS, with Russia. [sentence as heard] [Shcherbal] Are you planning to meet with President Yeltsin and discuss the prospects of establishing formal political relations between Russia and Chechnya? [Dudayev] We have never refused to do this, never. We were never against interaction, meetings, political decisions, cooperation. But the situation in Russia is very complicated at the moment. And it is getting even more difficult. President Yeltsin is being deprived from working on his own. In fact, Russia has no firm foreign or domestic policy. One does not know with whom one should negotiate. There are dozens of delegations, representations from all sorts of parties and factions, and everyone tries to grab a piece of the action. And this presents the main difficulty. [end recording]
