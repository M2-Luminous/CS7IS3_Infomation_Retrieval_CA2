The only thing of concern to citizens is whether the [exit tax] will lead to new shortages. Now that the election is over, stores are empty again. But what cannot be found in stores can be bought at open-air markets. The goods come from Turkey, Greece, and other neighboring countries. Not even soap can be obtained in Yugoslavia without smugglers. This is underlined by the case of gasoline. If it were not for smugglers, lines several kilometers long would form at gas stations, and rationing coupons would have to be introduced. A gasoline smuggler commented on the government decision to impose an exit tax on local Radio 202: "I smuggle gasoline from Hungary. I have a friend in Subotica, and after each border crossing I leave gasoline at his place. After a few days I transport it by truck to Belgrade to sell it at a price of two or three German marks [DM]. Now I will lose DM60 if I make six border crossings. For each transport I have to pay DM30, totaling DM180. That makes a daily cost of DM240. I will continue to smuggle since I am unemployed, but from now on, a liter of gasoline will cost from DM5 to DM6 in Belgrade." The same will be true for other smuggled goods. However, there will be only a few buyers able to pay the new, higher prices. Therefore, there will be fewer who support their families by smuggling. It seems that the Yugoslav Government has introduced the most efficient blockade of Yugoslavia. Once again, it will replenish its coffers and empty the pockets of its citizens at the same time.
