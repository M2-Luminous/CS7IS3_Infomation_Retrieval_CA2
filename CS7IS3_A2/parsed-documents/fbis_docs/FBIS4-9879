On this matter, the Cuban foreign minister told this station the following: [Begin Robaina recording] I think the main objective is not to submit a concrete proposal on how or with what to pay the foreign debt. Cuba does not have what is in fact needed to pay the debt as far as money is concerned, but we are surely willing to try to find a solution and to sit at a negotiating table to discuss all possibilities. We can establish what Cuba needs and the investment possibilities for Uruguay. Some Cuban products could be useful to Uruguay, so these products can contribute to solving this problem. The important thing is that a Cuban delegation headed by the Cuban Central Bank president will arrive here soon, and they have the decision-making power to choose the options to solve this debt problem. [end recording] The Cuban foreign minister met previously with Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle. They exchanged ideas on the forthcoming Ibero-American Summit to be held in Colombia, transformations in the economic area taking place in Cuba, and preparations for the emigre conference that will take place by the end of this month, among other subjects. Robaina's agenda, which is certainly tight, included a meeting with Liber Seregni, president of the Broad Front; an interesting meeting with the Uruguayan Congress foreign relations committee, at which the Cuban foreign minister explained the true situation in Cuba; a meeting with Cuban residents in Uruguay; and another meeting with Uruguayan intellectuals. According to a Cuban delegation spokesman, Tuesday's agenda contemplates the beginning of talks at the Foreign Ministry level, a meeting with his Uruguayan counterpart Sergio Abreu, contacts with several television networks from Montevideo and the most important national newspapers, like EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO.
