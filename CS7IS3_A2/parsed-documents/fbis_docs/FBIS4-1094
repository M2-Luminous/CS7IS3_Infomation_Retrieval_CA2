FBIS4-1094 "drafr078_e_94003" FBIS-AFR-94-078 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Dissension Reported in NPFL on Minister Appointments Dissension Reported in NPFL on Minister Appointments AB2104180494 Paris AFP in French 1212 GMT 21 Apr 94 AB2104180494 Paris AFP French BFN [Text] Monrovia, 21 Apr (AFP) -- Dissensions emerged today within the National Patriotic Front of Liberia [NPFL], the main armed faction, a day after the announcement of an agreement between the different factions on the formation of the future transitional government. Last night, four of the six NPFL representatives within the transitional government were given "hearings" by the Transitional Legislative Assembly, before being officially commissioned by David Kpomakpor, the chairman of the Council of State (transitional collegiate presidency). The NPFL's mission "has been successfully accomplished," new Justice Minister Laveli Supuwood said, while his colleague, Labor Minister Tom Woewiyu, said that he was "ready to break down factional barriers and seek the interest and happiness of all Liberians." Interior Minister Samuel Dhokie, who is a top NPFL official, promised "to ensure national reconciliation and destroy the artificial division of the country." A fourth NPFL representative, Wehyee Dekyee, minister of lands, mines, and energy, attended the ceremony, which was boycotted by the two other NPFL members in the government, Information Minister Joe Mulbah and Agriculture Minister Roland Massaquoi. In addition, none of the 13 NPFL representatives in the Transitional Legislative Assembly attended the hearings of their "brothers-in-arms," an AFP correspondent observed. For NPFL leader Charles Taylor, quoted this morning by the Front's radio monitored in Monrovia, the NPFL officials who have taken office in the government "without a consensus on the issue within the movement have not shown solidarity." It is a "defection," as far as Taylor is concerned. Since last November, the NPFL representatives in the government have refused to take office until an agreement is reached on all the ministerial posts, particularly on the four remaining key portfolios: defense, finance, foreign affairs, and justice. Yesterday morning, the Council of State chairman announced that an agreement had been reached between the NPFL, the former interim government, and the United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia on three ministries, and that the fourth post -- that of foreign affairs -- will be appointed "soon" by the Council of State. A few hours later NPFL Information Minister Joe Mulbah had already begun expressing some reservations, pointing out before journalists that the Front's leadership had not been officially informed about these nominations and that, consequently, his boss Charles Taylor had not endorsed them. In a statement issued late this morning in Monrovia, the NPFL announced the holding of a congress this weekend in Gbarnga -- 160 km northeast of Monrovia. At the end of this congress, the NPFL "will be able to present serious and adequate proposals that will finally enable all the signatories to the Cotonou Accord to participate fully in the government," the communique said.
