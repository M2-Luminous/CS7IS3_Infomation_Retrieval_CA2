Various work undertaken by the autonomous region should be carried out in line with the principle of abiding by or serving the whole situation in the work of the entire party and of the country as a whole. Efforts should be made to deal earnestly and successfully with the relationship among reform, development, and stability; to maintain mutual harmony and promotion among reform, development, and stability; and to strive to win a new victory in socialist modernizations. Wang Qun said: The "government work report" given by Premier Li Peng has summarized in line with the principle of seeking truth from facts the important and major achievements scored by China over the past year in conducting reform, opening up, and modernizations and clearly defined the major tasks for conducting reform and construction this year. In view of the party's line, principles, policies, and measures, the government work report has fully reflected the spirit of the 14th CPC Congress and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and totally conformed with China's reality in socialist modernizations. I very much agree with the report. It is a good report of enhancing the national vigor and heartening the public feeling because it has revealed the heroic spirit of Chinese Nation in being not afraid of power. Wang Qun said: In his "government work report," Premier Li Peng said: "Tasks stressed by the CPC Central Committee with regard to seizing the opportunity, deepening the reform, broadening the opening up, promoting the development, and maintaining the stability represent the whole situation prevailing in the work of the entire party and the country as a whole." In achieving development and making progress, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should have the whole situation in mind; closely follow the situation; and abide by and serve the situation. The region's work in various fields, as well as cadres and people of various nationalities, should also abide by and serve the whole situation and so should various localities and departments throughout the region, which should turn the practice of abiding by and serving the whole situation into the conscious action of the broad masses of cadres and people. Wang Qun pointed out: To achieve development in the region in line with the whole situation, it is imperative to follow the content stressed by Premier Li Peng in his "government work report" with regard to dealing successfully and earnestly with the relationship among reform, development, and stability. Economic construction represents a center of work in various fields, as well as reform and opening up represent the motivating force of development. Development and reform represent a basis for maintaining social stability and having China enjoy long-term order and peace. Maintaining social stability represents an inevitable condition for developing the economy and smoothly conducting reform. If we fail to concentrate on further deepening the reform and broadening the opening up, the region's program of accelerating development will become empty talk. Without social stability there will be no development. Units from top to bottom across the region, as well as various industries and trades, should realistically and fruitfully do a good job in further conducting reform and broadening the opening up to enable the region's undertakings of four modernizations to achieve faster development and to promote the country's to become more prosperous. They must maintain the mutual harmony and promotion among reform, development, and stability and continuously score new achievements in socialist modernizations. Comrade Wang Qun stressed: In achieving development in the region, we should have new ideas. The paragraph of General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech quoted by Premier Li Peng in his "government work report" has an important and guiding significance on the region's work. New ideas for the region to achieve development are as follows: It is imperative to truly orient the region's work onto a track with a center of increasing economic results and not to follow the old way of blindly seeking output value and growth and broadening the scale of investments. It is necessary to proceed from the region's reality in doing everything and to truly orient the economic development onto a track of depending on scientific and technological progress and upgrading the quality of labor forces, particularly onto a track of readjusting the production structure and products' mix, improving products' quality, and increasing economic results. What is important is to seek progress in upgrading the managerial and technical standards and improving the quality. Only such progress can be essential. Wang Qun pointed out: We should further understand the region's strong and weak points under the conditions of the socialist market economy. Accelerating the establishment of socialist market economic systems will bring about an important opportunity for the region to accelerate its development. The region is endowed with vast territory and abundant resources and its population is small. In particular, the region's potential in agriculture, animal husbandry, township enterprises, and the industrial development of energy resources and raw materials, is very large and its prospect is vast. The state has put the supporting and promoting of economic development to minority regions into the program of macroeconomic readjustment and control and will give more supports in investment and policies to these regions. All of these are superior and favorable conditions for the region to develop its economy. Only by seizing opportunity, deepening the reform, broadening the opening up, and bringing the region's superiority into full play, are we able to achieve faster development. Wang Qun pointed out: In view of the autonomous region in developing the economy, it is particularly necessary to break away the out-dated concepts and fetters accumulated under the systems of planned economy and to foster the new concept and ideas of socialist market economy. Efforts should be made to foster the sense of information, markets, opening up, economic results, competition, and legal systems, which are suitable to the market economy. It is also necessary to conduct work in a creative way in understanding and grasping the objective laws of market economy, which include the law of value, supply and demand, and competition. Comrade Wang Qun said: In his "government work report", Premier Li Peng expounded in an overall way the great achievements scored by the country over the past year and accurately analyzed the country's contradictions, difficulties, and problems cropping up in the economic operation. However, these problems are predicted to crop up along the advancing road. In reading the government work report, we have felt that the determination of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to deepen the reform and to push forward the establishment of socialist market economic systems is unswerving. They have clearly pointed out difficulties and problems that will crop up along the advancing road and urged the entire party to pay great attention to them, to earnestly do a good job in dealing with various contradictions and problems in a timely manner, and to maintain the unity and stability to ensure the smooth progress in conducting reform and building socialism. Wang Qun stressed: In his "government work report" Premier Li Peng stressed that we should take a two-handed approach and be tough with both hands and uphold the principle of building the two civilizations simultaneously. Meanwhile, we should upgrade to an important position the work of enhancing the nationalities' unity and accelerating the development of minority regions. All of these have given great support to the border minority regions and fully indicated that the party and state are showing concern and supporting the development and mutual prosperity of border minority regions. Under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, we should further make efforts to wage struggle; safeguard the unification of the motherland and the great unity fostered by various nationalities; and build Inner Mongolia into a prosperous, civilized, rich, strong, and socialist border region.
