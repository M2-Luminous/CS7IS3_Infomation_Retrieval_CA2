Li noted that exchanges between China and Latin American countries have been increasing year by year in politics, economy, and culture and they have the common aspiration to develop cooperation. While recalling his last two visits to China, Fujimori said that his three visits to China have enhanced mutual understanding and promoted bilateral economic and trade relations.
