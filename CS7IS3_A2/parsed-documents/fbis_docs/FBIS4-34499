Earlier, an official communique had announced that "from now on, the national flag will remain at the top of the flagpole until further notice, and it will be saluted every morning. The daily ceremony of lowering the flag has been abolished." The purpose of this measure is to strengthen the "flag's symbolism" to contribute to the safeguarding of "national independence." Bernard Sansaricq, president of one of the Senate's opposition blocs (not acknowledged by the international community), and Army Chief General Raoul Cedras, along with the Haitian military high command, were at Jonassaint's side.
