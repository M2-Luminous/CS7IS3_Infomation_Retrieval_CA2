FR940719-1-00085 FR940719-1-00015 Request for Data MSHA requests specific information and data concerning any of the assumptions and estimates made in its PRIA. In particular, MSHA requests information on four proposed provisions. First, with respect to §75.312, ``Main mine fan examinations and records,'' MSHA requests data concerning any potential cost impacts to the mining industry that may occur as a result of using an alternative test that does not require stopping the fan. Second, with respect to §75.321, ``Air quality,'' MSHA requests data on the number of mines that would encounter an air quality problem (either at an evaluation point or going to and from an evaluation point), the current air quality level at these mines, the types of actions needed for compliance, and the expected incremental costs of these actions. Third, with respect to §75.362, ``On-shift examination,'' MSHA requests data on alternative compliance measures that deep cut mining operations, in particular, would be able to use to conduct methane tests at the face. Fourth, with respect to §75.380, MSHA requests information on the cost of compliance associated with prohibiting certain equipment in the primary escapeway, and costs related to alternative compliance measures. VI. Metric Measurements The proposed rule has been prepared using the inch-pound system of measurement (English system) instead of the SI (metric) system. However, the Agency remains committed to accomplishing an orderly transition to the SI system. The following table is intended to aid in the conversion to metric units. ␣ 1Quantity 1From 1To 1Multiply by Length Inches Centimeters 2.54 ␣ Feet Meters 0.304 Area Square feet Square meters 0.093 Velocity Feet/minute Meters/second 0.005 Pressure Lbs/sq.in Kilopascals 6.895 ␣ Lbs/sq.ft Kilopascals 0.049 Air quantity Cu.ft./min Cu.meters/sec 0.00047 Power Horsepower Kilowatts 0.746 Temperature Degrees F Degrees C T C =(T F &hyph;32)/1.8 List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 75 Escapeways, Mine safety and health, Underground coal mines, Ventilation. Dated: May 12, 1994. J. Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health. It is proposed to amend part 75, subchapter O, chapter I of title 30 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 75_MANDATORY SAFETY STANDARDS_UNDERGROUND COAL MINES 1. The authority citation for part 75 continues to read as follows: Authority: 30 U.S.C. 811, 957, and 961. 2. Section 75.301 is amended by revising the definition of ``Return Air'' to read as follows:
