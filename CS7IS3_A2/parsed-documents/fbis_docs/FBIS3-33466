This wave of emigration, unlike the one in the 1980's, is due neither to political nor ideological factors. Its causes are entirely socio-economic. Some 150,000 Nicaraguans have emigrated to our next-door neighbor, whether legally or by sidestepping border posts, solely because despair "abounds" and jobs "are scarce" here. "Why should we come back?" Nicaraguans ask. The backdrop to this question is significant. It unquestionably suggests that they see neither a present nor a future in our country. As far as they are concerned, there are not even remote prospects for improvement. This in itself ought to prompt in-depth reflection by the government and multilateral financial organizations, inasmuch as it confirms that economic policy over the past three years has been on the wrong track. In addition, this emigration shows that political and armed confrontation is doing irreparable harm to the country and, therefore, that a national understanding leading to a period of peace and stability is urgently needed. All political forces and all segments of society bear some degree of responsibility in this regard. Nicaraguan and Costa Rican authorities met last week in Costa Rica to hammer out a joint migration policy that would put an end to the wave of deportees and "rejects." The effort is a praiseworthy one, inasmuch as abuses are being committed. It still remains to formalize this joint policy, however. The Nicaraguan Government has requested an "immigration" amnesty for the thousands of our citizens who remain in hiding in Costa Rica, but the authorities there do not "look favorably" on the request, particularly because Costa Rica is in the home stretch of a general-election campaign. Emigration is an issue with major human implications, and therefore both Nicaraguan and Costa Rican society urgently need to develop an awareness of it. Otherwise, it would be neither unusual nor unlikely for xenophobia to begin emerging in Costa Rica against Nicaraguans. That would be a serious and dangerous development for our brothers.
