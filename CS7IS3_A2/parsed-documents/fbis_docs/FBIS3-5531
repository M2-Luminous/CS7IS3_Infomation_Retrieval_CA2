Let us, however, see its revival as an aspect of the realities of the post- Cold War era without overreacting to it. President Clinton signed his executive order to revive the Super 301 Provision in line with his long-advocated policy. We use the term his long-advocated policy because the President already made it clear that he would revive the provision if elected in a campaign pledge titled "the Highest Priority to the People," announced jointly by himself and Vice President Gore (candidate at the time) as presidential and vice presidential candidates running on the Democratic Party's ticket during the 1992 presidential campaign. The President has chosen the most effective timing for revival of the provision in a bid to make it clear that the revival of the provision targets Japan, among other nations. The most internationally notorious provision allows the United States to identify "unfair nations" in trade with the United States, negotiate with those unfair nations to remove their trade barriers and open their markets to U.S. goods, and raise large tariffs and impose sanctions against those nations in case they refuse to make concessions. There is no guarantee that the United States will not identify unfair trading nations arbitrarily. There is doubt that the revival of the provision constitutes a violation of GATT rules which call for holding multilateral negotiations to settle trade disputes. Japan has guarded, reacted, and toughened its stand against the step the United States has recently taken, and we think Japan has probably made reasonable responses. We want to indicate two points. Among other things, Japan's excessively emotional reaction to the U.S. decision to revive the prevision will never be a plus not only for Japan itself, but for overall Japan-U.S. relations. It can be said that the U.S. posture to hold negotiations with Japan with a hint at the possibility of slapping sanctions on Japan is aimed at bullying Japan to accept what it demands. The U.S. posture may incur displeasure in Japan. There is a kind of sense of a game in recent U.S. moves to use the revival of the provision as a "tool to crack open Japan's closed market." If Japan sticks to a single way of confronting the revival of the provision, it may increase differences and tensions between the two countries. Japan needs to look at the situation with a broad sense of a game. Another point we want to indicate is that this time, Japan must realize anew the significance and depth of the changes taking place in the United States during the post-Cold War age. The Clinton administration is pouring the same strong energy into "revitalizing the U.S. economy" as successive U.S. administrations did into their policies toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. Promoting trade and stepping up pressure for market opening is an extension of this energy. Although it is true that there are a lot of problems with the specific methodology of dealing with the pressure, it appears that Japan is still optimistic about the way the United States will expend this energy. We believe this makes Japan's actions inarticulate and restricted.
