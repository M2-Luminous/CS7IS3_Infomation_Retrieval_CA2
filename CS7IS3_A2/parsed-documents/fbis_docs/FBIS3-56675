The faction has made this decision because on 13 January Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, used his speech from the podium to insult and directly threaten deputies. The Russia's Choice amendment also states that if a deputy banned from participating in the chamber's sittings does not obey the decision, the chairman will be able to summon help from the security services.
