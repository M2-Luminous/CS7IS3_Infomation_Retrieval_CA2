ROK President Kim Yong-sam called an emergency cabinet meeting and declared that the ROK's 600,000-strong armed forces were on war alert. Immediately responding to the ROK's request, the United States started deploying Patriot missiles in the ROK and preparing for the resumption of U.S.-ROK joint military exercises. U.S. Defense Secretary Perry said that the United States had delivered 160 Patriot missiles to the ROK, and if the United Nations adopted a resolution of sanctions against the DPRK, the United States would deliver more armed forces and weapons to the ROK. The escalation of the military situation is mainly due to man- made factors. Over the past year, the Korean situation alternated between tense and relaxed situations. Last March, the DPRK abruptly announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to oppose the "Team Spirit 93" joint military exercise held between U.S. and ROK armed forces, thus causing concern among the international community. The DPRK also carried out frequent air defense maneuvers and proclaimed blackouts. As a consequence, both the ROK and the DPRK were almost on war alert. Later, the United States took the initiative to negotiate with the DPRK about the differences on the issue of de-nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. The dialogue bore fruit. Last February, the DPRK reached agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and the United States separately, agreeing to allow personnel dispatched by the IAEA to "carry out inspections which intend to guarantee continuous nuclear safety." Meanwhile, the DPRK and the ROK held talks at Panmunjom from 3 to 16 March to discuss the issue of reciprocal envoy visits. Originally, the atmosphere of the Korean peninsula can be gradually improved through dialogue. In early March, the IAEA dispatched a six-member nuclear inspection team to the DPRK for investigation. They inspected seven nuclear facilities, but after returning to Geneva, they complained that the DPRK obstructed them from taking away a sample from a chemical research institution. As proved by the development of events, the fact that the Security Council urged the DPRK to let the IAEA "complete all the necessary inspection work" implied that the DPRK had opened its seven nuclear facilities, but the remaining problem was the DPRK was not cooperative enough in obstructing the inspection team from taking away a sample. The DPRK defended itself against the censure, pointing out that the IAEA had inspected and put a seal on the facility as well as installed monitoring instruments there, but the inspection team contradicted themselves and it was unreasonable for them to insist on tearing off the seal and taking away a sample again. It seems that we cannot describe the DPRK as uncooperative but we can only say that the DPRK objected to tearing off the seal for reexamination. Originally, such differences could be settled through talks. However, when the northern and southern sides of Korea discussed the matter at Panmunjom, they traded vicious remarks against each other, including those concerning the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise. Hence, the situation took a sudden turn and the issue of U.S.-ROK military exercise escalated to U.S. deployment of more weapons and more troops in the ROK. The United States has openly asserted that the DPRK must yield to U.S. pressure to accept nuclear inspection, otherwise the Security Council will impose sanctions on it. However, the international community does not consent to using the Security Council's sanctions to settle the problem. The main reason is that since the DPRK does not trade with most countries, measures taken by the Security Council to isolate the DPRK will not affect the latter very much, but will rather make things worse. East Asian countries always seek stability to facilitate the peaceful construction of Asia. The United States can look on indifferently after making a mess of the situation. However, if a war breaks out in the Korean peninsula, refugees will flee hither and thither, and Japan, the ROK, China, and Russia will bear the brunt of it. The Korean Peninsula issue never endangers the security of Western European countries. If someone in the Security Council proposes troop deployment, Western European countries will not be ready to share the military expenditure, whereas Japan will not be eager to worsen the situation. At that time, the United States will become more isolated. Russia has called for an international meeting attended by various sides related to the situation of the Korean peninsula, including Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the ROK, and the DPRK, to settle the problem. Russia maintained that sanctions should not be made a first priority but rather political and diplomatic means should be used. Under the influence of moderates at home, the ROK's foreign minister also said that it was a "bad idea" to impose sanctions on the DPRK and that the problem could only be settled with China's assistance. Former U.S. President Bush also gave his advice to the Clinton Administration: "At present, the most important thing is to preserve the U.S. leading position in the world rather than to deal with the trade imbalance. If we are worried about the Korean peninsula issue and Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons, we need China's help." Various countries in the world do not agree with the U.S. suggestion of taking punitive military actions against the DPRK because Pyongyang is passively on the defensive and has never sent troops to attack the south, whereas the United States has exhibited its strength menacingly, and the ROK Radio even declared that "Seoul and Washington have drawn up a plan to overthrow the DPRK Government." Therefore, various countries are not willing to add fuel to the flames and worsen the situation, whereas the ROK hopes that China can exert its influence on the DPRK so that the latter will take more flexible measures. Clinton probably knew that it would be quite infeasible to take a hard line on this matter, so he played the China card, extending his "thanks to China for striving to stop the DPRK's development of nuclear weapons." However, China has made its stand very clearly known. China reasserts that the problem should be settled through dialogue and that, as proven by past facts, exerting pressure on a country by imposing sanctions on it can only lead to a tense situation, whereas only dialogue can make a breakthrough. In implementing its Asia policy, the United States should respect the aspiration of Asian countries in seeking peace and stability and make it a basis for consultation and cooperation with Asia. The problem cannot be settled by isolating the DPRK. Only when we win over the DPRK and help it return to the international community, can a more constructive situation emerge.
