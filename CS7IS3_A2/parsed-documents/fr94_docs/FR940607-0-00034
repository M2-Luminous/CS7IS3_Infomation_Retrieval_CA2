FR940607-0-00034 FR940607-0-00015 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 270 [FRL&hyph;4892&hyph;3] Extension of Date for Submission of Part A Permit Applications for Facilities Managing Ash From Waste-to-Energy Facilities AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of extension of permit application deadline. SUMMARY: In City of Chicago v. Environmental Defense Fund, Inc., No. 92&hyph;1639 ( XX U.S. XX , decided May 2, 1994), the Supreme Court held that ash generated by certain municipal waste-to-energy facilities that burn household wastes alone or in combination with nonhazardous wastes from industrial and commercial sources is not exempt from regulation as a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). When the decision takes effect, persons who generate such ash will need to determine whether it is a hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. Ash that is hazardous will need to be managed in compliance with all applicable hazardous waste regulations. In response to the Court's decision, EPA is today announcing that there has been substantial confusion as to when the owners and operators of facilities managing such ash were required to file applications for RCRA hazardous waste permits. EPA is exercising its authority under 40 CFR 270.10(e)(2) to extend the deadline for filing permit applications. EPA also is announcing today that it considers ash from these combustion facilities to be a newly identified waste for purposes of the land disposal restrictions under sections 3004(d)-(m) of RCRA. Current land disposal restrictions do not apply. Rather, the Agency has a duty to promulgate ash-specific restrictions 6 months from the date of today's document. All other hazardous waste regulations will apply to hazardous ash when the decision takes effect. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 7, 1994.
