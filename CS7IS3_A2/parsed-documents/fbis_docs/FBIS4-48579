But according to PAC chief negotiator, Gora Ibrahim, the interim constitution will have to be amended by parliament since it only entitles parties that gained a minimum of five percent of the votes to have a cabinet position. Ibrahim told NEW NATION of how PAC sees its future role in parliament and how it plans to work within the system. On president Nelson Mandela's overtures to try to give recognition to the role liberation movements had played, Ibrahim said he did not know how Mandela planned to do that. Ibrahim, however, said negotiations were continuing with Mandela on the type of role and positions that the PAC could be expected to hope for in government. "We appreciate the president's gesture to accommodate the PAC in the cabinet," he said. "But I do not know of any position that had been left for us." It has been suggested that the president was trying to provide the PAC with an important post in the government besides a cabinet position. It has also been mooted that Mandela might even give the organisation one of the positions that belong to the ANC. "While the PAC appreciates the gestures made by Mandela there are constitutional issues that have to be resolved," said Ibrahim. "Our participation in the cabinet would be illegal if the constitution was not amended," he said. Ibrahim said his organisation cannot force changes to the constitution since its voice had been weakened by the percentage votes it received from the electorate. He said the PAC's role in parliament would be guided by concern for the aspirations of the people such as land, housing, employment, education and health. "We will not oppose everything that comes before parliament," Ibrahim said. "We will not oppose measures that will improve the lot of the majority." On the future of the Azanian People's Liberation Army (APLA), he said APLA commanders were negotiating about the future of the force but could not spell out when and where they would assembly them for integration into the South African National Defence Force (SANDF). He also could not say how many of APLA cadres would be involved. Ibrahim said he hoped that APLA's participation would not be prejudiced by the percentage of votes the organisation had achieved in the elections "since a new army should not represent the wishes of political parties but the interests of the nation". "Integration should be determined on merit and qualifications," he said. "I think APLA would be able to meet all those." Before the elections, PAC supported wildcat strikes by civil servants in the former homelands but Ibrahim admitted to NEW NATION that the strikes were "premature". "They (North-West provincial parliament) have been there for less than a week," he said, "but their grievances will have to be addressed sometime." But Ibrahim predicted that the ANC government would be faced with immense problems trying to control strikes arising from expectations raised during the election campaigns. He cited housing as an example. "There is no way that enough housing can be provided in the foreseeable future -- for more than eight-million people living in shacks and squalid areas," he said.
