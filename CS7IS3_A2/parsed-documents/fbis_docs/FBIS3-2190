Delivering the 1994-95 budget in the Legislative Council this afternoon, the financial secretary said inflation rate in 1994 will also keep to an average of around 8.5 percent in 1994, the same as it was in 1993. The financial secretary said GDP per head in Hong Kong in 1993 reached 18,500 U.S. dollars in 1993 and is expected to reach 20,600 U.S. dollars in 1994. Expressing confidence about the prospects for 1994, Sir Hamish said Hong Kong can look forward to better economic prospects in its major overseas markets, and to continued the high growth in the region. "Above all, we have a vital role to play in China's economic modernization," he said. "Increasingly, the key to our future economic success will lie in our ability to sell our services to the world, to the region, and above all to the Chinese economy," he said. The financial secretary said that the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the improved prospects in major overseas markets will also help boost trade potentials. Speaking of problems in Hong Kong's economic development, the financial secretary said, "inflation remains a difficult challenge." "Property prices are rising to increasingly uncomfortable levels because of acute shortage of land combined with growing prosperity and the understandable ambition of families to own their own homes," he said. The financial secretary proposed a number of income tax concessions which would enable about 420,000 taxpayers, or a quarter of the total, to drop out of the tax net entirely.
