U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in Israel yesterday afternoon after a series of talks with President al-Asad and Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' in Damascus, met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin at his Jerusalem residence late last night. The meeting, which was attended by Dennis Ross and Professor Itamar Rabinovich, lasted about an hour and a half. After the meeting, Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said: "The negotiations held in Damascus should be viewed as a few more small steps at the start of a long trek. Further declarations were made and answers given in the course of Christopher's talks. The talks should be viewed in terms of protracted negotiations. Not every declaration or answer immediately creates a new reality." Nevertheless, last night both American and Israeli sources were under the impression that practical Israeli-Syrian negotiations have been launched and that while the gaps between the parties' stands are very profound, Christopher sensed that the Syrian stand has shifted. Last night, Christopher presented Rabin with detailed Syrian answers to the clarifications Israel had requested concerning the arrangement proposed by Syria. [passage omitted] [Reporting on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0405 GMT on 17 May, political correspondent Shlomo Raz states that "Jerusalem primarily took note of the Syrian media reports, which are also being interpreted as an attempt to improve the atmosphere and not as actual progress in the negotiations. These include the TISHRIN report about withdrawal within a reasonable period and the AL-HAYAH report outlining five points of the Israeli-Syrian peace arrangement." Raz cites "a senior political source" as saying that the AL-HAYAH report "is inaccurate, because that is not what Warren Christopher brought back from Damascus, although it indicates a desire to improve the atmosphere." [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 17 May, in a report by political correspondent Aluf Ben on page A1, cites "a senior political element" as saying "last night" that "the Syrian replies addressed every component of the Israeli peace proposal: withdrawal, security arrangements, the substance of peace, the time factor, and the linkage between withdrawal and normalization. According to him, the answers were `low key'."]
