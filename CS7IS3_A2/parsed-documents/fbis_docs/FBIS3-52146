He added: We have asked for the British ambassador's departure in an attempt to improve relations between the two countries. It is for Britain to nominate another person from its embassy to be acting ambassador. He stressed that the matter was legitimate and does occur in diplomatic relations. He pointed out that the British Government's demand that the Sudanese Government should reconsider its decision is a matter which is not legitimate in these relations. He also made reference to the visit of the Archbishop of Canterbury to Sudan. He said that he considered the archbishop as a VIP and he ought to have entered Sudan through the capital, Khartoum, but regrettably he went to see the rebels and visited the citizens who were under the control of the rebels.
