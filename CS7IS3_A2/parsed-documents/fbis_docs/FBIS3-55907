Latvian Officials Call the Incident `a Provocation'"] [Text] On 10 January, General Nikolay Taylakov, deputy commander-in-chief of the Russian Army's Northwestern Group of Forces, and General Anatoliy Vodopyanov were arrested and deported to Russia at the directive of Andrey Ruchs, chairman of Riga's suburb of Vidzem. The arrest followed the Latvian territorial defense troops' seizure of a military depot and another official building held by Russian troops. Meanwhile, local authorities said that the generals were arrested for fear that they might attempt to mount armed security guard details at the facilities that were to be handed over to Latvia. Ilgonis Upmanis, chief of the Latvian Government's bureau on the withdrawal of Russian troops, told BALTFAX that both generals returned to Riga and that the republican prosecutor's office filed a criminal lawsuit regarding the incident. Mr. Ruchs, meanwhile, conceded that he had overstepped his powers. Martins Virsis, chief of the Latvian delegation in talks with Russia, has called the incident "a deliberate provocation," planned for a day when talks between Russia and Latvia were to resume in Riga. His Russian counterpart, Sergey Zotov, said that the beginning of the next round of the talks was out of the question "until light is shed on this incident." Given the situation, Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev ordered that units of the Pskov Airborne Division be put on full alert.
