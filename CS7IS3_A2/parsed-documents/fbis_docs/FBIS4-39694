He said that the contract costing 550 million dollars will ensure employment for 100,000 people on Russian industrial military enterprises over the next two years. There will also be more jobs at enterprises producing spare parts for military jets until the contract expires. Soskovets emphasized that other ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) countries had also showed interest in Russian military equipment. Soskovets stressed that the contract with Malaysia was even more important since in 1994 the Russian Air Forces had ordered only 17 military jets from the military industrial enterprises. Speaking on the contacts with Russian diplomats in Kuala Lumpur and Delhi where the Russian governmental delegation had stopped on its way from Malaysia, Soskovets regretted that Russian diplomats hardly knew the realities of life in Russia or bilateral economic relations and just kept complaining about the conditions of living and working in the country where they were sent. Soskovets announced that he had asked Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov to make a report on the performance of the Russian embassies in India and Malaysia.
