Elliasson, who supported a peaceful solution on the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, took over the term chairmanship from Italy. Eliasson, before meeting with Cetin, said he came to Turkey to exchange opinions with the concerned sides adding he will later go to the region and meet with other sides. He said defending the international community's and CSCE's principles were very important and added that the Nagorno-Karabakh problem should be solved in political ways. Foreign Minister Cetin said most of the Azeri territory were under Armenian occupation. `It is very diffucult to hold a peace conference before this occupying attitude ends,' he added. Cetin said Nagorno-Karabakh was Azeri territory and with the CSCE resolutions this was once again confirmed. Recalling that Turkey wanted Armenians to withdraw from the Azeri territory soon the foreign minister said Turkey was ready to do its best on the issue. Eliasson will leave for Baku, where he will hold a series of contacts with Azeri officials. Turkey and Russia are active partners in the nine-nation Minsk Group that is working to arrange an Armenian withdrawal before an international conference can convene on the future of the enclave.
