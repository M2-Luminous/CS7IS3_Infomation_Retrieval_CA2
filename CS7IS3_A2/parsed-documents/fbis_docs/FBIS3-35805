What is your feeling? [Zhirinovskiy] The people of the world simply do not know how to deal with this new party, the strongest in Russia. The people do not have any experience. [KURIER] You want to become Russian president. What would you do differently? [Zhirinovskiy] I would stop the help for foreign countries and turn to internal problems, for example, the high crime rate and the reestablishment of the military and military industry. [KURIER] You are constantly quoted as making contradictory statements. First you do not want borders to be changed in Europe, then you want to reestablish the Soviet Union. What is valid? [Zhirinovskiy] I meant that the republics of the former Soviet Union will voluntarily become Russian territory. [KURIER] You want to return South Tirol to Austria -- this would probably not be possible "voluntarily." [Zhirinovskiy] I talked about what would happen in Europe if Russia were divided. There are many problematic regions in the world, among them are South Tirol, Trieste... [KURIER] The public prosecutor's office in Moscow is conducting investigations regarding you because of warmongering. [Zhirinovskiy] This is a mistake of the political forces that are my opponents. They use every opportunity to harm me. [KURIER] According to your party program, Europe belongs to the Russian sphere of influence. [Zhirinovskiy] It would be best if all former East Bloc states remained neutral. NATO is a military bloc. If a country accedes to this bloc, this will not contribute to the establishment of peace. NATO will use these countries as small partners that are to serve the big members. [KURIER] You are often compared with Hitler. Are there parallels? [Zhirinovskiy] There is no reason for these comparisons. Then Pinochet and Mao Zedong would also have to be called Hitler. There is a Hitler in every country. [KURIER] IZVESTIYA wrote that it is easier for you to seduce a nation than a woman. [Zhirinovskiy] I never had the problem of being obliged to seduce a woman. As far as the nation is concerned -- I am working on it.
