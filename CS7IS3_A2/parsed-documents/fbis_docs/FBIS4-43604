[Begin Tomaras recording] The beginning of a close cooperation between Greek and Israeli authorities, especially on the issue of combating terrorism, was marked by the visit of Public Order Minister Papathemelis to Israel at the beginning of this week. During a news conference held today, Papathemelis announced that this cooperation will begin at the EU Summit in Corfu, where a team of Israeli specialists will install special equipment as part of the security measures. The equipment will include cameras that take pictures at night and from a great distance. The team of Israelis will arrive in our country next week and will train Greek officials in the use of that equipment, which afterwards will remain with the Greek police. The public order minister said he was impressed with the modern technical means that the Israelis have and which he did not even see in the United States. The public order minister also let be known that the Israelis have information on terrorism, mainly due to the perfect organization of their police, and hopes that the signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement will result in the transfer of that information to the Greek authorities. The cooperation among the authorities of the two countries will be extended to combating drugs and illegal immigration and the exchange of information, mainly the supply of high technology equipment necessary for the modernization of the Greek police. Asked whether he discussed the issue noted in a recent report by Italian newspaper CORRIERE DELLA SERA regarding the gathering of terrorists in Iran, Papathemelis replied: I raised the issue with persistence but the Israelis were not willing to tell me. In another question on whether the Israelis have any information about terrorism in Greece, the public order minister said that only time will tell. However, he stressed that the Israeli authorities have the capability to get such information from sources to which we have no access. Finally, on his visit to Israeli, the public order minister said that it was considered a step that supports the peace efforts in the area and that Israel looks forward to the role of Greece and Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou in that peace.
