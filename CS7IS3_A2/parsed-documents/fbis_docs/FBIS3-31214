Prokes said that the SNS fully agreed with the view of its coalition partner, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), that the elections should be called as early as possible. He said that the vote of no confidence in Deputy Premier Roman Kovac and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik by the HZDS Board on Saturday [12 February] was a natural result of the developments within the HZDS. Roman Kovac and Moravcik [are] the initiators of a new faction within the HZDS aimed at creating a broad coalition government. Prokes said that the SNS and the HZDS had not yet discussed possible successors to Kovac and Moravcik if they are dismissed. It is premature to evaluate the question of whether the post of foreign minister will be offered to himself, Prokes stated. Reacting to the proposals made by the newly established HZDS faction, the Alternative of Political Realism, Prokes said that the country had already experienced a National Front in the communist period. If such steps are taken now, it would be the end of pluralism, he added. Prokes assured that the eight-member SNS group of deputies would support the amendment to the large privatization law, which is to be the first point on the agenda of the next meeting within the current parliamentary session, scheduled for Wednesday [16 February].
