This is being done in line with a decision by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat. Palestinian sources reported that 'Arafat instructed Sultan Abu-al-'Aynayn, the camps' military commander, via a message delivered to him by a leading Lebanese personality, to collect all personal and other weapons from the camps immediately, ahead of their transfer to Gaza and Jericho by official Egyptian authorities. Abu-al-'Aynayn reportedly received a telephone call from Lieutenant Colonel Nasr Yusuf in Tunis asking him to implement 'Arafat's decision immediately. Lt. Col. Yusuf is the official who will command the Palestinian police force in Gaza and Jericho. The Palestinian source said some of the weapons have already been gathered and their number and type recorded, whether they are from military men or civilians. These sources noted that Lieutenant Colonel Munir al-Maqdah, the Fatah Forces commander in the 'Ayn al-Hulwah Camp in south Lebanon and a man who opposes Yasir 'Arafat, has declared his refusal to allow weapons to be gathered from his forces inside the camp. He said in a statement today: Our rifles will remain under the control of the Syrian and Lebanese Army. Lebanese political circles noted that Palestinian contacts took place during the past few weeks. The objective of these contacts was to coordinate on gathering weapons from the Palestinian camps in Lebanon in preparation for sending them to the Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho. The circles also said that last Monday's storming by the Lebanese Army of numerous arms caches belonging to a Palestinian faction in the district of Sharhabil, east of Sidon, in south Lebanon and the seizure of large amounts of weapons, missiles, and hand grenades fall within the framework of a plan set out by Lebanese and Palestinian officials. The Lebanese circles expressed their belief that the prevailing trend now is to empty all the Palestinian camps of weapons as planned. Diplomatic sources in Lebanon reported that interest is increasing among Lebanese officials regarding the conditions of the Palestinians in Lebanon, in particular after signs emerged that conditions inside the camps are worrying in light of developments in the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. During its meeting last night, the Lebanese Council of Ministers refused to approve the request submitted by the 10 Palestinian factions in Lebanon to hold a political rally organized together with Hizballah and the national resistance in Lebanon.
