For confirmation, as is appropriate in such a case, we sought information from a medical source. We asked the director of Niamey National Hospital for the facts: [Begin unidentified doctor recording] What I can tell you is that we effectively admitted a student who was in a coma resulting from a head injury. He died around 0500 this morning. [end recording] So one dead and three wounded. That is the result of the violent clashes that took place between students and police forces. At the origin of the incidents was the demand by students for the payment of six months of scholarship arrears. This morning, our reporter Sadou Moussi held a telephone conversation with Issa Boubacar, secretary general of the Niger Students Union: [Begin Boubacar recording] Yesterday evening, while Niamey University students were exercising a constitutional right, namely the right to demonstrate to demand the payment of their scholarship arrears, the ruling power sent antiriot police forces to crush the demonstration. Their savage repression resulted in the death of one of our comrades, Tahirou Harouna, a first year student at the Philosophy Department. Several others were wounded. The incidents took place yesterday around 1700. [passage omitted] [end recording] Our reporter Boureima Noumou Maiga also asked Niamey Prefect Souleimana Barry for his side of the story: [Begin Barry recording] We were informed yesterday morning that students were blocking the bridge with burning tires. We know what happened last time when they burned private cars and people were wounded. The demonstration was not very big so we tried to contain the situation and to open the bridge to traffic to enable people living near the bridge to go about their normal business. It did not take long for things to be brought under control. The bridge was open to traffic and I believe the students returned to campus. As there were sporadic clashes on campus, the police remained there. They withdrew at around 2000. We were informed that one student was injured and that three policemen were also wounded. What is surprising in all this is that there were no fistfights between the police and the students, according to what the police told us. In regard to the wounds the student died of, we are still awaiting the results of the autopsy and the ongoing investigation. If there were no fistfights, one wonders how a person could have been killed. [end recording]
