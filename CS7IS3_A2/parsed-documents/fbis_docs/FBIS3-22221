Is this a reaction of an ostrich who -- at the sight of danger -- hides his head in the sand? It is very difficult to meet a person who understands that protection of the environment is a much more important task than economic reforms and political scandals. However, fortunately, there are such people among us. They are ecologists. They are professional amateurs, enthusiasts and skeptics, gloomy pessimists and decisive romantics.... If mankind survives, this will only occur through their efforts. Our guest today is an ecologist, if it is possible to say so, he is No. 1 in Belarus. He is reserved, he hates loud phrases and effective gestures. Nevertheless, when my colleagues-deputies voted down one of the ecological issues, he said ``Shame on you!'' and left the session hall. I recalled this event. He impatiently waved his hand. ``At my age, it was just okay.'' However, I have my own opinion on this issue. Professor, author of more than 300 research publications, Baris Parfenavich Savitski heads a Supreme Soviet commission for ecology and the rational use of natural resources, and demonstrates the professionalism and wisdom of a competent politician. Babina: Baris Parfenavich, you have been working in the legislature for more than three years. What are the results of your work? With what feelings do you view those three years? Savitski: First of all, I have to say that the work in the commission takes all my time, and I am completely devoid of time for the fulfillment of my deputy duties. Therefore, my technical secretary fulfills that part of my work. I am concerned with this. However, I am satisfied with the results of the work of my commission. We faced the task of creating a group of ecological laws that would consider the new status of the Republic, its sovereignty, and emerging market relations in Belarus. Our first draft law had to reorganize the entire structure of the system of environmental protection in the Republic, to establish a powerful centralized system of control, and to do away with numerous organizations that duplicate each other's activities. Many deputies thought that this draft law was too advanced and voted it down. However, some elements of this law are being implemented in other laws and legal norms. We have begun to develop the so-called code of ecological laws. These laws include a number of ecological issues -- the protection of the environment in general, the protection of water, land, animals, and plants, etc., and the mechanism for their implementation. However, it is simply impossible to adopt all these laws at one Supreme Soviet session. Therefore, we proposed discussing the most important ``Law on Environmental Protection.'' The Law ``On State Ecological Examination'' is currently included in the state planning system and implemented in the decisions on the socioeconomic development of Belarus. The implementation of various draft projects that did not receive a positive assessment of ecological experts will not be financed by the state. This is the most effective economic lever. I feel proud that no other state has the same precise concept of ecological examination. In my opinion, experts from the World Bank for Reconstruction and Development and my colleagues-deputies from other states -- with whom we usually cooperate on these issues -- agree that this law is a great achievement for our legislature. The Law ``On Industrial and Consumer Waste'' has been recently published in the press. Implementation of this law will considerably decrease the negative impact of waste on the environment and make entrepreneurs use this waste in industrial production. Economic measures will also help to implement this task. Our Republic is literally flooded with proposals to build enterprises for storage and processing of radioactive or chemical waste. Considering that Western businessmen are ready to propose enormous bribes, some of our officials are ready to permit the construction of such production sites on our territories that are already contaminated with radionuclides. Well, the new law categorically bans transporting all kinds of waste to Belarus, excluding the waste which can be processed at the already existing Belarusian production sites, however, after a strict ecological examination. This law also limits transporting waste through our territory because it can cause terrible consequences. Do you remember how the waste with radionuclides poured out of containers at Brest railway station? These three laws have been recently adopted by our legislature. I can say that if my name is put under only these three laws, I will claim that my life was worth living. Hence, our commission is doing well. However, if all 14 members of our commission were professional lawmakers, our results could have been more fruitful. The issue of a professional legislature arises, however, this is an issue for another interview. Babina: You often go abroad. Can you compare our ecological legislation with that of foreign states? Savitski: The financial situation of our state is in a miserable state, that is why I cannot go to the states I would like to visit, but to the states where I am invited.... Therefore, it is difficult to speak about all the states. I am sure that if not for Chernobyl, the ecological situation in Belarus would not have been worse, but even better than in some European states. Currently, we have a lot of difficult problems. In the first place, the change in the chemical composition of Belarusian soil as an aftermath of acid rains and air pollution due to the means of transportation. These are global issues. The local issue of key importance is the waste from Soligorsk and Gomel chemical factories; the negative results of foolish land improvement; and the ecological situation in Novopolotsk. As for the legislation, it is not worse than in West European states and in some respects it is better. In the West, the implementation of ecological projects is often hampered by parliamentary agricultural and industrial lobbies. I am convinced that paradise is the German economy accompanied by our ecological legislation. To my regret, we are too far away from this paradise. However, in my opinion, under market conditions, the mechanism of control over the implementation of ecological laws is becoming more and more operative. Many of our industrial and agricultural sites are owned by persons who are responsible before the law. Babina: You are heading the Belarusian Ecological Union. This is one of our numerous new public organizations. How do you assess the activity of ``the greens'' in the Republic? Savitski: I have no single opinion on the issue. I do not like the appearance of the so-called ``banning'' trend in this organization. Often, despite real conditions, they demand that some sites not be constructed. However, life is life. Therefore, in my opinion, the key task of ecologists is not to ban but to choose the right option. To my regret, we are meeting more often with these ``banning'' demands. Sometimes, they are offended that we did not support their proposals. I can give you some examples: There is a project for the construction of an industrial site for production of sodium carbonate from the waste of the Soligorsk chemical factory. It may seem that everything is okay, because the Republic badly requires this substance. Moreover, it will be produced from this waste.... However, the Soligorsk Union of Ecologists has been writing letters of protest to all organizations and departments of the Republic, as well as to the UN ecological departments. In fact, Soligorsk ecologists are not against the construction of this kind of a factory, however, they oppose its construction on their territory. That is, waste from the Soligorsk chemical factory will have to be transported somewhere else.... If this union of ecologists made attempts to make this production safer -- there are no safe technologies overall -- their actions could have been more fruitful. Babina: You receive many letters from ordinary people. What are they about? Savitski: Each day, we receive about 30 letters. They are varied. Ecologists and workers of various branches of our economy send their proposals on various issues. We also receive many letters from working collectives. We try to answer all these letters. Babina: ZVYAZDA wrote about the debates between Belarusian and Ukrainian ecologists on the issue of constructing a building materials factory close to Malorita. Has this issue been resolved? Savitski: This issue has been discussed on all levels. A very representative commission of Belarusian ecologists has come to the conclusion that nothing threatens the Shatskiye Lakes. Nevertheless, we can listen to all the counter arguments of our Ukrainian colleagues. I hope that they will also take into consideration our protests about the decision of the Ukrainian legislature to continue the operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Babina: The last question. What is awaiting Belarus in 10-15 years? Savitski: I would hope for Belarus, especially its northern part, to become a kind of Switzerland within the CIS, a zone for tourism, recreation, and farming. Our industry should be equipped with modern technology. In general, it seems to me that Belarus has all the chances for becoming a state respected by the international community. The Belarusian agricultural sector can provide us with our own food, our industry -- with raw materials. We should discard the practice of using pesticides and herbicides, and begin working for export. As for our industry, I can hear that many people say that we experience a lack of raw materials, and can become ``an assembly shop'' for the CIS. In my opinion, in due time, this peculiarity of Belarus will make our Republic one of the most developed in the CIS. Please, pay attention, Japan is also ``an assembly shop'' for the planet and neither Japan, nor Great Britain, nor Switzerland, nor Germany can boast of rich natural resources. This fact does not impede them from being rich.
