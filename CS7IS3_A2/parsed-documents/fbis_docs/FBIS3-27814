"No one can break the crystal- like singlehearted unity of Korea" he said, adding: "In Korea the question of carrying forward the revolutionary cause of the leader has been successfully solved and education of the young people has reached the highest level beyond imagination". Co-chairman of the party A. Alimjanov said: "Only the rich monopolize arts and scenic spots in many countries. But in Korea all people take part in the creation of arts and enjoy holidays at scenic spots. This is the reality which can be seen only in Korea where the people revere their leaders as fathers."
