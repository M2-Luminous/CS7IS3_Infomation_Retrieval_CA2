Slovak political instability, including that of the government, is a reality which disturbs the Slovaks and raises doubts about the country among foreign investors, Kovac says, adding that although blame for this does not lie squarely with Meciar and his government, they cannot be spared it. Rejecting a campaign aimed at discrediting his person, he says that it has been initiated by "people from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), including its chairman, deputy chairmen, and deputies." At present, the government has enough powers to be efficient, he says, adding, "I believe the solution offered in the (Slovak) Constitution to be acceptable." Accusations leveled by Meciar that Kovac has triggered the factional strife within the HZDS are false, Kovac says, adding that in his meetings at their request with HZDS deputies they ask him to explain his relations with the government. "I am open with them, and my criticism includes myself." Kovac also says that Meciar has informed him of cases of deputies who requested 50 million korunas for their offers to support HZDS. Corruption is rumored to be more and more widespread, but on the other hand no steps have been taken to prove it, Kovac says in the paper, adding that he urged Meciar to "act against such people." "Accusations of corruption should be made only when it is possible to prove them," Kovac says, adding that empty corruption accusations tarnish Slovakia's image. Calling the law on the defamation of the republic a "relic of socialism," he says he is ready to sign an amendment to it as soon as it is approved by parliament. State Secretary and Government Office Head Ivan Lexa is being investigated on charges of violating the defamation law in connection with pronouncements he made after Kovac repeatedly refused to approve his appointment as privatization minister. The government itself proposed last week that the appropriate articles of the law be repealed, but parliament declined to put the issue on its February agenda.
