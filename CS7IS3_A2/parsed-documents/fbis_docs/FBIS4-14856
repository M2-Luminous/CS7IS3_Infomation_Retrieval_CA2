FBIS4-14856 "drsov065_b_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Zhirinovskiy Expels Duma Member Marychev Zhirinovskiy Expels Duma Member Marychev LD0404182694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1615 GMT 4 Apr 94 LD0404182694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Vyacheslav Marychev, elected to the Russian State Duma on the party ticket of Liberal-Democrats, has been expelled from the party. This was reported to the press on Monday by Marychev himself. He said he was notified by the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky just before the 5th congress of Liberal-Democrats held in Moscow last Saturday. He also said that security guards did not let him into the Central Tourists' House where the congress was held even though the convention was open to everyone. Marychev said his expulsion had been caused by a number of speeches in which he actively resisted the so-called imperative mandate being given to party groups. It would give groups the right to strip members of the State Duma elected on party tickets of their mandates. During a visit to St.Petersburg before the congress Zhirinovsky repeatedly declared that Marychev who used to lead the local branch of the Liberal-Democratic Party accepted bribes, in particular from Russia's Choice, for making statements directed against the leader. Marychev said he was ready to sue Zhirinovsky for libel if the conflict is not settled. However, in reply to a question from Interfax he said he was not disappointed in Zhirinovsky as a person. He said he still considers the party leader a talented politician. The decision of the congress to make Zhirinovsky the party chairman till 2004 and grant him absolute power between congresses contradicts party rules, said Marychev. Members of the State Duma Vyacheslav Marychev, Viktor Kobelev and Alexander Pronin expelled by Zhirinovsky from the Liberal-Democratic Party are planning to hold a news conference at the State Duma on Wednesday.
