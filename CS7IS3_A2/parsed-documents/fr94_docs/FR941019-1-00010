Willful violations of the rule are subject to criminal enforcement. Finding of No Significant Environmental Impact: Availability The Commission has determined under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and the Commission's regulations in Subpart A of 10 CFR Part 51, that this rule, if adopted, does not degrade the environment in any way. The actions resulting from this rule, if adopted, would reduce the core damage frequency and risks during shutdown and low-power operations. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there will be no significant impact on the environment from this proposed rule. This discussion constitutes the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact for this proposed rule; a separate assessment has not been prepared.
