Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council, led members of the central party, government, and Army joint task force to inspect some disaster areas in Guangxi and specially conveyed regards to officers and men of the PLA, who were fighting floods and providing disaster relief. He told them: You, soldiers stationed in Guangxi, are doing your best to actively participate in flood resistance and disaster relief without fearing sacrifice. The local government and people appreciate your efforts very much. Without you soldiers, we would not possibly make such great achievements in the anti-flood struggle. Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee's Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat, led members of the central party, government, and Army joint task force to Changsha. After hearing the Hunan Provincial party committee and government's reports on provincial flood resistance and disaster relief efforts, Wen Jiabao said: Officers and men of the PLA and armed police officers and men carry forward the fine tradition of devoting themselves to the people and appear at flood-stricken places as soon as possible. The PLA are worthy of being called the people's own Army. State Councillor Chen Junsheng led members of the central party, government, and Army joint task force to visit officers and men of a certain unit, who have assisted emergencies for more than 10 days at the Bei Jiang Dike. He said: The PLA played a key role at a crucial time. The hidden hole on the Bei Jiang Dike presented an imminent danger. If the PLA had not come in time to fix it, the consequences would be very serious. Since serious flooding hit Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan on 8 June, soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force stationed in flood areas have been called out immediately to spare no effort in fighting floods and offering disaster relief. Leaders at all levels led their men from the front, made careful arrangements, and were in command at the forefront of flood resistance and disaster relief. As a huge flood peak hit the Bei Jiang Dike, General Li Xilin, commander of the Guanzhou Military Region led thousands of officers and soldiers in rushing into the danger zone. They plugged holes in the dike in time and secured the Bei Jiang Dike that is so vital to the safety of the entire Zhu Jiang Delta. After Jinman village in Guangxi's Duan county was submerged by floodwater, engineering corps of the Guangxi Military District got the order to rescue victims there. They made a rapid 120 km march to hurry to Jinman village in time and evacuated more than 3,000 Jinman residents. The 100-meter Xiangjiang Dike in Changsha's Longwang Lane collapsed on the morning of 18 June and floodwater seriously threatened the lives of more than 40,000 residents. Deng Hanmin, political commissar of the Hunan Military District, led more than 260 soldiers in quickly fixing the dike by reinforcing it with more than 40,000 sandbags. They finally headed off disaster. With the weather poor and communication difficult, an Air Force unit took emergency measures to speedily deliver food to Wuzhou by plane. Flood victims hailed them excitedly: Long live the PLA! Carrying forward our Army's spirit in being brave and tough, fearing no sacrifice, and fighting tenaciously, officers and men participating in flood resistance and disaster relief have been fighting floods for 15 days and nights. Their high morale did not sink a bit. To rescue 460 people besieged by floodwater, officers and men of a engineering regiment jumped into the water to safely evacuate them. After having rescued people in several flooded areas, more than 600 officers and men of a tank brigade received an order to assist in an emergency in Qingyuan city. They hurried to the collapsed Huilangzhen Dam and worked all-out to achieve a heroic deed -- fighting all day to plug the hole on the third dike and rescuing more than 40,000 people and their property. As the masses of cadres and soldiers have been highly disciplined in their rescue missions, and not encroached on the interests of the people in the slightest, they have won praise and support from the people. People of Shijiao town, where the Bei Jiang Dike is located, hurriedly left their homes when huge floods approached. As the rescuing troops entered the town, they found that the doors of many shops and houses were still open. Cadres and soldiers did not take anything from the open houses. Quite the opposite, they organized patrol teams to guard property in the shops and houses day and night. When the floods receded, people returned and found their homes the same as before they left and nothing was missing. They were touched and said: The PLA is the people's good troop!
