FR941006-2-00094 FR941006-2-00076 [Docket No. 030&hyph;32190; License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01, EA 94&hyph;131] Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc., Evanston, Wyoming; Order to Transfer Material (Effective Immediately) and Order Revoking License I Western Industrial X-Ray Inspection Company, Inc. (Licensee or WIX) is the holder of Byproduct Material License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Parts 30 and 34. The license authorizes the Licensee to possess sealed sources of iridium-192 in various radiography devices for use in performing industrial radiography activities. The license originally issued on August 12, 1991, and due to expire on August 31, 1996, was suspended by NRC Order (EA 93&hyph;238) on June 16 1994. II On June 16, 1994, the NRC issued an Order Suspending License (Immediately Effective) (Suspension Order) and Demand for Information to WIX. The Suspension Order was based on inspections and investigations that had identified numerous violations of NRC's radiation safety requirements, including some violations which were found to have recurred after being found in previous inspections and several which were determined to have been committed deliberately by WIX employees and by the President and Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) for WIX, Larry D. Wicks. Apparent violations were described in inspection reports 030&hyph;32190/93&hyph;01 and 030&hyph;32190/94&hyph;01 issued on May 12, 1994. The violations were also described in the June 16, 1994 Suspension Order. The Suspension Order required WIX to suspend its use of NRC-regulated material and to place it in safe storage pending further order. The Demand for Information required WIX to describe why, in light of the violations and managerial failures discussed in the Suspension Order, NRC License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01 should not be revoked and also why an order should not be issued to Mr. Wicks prohibiting him from performing NRC-licensed activities. On June 17 and June 28, 1994, letters were submitted to the NRC on behalf of WIX by its attorney, John C. Phillips. These letters provided WIX's response to the violations and requested relaxation or rescission of the Suspension Order. In response to the violations, WIX admitted some of the violations, denied some of the violations, and denied that Larry D. Wicks had ever deliberately caused the Licensee to be in violation of NRC requirements or at any time provided materially false information to the NRC. In addition, the June 28, 1994 letter included a Corrective Measure Plan that described various actions taken by WIX to preclude a recurrence of the violations that led to the Suspension Order. Actions described in the responses include obtaining more alarm ratemeters, establishing a system for their system for their issuance and ensuring the current of their calibrations, designation of an Assistant RSO, and creation of additional records, along with statements assuring future compliance. The responses amount to assertions of being in compliance, that most of the violations were inconsequential and the public health and safety had not been jeopardized, and that future conduct will prevent violations. These responses were submitted as a basis for relaxing or rescinding the Suspension Order and did not provide an adequate or specific response to the Demand for Information which asked why the license should not be revoked. The NRC reviewed the information in these letters to determine whether WIX had provided sufficient justification for the NRC to relax or rescind the Suspension Order. On July 19, 1994, the NRC denied WIX's requests in writing, stating, ``Given the nature of the violations in this case, the NRC's concerns about the integrity of certain WIX personnel, and the licensee's failure to address adequately the fundamental problems identified in the Order, e.g., our significant concerns regarding the capability or willingness of Mr. Wicks and other WIX personnel to ensure compliance with NRC requirements, I find the mere promise in your submittals of future compliance with NRC requirements insufficient assurance at this time that WIX employees will conduct licensed activities in accordance with NRC requirements.'' In its second report, OI concluded that four WIX employees, including the President, committed four deliberate violations. These violations have safety significance, such as failure to evaluate a potential overexposure, preparation of false reports concerning a potential overexposure, and failure to supervise radiography operations. The NRC remains concerned about the deliberate violations caused by WIX's President and RSO, especially as they pertain to a possible overexposure incident, and his other failures to properly direct the conduct of licensed activities in a safe manner. It is this failure to conduct licensed activities in a safe manner, coupled with questions as to the integrity of several employees, that cause the NRC to be concerned about public health and safety. In its response, WIX did not sufficiently demonstrate that the NRC could rely upon it to ensure that the public health and safety would be protected if radioactive materials were to be used in the future under License No. 49&hyph;27356&hyph;01.
