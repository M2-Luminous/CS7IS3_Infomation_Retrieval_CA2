I do, however, want to resolve a few problems that are a burden on the economy. I will not allow a few dozen other issues to be included in this program. I have selected 10," said Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko after hearing economists' questions and remarks concerning the "Strategy for Poland." The deputy prime minister took part in a meeting at the Polish Economic Society, which was held on 8 June in Warsaw. Many controversies were aroused by the unemployment counteracting program. A decrease in the unemployment rate, which was envisioned in the program, to a level of 14 percent was said to be too low. It was also stressed that it is not possible to lower the inflation rate and the unemployment rate at the same time. The goal to work toward should be to lower unemployment, whereas combating inflation is merely a means leading to the achievement of this goal. Therefore, a "monetary expansion" should not be feared. Many statements suggested that the "Strategy for Poland" is too optimistic. Participants of the meeting listed the conditions that should be met so that implementation of the programs is possible--"to mobilize savings"; "to extend the investment blockade"; "to increase the inflow of foreign capital and to create conditions for investors"; "to improve the competitiveness of the economy and, following the Japanese model, to set up a foreign trade council"; "to immediately embark on a program of investing in human capital"; "to extend the guarantees for deposits in all banks"; "to prepare substitute policies, when it turns out that, for instance, there are new possibilities." As Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said, the "Strategy for Poland" is supposed to inform both households and all companies, as well as foreign investors, about the intentions of the Polish Government. They should know what they can count on. This is exemplified by the tax on immovable property, which has been blown up into sensational news, despite the fact that work on it was started by previous governments. The ministry is conducting such work; however, it will be the Sejm that decides what taxes and when they will be introduced. We want to develop housing, said the deputy prime minister, and we will not tamper with the fiscal system in such a way as to impede this sector. There exist very acute conflicts between employment and inflation or between unemployment and inflation. These are more political than economic decisions. The "Strategy for Poland" proposes lowering these two rates, both the inflation rate and the unemployment rate, which is possible. Right now, however, it seems that of greater importance is the quicker lowering of the inflation rate--to less than 10 percent by 1997. This is more real than lowering the unemployment rate to this level. The government is not going to grant a state loan, as was done, for example, before World War II for implementation of the program. The country's debts are too great debt to afford such measures. Therefore, I do not want to accept credits without any consideration, the deputy prime minister said. The announced consolidation of banks, which also causes concern, is indispensable because of competition. Even the largest Polish companies are simply small compared to Western firms. It is not true that there are surpluses in this year's budget. The revenues are indeed greater. However, for example, the valorization of retirement and disability pensions costs 2.5 trillion zlotys [Z] a month, which totals approximately Z30 trillion per year. The budget participates in this. Now, if it turned out that there are really some surpluses, I would prefer to spend them primarily in such a way as to partially lessen the debt burden of the education or health sector, said Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko. Grzegorz Kolodko said that, for the time being, there is no need to amend the budget, which does not mean, however, that there cannot be any changes in the future. "I will certainly not propose it this month," he said.
