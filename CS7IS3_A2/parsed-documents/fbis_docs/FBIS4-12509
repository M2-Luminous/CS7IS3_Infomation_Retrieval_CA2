FBIS4-12509 "drnes069dd_94013" FBIS-NES-94-069 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Hamas Official: Rocket Threats Not `Cheap Propaganda' Hamas Official: Rocket Threats Not `Cheap Propaganda' JN0804185294 Paris Radio Monte Carlo in Arabic 1735 GMT 8 Apr 94 JN0804185294 Paris Radio Monte Carlo Arabic BFN [Interview with Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative in Syria, by Sana' al-Imam, in Damascus; date not given; from the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded] [Text] [Mustafa] The purpose of the 'Afula operation was to avenge the martyrs of the bloody Ramadan dawn in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Revenge was inevitable. Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] is confident that 'Arafat will not go back on the negotiations. He has burned all his bridges. He will not return to the trench of the people, the intifadah, and the resistance. The only thing he has left is to pursue the conspiracy to the end. It is like a person who falls in deep mud; whenever he tries to come out of the mud, he sinks deeper. We are really astonished at the U.S. position and that of the Security Council and some nations that condemned this great operation of martyrdom, carried out for revenge and to deter the Zionist usurpers from committing more operations. It took the Security Council three weeks to issue a resolution condemning the crime of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. On the other hand, it was only a matter of hours before it condemned this revenge operation, which is part of the resistance against occupation and usurpation. Does the Security Council act upon U.S-Zionist orders? Is it no longer a council for world peace and world peoples? [Al-Imam] Hamas is not satisfied with this operation. It has threatened to fire rockets at the homes of settlers in the occupied territories. On what basis did Hamas launch these threats? Will these threats be carried out? I wonder if Hamas really has the weapons required to carry out such threats? [Mustafa] First of all, the Palestinian people, Hamas, and all free men, are demanding that the usurper occupiers leave our land and go to their original home. They will live in peace after the return of four million Palestinians who were made homeless by Zionist usurpation. Those Zionist settlers and soldiers are practicing killing, terrorism, and deportation. They are practicing rape and violating sanctities. This is the demand Hamas has made to those settlers. Otherwise, it has threatened them with rockets, just like the Zionists launched rockets against our people and villages and safe and defenseless homes before and during the intifadah. When Hamas declares this, it is aware that the Palestinian people know Hamas keeps its promises. It has earned its credibility through its successive statements and positions. This is not credibility won by propaganda and fame. It is true credibility won on the battlefield. Therefore, the threats Hamas has launched to fire the rocket shells, which God has given it recently, as stated in the recent military communique, represent a true announcement. This is not cheap propaganda. It is not to win fame. Hamas and the al-Qassam Battalions have proven this during the intifadah.
