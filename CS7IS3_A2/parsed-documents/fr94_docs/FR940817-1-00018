ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: EPA proposes to approve the State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision submitted by the District of Columbia for the purpose of establishing a Small Business Stationary Source Technical and Environmental Compliance Assistance Program. In the final rules section of this Federal Register , EPA is approving the State's SIP revision as a direct final rule without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial SIP revision and anticipates no adverse comments. A detailed rationale for the approval is set forth in the direct final rule. If no adverse comments are received in response to this proposed rule, no further activity is contemplated and the direct final rule will become effective. If EPA receives adverse comments, the direct final rule will be withdrawn and all public comments received will be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this proposed rule. EPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Thomas J.
