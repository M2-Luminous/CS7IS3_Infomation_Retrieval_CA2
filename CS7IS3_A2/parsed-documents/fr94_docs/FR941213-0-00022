FR941213-0-00022 FR941213-0-00005 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [CA 13&hyph;3&hyph;6723; FRL&hyph;5118&hyph;7] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; California State Implementation Plan Revision, Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District, Ventura County Air Pollution Control District, and Placer County Air Pollution Control District AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is finalizing the approval of revisions to the California State Implementation Plan (SIP) proposed in the Federal Register on April 4, 1994. The revisions concern rules from the following air pollution control districts: Yolo-Solano Air Pollution Control District (Yolo-Solano APCD), Placer County Air Pollution Control District (Placer County APCD), and Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (Ventura County APCD). This approval action will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. The intended effect of approving these rules is to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). The revised rules control VOC emissions from cleaning and degreasing operations. Thus, EPA is finalizing the approval of these revisions into the California SIP under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas. EFFECTIVE DATE: This action is effective on January 12, 1995. ADDRESSES: Copies of the rules and EPA's evaluation report for each rule are available for public inspection at EPA's Region IX office during normal business hours. Copies of the submitted rules are available for inspection at the following locations: Rulemaking Section (A&hyph;5&hyph;3), Air and Toxics Division, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region IX, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, CA 94105.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On April 4, 1994 in 59 FR 15691, EPA proposed to approve the following rules into the California SIP: Yolo-Solano APCD's Rule 2.24_Surface Cleaning Operations, Placer County APCD's Rule 216_Degreasing Operations, and Ventura County APCD's Rule 74.6_Surface Cleaning and Degreasing. Rule 2.24 was adopted by Yolo-Solano APCD on November 14, 1990, Rule 216 was adopted by Placer County APCD on September 25, 1990, and Rule 74.6 was adopted by Ventura County APCD on December 10, 1991. These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 13, 1991, April 5, 1991, and June 19, 1992, respectively. These rules were submitted in response to EPA's 1988 SIP-Call and the CAA section 182(a)(2)(A) requirement that nonattainment areas fix their reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone in accordance with EPA guidance that interpreted the requirements of the pre-amendment Act. A detailed discussion of the background for each of the above rules and nonattainment areas is provided in the NPRM cited above. EPA has evaluated all of the above rules for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations and EPA interpretation of these requirements as expressed in the various EPA policy guidance documents referenced in the NPRM cited above. EPA has found that the rules meet the applicable EPA requirements. A detailed discussion of the rule provisions and evaluations has been provided in 59 FR 15691 and in technical support documents (TSDs) available at EPA's Region IX office (TSDs dated August 6, 1993 for Rules 2.24, 216, and 74.6). Response to Public Comments A 30-day public comment period was provided in 59 FR 15691. EPA received no comments.
