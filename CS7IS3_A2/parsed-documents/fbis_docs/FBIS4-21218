The petition, filed by the editor of a Tamil weekly, THARASU, Mr. S. Shunmugam, lists four other cases pertaining to the alleged police abuse of the narcotics drugs and psychotropic substances act in the last one-year. No more than 20 per cent of the cases registered under the act have resulted in conviction. The petitioner's point is that the poor conviction rate has much to do with the arbitrary exercise of powers by the police at the instance of the ruling party bigwigs. The petition seeks a court directive to the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government for appointment of a judicial commission to inquire into the alleged misuse of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances act and abuse of its provisions for extraneous reasons. Admitting the petition Mr. Justice Kanakaraj, ordered notices to the Union home secretary and also the state home secretary returnable in three weeks. In his affidavit the THARASU editor said that the investigation conducted by his weekly indicated that the arrest of Mr. Alagappan, son-in-law of justice A.R. Lakshmanan, on January 28, was done in consultation with the ruling party leadership. The suspect on his arrest was not told anything other than that he was being arrested on instructions from a senior official of the state law department. Mr. Alagappan alias Kumar was released on conditional bail after three days in judicial custody. Meanwhile, Mr. Kumar today moved the high court, saying that his arrest on the ganja smuggling charge was motivated and obtained a two-week stay on the proceedings of the case against him, pending in the sessions court. [sentence as published] The THARASU editor, in his affidavit, submitted that the narcotics drugs act was being used against a family member of a high court judge as a calculated move to intimidate the judiciary. Mr. Shanmugam submitted that his writ petition related to, not an isolated case against the judge's son-in-law, but several instances of misuse of the narcotics drugs act for political purposes by the ruling AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam].
