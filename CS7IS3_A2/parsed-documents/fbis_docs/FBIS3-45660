China's Minister of Agriculture Mr. Liu Jiang, speaking at a national agricultural work meeting, said that this year's goal for agriculture and the rural economy was to raise the income of farmers steadily and guarantee the supply of agricultural products, causing an all-round development of the rural economy with the aim of achieving a five percent increase in the per capita income of farmers and a grain output of more than 450 billion kilograms and increases of 850 million kilograms for cotton and one million tonnes of edible oil. These goals indicate the government's desire to develop the agricultural sector and its determination to better the living standards of farmers despite many difficulties. Many difficulties have been encountered in raising the output of grain and cotton because of lower profits and inflation affecting production means, resulting in a dampening of farmers' enthusiasm for growing these crops. The Minister of Agriculture said that China's agriculture lacks a stable basis with the area of land under grain cultivation last year down by seven million mu over the previous year. The government would, he said, call on the relevant departments to see to it that an area of more than 1.6 billion mu under crop cultivation is maintained the special loans were set aside for 500 counties to support their cultivation of grain. Cotton output was down last year resulting in a price hike in cotton and harmed the textile industry. The government has therefore set the area of land under cotton cultivation this year at 90 million mu and has decided to raise the purchase price of cotton considerably besides arranging loans to 150 counties for the production of high-quality cotton. The output of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, aquatic products, fruit and vegetables, which are important to people's daily lives all increased greatly last year and importance is place on this year's production as well. Mr. Chen called for a big increase of these products, saying that the outer suburbs of the country's main cities should increase their areas for vegetable cultivation to guarantee supply and keep prices stable.
