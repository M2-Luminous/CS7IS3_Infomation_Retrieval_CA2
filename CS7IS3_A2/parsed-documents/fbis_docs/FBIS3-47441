Former Presidents Choe Kyu-ha, Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u personify the conflict and yoke that stained the political history of South Korea for the last 15 years, some newspapers said. Kim had invited the trio to Chongwadae [presidential office] for lunch and informal talks, but the news media and general public attached significance to the event and used words like "great reconciliation" and "great harmony." In addition, Kim invited his predecessors to seek their support for his administration's efforts to boost competitive strength in the era of globalization through national unity. But below this facade, the TONG-A ILBO could not help detecting Kim's political calculation. The daily said in an editorial Tuesday that through the last 10 months of anti-corruption campaigning Kim has alienated himself from Chon and No and must have felt a political burden. In this respect, the presidential get-together could be nothing more nor nothing less than a meeting of pro-government forces, the TONG-A said, adding that this was why it could not but worry that the meeting may force a dispersal rather than a concentration of national strength. The TONG-A nevertheless ended its editorial on a hopeful note, urging Chon and No to make efforts to make up their personal animosity so that the public no longer hears about their conflict. Moreover, if the meeting was held to help gather national competitive strength within a big framework of reconciliation and unity, the newspaper said, the public suspicion or impression that Kim has been waging a political vendetta against his predecessors under the pretext of an anti-corruption campaign has to be cast off. The SEGYE TIMES, in an editorial, said that it did not view the meeting as an occasion for simple reconciliation, for it has to be reconciliation and cooperation for the future through readjustment of personal attitude and self-reform. It should not be a reconciliation that accepts past mistakes or wrongdoings as they are, but one based on a thorough self- examination and efforts to reborn for the future, it said. A SEOUL SINMUN editorial said angry and fighting politics were replaced by politics where there are smiles. There was no better sign than that Korean politics have stabilized and matured, it said. There were times when chief executives could not go out to the public freely and express their own opinions. As one of the persecuted politicians during those unfortunate days, President Kim has extended his arms to former presidents based on his legitimacy and confidence, the SEOUL SINMUN said. Kim's efforts to get the nation back to normal have to be evaluated highly, the newspaper added.
