FBIS3-34065 "drnes023_r_94002" FBIS-NES-94-023 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Feb 1994 India Paper Protests Clinton Remarks on Punjab, `Sikh Rights' BK0202033894 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS in English 25 Jan 94 p 8 BK0202033894 Delhi INDIAN EXPRESS Language: English Article Type:BFN [Editorial: "Cockpit of Intrigues"] [Text] President Clinton is fast gaining recognition as the patron-in-chief of secessionists of South Asia. After his recent gesture to Ghulam Nabi Fai, chief of one of the Pakistan-funded outfit of Kashmiri separatists in the US, it has now been disclosed by the US-based Council of Khalistan that Clinton has also expressed his concern for "Sikh rights" in Punjab. He has done so in a letter to Congressman Gary A. Condit who had drawn the former's attention to "the crisis in Khalistan." The mischief is writ large on statements both by Condit and Aulakh, the leader of the Sikh separatists. Yet, the State Department would have us believe that the letter was written to Condit only by way of courtesy -- a letter in which Clinton refers to Punjab as though it were the 51st state of the US. In doing so, the Department has conveniently tried to divert attention from the clear prospect of an early end to the prolonged campaign of brutal murders in Punjab, from the establishment of an elected government and from increasing signs of normalcy there. This happy turn of events should have gladdened the hearts of Americans whose government has repeatedly professed to come down heavily on international terrorism. But Clinton's administration has deemed it more important to warm the cockles of the hearts of foreign-based chiefs of separatist organisations who have been demoralised by the rapid restoration of peace in Punjab. Secessionists of every kind have good reason to think that Clinton and his buddies in the White House are there to ensure that they all will remain in business. They have discovered that they only need to pose as great champions of human rights to enlist Clinton's sympathy. In fact many worthies of the under-world around the world may take the cue from the American lobbyists for secessionism-cum-terrorism or their agents entrenched in present-day White House. The bulk of Clinton's staff seems to be preoccupied with salvaging his reputation in the wake of his and his wife's alleged malfeasance during his tenure as Governor of Arkansas. This may be one reason why lobbies working for dubious causes, apparently find "human rights" a magic formula to manipulate the White House. Washington, in fact, is likely to become famous less as a capital of think-tanks than as the key nerve-centre of specialists in political destabilisation in the third world. What a parody of the world leadership of the unchallenged superpower! The CIA, the great expert in subversion, has nursed Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] which has now taken over as the arch-stabiliser in South Asia. Clinton's touching concern for the feelings of American lobbyists for Pakistan's proteges among the Kashmiri and Punjabi separatists is apt to make ISI happy. It can count on its traditional links with the Pentagon being reinforced by a cooperative bureaucracy running the White House. Anyone can now get any dirty work done through Clinton's close aides just by chanting the mantra of human rights.
