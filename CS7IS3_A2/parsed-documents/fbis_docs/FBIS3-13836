Despite some positive points in this resolution, the way that the United States voted on some of its paragraphs, not to mention the U.S. obstruction of the Security Council for approximately three weeks, revealed the U.S. Administration's true position and confirmed that this U.S. Administration holds a greater bias toward Israel than that of former U.S. Administrations. The comments made by the U.S. representative at the Security Council, after this resolution was passed, are perhaps the clearest example of this extreme U.S. bias toward Israel, especially since she announced that her country does not regard the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Arab Jerusalem as occupied territories, so, according to her, they are not covered under the Fourth Geneva Convention concerning the situation of civilians at wartime. Given this, and in view of this extremely biased U.S. position, we do not need to wonder whether Washington is entitled to play an honest broker role in the Middle East conflict. We do, however, wonder about another doubtful issue: Will the new Security Council resolution be implemented on the ground, particularly regarding international protection for Palestinians, as long as the Clinton administration, which is facing a domestic crisis, flatters both Israel and its U.S. friends in this manner? While not wishing to focus any more attention on this extremely negative U.S. position toward an important aspect of the Middle East conflict; namely, Arab Jerusalem, we do hope that the recent Security Council resolution will be translated into tangible results. We wish to see results that will help open the door wide to the resumption of the peace process and help make the desired changes in the lives of the citizens in the occupied Palestinian territory.
