FBIS4-47830 "drafr086_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA ANC: `Large-Scale' Voting Irregularities in Natal ANC: `Large-Scale' Voting Irregularities in Natal MB0305191794 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1856 GMT 3 May 94 MB0305191794 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Durban May 3 SAPA -- The African National Congress Midlands region in KwaZulu/Natal on Tuesday [3 May] claimed large-scale voting irregularities, particularly in areas north of the Tugela River. "We are obviously concerned and anxious about this lead (in election results in the province by the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]). We are convinced there has been massive irregularities," said ANC spokesman Dr Blade Nzimande. The IFP's Dr Ziba Jiyane earlier predicted a 60 per cent majority for his party, adding that the IFP had overwhelming support north of the Tugela River. "This lead is not a true reflection of the IFP's popularity," Dr Nzimande said. On Tuesday afternoon an Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] report gave the IFP a lead of 21.4 per cent over its ANC rival. Dr Nzimande said the three ANC Natal regions were meeting to discuss "this grave situation". Discrepancies were noted in votes cast, particularly in KwaZulu- administrated areas, and had been forwarded to the IEC for investigation, he said. He said even in rural areas, where the ANC had a marginal support base, "it doesn't reflect at all".
