"The Russian Federation is not supplying the Yemenis with special-purpose equipment, either directly or through a third country", he stressed. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that even last year, long before the armed conflict began, Russia decided to halt supplies of arms and military equipment to Yemen following the exacerbation of intra-Yemeni discord. Russia did this on the grounds that supplying weapons to warring parties contradicts its principled approach, which aims to achieve the earliest possible settlement of the conflict by political methods. Grigoriy Karasin pointed out that the Russian Foreign Ministry is taking this line in contacts with both states and is encouraging them to act in the same way.
