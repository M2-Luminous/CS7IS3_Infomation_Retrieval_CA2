Shahin] [Text] Amman -- The Israeli government has approved the entry of up to 600 Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) personnel including all members of the Palestine Central Council (PCC) in preparation for the expected entry of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to the Palestinian autonomous territories, PLO sources said Friday [17 June]. The Israeli-approved list, which includes PLO activists from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, is the first to include members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). Both groups reject the peace process. Up to 400 names of PLO activists including members of women's organisations and medical organisations and administrative officials were approved Thursday and up to 100 more were passed through Gaza-based PLO officials to Tunis on Friday. The PLO had submitted large lists to the Israelis and now they are flowing back to Tunis. Most members of the PCC were also given clearance by the Israeli authorities by Friday. There was, however, a "B list" and "C list," according to PLO sources in Amman. These were still subject to further security checks by Israelis and in the case of "list C" -- which contained the names of those who were refused entry. "The PLO sources in Amman did not have the names of the people refused entry. [quotation marks as published] The names included in the list of 600 are both from Gaza and the West Bank and include several hundred Fatah-affiliated activists, independents, about 25 FIDA members, 19 members of the PFLP and a handful of DFLP members. Former militant activists and political prisoners expelled by Israel are among those whose names were approved. The timing of the approval is in synchronisation with the expected entry of Mr. 'Arafat and an effort to make the Palestinian National Authority operational within the next few weeks. The timing of Mr. 'Arafat's entry, initially tipped to have been on June 5, is still uncertain. Many PLO officials now say that it will not be until after the July 6 ceremony in Paris in which the PLO Chairman and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin will receive a special U.N. prize for their role in the Middle East peace process. International funding is among the points of contention said to have delayed the PLO chairman's entry into Jericho and Gaza. World Bank officials were in Tunis to discuss the channelling of funds. Mr. 'Arafat is said to be angered by the World Bank's insistence that the funding be given directly to government agencies or projects.
