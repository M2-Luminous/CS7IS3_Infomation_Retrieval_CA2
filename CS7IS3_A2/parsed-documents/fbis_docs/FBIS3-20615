Cheng Kejie, chairman of the region, told reporters that the hydropower station is believed to be second only to the projected Three Gorges hydropower station in scale, and when it is completed it will be the second biggest in Asia. During the first-phase construction, a water control dam with a height of 375 metres will be built, and seven generating units with a total generating capacity of 4.2 million kilowatts will be installed. When the first phase is completed the hydropower station will be able to generate 15.67 billion killowatt-hours of electricity a year, Cheng said. During the second-phase construction, two more generating units, to boost the station's aggregate generating capacity to a total of 5.4 million kilowatts, will be installed. The entire project will require a total investment of 30 billion yuan ($3.4 billion), of which $970 million will be provided in the form of World Bank loans, the chairman said. [Passage omitted]
