The petitioner contends that it carefully compared the 230CE to the 300CE, and found the two models to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. G&K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the 1991 model 230CE, as originally manufactured in the same manner as the 1991 model 300CE that was offered for sale in the United States, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.

Additionally, the petitioner states that the bumpers on the 1991 model 230CE must be reinforced to comply with the Bumper standard found in 49 CFR Part 581. Petitioner also contends that the vehicle is capable of being readily modified to meet the following standards, in the manner indicated: Standard No. 101 Controls and Displays: (a) substitution of a lens marked ``Brake'' for a lens with an ECE symbol on the brake failure indicator lamp; (b) installation of a seat belt warning lamp; (c) recalibration of the speedometer/odometer from kilometers to miles per hour.
