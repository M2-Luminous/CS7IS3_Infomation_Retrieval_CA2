Xiamen has thus become the third special economic zone (SEZ) with legislative power after Hainan Shenzhen [as received]. The move marks another significant step China has taken in speeding up reforms and establishing a legal system for the SEZs. Legislation is playing an increasingly important role in the development of SEZs. With a legal framework basically built for a market economy and for their economic convergence with the international market, the SEZs serve as experimental sites for not only economic restructuring, but also for local legislation. Establishment of a legal system has been included in plans for the development of the SEZs. In 1981, the NPC Standing Committee authorized Guangdong and Fujian Provinces to formulate regulations and statutes regarding SEZs under their jurisdiction. In 1988, Hainan island became a province and a special economic zone, and was also authorized to formulate local laws and regulations. In 1992, the NPC Standing Committee gave Shenzhen the same right. Granting Xiamen legislative power is a need posed by the Xiamen SEZ to speed up reforms and open wider to the rest of the world. Separated from Taiwan by the sea, Xiamen plays an irreplaceable role in increasing personnel and economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and in promoting China's reunification. Since its establishment, Xiamen has developed rapidly. Overseas- funded enterprises now account for more than 60 percent of Xiamen's industrial output value. However, legislation in Xiamen proceeded at a slow pace, making it impossible to set code of conduct for economic activities. And the situation has already adversely affected improvement in Xiamen's investment environment. With the legislative power just granted, Xiamen will be able to solve many problems that have cropped up. Over the next few years, Xiamen plans to enact at least 50 local laws and regulations.
