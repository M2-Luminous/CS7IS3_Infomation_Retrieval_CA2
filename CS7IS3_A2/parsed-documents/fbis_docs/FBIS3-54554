This regional organization originally included Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, but in 1992 Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan joined it. According to the president, the United States and Europe are not interested in the settlement of conflicts that are taking place in the young states of the region and might even foment them. He said: "Unfortunately, the colonial powers do not pay attention to those ruinous conflicts in the `Third World' that do not involve their interests. In some cases they even fan the flames of these conflicts in order to reach their diabolic objectives and ensure their illegal interests." Hashemi-Rafsanjani indicated the urgent necessity of close cooperation of the ECO member-countries that are rich in natural and labor resources. "It is absolutely evident that this cooperation will reduce our economic dependence on the developed countries" and will decrease the political tension in the region, the president stressed.
