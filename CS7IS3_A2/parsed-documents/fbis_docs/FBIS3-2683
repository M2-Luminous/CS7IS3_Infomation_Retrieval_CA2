Liu Zhongli said: To basically maintain a balance between total social supply and demand and to alleviate inflationary pressure, we should still adhere to the principle of tightening control over expenditures in preparing this year's state budget. In preparing financial expenditures, we must consider our financial capability, ensure funds for key projects, and tighten control over investment in general projects. He stressed: This year, in addition to continuing to increase investments in agriculture, education, science and technology, infrastructural facilities, and other key areas, and in addition to ensuring a necessary increase in funds for national defense and judicial and public security departments, we should give priority to ensuring expenditures for wages and the state's grain storage expenses. By no means should we allow using workers' living expenses to launch new projects. Liu Zhongli said: Localities who are still holding out workers' wages should decidedly stop or postpone the construction of projects using funds for other purposes; units that are still holding out workers' wages are not allowed to buy sedans or other high-grade consumer products. He stressed that finance departments at all levels must place great importance on this issue. Liu Zhongli also called for strictly controlling the scale of fixed asset investment. He said: Except for those projects that have been approved and of which construction has to be carried out, no new projects should be launched. The construction of projects for which funds are not secured and of which the economic efficiency is not definite should be decidedly stopped or postponed. Liu Zhongli pointed out in his report: Currently, wasting funds is a quite serious problem. Many units demand high standards for interior decoration and new equipment; the practice of sightseeing in the name of attending meetings and using public funds for dining and wining continues despite repeated banning. In particular, many units lack effective control over their organizational size; as a result, their personnel expenses take up a large portion of their development funds. Therefore, this year, we should focus on reducing personnel, automobile, and meeting expenses; forcefully promote the good tradition of working hard and living a frugal life; and urge the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to combat waste and excessive spending. At the same time, as the price reform deepens, we will gradually reduce financial subsidies -- the total subsidy amount must not exceed the budgeted amount. We should deepen the reform of institutions' financial management and should continue to encourage and support them in increasing income within the bounds of established policies and laws and in implementing the comprehensive revenue-expenditure planned management involving all revenues and expenditures. We should resolutely and thoroughly implement the policy of separating revenues from expenditures. Income from leasing lands and selling public houses should be included in the revenues under budgeted management so that unified budget management can be exercised.
