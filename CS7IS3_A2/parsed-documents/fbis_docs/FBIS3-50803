It was officially announced last night that President de Leon decided to accept Estrada's resignation after studying the matter. She submitted her resignation in mid-November, shortly after replacing Cesar Alcides Soto Rodas. Ms. Estrada resigned citing health reasons, but the government announced last night she will be named head of the Association of Nontraditional Products (Gexpront), where she performed a work public officials and private businessmen have described as successful. Banker and exporter Eduardo Gonzalez Castillo is reportedly a strong contender to replace Estrada, although the possibility that Rodriguez may be confirmed has not been ruled out, given that he is also an expert in commerce and international businesses.
