"We have guaranteed investors against confiscation of their property and have guaranteed their right to repatriate their profits and dividends. Although the clause on mining is still in the Freedom Charter, we have made the shift away from nationalisation," he told delegates at the ANC Youth League [ANCYL] conference in Soweto on Friday. The ANCYL's annual conference is the last before the April 27 general election. Mr Mandela said it was important to organise the economy to enable it to deliver the goods in the face of high expectations from the people. "If the ANC government is unable to deliver the goods, then you should overthrow it because it is not good," he said. He said the ANC had also agreed to a code of conduct for senior officials to avert the "gravy train" psychosis brought on by apartheid. He said part of the code stated that any member of the organisation receiving a donation of more than R[rand]100,000 should immediately report it to the movement because the organisation did not want its senior officials to be unduly influenced. He said salaries of government ministers after April 27 would have to be commensurate with those of people in industry as there was a tendency by state officials to live beyond the means of ordinary people. On violence, Mr Mandela said politically-inspired disturbances had to be settled to ensure international investment. He said National Party [NP] leader Mr F W de Klerk was convinced he would receive the support of most whites, coloureds and Indians, and that violence would keep Africans away from polling booths and so boost the NP's chances. This was in line with NP strategy of using violence to prevent a decisive ANC victory in the election, Mr Mandela claimed. He said there was a time when the ANC was proud to proclaim it was not involved in violence, but rogue elements within self defence units [SDU] had changed this. "We must admit that discipline has broken down within some SDUs." Mr Mandela warned youths against complacency in the run-up to the elections. He said the challenge was to ensure the organisation won 67 percent of votes as indicated in some opinion polls.
