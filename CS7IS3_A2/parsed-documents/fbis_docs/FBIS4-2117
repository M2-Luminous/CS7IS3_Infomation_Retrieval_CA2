A lawyer, who originally had promised to defend Xi Yang, suddenly changed his mind and said he was not competent for the job. Nevertheless, MING PAO has stressed that it will continue its efforts in the coming days to help Xi's family to find a suitable lawyer to appeal the case. On the day before yesterday, Xi's family met with a responsible official from the China Solicitors' Office and reached a verbal agreement: A lawyer from the solicitors' office will appeal Xi's case. Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer, who had indicated he was willing to defend Xi Yang, to the court the day before yesterday, and the process of Xi's appeal was set in motion. When MING PAO chief editor Chang Hsi-hung accompanied Xi's family to sign the official agreement at the solicitors' office, the lawyer suddenly said that he was not competent for the job, without giving any specific reason. It has been reported that a responsible official from the solicitors' office did not want the lawyer to take on the job of defending Xi Yang. When Xi's family presented the name of the lawyer to the court on Monday [4 April], a court official revealed that Xi Yang had said two things regarding the search for a lawyer: First, his family should try to get a lawyer for him; and, second, if his family is unsuccessful, the court may do so on his behalf. The court official also said that, if the lawyer invited by the family cannot attend the court for personal or other reasons, he will naturally lose the opportunity to defend Xi Yang. The court will then have to assign a lawyer to defend Xi Yang. Xi's family nonetheless still wanted to try to find a lawyer for Xi Yang. Despite the setbacks encountered in their search for a lawyer, Xi's family said that they will do their utmost to find a qualified lawyer in the next day or two to defend Xi Yang. Xi Yang's father, who is currently hospitalized, appealed to the authorities to allow him to meet his son Xi Yang in the course of the appeal and let him attend the second trial as an observer. Xi Yang's father also expressed his hope that Hong Kong's National People's Congress [NPC] deputies or Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] members could attend the trial as observers.
