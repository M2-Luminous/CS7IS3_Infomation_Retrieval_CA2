The agreement related to their bilateral trade in cotton, wool, and man-made fibre textiles and textile products. The accord was signed in Washington Friday [28 January]. The textile agreement contains the liberalization of various products, and the possibility of growth in non-traditional categories. The agreement also removes all quantitative limits to textile imports from Macao, aside from wool items. A press communique issued by the Macao Government stresses that the extended agreement offers better access to the U.S. market not only for garment products but also for woven fabrics. The U.S. has and continued to be Macao's prime export market. During the first ten months last year, the U.S. absorbed 33.7 percent of Macao's total export volume, which stood at 3.9 billion Macao patacas (about 487 million U.S. dollars).
