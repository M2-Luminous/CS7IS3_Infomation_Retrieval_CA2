But at the same time the Liberals are holding steady. Every three weeks in advance of the European Parliament election the Gallup Institute has conducted a survey on popular support for the parties and lists currently in the running. The poll shows that 59 percent of the voters have now decided to vote for a particular party or list, and this is a clear rise in relation to the corresponding poll conducted 10 days earlier in which 51 percent had decided on a party. Not surprising, the share who are still in doubt has at the same time fallen from 35 to 29 percent of voters. The poll shows that the SDP is now looking at a significant gain, both in relation to preceding poll and to the European Parliament election in 1989. In that year the SDP got 23.3 percent of the votes, and this is also where the party stood in the poll of 15 May. In the current survey, the party has an 8-percent gain -- to a strong 31 percent of voters. Accordingly, the SDP has gained the support among many who only recently have made their party selection. It is interesting that the SDP is just as strong among both yes and no voters who had decided on a party in the European Union [EU] referendum of 18 May 1993. Among yes voters, the party gets 31 percent, while among no voters it gets 30 percent. The election's big winner, however, still appears to be the Liberals. In the preceding Gallup poll, that party had 28 percent of votes among those who had decided on a party, and an equally large share supports the party in the current poll. But it can accordingly be said that Liberal voters decided early on this party, and for many people this was surely because of the Liberals' clear stance on the EU. Specifically, the party has very strong support among those who voted yes in the 1993 EU referendum. Some 39 percent of the yes voters from 1993 who had chosen a party then will vote for the Liberals this time, while only 9 percent of the referendum no voters intend to cast their ballot for the party this time. [passage omitted] The statistical margin of error in these polls is between 1 and 3 percent, so that it is smallest for the parties with less support and largest for parties with more support. [passage omitted] SDP Storming Ahead for EU Election Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (SDP) has fresh ammunition when he shows up to wrestle Liberals' Chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen [for a debate] on TV 2. The prime minister can brag about an especially strong poll gain for his party just three weeks before the election to the European Parliament. [passage omitted] "This is fantastically neat," says Frank Jensen, the party political spokesman. He is not in doubt that the gain is especially due to the prime minister's performance in the TV duel with Ellemann-Jensen last week. At the same time, he also thinks that the SDP campaign has begun to have an effect. "The TV debate showed that the prime minister can deliver the goods despite Uffe's effective debating style. At the same time, it is clear that it is no longer just a matter of yes or no for the EU," says Jensen. The poll moreover underlines that the Liberal Party is the main opponent of the SDP. The Liberals held steady at 28 percent, compared with 16.6 percent in the 1989 election. Generally all others declined. Of the 1,597 interviewed, 59 percent had decided on a party. This is 8 percent more than 10 days ago. The poll was conducted 13-23 May 1994, during which a representative sample of 1,597 eligible Danish voters were contacted by phone. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |"How will you vote in the election for the European Parliament on 9 June?"
