"There is no question of being uncooperative," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin, who touted China's preference for a "moderately-worded" presidential council statement as the best step towards a peaceful resolution of the Korean crisis. "We stand for a moderately worded, constructive presidential Security Council statement that is designed to facilitate the parties concerned ... to resume dialogue on this question," Wu said. "This is a well-considered position," he added. His remarks came after China split with the rest of the council members Wednesday over the form and substance of a warning to North Korea over its suspected nuclear bomb programme. Western powers, especially the United States, have pushed hard for a binding resolution that would promise further action--a thinly veiled reference to possible economic sanctions--against North Korea over its failure to give International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors access to all its nuclear facilities. Exerting pressure on Pyongyang "can only deteriorate the atmosphere and aggravate the problem," Wu stressed. "Therefore we do not accept a Security Council resolution," he said, adding that China's insistence on a presidential statement "represents an effort to facilitate the resumption of dialogue." Wu, who declined to specify whether China would veto any UN resolution, called on the parties concerned "to demonstrate patience and cool-headedness" given the potential threat to regional stability posed by the volatile situation on the Korean peninsula. China's rejection of a binding resolution effectively scotched plans for a Security Council warning to be issued to North Korea late Thursday, as non-aligned council member states called for more time to reach a consensus on a message that could receive unanimous support.
