Shokhin Does Not Care for Glazyev's Position"] [Text] Yesterday two news conferences on economic policy at the level of top government officials were held in Moscow. First Viktor Gerashchenko met with journalists in the Central Bank on the occasion of State Bank Day (old style). In the White House [Vice Premier] Aleksandr Shokhin, in the company of Deputy Finance Ministers Aleksashenko and Kazmin; Tax Service chief Vladimir Gusev; and Mr. Gerashchenko, who arrived hurriedly in his Zil limousine straight from the Central Bank, at 1210 began to take questions from the newsmen. In the White House, several subjects were discussed, the most urgent among which was the extent of the government's involvement in drafting presidential edicts. Shokhin stated that its participation has been more than substantial, stressing that in the future the cabinet will be more actively promoting its work because otherwise "others will do so." The edicts themselves, according to Shokhin, were the result of a six-hour meeting between the president and the premier. Commenting on the edicts, Shokhin confirmed the need to spell out the foreign policy edict with government resolutions. According to him, the edict's interpretation is so far being drafted within the framework of one document, but if it becomes impossible to incorporate the commentaries in one, several resolutions will then be issued on the subject. Viktor Gerashchenko, commenting on the Central Bank's participation in drafting the edicts, stated that it has been considerable, denying media reports about his opposition. At the same time, according to him, at the final stage of drafting the first package some deplorable inconsistencies had slipped into the edicts. More specifically, Viktor Gerashchenko said that permission to withdraw sums from deposit accounts before term as a way to overcome the nonpayments problem could seriously harm the banking system. Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko, at journalists' request, expressed the Finance Ministry's opinion on the development of inflationary processes. According to him, the decisions made will not lead to a growth in inflation before the end of summer; it will stay at the May level of 7-9 percent, and in December it could fall to 5 percent provided the current anti-inflation policy continues and there are no serious incidents. Unemployment growth, according to Finance Ministry predictions, will continue to creep. Shokhin also commented on the battle around the budget in the State Duma. He fully rejects the position of Sergey Glazyev, who heads the Duma's Economic Policy Committee and proposes respectively to add 30 trillion rubles in revenues and expenditures into the budget. In his opinion, Glazyev's position is counterproductive: The revenues he counts on are hypothetical. And this means that should there be a shortage, the government will have to sequester expenditures. Aleksandr Shokhin has no doubt that as a result, this will affect not the lobbyists -- who "will get what they want anyway" -- but the social sphere and education. Shokhin relates more favorably to the position by budget committee chairman Mikhail Zadornov who, according to the vice premier, is ready to draw up a "mini-budget" with possible additional revenues: Under the project, the first three trillion of "surplus" money will go to the military industrial complex; the next, to the social sphere, and so forth. Shokhin also spoke about the results of a government delegation's visit to China where possibilities of interstate long- term investment cooperation were considered. In particular this included the construction of five thermal power stations, talks about which have been going on for a long time; a bid for the construction of a hydro-power station on the Yangtze river, where Russia has good chances for success; and also the problem of mutual payments. On the latter question the Chinese side, according to the vice premier, has not as yet granted Russian trading companies access to the national currency, the yuan, but included a proposal in corresponding protocols on recognizing trading firms' right to choose their intermediaries. This should expedite the solution of the problem of quality and mix of goods, even if supplied by a limited number of trading agents. Shokhin believes that Russia can use the experience of Chinese free economic zones in the Maritime region and in the Baltics. Both news conferences discussed lifting restrictions on foreign bank activity in Russia. Speaking at the Central Bank, Gerashchenko stated that "today work is under way on new `rules of the game' for foreign banks in Russia. The Central Bank has a deadline -- 8 June -- before which time a law has to be drafted." Aleksandr Shokhin, speaking in the White House, said that an agreement with the European Council could be signed on 13 June because the uranium issue has already been resolved. According to him, restrictions on foreign banks are to be gradually lifted (within three to five years). According to Gerashchenko (speaking at the Central Bank), there is still a limitation on foreign banks' aggregate share in Russia's banking capital -- 12 percent. "The size of the limit itself, however -- 10 percent or 15 percent -- is not of a matter of principle," the Central Bank chairman stated.
