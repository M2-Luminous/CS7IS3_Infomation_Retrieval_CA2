FR941130-0-00063 FR941130-0-00008 PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION 29 CFR Part 2609 RIN 1212&hyph;AA64 Debt Collection by Administrative Offset AGENCY: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') is amending its regulations to provide for debt collection by administrative offset. The procedures in this rule implement administrative offset, as authorized by the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended by the Debt Collection Act of 1982, and in accordance with standards prescribed by the Comptroller General of the United States and the Attorney General of the United States. The PBGC believes that adoption of this rule will enhance its debt collection ability. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Catherine B. Klion, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;4026, 202&hyph;326&hyph;4024 (202&hyph;326&hyph;4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.) SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program under title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301 et seq .). In conjunction with the pension plan termination insurance program, persons (including organizations and entities) incur various types of debts to the PBGC, and the PBGC incurs various types of liabilities (including contractual obligations). The PBGC anticipates that administrative offset will enhance its debt collection ability because persons owing debts to the PBGC sometimes receive payments from federal government agencies ( e.g. , in connection with government contracts). (As was stated in the preamble to the proposed administrative offset rule, the PBGC generally will not offset against plan benefits.) Administrative offset is defined as ``withholding money payable by the United States Government to, or held by the Government for, a person to satisfy a debt the person owes the Government'' (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1)). The Debt Collection Act of 1982, which amended the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701, et seq.), authorizes the collection of debts owed to the United States by administrative offset (31 U.S.C. 3716). Before collecting a claim by administrative offset, the head of an agency must prescribe regulations on administrative offset based on the best interests of the United States Government, the likelihood of collecting a claim by administrative offset, and, for collecting a claim by administrative offset after the six-year period for bringing a civil action on a claim under 28 U.S.C. 2415 has expired, the cost-effectiveness of leaving a claim unresolved for more than six years (31 U.S.C. 3716(b)). The Comptroller General of the United States and the Attorney General have amended the Federal Claims Collections Standards (``FCCS'') (4 CFR parts 101 through 105) to implement the Debt Collection Act of 1982. Part 102 of those regulations prescribe standards for debt collection by administrative offset. The procedures prescribed in this rule are consistent with applicable provisions of those regulations.
