FBIS4-57702 "drlat100_b_94009" FBIS-LAT-94-100 Daily Report 23 May 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Employers Organizations Condemn Provisional Government Employers Organizations Condemn Provisional Government FL2305193094 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole in French 1045 GMT 23 May 94 FL2305193094 Port-au-Prince Radio Metropole French BFN [Text] Two Haitian private sector employers organizations have condemned the appointment of Judge Emile Jonassaint as president of the Republic. The two organizations -- the Haitian Manufacturer's Association, or ADIH, and the Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy -- have demanded that the Governors Island agreement and New York pact be implemented and respected. ADIH's executive council officially rejects the appointment of Judge Jonassaint and his de facto government and, until President Aristide appoints a new prime minister, recognizes as a legitimate government only the resigning government headed by Robert Malval. In a press release, ADIH's executive council urges the other sectors of the national life to take a stand to obtain a return to constitutionality immediately and without delay. As for the Center for Free Enterprise and Democracy, which has denounced the unconstitutionality of the Jonassaint government, it also denounced -- and I quote -- the immorality of Security Council Resolution No. 917 and the discrimination and hypocrisy of U.S. policy toward the Haitian refugees. This center, which reminds the Army that under the Constitution, it has the duty to protect lives and property, also urges President Aristide to immediately appoint a new prime minister. Finally, this center asks all the protagonists in the crisis, both civilian and military, to exhibit public-spiritedness and patriotism so as to spare the nation the shame of a military intervention.
