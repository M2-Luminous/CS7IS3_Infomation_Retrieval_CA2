"Our information indicates that the first shots were fired at the Zulus. There is no evidence that the marchers started shooting," said Witwatersrand police liaison officer Colonel David Bruce. Initial investigations showed that there were people placed in buildings who were assigned to shoot at the crowd, he said. "It appears that certain elements were planted to cause trouble. They didn't care who they hit. They fired indiscriminately." More information which pointed to planned acts of terrorism was passed on to WEEKEND STAR this week. Defence analyst Helmoed Romer-Heitman said witnesses had seen a number of men entering buildings around the Library Gardens with bags that could have concealed weapons. "Several people who work in the area and who get to their offices early in the morning apparently saw men they had not seen before going into buildings along the route and around the Library Gardens, carrying bags," he said. The second piece of information concerned at least 10 bullet holes blasted through thick steel girders in the Library Gardens. They seemed to indicate that weaponry of a much heavier calibre than would normally be available to ordinary citizens was used. Most of the shots, which left holes a centimetre in diameter, went right through the 14 mm-thick steel structures supporting a mezzanine floor above shops overlooking Library Gardens. Forensics expert Dr David Klatzow, "who was commissioned by WEEKEND STAR to examine the holes, concluded that the bullets were almost exclusively full metal jacket. This means they would have been fully encased in metal, enabling them to pierce most armour plating. According to Klatzow, they could have been fired from either R-1 or AK-47 rifles. Klatzow said the shots were probably fired from the direction of the public toilets overlooking Library Gardens. Commenting on the SAP's [South African Police] use of R-1s, Bruce said it was useless to equip policemen with handguns in an attack like that on Monday. "You've got people shooting up there and you've got a .32 -- what use is that?" Asked what the police had done to prepare for the Zulu march, he said they had been prepared for a meeting, not a march. "We have no doubt that the investigation will reveal that the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and the ANC will have to shoulder some blame for Monday's crisis," said Bruce. "What we find most pertubing is that there are people who have said they saw what happened, but they don't want to come to the police. "We must have eyewitness accounts so that we can ensure this doesn't happen again -- and we can't do it alone."
