Special messages from His Majesty the King of Cambodia and the Secretary General of the United Nations were addressed to the meeting. I. Situation in Cambodia 1. The participants welcomed the establishment of the Royal Government of Cambodia in accordance with the Constitution adopted by the Constituent Assembly, whose members were chosen through the elections of May 1993, all in strict conformity with the agreements on a comprehensive political settlement of the Cambodia conflict. They paid high and respective tribute to His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, king of Cambodia, for his eminent leadership in successfully completing the peace process. They expressed their most sincere wishes for his rapid recovery and his return to his people as soon as possible. 2. The participants unanimously expressed their full support to the only legitimate government of Cambodia and to its two prime ministers, His Royal Highness Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his Excellency Mr. Hun Sen, in their joint efforts for national reconciliation and peace in Cambodia. They expressed their hope that through these efforts Cambodia will fully recover its stability, prosperity and security throughout its territory. II. Necessity for Enhanced International Assistance 3. The participants paid respectful attention to His Majesty the King's message addressed to the meeting and fully took note of the priority sectors and activities mentioned in his message. 4. The participants shared the view that the reconstruction of the devastated national economy is the chief and indispensable component for achieving peace, stability and national reconstruction, and thus, constitutes an integral part of the implementation of the Paris peace accords. The international community which has fully committed itself to the peace process should strengthen its assistance to the reconstruction of Cambodia in order to consolidate the fruits of the peace process. 5. The participants welcomed the reports by the Cambodian delegation and the international organizations on the progress in Cambodia's economic reform policy. They particularly took note of the further progress in transition to market economy and trade liberalization as well as the enhanced tax revenue and the reduction of monetary financing of the budget which resulted in improved macroeconomic stability, namely reduced inflation rates and stable exchange rates. They shared the view that such determined and substantial adjustment efforts should continue and deserve strengthened international assistance. 6. The main source of Cambodia's medium-term economic growth and reduction of poverty resides in the agricultural sector. Particular emphasis should be put on the development of this sector as well as on the improvement of the infrastructure, especially the transport and water infrastructure, which will create a greater capacity for economic growth. This will also enable the benefits of growth to spread throughout the country. In this connection, with a view to promoting the development of human resources, the participants stressed the need to formulate long-term policies for sustainable development of the basic social sectors, giving priority to health and education, while at the same time meeting the most pressing requirements. They concurred that well-targeted and well-coordinated international assistance, taking fully into account these priorities, and implemented with the participation of the beneficiaries, is called for. The participants stressed the vulnerable position of women in their double roles as mothers and income-providers and that these double roles have to be taken into account both in formulating development strategies and in the implementation of projects. 7. In this respect, the participants recognized that capacity building involving equal attention to the contributions of women is of crucial importance in achieving market-oriented reforms, in pursuing the goal of reconstruction in a coordinated manner and in effectively absorbing international aid. In this regard, they commended the continuing efforts of the ADB and the UNDP in the implementation, in close association with the IMF, of the technical assistance for strengthening marco-economic management. They reaffirmed that this is an area requiring full and sustained international assistance, particularly technical assistance. 8. The participants noted with satisfaction the joint statement by the UN resident coordinator on behalf of all UN agencies resident in Cambodia as it demonstrates the increasingly coordinated approach adopted by these agencies in support of Cambodia's reconstruction and development efforts. III. Financial Requirements of Cambodia 9. The participants highly appreciated the government's efforts for preparing its strategy document entitled "The National Program To Rehabilitate and Develop Cambodia." 10. The participants commended the World Bank for its intensive efforts to harmonize its economic work with the need for support to ICORC, in particular by preparing a comprehensive report on the economic situation in Cambodia describing priority projects and programs in all the sectors of Cambodia's development and reconstruction, and by assisting the chair in compiling pledges made by the participants. 11. The donors expressed their full and clear support to the ambitious economic and social development and reform program elaborated by the Cambodian authorities and pledged a total amount of approximately 486 million U.S. dollars of aid projects and programs for 1994. 12. The participants welcomed the progress in the discussions between the IMF and the Cambodian Government on a policy framework paper leading to a loan program under an ESAF [Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility] arrangement of approximately 120 million dollars over 1994-1996. They also welcomed the intention of the World Bank to extend a new structural adjustment lending of approximately 60 million dollars provided that an agreement is reached on the medium-term reform policy. They also noted the ADB's operational program which envisages a lending level for the medium- term (1994-1997) amounting to about 266 million dollars. IV. Specific Issues 13. The participants acknowledged that mines are one of the serious obstacles to the reconstruction efforts of Cambodia. They recognized the urgency of demining to free land for the resettlement of refugees for the expansion of agriculture and for the reduction of mine casualties. They acknowledged that the Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC) continued to need international assistance and support through funding and/or provision of experts. They strongly condemned any laying of new mines. Based on this recognition, an amount of 5.4 million dollars had already been deposited in the UNDP Trust Fund. New pledges of approximately 15 million dollars have been announced as assistance to CMAC through various channels including the UNDP Trust Fund or NGO [nongovernmental organization] projects. In addition the UNDP is financing a capacity building program from its own resources amounting to 800,000 dollars. Some countries announced plans to dispatch experts. It is expected that a total of 30 technical advisers will be in the field. 14. The participants shared the view that the international community, in the spirit of Rio declaration and acting in conformity with the recent International Action Plans and Agreements on the Environment, including Agenda 21 and Framework Convention on Climate Change, should cooperate and strengthen aspects of environment protection in their assistance program. They welcomed the first participation of Cambodia in the Ninth Session of International Negotiating Committee for a Framework Convention on Climate Change in February. They encouraged the Mekong Secretariat and other bilateral and multilateral agencies to continue and enhance their present efforts in the environmental sector. Particular attention should be paid to the conservation of the water, flora and fauna of the Tonle-Sap Lake and its surroundings as well as to the proper management of the tropical forests in Cambodia. In this regard they welcomed the intention of the Government of Cambodia to become a member of the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO). 15. The participants welcomed the appointment of a special representative of the secretary general of the United Nations pursuant to Resolution 1993/6 of the Commission of Human Rights. They shared the view that the establishment of the Cambodia field office of the United Nations Human Rights Center, with the agreement of the Cambodian Government, was important, in the present juncture, and that it should be properly funded in order to enhance respect for human rights as well as for the rule of law. 16. The participants congratulated the NGO's, both foreign and Cambodian, on their important role in the development of Cambodia in the past and expressed the hope that this would continue and expand in the future. V. Next meeting 17. The participants agreed that the next ICORC meeting will be held in Paris, hosted by France next year. The participants underlined the importance of ICORC as a gathering to give political impetus to the international assistance to Cambodia. The participants also urged the World Bank to bring, in connection with the other international agencies, a strong technical support to reinforce the effectiveness of the international assistance, having in mind the constitution, in due course, of a consultative group.
