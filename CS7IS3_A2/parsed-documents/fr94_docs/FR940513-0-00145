FR940513-0-00145 FR940513-0-00034 Some comments that opposed mandatory cost disclosures recognized that manufacturers might want to disclose some cost information voluntarily in point-of-sale materials. 120 Several comments recommended that the Commission regulate how cost disclosures on packaging or in point-of-sale materials should be made, if the manufacturer wishes to make them. Of these, some recommended that the Commission require manufacturers to disclose the product usage period and energy cost assumptions upon which their cost claims were based. 121 Other comments suggested that the Commission should prescribe standardized assumptions for any voluntarily-made operating cost disclosures. 122 120 Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2; LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 4 (contending that the information necessary to make informed purchasing decisions between two lamps of different efficiencies and price takes two forms: Total operating costs, and total life-cycle costs. ``Since electricity rates vary considerably by region, hours of lamp usage vary by consumer, and retail price depends on factors outside the manufacturers' influence, it is difficult to present this information on a product label. However, guidelines should be established by the Commission for presentation of these quantities in point-of-purchase information to avoid confusing or inaccurate claims in product advertising.''); SCS, GG&hyph;16, 4&hyph;5. 121 NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 25 note ** (``NEMA believes that the Commission should not mandate specific assumptions that must be used in voluntary cost disclosures. Rather, the Commission should require that manufacturers who choose to make disclosures must disclose their assumptions about the cost of electricity and annual hours of lamp use.''); Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 1 (``Any such (voluntary operating cost) disclosures should be based on substantiated test data and any assumptions (should be) disclosed on the package.''). 122 See Angelo (Tr.), 136, 157 (suggesting that the Commission set a standard to avoid one manufacturer using 10 cents per kWh and another using 15 cent per kWh), 158; GE (Tr.), 170 (``We do agree that if cost of operation is going to be optionally claimed on a package, then it is a good idea to have a standard set of assumptions.''), 170&hyph;72 (cautioning that, unless the required assumptions are keyed into flexible marketplace standards, there is a risk of their becoming outdated, which would undermine credibility and inhibit the main goal: Consumers switching from general service incandescent lamps to compact fluorescent lamps); Green Seal (Tr.), 159 (``*␣*␣* I think it makes sense, therefore, to lay out what the assumptions are and once that is done, there is a standard.''); Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 2 (supports development of a common set of criteria for operating cost disclosures on lamp packages where the manufacturer chooses to display them, and suggests basing disclosures in meantime on 1100 hours use per year and 10 cents per kilowatt-hour). The Commission has determined not to require disclosure of operating cost information for general service incandescent (nonreflector) lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps. The Commission agrees that fluctuations in retail purchase prices for lamp products and utility company rebates make it a practical impossibility for manufacturers to disclose a meaningful total operating cost that includes purchase price. 123 The Commission also agrees that varying energy rates and consumer usage patterns would make it necessary to require computation of annual operating cost on the basis of questionable assumptions. 124 This would make it difficult, if not impossible, to provide current, accurate and meaningful annual operating cost information for prospective lamp purchasers. 125 Because purchasing decisions are likely to be made very quickly for lamps, which are relatively low-priced items, complicated disclosures involving operating costs are unlikely to be heeded by purchasers at the point of sale and may possibly be confusing. 126 Therefore, a required energy operating cost disclosure would not be useful in helping buyers make purchasing decisions. 127 123 To encourage the use of compact fluorescent lamps, some utility companies offer significant rebates to their customers for purchasing them. These offers usually accompany the consumers' utility bills, and include explanations of why compact fluorescent lamps can save energy and money. 124 Various studies have shown that 1100 operating hours per year is the average figure for a lamp in a residential setting. Osram (Tr.), 122. To use this average where the lamp a consumer actually purchases only has a 750 hour life, however, could be confusing. GE (Tr.), 155. See notes 106, 108, above. 125 Also, because the dollar cost figure on the package will not relate to what the consumer is paying for the lamp, it is likely to be confusing to consumers. Tr., 132&hyph;33, 138&hyph;39. 126 See, e.g. , NEMA, G&hyph;3, 36&hyph;37. According to GE, of industry sales of all incandescent lamps to residential purchasers in 1992, 36% were sold through mass merchants, 31% through food and grocery outlets, 22% through hardware and home center stores, 7% through drug stores and 4% through all other outlets. GE (Tr.), 105(4). Seventy eight percent of all these lamps are purchased by residential consumers walking themselves through the purchase decision, without expert assistance. GE (Tr.), 105(5). In addition, the average residential consumer spends 53 minutes total for all purchases per stop in grocery or food stores, GE (Tr.), 108, so the consumer obviously spends little time deciding which lamp to purchase in these stores. 127 In contrast, information disseminated to consumers in other ways, such as utility company bill inserts, may be more useful.
