As is well known, this tour began in Indonesia, the country leading the nonaligned movement. The Indonesian Government and the productive sectors in general have reaffirmed their willingness and desire to increase trade and cooperation with our country in several areas. Robaina's trip through that region of ancient culture is still underway, so it is premature to make an assessment, either country by country or of the mission as a whole. I believe, however, that the objective of these visits has been achieved. Cuba needs to make known to the world the true situation current in the country, and its new strategies to counteract the perverse blockade and the collapse of the European socialist bloc, particularly of the ex-Soviet Union. Our international relations also have an impact on the priorities of our economy within the context of principles. Today I would like to underscore the importance of the Cuban foreign minister's visit to India. This Asian country is one of the most heavily populated nations on earth, a multinational, multiethnic, and pluricultural country, the industry of which is extremely versatile. India and Cuba are linked by long-standing ties of friendship. As you are all well aware, both were founders of the nonaligned movement in 1961, and both countries demand the right to a dignified life for Third World nations, which implies international cooperation, trade without barriers, transfer of technology in an unrestricted manner, and respect for self-determination and national sovereignty. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro had already visited this vast nation, the culture of which spans more than four milleniums, and which was responsible for one of the earliest literary creations of man. Its great forefathers and leading figures of the modern state, beginning with Gandhi; then Nehru; later, Nehru's daughter Indira; and finally, Rajiv Gandhi, have enhanced the policy of peace, mutual understanding, and demands for the rights of neglected peoples. With all of these precedents, it is easy to assess the importance of this visit the Cuban foreign minister will begin within the next few hours to India, without minimizing, of course, the visits he already made to other countries of the region, and the visits he is still to make to other Asian countries, all of them heirs to ancestral cultures.
