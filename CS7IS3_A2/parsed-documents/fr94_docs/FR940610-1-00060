FR940610-1-00060 FR940610-1-00008 Although RDA have been established for more nutrients than indicated above, the Department has chosen to monitor only those listed because these are key nutrients that promote growth and development which are consistent with those required in the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;535). The proposal would also require schools to decrease the levels of sodium and cholesterol and increase the amount of dietary fiber in school meals. The Department is not proposing specific levels for these components, since numeric targets are not established by the current Dietary Guidelines. However, progress in this area could be assessed through a variety of ways including gradual reductions in sodium, and if necessary, cholesterol levels, and increased use of vegetables, fruits and grain products. The Department wishes to note that the Dietary Guidelines are designed for persons aged two and over. The Department will maintain current meal patterns for children in the zero to eleven months and one to two year age groups. For children who are two years old, schools will have the option of using the minimum calorie and nutrient requirements for school meals for children ages three-six or developing a separate set of nutrient and calorie levels for this age group. Finally, because compliance with the Dietary Guidelines will not be required until School Year 1998&hyph;1999, which begins July 1, 1998, the current meal patterns and quantities will be retained temporarily and will be redesignated §210.10a for the NSLP and §220.8a for the SBP. This proposal does not apply to infant meal patterns and meal supplements; therefore, the appropriate sections of the redesignated §210.10a and §220.8a will continue to be followed by schools serving infants and meal supplements. New Approaches to Menu Planning: Nutrient Standard Menu Planning and Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning Schools must currently meet a meal pattern which specifies minimum amounts (by age group) of the five food items which must be offered in order to receive reimbursement for meals. An alternate approach that provides an excellent tool for improving the nutritional quality of school meals is Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (NSMP). Under NSMP, the menu is developed through the nutrient analysis of all foods offered over a school week to ensure that meals meet specific nutrition standards for key nutrients, and meet recommended levels of fat and saturated fat. Other dietary components that will be analyzed are cholesterol, sodium and dietary fiber. However, the Department recognizes that some school food authorities may not have the computer capability or the degree of access to technical support necessary to independently conduct NSMP. In these circumstances, the Department is proposing to allow school food authorities to use a modified form of NSMP entitled Assisted Nutrient Standard Menu Planning (ANSMP). Use of ANSMP would allow development and analysis of menus by other entities while still applying the essentials of NSMP. (A more complete discussion of ANSMP may be found later in this preamble.) Under NSMP, the menu planner is expected to use effective techniques to provide menus that meet the updated nutrition standards. All menu items (i.e., any single food or combination of food) or other foods offered as part of the reimbursable meal will be counted toward meeting the nutrition standards. An exception to this is foods of minimal nutritional value, as provided for in §210.11(a)(2) or §220.12(b), which are not offered as part of a menu item in a reimbursable meal. A definition of ``menu item'' is proposed to be added to §210.2 and §220.2 to expand upon the current definitions of food item and food component that are used in various sections of the regulations concerned with point of service meal counts. The definition would also specify that one menu item offered must be an entree and one must be fluid milk. Further, as discussed later in this preamble, the Department is proposing that the entree must be selected as part of a reimbursable lunch. Menu items will be analyzed based on production levels to more accurately reflect the overall nutritional composition of the menu. Menus will be planned, analyzed for nutrient content and adjusted as needed to ensure that production and selection trends are considered and nutrition standards are met. A discussion of NSMP software programs and the National Nutrient Database for Child Nutrition Programs is provided later in this preamble. The purpose of NSMP and ANSMP is two-fold: To provide a flexible way to plan menus using certain nutrient levels, not on limited food items and amounts, and to measure how well meals are meeting nutrition standards. The Department is proposing to adopt NSMP and ANSMP by amending §210.10(k) and (l) of the regulations to incorporate NSMP and ANSMP for the NSLP and §220.8(j) and (k) for the SBP. While school meals will be expected to comply with the updated nutrition standards and to be planned through NSMP or ANSMP, the Department wishes to emphasize that compliance monitoring would stress technical assistance to enable the school to achieve the standards. While all meals offered during a menu cycle that fail to meet the established nutrition standards could technically be subject to an overclaim, the regulations will require State agencies to establish claims only when school food authorities refuse, not simply fail, to take corrective action. It is the Department's intent that every effort be made to provide nutritious meals to children rather than taking punitive actions which could undermine this initiative. Further discussion on this point may be found later in this preamble in the section on monitoring.
