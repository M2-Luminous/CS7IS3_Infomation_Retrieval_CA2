Twenty-eight criminal gangs were smashed, 110 human traffickers were arrested, and 170 women who had been abducted and trafficked in were rescued. Over the past years, some lawbreakers ganged up with one another to wantonly engage in the criminal activities of abducting and trafficking in women and children in order to reap staggering profits. The women who had been abducted and trafficked in suffered all kinds of humiliation. Some of them were even killed or cruelly injured by their buyers when they gave a strong resistance. Some of them could not withstand humiliation and committed suicide. Xia Lingfeng, who was from Yunnan, was sold to Wang Erliang, a villager of Dalumao township of Jungar Banner, for 5,000 yuan. Xia managed to run away several times. Wang Yingxiang, Wang Erliang's father, took her back and broke her legs with a bat. After disclosing this case, the Jungar Banner security bureau immediately rescued her and duly punished the buyers. Through this struggle, the broad masses of security cadres and policemen spared no hardships to conduct investigations among each village and each household, persisted in the principle of being resolute and steady, rescued all the women who asked to be rescued if discovered, and rapidly and sternly punished all the abductors and traffickers. An extraordinarily powerful criminal gang involving 69 persons with two brothers, namely Li Daichun and Li Dailin, as chief culprits, was destroyed at a time by the Togtoh County security bureau. The Hohhot city security bureau arrested a four-member criminal gang with Gan Ming as chief culprit. On 14 January, 52 women, the third group of women saved through the special struggle, got on a train back home.
