Denktas met United Nations envoy Joe Clark for a second time in two days who came to Cyprus to hold talks on confidence building measures. Denktas, speaking to reporters before starting a working lunch with Clark, urged Kliridhis to agree to meet him face-to-face to improve mutual understanding. "We have to come to a solution one way or another. Both sides have to be satisfied, we are eager for that," he said. Clark said he was not asking the two sides to declare acceptance of U.N.-proposed confidence-building measures before negotiations adding that "neither I nor the U.N. want to force anything because there has to be agreement between the parties. We have come a long way." Clark said he will leave for Ankara and Athens on Wednesday to hold contacts after meeting with Kliridhis. The Mediterranean island has been divided into Turkish and Greek Cypriot sectors since Turkey conducted a peace operation to the north in 1974 following a short-lived coup by Greeks wanting to annex Cyprus to Greece. A U.N. peacekeeping force has been in Cyprus since inter-communal fighting first broke out in 1964. The U.N. has proposed a package of measures which include reopening the deserted, Turkish-held resort of Maras [Varosha] and Lefkosa International Airport under U.N. control to try to rebuild bridges between the two sides. Denktas said last week his government agreed to resume talks on the confidence-building measures.
