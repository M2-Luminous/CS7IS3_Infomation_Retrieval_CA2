We want your opinion on the attack on the security guards of FMLN Deputy Nidia Diaz. [Vargas] These incidents, not only against Nidia Diaz, but also the kidnappings -- all these problems are deplorable and should be rejected and condemned. We cannot permit violence and the principle of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth prevail in our society. Since 16 January 1992, Salvadorans are committed to taking a totally different path. The fact that this is the second attack on this same person, specifically this same security guard, is strange. I believe this should be thoroughly investigated and that the weight of the law should fall upon those who are responsible, so that the exemplary punishment can dissuade others from acting the same way within Salvadoran society. [Reporter] Deputy Nidia Diaz mentioned the political connotations that this attack could have. As member of the Dialogue Commission, and within the framework of the Chapultepec Agreements how do you view these actions against a party like the FMLN which recently entered the country's political life? [Vargas] As I said.... [pauses] although I did not say it directly, I believe it is somewhat strange that the attack was against the same person, the same security guard who was attacked the first time. As you said, this incident warrants a thorough investigation, as it could have other connotations. Attacks that could occur at a given time which could be directly or indirectly related to political groups should be rejected; not only against the FMLN, but also against ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance) the Christian Democratic Party, the Unity Movement, the National Conciliation Party, all political parties. It is not possible for persons who disagree with each other, who have different ideas or ideologies, to react this way. This is unacceptable as a political system. I may disagree with your ideas, you may disagree with mine, but we should discuss our differences without resorting to violence. This is one of the basic principles we have established. We must exercise personal and institutional coexistence, so the process can mature and reach its maximum expression for the benefit of the entire society. [Reporter] Do you think an incident such as this can undermine politics in El Salvador? [Vargas] I would not say it could undermine politics or create a crisis. It creates an unstable political balance. This means that.... [pauses] we must remember that these are factors that go through cycles at a given time. I believe sound judgment, good sense, mutual respect, and above all prudence should guide our steps. Provocations should not produce visceral reactions because this will take us nowhere. It would take us to a polarized confrontation similar or worse to the ones we had in the past. Definitely, generations who went through that experience do not want to see the same thing happen again. In that sense, I want justice -- as the main factor to discourage actions that violate society rules -- to prevail. I believe a thorough police investigation is necessary. This case should be given more attention because there could be factors that are not political, which if not properly investigated can have repercussions in the political field, which of course would be totally undesirable.
