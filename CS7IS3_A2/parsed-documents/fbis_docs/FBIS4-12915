FBIS4-12915 "drnes072dd_94002" FBIS-NES-94-072 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 Palestinian Affairs Al-Tibi on Hadera Attack, Dialogue With Hamas Al-Tibi on Hadera Attack, Dialogue With Hamas TA1304123794 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 0935 GMT 13 Apr 94 TA1304123794 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Telephone interview with 'Arafat adviser Ahmad al-Tibi by Mikha Friedman; place not given -- live] [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Al-Tibi] With your permission, I would like to address the Hadera event. Innocent people, blameless civilians riding a civilian bus were murdered on their way from 'Afula to Tel Aviv. Murder is murder, and I repudiate this in no uncertain terms. Even if I ignore everything that happened before, murder is murder. Yet we should all remember that both sides are paying with precious blood. What started with the Hebron massacre and continued in 'Afula and in Hadera and Jericho today should motivate us all to prevent murderers from both sides from achieving their one and only purpose -- harming the peace process and the chance for compromise between the two nations. [passage omitted] I see no option other than sitting down and completing the agreement as soon as possible, in order to reduce the level of violence and terror to a minimum. As for condemnation, it must come from both sides. As I have condemned today's event, I expect to hear a condemnation of what happened in Jericho today; of the cold-blooded killing yesterday of a pregnant woman in al-Jib; of the appalling demolition of a house belonging to a senior PLO official in Ramallah, which was also intolerable, although no one was hurt. Appalling things happen on both sides, and they merit a second look even when they are carried out by the authorities. [Friedman] Dr. al-Tibi, we ran a seemingly astonishing report this morning about an ongoing dialogue in Gaza between the moderate, peace-seeking Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which is usually seen as an enemy of peace. There is talk of cooperation when autonomy is implemented there. Can you confirm it? [Al-Tibi] Local-level meetings have been held in Gaza between people from all elements. The purpose of these meetings was to avert conflicts and bloodshed among Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. No one expects the Palestinians to start killing each other, and therefore the statement issued today by one of the Hamas leaders, saying they will respect and defend the Palestinian police, is a step in the right direction. I welcome it. [Friedman] Except that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam is not a party to this dialogue. [Al-Tibi] There are clear discrepancies between the stands of the Palestinian leadership, namely the PLO, and Hamas, on the political process. It is no secret that the PLO favors continuing the political process, while Hamas is opposed to it and is even fighting it. [Friedman] Will the Palestinian police and the Palestinian security services relentlessly fight the 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam peace opponents? [Al-Tibi] Whenever I hear people call for a Palestinian civil war, I reject it categorically. [Friedman] A relentless struggle is a determined fight against those who are out to kill you too, not just me. [Al-Tibi] But the Palestinian leadership and the Palestinian national authority will do all it can to maintain order and security in a democratic fashion in the framework of the Palestinian national rule in Gaza and Jericho. [Friedman] Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi, thank you very much. [Al-Tibi] Thank you.
