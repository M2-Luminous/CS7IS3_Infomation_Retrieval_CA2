The reply follows the request from U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in late February for Japan to send personnel to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary elections, the officials said. The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and 11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit overseeing the polls in the Central American country. A peace agreement, enabling the U.N. to deploy its peace mission in El Salvador, was signed in January 1992 after a decade-long "proxy war" between the U.S.-backed right-wing government and leftist guerrillas, supported by the former Soviet Union. El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan has sent election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping Cooperation Law, after Angola and Cambodia.
