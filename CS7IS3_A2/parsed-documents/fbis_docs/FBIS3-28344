His comments came after leaders of the coalition parties agreed on a 6 trillion yen tax cut but decided to convene again Tuesday to fill in the remaining gaps on how to finance the cut. The budget bureau official, requesting anonymity, told reporters that even if a final decision is made, the ministry would have to work on a tight schedule for the budgets. The advisory tax panel to the prime minister was scheduled to submit its report on fiscal 1994 tax reform, but postponed it until Wednesday. But a tax bureau official told reporters that it would become difficult for the panel to submit the report by Wednesday, saying, "we are facing the final deadline." It is not technically impossible to announce the outline on Wednesday, if a consensus is reached at resumed talks Tuesday, he said. But he added that it has become "very difficult" to do so in view of the likely revisions in the original tax proposal. The panel recommended in a "medium-term" tax reform report last November linking in a single law an income tax cut with a consumption tax hike to offset it. The budget bureau official said if the schedule does not go smoothly, the ministry will have to put off the budget announcements until February 14 or after.
