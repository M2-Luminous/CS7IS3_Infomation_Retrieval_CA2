[Verheugen] No. There had been signs for a couple of weeks. The FDP was under very strong pressure. If anything did come as a surprise it was that Mr. Kinkel has created the impression that it is a statement without if's and but's. [Rosenbaum] Does this mean you expect a loophole in the final wording? [Verheugen] It will not really be a matter of wording in the end. I am sure that the coalition will not win a majority on 16 October and that the role that the FDP would like to play is over. It is no longer the link between the popular parties that it used to be. It has lost its position as third party. [Rosenbaum] What do you think the FDP's reaction will be if the election produces the result that you expect? [Verheugen] If the Bundestag elections produce a result that enables the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] to form a majority either with the Greens or the FDP, and if there is no longer a majority between the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] and the FDP, the FDP will not turn a deaf ear to talks. It would be very unwise to do so. [Rosenbaum] Does this mean that the SPD is counting on the FDP to be available as a coalition partner? [Verheugen] We are not counting on any coalition partners in this election campaign. We are not conducting a coalition election campaign, but we have only ruled out a grand coalition and talks with right-wing extremists, whom we will be able to prevent from entering the Bundestag, as well as with the Party of Democratic Socialism. But all the others -- and this leaves only two -- are parties that we can talk to. [Rosenbaum] How do you see the [FDP's] statement that the presidential election is not a preliminary decision for the Bundestag elections? [Verheugen] This is a piece of very interesting and important information. I think that with this decision the FDP has gained full freedom of action. For, it has achieved a situation where the presidential elections need not be seen in connection with a coalition statement. Without an FDP coalition statement or without this particular statement, an FDP decision in favor of Johannes Rau in the second or third vote in Berlin would, of course, have been considered an indication of an intended coalition change. No one can say that now. [Rosenbaum] You are counting on the FDP to vote for Rau? [Verheugen] This way the FDP could demonstrate its liberal independence and show that it does not want to be completely under the CDU's tutelage. [Rosenbaum] Do you seriously believe that you can survive without a clear coalition statement? [Verheugen] A big popular party does not have to make a coalition statement. The SPD is going into this election with the intention of becoming the strongest party, of forming the government. This means, providing the chancellor and determining the guidelines of policies. And the question of a partner, if you need one, can only be determined by evaluating how the highest possible degree of social democratic policy can be achieved. We do not want to be implementing another party's policy. I cannot see the necessity or the benefit of the SPD making a coalition statement. We will not be conducting the election campaign as one part of a party constellation against another party constellation. We are conducting the election campaign to realize our objectives. All the others are fellow candidates to whom we are not giving any presents.
