The base identified as the wing base of the terrorists and situated north of Trincomalee and to the west of Nilaveli area was overrun and destroyed without much resistance from the terrorists, according to a senior military officer in the East. The terrorists put up a token resistance and withdrew at the approach of our troops supported by the Air Force, the officer said. Several soldiers, including Special Forces personnel, were involved in the offensive codenamed (Wale Sumana), named after one of the giants in the army of Sri Lanka's ancient King (Vettigamono), which was launched late last week amidst much secrecy. The number of casualties incurred by the terrorists before their withdrawal from the area was not known, but the Army had a single casualty from an antipersonnel mine. Soldiers recovered mines, about 100 kilos of explosives, food, and other items from the terrorist base which comprised about 15 bunkers, 10 huts, a lecture room, a (?sewing) center, stores, and a dental clinic. (Wale Sumana) is the first major combined offensive to be launched by the security forces since the assuming of command by the Army commander, Lieutenant General Gerry de Silva, and also the first in 1994.
