FR941128-1-00036 FR941128-1-00005 f. Source-Receptor Relationships 1. Only one source can be modeled at a time. 2. There is no limitation to the number of receptors; the downwind receptor distances are internally calculated by the model. The SLAB calculation is carried out up to the user-specified maximum downwind distance. 3. The model contains submodels for the source characterization of evaporating pools, elevated vertical or horizontal jets, and instantaneous volume sources. g. Plume Behavior Plume trajectory and dispersion is based on crosswind-averaged mass, species, energy, and momentum balance equations. Surrounding terrain is assumed to be flat and of uniform surface roughness. No obstacle or building effects are taken into account. h. Horizontal Winds A power law approximation of the logarithmic velocity profile which accounts for stability and surface roughness is used. i. Vertical Wind Speed Not treated. j. Vertical Dispersion The crosswind dispersion parameters are calculated from formulas reported by Morgan et al. (1983), which are based on experimental data from several sources. The formulas account for entrainment due to atmospheric turbulence, surface friction, thermal convection due to ground heating, differential motion between the air and the cloud, and damping due to stable density stratification within the cloud. k. Horizontal Dispersion The horizontal dispersion parameters are calculated from formulas similar to those described for vertical dispersion, also from the work of Morgan, et al. (1983). l. Chemical Transformation The thermodynamics of the mixing of the dense gas or aerosol with ambient air (including water vapor) are treated. The relationship between the vapor and liquid fractions within the cloud is treated using the local thermodynamic equilibrium approximation. Reactions of released chemicals with water or ambient air are not treated. m. Physical Removal Not treated. n. Evaluation Studies Blewitt, D. N., J. F. Yohn, and D. L. Ermak, 1987.
