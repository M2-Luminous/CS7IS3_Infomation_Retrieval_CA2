Monde said it is immoral for U.S. President Bill Clinton to expect Haitian soldiers to stage an uprising against their generals. According to the legislator, the United States "knows" that the soldiers, not the generals, staged the coup that toppled constitutional President Jean Bertrand Aristide in September 1991. To explain the alleged immorality of Clinton's position, Monde said it is as if the United States were to encourage U.S. Marines "who are not homosexuals to rise up against Marines who are." Meanwhile, former Senate President Dejean Belizaire said the issue of exile for the military is a form of bait. "We must not lose the country's sovereignty," Belizaire said. The right-wing organization "Capois La Mort" said, regarding the establishment of the U.S. radio station, that the Armed Forces should not "yield to blackmail." Likewise, according to Monde, the mission of Duly Brutus, former president of the Chamber of Deputies, and Deputy Datus Milcent, who traveled to Washington on Sunday as guests of the "Heritage Foundation," is to denounce the plan to invade Haiti and prove the "negative influence" William Gray, Clinton's adviser on the Haitian crisis, has had on U.S.-Haitian policy. Brutus and Milcent will meet with three former U.S. secretaries of state and members of Congress during their visit to Washington. "Gray has no credibility to negotiate the crisis the country is experiencing because of the circumstances under which he left Congress," Monde argued, although he did not mention what the motives were. In his opinion, Gray "hides under President Aristides' table and obeys every word he says." " On the other hand, since this past Monday, the Haitian banks began to apply one of the measures imposed by the U.S. Government by limiting the delivery of funds sent by Haitians from their relatives living in the United States to $40. This measure has caused dissatisfaction among the Haitians who survive on the funds their relatives send. In addition, the Haitian banks advised their clients that they could no longer use credit card services. On the other hand, the "Haiti Trans Air" airlines, which has regular flights between Port-au-Prince and Miami, announced today that its last flight to U.S. territory would be on 24 June as a result of the measures adopted by President Clinton, who unilaterally decided to suspend flights between both nations. With Haitian Trans Air discontinuing flights, a measure also to be supported shortly by "American Airlines," only "Air France" will cover the Port-au-Prince journey, with a stopover on Guadeloupe island, three times a week, and to Santo Domingo once a week. As result of the situation, hundreds of travelers remain in the Port-au-Prince airport trying to arrange a flight out of the country before the commercial flight suspension declared by President Clinton enters into effect this weekend. Similarly, Emmanuelle Constant, head of the Front for Haiti's Advance and Progress (FRAPH), reiterated today that the foreigners currently in Haiti are in no danger. According to Constant, the majority of those foreigners are still in the country and have not heeded the calls to abandon Haiti made by the United States and Canada, which he believes is evidence that they are not in any danger.
