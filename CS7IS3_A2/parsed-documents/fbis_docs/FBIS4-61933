In that case the president would only be the head of state and not the head of state and government as today, Chernovil told a news conference in Kiev on Tuesday. He said it would hardly be possible to postpone the presidential election, something proposed by President Leonid Kravchuk, because a motion to that effect would need the support of at least 170 legislators and because the preparations for the 26 June election "have already gone too far." Nevertheless Chernovil expects the matter to be brought up at one of initial parliament sessions. At the same time, he said he considered it "immoral" to hold a presidential election before the legislature delineated the future president's powers. Chernovil said his party would not propose its own candidate to the post of parliamentary speaker "unless the Communists nominate their own candidate." According to the Central Electoral Commission, Rukh has won 20 seats in the new parliament, or 5.9 percent of the total number.
