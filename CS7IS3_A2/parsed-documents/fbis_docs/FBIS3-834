The Action and Progress [Generation Action Progres] party was inaugurated at the International House in Porto-Novo this morning. In his welcome address, the party chairman, lawyer Yves Edgar Monou, took stock of the country's 33 years of independence which were marked by failure and success as well as unrest and peace, and this raises questions and requires sober reflection. According to Monou, Beninese should stop destroying their own genius and strive for the consolidation of the current democratic process which they invented in Africa. The whole Beninese people must change their mentality and behavior. Let us listen to Lawyer Monou: [Begin recording] We must change our mentality and make a new national and patriotic interest one of our major concerns. From now on, our daily concern should be how to come together as an individual and advance, always advance, relentlessly and (?straight) on the path of progress. We should also strive to make our youth the true spearhead of our country. In short, we should draw lessons from past mistakes and resolutely turn to the future and prove the relevance of the thought of Oscar Wilde, an English author of the last century, who said that youth is the only valuable asset.
