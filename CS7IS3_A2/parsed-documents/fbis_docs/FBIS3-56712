Viktor Chernomyrdin Has Had a Lunch With Senators] [Text] Ramazan Abdulatipov, first deputy chairman of the State Committee on Federal Affairs and former speaker of the House of Nationalities in the former Russian Federation Supreme Soviet, has become deputy head of the Russian senate. He received 117 votes out of 156 in the Federation Council. Informed sources say that there was covert agreement between Ramazan Abdulatipov and Vladimir Shumeyko whereby the former speaker of the House of Nationalities must not obstruct the first deputy premier's taking the chairman's spot. It is no wonder that after his victory Vladimir Shumeyko offered Ramazan Abdulatipov the post of his deputy on nationalities affairs. The second deputy chairman of the Russian senate (in charge of industry and agriculture) is Valeryan Viktorov, chairman of the Chuvashia Council of Ministers. For him the new post is an opportunity to avoid a highly likely resignation which could follow the inauguration of Chuvashia's first president, Nikolay Fedorov. The post of the third deputy chairman of the Federation Council was contested by Vladimir Shumeyko's main rival for the chair of speaker in the upper parliament chamber, Petr Romanov, director of the Krasnoyarsk-based Yenisey chemical plant; and Aleksandr Kovalev, head of the Voronezh Oblast administration. Neither of them polled the requisite number of votes. Therefore Vladimir Shumeyko proposed that the election of his third deputy be moved to the next session of the upper parliament chamber. In between the election of the deputy the Russian senators discussed a list of committees in the upper house. At 1340 the session was interrupted. Government chairman Viktor Chernomyrdin invited the heads of the Russian regions to lunch. It will be recalled that on 13 January Viktor Chernomyrdin had lunch with the heads of the krays, oblasts, and republics, persuading them to vote for Vladimir Shumeyko as speaker of the Russian senate. The meeting between the regional leaders and the chairman of the Russian Government lasted for two hours. According to one of the participants in the meeting, Victor Chernomyrdin stated that all the requisite powers must be transferred to the regions. He told the heads of the republics that especially to this end, a government commission is being set up headed by Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov which is to discuss and map out ways to address the problems involved in relations between the center and regions, primarily those concerned with the budget and finances. According to another participant in the meeting, the Yarov commission will include two representatives from eight interregional economic associations. In a goodwill gesture Viktor Chernomyrdin said that as of now the institution of the Russian Federation president's representatives in the krays, oblasts, and republics is abolished. A corresponding edict will be promulgated shortly. Viktor Chernomyrdin told the regional leaders that the composition of the new government will be announced on 18 January. Apart from the ministries five committees will remain in the government, including the State Property Management Committee. Responding to complaints by the regional leaders about the state's debts and problems of mutual financial settlements and payments, Victor Chernomyrdin said that a draft decree on the agriculture sector is pending whereby the state will settle its debts with agricultural producers (400 billion rubles) and make available credits for spring field work. Furthermore Viktor Chernomyrdin promised to set up a special commission to speed up settlements within Russian's banking system and thereby resolve the problem of mutual clearance. It is noteworthy that Viktor Chernomyrdin did not say a single word about the election of Vladimir Shumeyko as chairman of the upper chamber.
