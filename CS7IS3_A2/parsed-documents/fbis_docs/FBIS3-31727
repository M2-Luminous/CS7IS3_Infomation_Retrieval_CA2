The sides agreed that parties whose candidates cannot enter the second round because they received insufficient votes would support the candidate of the four parties to the agreement who won the most votes in the first round. Inasmuch as candidates of several parties from those signing the agreement reach the second round, the number of votes cast for the candidates of the signatory parties will determine who will step down in favor of another candidate. The parties will ensure that details of the agreement and the rules for stepping down be approved by their candidates.
