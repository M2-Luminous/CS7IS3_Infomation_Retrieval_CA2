[passage omitted] It has been proven to the world that the concept of security for the Palestinians in the occupied territories must be the basis of negotiations if they are to succeed. It has also been proven that settlements are time bombs and a source of threat to any future peace agreement. Hence, the call to dismantle the settlements and place the entire settlement issue on the talks' agenda. We say that it has been proven to the world that these facts are known not only to the Palestinians but to anyone who has even a superficial knowledge of the situation on the ground. After this convincing evidence to the world and the U.S. Administration's continued behavior as if nothing has happened, the outcome is that the peace process cannot continue in its present form. If the PLO insists that the peace process in its present form has reached a dead end, and if Israel and the United States insist on continuing the peace process, the logical conclusion is that the peace process has practically ended. Israel and the United States are trying to seek ways out, but plainly solutions are needed. What would have happened if the PLO had an armed security presence in Gaza and Jericho when the Hebron massacre occurred? The thought of this or other scenarios, such as whether the Palestinian security forces would have participated in the protests, tried to control the protests, or refrained from doing anything, can lead to destructive results. Settlements are not only a huge obstacle to peace, but easily detonated land mines planted between every inch of the same land on which peace must prevail. If the present situation continues, the end of the peace process will have immense and grave repercussions not only among Palestinians but also in the region as a whole. And if the United States keeps exerting direct and indirect pressure on the Palestinian leadership in a bid to renew the talks for the sake of talks, the results of this pressure will have destructive effects on the peace process. The statement by President 'Arafat to NEWSWEEK to the effect that the Palestinian people will not accept to continue the talks in the form that existed before the massacre is best proof that the crisis has gone beyond the stage of pressure. It is inconceivable for anyone to expect the Palestinian leadership to lose the support and backing of its people and also lose the chance of making a genuine peace. The U.S. and Israeli leaderships must examine for the fourth, fifth, and tenth time the Palestinian demands presented to them on Friday morning, 25 February 1994.
