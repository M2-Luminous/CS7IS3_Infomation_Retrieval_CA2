Reacting to that step, the Ukrainian military commanders, the officers in the brigade, resolutely disagree with any unilateral actions aimed at changing the status of the formation. In a statement adopted at a general meeting, the officers and warrant officers demanded that a political decision should be adopted as soon as possible on the future of the Black Sea Fleet, on the basis of which the fate of each of them could be determined. At the same time they warned that, until such a decision is adopted, they will stop any attempts to unlawfully seize the ships or other facilities belonging to the brigade.
