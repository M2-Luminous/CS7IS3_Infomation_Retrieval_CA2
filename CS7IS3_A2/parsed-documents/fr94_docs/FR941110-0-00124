FR941110-0-00124 FR941110-0-00016 In keeping with this responsibility, we are strengthening §488.332 by requiring that, if arrangements have been made with other State components for investigation of complaints, the State must have a means of communicating information among appropriate entities, and the State survey agency retains responsibility for the investigation process. Also, we are adding a paragraph to §488.335 requiring that State survey agencies consider complaints of neglect, abuse or misappropriation of resident property by an individual used by a facility to provide services to residents as a potential reflection on a facility's compliance with Medicaid and/or Medicare participation requirements. Comment: Some commenters expressed concern about the use of an attorney on a specialized investigation team. Response: The Act, at sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4), refers to an ``attorney'' as well as other professions (auditor, appropriate health care professionals) to describe examples of various disciplines that may be used to make up specialized teams to investigate violations of requirements by nursing facilities or skilled nursing facilities and, in a broader sense, to monitor all facilities for compliance with the requirements of sections 1819(b), (c), and (d) and 1919(b), (c), and (d) of the Act. We did not intend that attorneys be a routine part of such teams; however, the language of the Act and proposed rules gives States a broad choice of occupations from which to choose for the survey and certification process. Comment: Several commenters requested that a facility have prior notice of a complaint investigation to notify its attorney in those instances when an attorney is part of the specialized complaint investigation team. Response: Notifying a facility in advance of a complaint survey so that its attorney might be present is, in fact, announcing the survey. To do so is inconsistent with HCFA policy, which intends that as many surveys as possible be unannounced. Comment: A few commenters identified specific areas of concern in the complaint investigation process. These concerns stemmed from the general comment that the complaint investigation team may not have proper training. Response: We appreciate the concern of these commenters who recognize that the investigation and resolution of complaints is a critical certification activity requiring properly trained investigators, and we will consider these concerns as we strive to continually improve our training courses. However, we believe that the expertise of a special investigation team and the overall State survey agency responsibility for complaint investigations provides a coordinated effort that assures that the complaint investigation process is executed by properly trained individuals. Sections 1819(g)(4) and 1919(g)(4) of the Act provide that the State may maintain and utilize a specialized team which may include an auditor, an attorney, and appropriate health care professionals to identify, survey, gather and preserve evidence, and carry out appropriate enforcement action against substandard facilities. The discipline, specific training, and education of such a specialized team provides the narrow focus that is often essential to conduct a comprehensive complaint investigation. The State survey agency has the overall survey and certification responsibility and expertise that assures that surveyors can ascertain when Medicare and Medicaid facilities meet participation requirements. Comment: A few commenters recommended that a process for appeal by the complainant be implemented. Response: While we cannot deny that there may be instances in which a complainant is dissatisfied with the findings of a complaint investigation, we cannot accept the recommendation to include an appeal process for the complainant in the regulation as the complainant is not a party to the provider agreement. Comment: A commenter asked what type of action could be invoked when a complaint was received after the violation occurred and was resolved by the time the surveyors arrived. Response: Although we may have discretion with the selection of remedies to address noncompliance with requirements that are corrected by the time of a survey, it is likely that we would give serious consideration to imposing a civil money penalty in such cases. Sections 1819(h)(1) and 1919(h) (1) and (3) of the Act expressly authorize the impositions of these sanctions even if, at the time of the survey, the facility is in compliance. Comment: A few commenters recommended that the provision which includes administering remedies to noncompliant facilities found during a complaint investigation be revised to say that the State will carry out appropriate enforcement remedies against chronically substandard facilities. Response: We do not agree. While the facility's compliance history is a factor in general and specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies in determining the appropriate remedy or remedies, we will not limit the remedies to only those facilities which have chronically provided substandard care. To do so, would be to allow many deficiencies that constitute noncompliance to go unsanctioned. This undermines the purpose of remedies that are intended to motivate prompt compliance with participation requirements. Section 488.334␣Educational Programs
