ITAR-TASS has learned today from military sources that a small gang of Tajik mojaheeds attempted on Thursday to break through the positions of Russian border guards, deployed on the Pyanj sector of the border, heading for Shartuz. However, they were stopped by Russian border guards and men from one of the battalions of the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and forced back into Afghanistan. Futile also were the attempts of two small groups of Tajik opposition fighters to illegally cross into Tajikistan through the zone controlled by men of the 12th Russian border post. According to the same source, Tajik mojaheeds, entrenched in several border provinces of the Islamic state of Afghanistan, have staged several more minor armed provocations since the beginning of January on sectors guarded by the Pyanj and Moskovskiy borderguard detachments. Two violators of the border were killed. There were no casualities among Russian servicemen.
