FR940630-0-00061 FR940630-0-00019 33 CFR Part 165 [CGD13&hyph;94&hyph;018] RIN 2115&hyph;AA97 Safety Zone Regulations; St. Helens Fourth of July Fireworks Display, Columbia River, St. Helens, OR AGENCY: Coast Guard, DOT. ACTION: Temporary final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone for the Independence Day Fireworks Display to be held on July 4, 1994. The zone will be located on the Columbia River from river mile 85.8 to 86.5. This safety zone is needed to protect persons, facilities, and vessels from safety hazards associated with a fireworks display. Entry into this safety zone is prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation becomes effective on July 4, 1994, at 8:45 p.m. (PDT) and terminates on July 4, 1994 at 10:45 p.m. (PDT). FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: LTJG R. S. Croke, c/o Captain of the Port Portland, 6767 N. Basin Ave., Portland, Oregon 97217&hyph;3992, (503) 240&hyph;9327. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553, a notice of proposed rulemaking was not published for this regulation and good cause exists for making it effective in less than 30 days after Federal Register publication. Publishing a NPRM and delaying its effective date would be contrary to the public interest since immediate action is necessary to ensure the safety of structures and vessels operating in the regulated area. Due to the complex planning and coordination involved, notice of the final details for the show were not available to the Coast Guard from the St. Helens Fireworks Committee until 30 days prior to the show. Therefore, sufficient time was not available to publish the proposed rules in advance of the event or to provide a delayed effective date. Following normal rulemaking procedures would be impracticable. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are LTJG R. S. Croke, project officer for the Captain of the Port, and LT L. J. Argenti, project attorney, Thirteenth Coast Guard District Legal Office. Discussion of Regulations The event requiring this regulation will begin on July 4, 1994 at 8:45 p.m. (PDT). Upon request of the St. Helens Fireworks Committee, the Coast Guard is establishing a safety zone from Columbia River mile 85.8 to river mile 86.5. This fireworks display may result in a large number of vessels congregating near the fireworks launch site. Concern is justified due to the possibility of debris and unexploded fireworks falling into the Columbia River in the vicinity of the launch site. This safety zone will be enforced by representatives of the Captain of the Port Portland, Oregon. The Captain of the Port may be assisted by other federal agencies. This Regulation is issued pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1225 and 1231 as set out in the authority citation for all of Part 165. Regulatory Evaluation This temporary final rule is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has been exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Federalism This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environmental Assessment This final rule has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and determined to be categorically excluded from further environmental documentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B. A Categorical Exclusion Determination statement has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket.
