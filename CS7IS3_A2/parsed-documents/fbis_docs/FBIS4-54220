The source said the early June meetings will deal with the issues of insurance, and autos and auto parts, two of the three sectors specified as "priorities" in the framework talks. For the auto sector, vice ministerial-level talks are also slated for the second week of June in Tokyo. The series of meetings are the first since the two countries agreed earlier this week to resume the framework negotiations, agreed last July to bring down Japan's large trade surplus with the U.S. The trade process had been stalled since February this year due to differences over a U.S. demand to set numerical targets to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. Japan has staunchly refused the demand. A working-group meeting for the remaining area -- government procurement -- has not yet been set, but will likely be held within the month of June.
