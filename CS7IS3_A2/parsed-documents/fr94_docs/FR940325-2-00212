FR940325-2-00212 FR940325-2-00094 On August 30, 1993, after completion of construction, Project No. 1 was sold to an owner-trustee and leased back to the Project No. 1 partnership. In the event the Project No. 1 partnership elects not to extend the lease for the 5 year option period, rent which would otherwise have been paid during the option period, equal to approximately $7 million, will become immediately due and payable. The obligation to pay such rent in the event the lease term is not extended has been guaranteed (``Rent Guarantee'') by Parent No. 2 In addition to the Rent Guarantee, in connection with the sale and lease back financing Parent No. 2 has also guaranteed until July 1, 1995 payment of any cost incurred by it that becomes necessary to correct a defect in Project No. 1's steam turbine foundation, up to $2 million (``Foundation Guarantee''), and the payment under certain circumstances of certain state taxes which might be deemed payable in the future in connection with Project No. 1's construction financing (``Tax Guarantee''). In connection with EII's acquisition of the Stock, GPU and EII will enter into an Assumption Agreement under which they would assume Parent No. 2's obligations under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee, and the Tax Guarantee (as well as the Repurchase Guarantee and the Catalyst Guarantee described below) and would agree to indemnify Parent No. 2 against any liabilities arising thereunder. Except with respect to obligations which may arise under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee and the Tax Guarantee, Project No. 1 partnership obligations under the lease and all other Project No. 1 partnership obligations are non-recourse to Cogen Corp. Project No. 2 is a 102 MW (net) natural gas fired qualifying cogeneration facility located in Florida. Project No. 2 is owned by a Florida limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, 50% of the general and limited partnership interests and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The other 50% of the general and limited partnership interests are held, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, by an unaffiliated privately-held diversified industrial corporation (``Investor 2'') which, among other businesses, is engaged in natural gas supply and transportation. Investor 2, through subsidiary companies, provides a portion of project No. 2's gas transportation services and peaking gas requirements and is project No. 2's steam host. Project No. 2 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Florida electric utility under a long-term power purchase contract and provides steam to a subsidiary of Investor 2 for citrus processing under a long-term steam sales agreement. Project number 3 (``Project No. 3'') is an 80 MW (net) natural gas fired QF located in New York. Project No. 3 is owned by a Delaware limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, approximately 33% of the general and limited partnership interests and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The balance of the partnership interests is held by an institutional insurance company, the operations and maintenance contractor and an unaffiliated energy project developer. Project No. 3 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a New York utility under a long-term power purchase agreement and sells steam to an adjacent educational institution primarily for space heating under a long-term steam sales contract.

Cogen Corp. also leases the project site from Project No. 4's steam host and, through a subsidiary, subleases the site to the partnership, for which it receives sublease payments from the Partnership under a sublease. Project No. 4 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Michigan utility and sells steam for process use to an industrial corporation under a long-term steam sales contract.
