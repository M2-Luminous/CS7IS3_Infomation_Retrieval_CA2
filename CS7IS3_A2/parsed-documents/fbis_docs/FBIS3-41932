Nearly 200 excited passengers, including Algerian government officials, most foreign diplomats in Algeria, and foreign and Algerian reporters, walked off the plane and continued the journey by bus toward a vast stretch of wilderness. Half an hour later, a cluster of beige buildings appeared on the horizon. This is the site of (Ain Wusela) Science Town, so named in Algeria's development plan. The first group of buildings completed in the science town are those of the 15,000-kilowatt heavy water reactor built by Algeria in cooperation with China. On the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Algeria on 21 December, the Algerian government held a grand inauguration ceremony for the reactor. The multi-function heavy water reactor was completed after five years of close cooperation between Chinese and Algerian scientists in overcoming various difficulties. China provided Algeria with technology and a complete set of facilities [she shi 6080 2457], and trained relevant Algerian scientists and technicians. During the one-year warranty period, the reactor, operated by Algerian scientists and technicians, has shown that it is up to the designed standards in all functions and composite indexes [zong he zhi biao 4844 0678 2172 2871]. Djebbar, minister of national education of Algeria, presided over and addressed the ceremony. He said that the Algerian government is satisfied with the effective cooperation between the two countries in the high-technology field. During the ceremony, Algerian Foreign Minister Dembri said the reactor is entirely for the purpose of scientific research on the peaceful use of nuclear energy. For this reason, he solemnly declared in the name of his government: ``Algeria is preparing to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.'' His declaration immediately won warm applause from among the foreign diplomats, and Algerian and Chinese scientists and technicians present. The reactor, named ``(As Salam),'' is an important means to raise Algeria's science research level, as well as an indispensable installation for training Algeria's nuclear scientists and technicians. During the course of construction, scientists and technicians of the two countries combated sand-storms and droughts, and completed the reactor and supportive structures on schedule. Moreover, they planted trees, landscaped the surroundings, and laid a foundation for further development of the science town in the vast wilderness. During the course of cooperation, they established a profound friendship and took pride in cultivating, with toil and sweat, a flower of nuclear science and technology in Algeria's scientific and technological field. The host showed the reactor and its control system to foreign diplomats and reporters. In the control center where various lights were flashing, the visitors listened attentively to a briefing by an Algerian staff member with a PHd degree. While shaking this reporter's hand, the Congolese ambassador to Algeria said: ``I wholeheartedly wish China and Algeria success in this cooperative project.'' After the visit, Li Dingfan, head of the Chinese delegation and deputy director of the State Atomic Energy Agency [guo jia yuan zi neng ji gou 0948 1367 0626 1311 5174 2623 2845], who made a special trip to Algeria to attend the ceremony, wrote in the visitors book: ``May the flower of nuclear science and technology jointly cultivated by China and Algeria bear rich fruit soon.'' After learning of the meaning of Li Dingfan's inscription, (Madani), spokesman and director of the information department of the Algerian Foreign Ministry, said: The inscription fully reflects the aspirations of the Algerian people and Chinese people, and the project which symbolizes Algerian-Chinese friendship will surely further promote friendly cooperation between the two countries.
