FR940916-0-00072 FR940916-0-00018 ยง29.1521 Powerplant limitations. * * * * * (i) Rated 30-second OEI power operation . Rated 30-second OEI power is permitted only on multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft, also certificated for the use of rated 2-minute OEI power, and can only be used for continued operation of the remaining engine(s) after a failure or precautionary shutdown of an engine. It must be shown that following application of 30-second OEI power, any damage will be readily detectable by the applicable inspections and other related procedures furnished in accordance with Section A29.4 of Appendix A of this part and Section A33.4 of Appendix A of part 33. The use of 30-second OEI power must be limited to not more than 30 seconds for any period in which that power is used, and by_ (1) The maximum rotational speed which may not be greater than_ (i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or (ii) The maximum value demonstrated during the type tests; (2) The maximum allowable gas temperature; and (3) The maximum allowable torque. (j) Rated 2-minute OEI power operation . Rated 2-minute OEI power is permitted only on multiengine, turbine-powered rotorcraft, also certificated for the use of rated 30-second OEI power, and can only be used for continued operation of the remaining engine(s) after a failure or precautionary shutdown of an engine. It must be shown that following application of 2-minute OEI power, any damage will be readily detectable by the applicable inspections and other related procedures furnished in accordance with Section A29.4 of Appendix a of this part and Section A33.4 of Appendix A of part 33. The use of 2-minute OEI power must be limited to not more than 2 minutes for any period in which that power is used, and by_ (1) The maximum rotational speed, which may not be greater than_ (i) The maximum value determined by the rotor design; or (ii) The maximum value demonstrated during the type tests; (2) The maximum allowable gas temperature; and (3) The maximum allowable torque. 13. Section 29.1549 is amended by revising paragraph (e) to read as follows: ยง29.1549 Powerplant instruments. * * * * * (e) Each OEI limit or approved operating range must be marked to be clearly differentiated from the markings of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section except that no marking is normally required for the 30-second OEI limit.
