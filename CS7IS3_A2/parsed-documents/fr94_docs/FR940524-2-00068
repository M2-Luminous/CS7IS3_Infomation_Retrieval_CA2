FR940524-2-00068 FR940524-2-00044 DEPARTMENT OF LABOR Mine Safety and Health Administration Petitions for Modification The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. 1. Southern Utah Fuel [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;57&hyph;C] Southern Utah Fuel Company, 397 South, 800 West, Salina, Utah 84654 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364 (b)(4) and (c)(3) (weekly examination) to its SUFCO Mine (I.D. No. 42&hyph;00089) located in Sevier County, Utah. The petitioner proposes to establish an evaluation point to monitor the air quality where the bleeder connector connects with the North Mains return entries on a weekly basis; and to prohibit travel in the affected area. The petitioner states that due to the inability of maintaining the oxygen content at 19.5 percent in the 4th East Bleeder Connector because the air is ventilating the longwall gob area, the seals located along the bleeder connector cannot be examined safely and that to increase the air through the gob area would increase the possibility of spontaneous combustion in the gob. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 2. Costain Coal, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;58&hyph;C] Costain Coal Company, P.O. Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002 (location of trolley wires; trolley feeder wires, high-voltage cables and transformers) to its Baker Mine (I.D. No. 15&hyph;14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky. Due to the width and required production, motor horsepower will be necessary that requires the use of high-voltage for longwall equipment in the Kentucky No. 13 seam at the mine. The petitioner proposes to use high-voltage (2400 volts) operated equipment in by the last open crosscut at the working longwall sections. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 3. Black Dog Coal Corporation [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;59&hyph;C] Black Dog Coal Corporation, Route 1, Box 105&hyph;A, Haysi, Virginia 24256 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its No. 1 (I.D. No. 44&hyph;05770) located in Buchanan County, Virginia. The petitioner proposes to check the quality and quantity of the ventilating current where it enters the intake entry located to the left of the # 3 conveyor at Spad Station # 1022 and where it leaves sub-normal roof conditions at Spad Station # 1211; and to travel into the intake airway at each door in the brattice line (located at 300 feet intervals) to look up and down the airway as far as possible to visually inspect the airway in order to evaluate the ventilation current without exposing the examiner to unnecessary danger. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard. 4. Frontier-Kemper Constructors, Inc. [Docket No. M&hyph;94&hyph;28&hyph;M] Frontier-Kemper Constructors, Inc., P.O. Box 726, San Manuel, Arizona 85631 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 57.9360(a) (shelter holes) for its development contract work at Magma Copper Company's San Manuel Mine (I.D. No. 02&hyph;00151, AO&hyph;1) located in Pinal County, Arizona. The petitioner proposes to cut 34,500 lineal feet of circular shaped drift, 15 feet in diameter, using a Tunnel Boring Machine, 3440 vertical feet underground. The petitioner states that the haulage roadway is rail mounted and consists of a 36 inch gauge track, using 70 pound rail and 65 inch wide Brookville Diesel Locomotives pulling Mullenhauser side dump cars; that the shelter holes would be installed at 200 feet centers in accordance with Az. 27&hyph;345 as a new mandatory policy for the petitioner; and that the shelter holes would not be used for storage. The petitioner proposes to provide training consisting of thorough-on-site instruction by petitioner's personnel on the use of shelter holes when trains are in the drift; to conduct discussions regarding the reason this policy is being implemented; to distribute written notice of the new policy and the fact that disciplinary action may be taken when the new policy is not followed; to incorporate the new policy into petitioner's written policies and procedures manual; to provide annual refresher training and task training to new employees on the use of the platform shelters (shelter holes); and to post signs throughout the drift instructing the miners to use the platform shelters (shelter holes) when trains are moving in the drift. The petitioner states that application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to its personnel. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.
