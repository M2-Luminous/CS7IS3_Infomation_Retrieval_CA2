"No accord will be reached between the two sides and the Palestinian delegation will ask to leave for Tunis for consultation with the PLO leadership," a source close to the negotiations told AFP. King Husayn had described the talks here as a "last chance" to mend ties between the two sides. A Jordanian official told AFP that Jordan feared that 'Arafat "is giving priority to Palestinian-Israeli cooperation rather than to that with Jordan" and would blame the PLO leader if the talks here failed. The source close to the talks said that 'Arafat's choosing Faruq Qaddumi instead of Mahmud 'Abbas to head the negotiations here "shows his determination to gain time without making firm commitments." Unlike Qaddumi who disagreed with the Israeli-PLO peace deal, 'Abbas signed the accord in Washington and is directly involved in all autonomy-related negotiations. The two days of talks focused on how to boost coordination on banking in the territories, the issues of Jerusalem, water, and refugees as well as on the PLO-Israeli negotiations, Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said. The talks "will continue until both sides reach decisive results," al-'Anani said earlier. King Husayn on Saturday gave the Palestine Liberation Organization until Tuesday to begin a "serious" dialogue on improving coordination, after the PLO had failed to sign an economics agreement that has been ready for two months. The agreement is aimed at setting up Jordanian banks in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
