I think that the signing of the agreement last night should mark the beginning of a process to (?eliminate) the conflict and to (?regulate) an overall peace in the new, territorially reorganized part of our homeland. In other words, this is an indispensable prerequisiste for creating specific conditions: first, to facilitate the return of all refugees and displaced persons. This we see as being the most important issue. In other words, everyone to return to his or her home. This is our main goal. We know it will be difficult to attain it but we are working on it. Second, to begin the process of reconstruction, development, and consolidation in our country both by relying on our own resources and with the help from the international community -- this was the topic of discussion with Mr. Preston, the president of the World Bank, in particular, and with Vice President Gore and Mr. Christopher on several occasions. I must say -- and we stressed this point last night during the signing ceremony -- that this agreement would not have been possible without the direct involvement on the part of the United States and of top U.S. officials. We have been trying for two years to give the U.S. public a true picture of Bosnia-Herzegovina, to spur the U.S. public and leadership. The seeds we have been sowing for two years are now sprouting. It seems to us that Washington, the capital of the democratic United States, is the right place for both the talks and the signing of this preliminary agreement and the final agreement which, we hope, will be signed by Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman on 15 March. That is the date we arranged. We hope that all work will be completed by then. However, this diplomatic activity was made possible by the heroic efforts of our soldiers who liberated parts of the territory. This was a basis for the diplomatic and political activity. We have proved that we were not only a political but also a military factor without which diplomatic activity could never be sufficiently successful. A great deal of work still needs to be done. Above all we must maintain this level of involvement and interest on the part of the United States, the allies, Russia, and UN member countries to achieve peace. For this reason we will be going to Moscow to meet Minister Kozyrev and other officials. Russia is without a doubt an important international factor and we will try to examine possibilities of an agreement with the Serb side. I expect a lot of work on the preparation and the drawing up of the federation's constitution and the confederal agreement with Croatia. This work will be accomplished at the U.S. Embassy in Vienna. A team of experts has already been sent there. Once the text of the constitution and the confederal agreement between the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia has been coordinated, Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman are expected to sign these agreements in Washington. Very little time remains and a great deal of work needs to be done. To conclude, I still have another meeting today in the State Department in connection with further activities and talks.
