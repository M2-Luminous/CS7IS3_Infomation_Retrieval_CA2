KPW Chief Leslaw Paga, while proposing a toast, said that one does not drink to the health of children, but one can make an exception in order for the stock market to continue to develop as successfully as it has thus far. According to many people associated with the stock market in various ways, the capital market in Poland has been developing correctly. That does not mean, of course, that no changes are needed that would guarantee the market's correct development. Professor Grzegorz Domanski, chief of the Council of the Securities Stock Market: The Polish capital market has been developing in the same way as a majority of institutions of the market economy in our country. There is no reason for the market to deviate from that general pattern. After all, the capital market is an integral part of the entire economic system, so it progresses along with the system. The rate of reforms we have been witnessing in the entire economy is directly reflected in the rate of changes in the capital market and also in its development. Despite being a very young market, it has already undergone changes. First, it has undergone a substantial calming down, and anyone who influences its regulatory shape and feels morally responsible is very happy about it. Currently, we are counting very much on two things: a speeding up of the development of brokerage houses that have clearly been becoming a bottleneck in the stock market's development, and, second, we want our securities market to stop being a market for individual investors and petty money grubbers and to become, instead, a market of institutional investors. We are already witnessing some symptoms of the changes. So, if we manage to invite institutional investors into the game, and if we manage to strengthen brokerage houses, we have a very bright future ahead of us. Andrzej Celinski of the Freedom Union: I am not a professional. I am just a politician who is interested in economics. From my nonprofessional standpoint, the capital market in Poland has been developing correctly, although perhaps somewhat too cautiously. Perhaps the development of the Warsaw Stock Market does not meet expectations or needs. Besides, institutions dealing with the capital market have a too limited array of services. In Poland, not only is the stock market too "thin" and small, with new companies entering it too slowly, but we also do not have new economic institutions with the necessary infrastructure for development of the capital market--for instance, property rights insurance. It is an institution that is known to every outside investor. But those investors do not find it here in Poland. This makes the investment processes very difficult, especially those that require changes in the ownership of, for instance, land or industrial premises. In my view, another issue is the array of offers of different financial services, which continues to be limited. Practically speaking, there are no venture capital [preceding two words in English] organizations in Poland--that is, with capital that requires the kind of investors using primarily their own ideas, unique expertise, and knowledge, and looking for deep gaps in the market as the basis. Countries that are developing at a fast rate--and Poland is definitely becoming such a country--and that are quickly changing ownership structures need offers going beyond the traditional offer of bank credit as a necessary ingredient for development of young entrepreneurship. Generally speaking, the stock market is developing a bit too slowly, but we understand the position of those who guard it against misfortune. Stock Market Chairman Wieslaw Rozlucki: It is difficult to be my own judge, but I think the first three years were good. We managed to avoid major mistakes. Some things are just beyond our control. The stock market's management cannot control the market itself or prices that either rise or fall too quickly. These issues are beyond our capabilities. I think the fundamental assumptions stood their test. In the beginning, there was nothing like a major involvement of interests and money that currently determine the shares' value. I am afraid that, unfortunately, the next three years will not be as good in the sense of avoiding conflicts or settling problems professionally. Of course, there are a few things that should be changed. We are waiting for institutional investors, better advisers, and better services provided to our customers. In my view, company analysis, fundamental analysis, and investment counseling remain the bottlenecks. But, as everybody can see, those bottlenecks keep changing every few months, followed by new problems that we try to overcome, and, in this way, the market is gradually developing.
