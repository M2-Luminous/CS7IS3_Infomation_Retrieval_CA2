The storming of the World Trade Center last year was an obvious example of how no action was originally taken against the right wing." "A warrant was issued almost 2 months ago for the arrest of Willem Ratte, fugitive leader of the right wingers who occupied Fort Schanskop in Pretoria. Since then he has appeared at several right-wing rallies." "It would appear that the police are unwilling to take him in, perhaps also for fear of violence. This failure to act against the right wing is in sharp contrast with the early morning raid last year on the homes and offices of more than 70 senior Pan-Africanist Congress members. At that time the authorities did not hesitate to act, even at the risk of derailing the negotiation process." "We are not advocating intensified action against the right simply to try to create the impression that equally firm action is taken against both right and left, but when people, regardless of color or political conviction, break the law, they must be arrested and punished according to the law." Police Must Earn Public Respect -- A second editorial on page 8 says that "it is with increasing concern that we note admissions by policemen in the Rand Supreme Court that they lied during the police investigation into the shooting incident last year between bodyguards of the ANC's Mr. Walter Sisulu and the police." "It is beyond comprehension that policemen, who ought to know better, can place the whole police force under suspicion by such lies. As it is, the police are already going through a credibility crisis, which could increase as 27 April draws nearer. We do believe, however, that the majority of police strive honestly to live up to their motto, we protect and we serve. It is for their sake that we plead with all policemen: Always act in word and deed in a manner which will earn the respect of the public." Intimidation Casts Shadow Over Democracy -- The Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans on 3 February in a page-8 editorial regrets that "it is a pity that the National Party [NP] could not present a `normal' election list because, according to President F. W. de Klerk, intimidation in black areas prevented this. As a result a shadow is cast over the deployment of democracy. If potential candidates are intimidated in such a manner, one can only imagine how much pressure there is on ordinary supporters. Mr. Nelson Mandela's repeated plea that the election campaign should be free and fair has apparently not reached the black communities, or is being ignored. Nevertheless, now that the NP has an election team, it must begin to use them visibly. Campaigning must not be done only by a handful of white party leaders. Black and colored people as well as Indians must become part of the voter recruiting effort. That is the best way of making a really new NP known." Success for Joint East Rand Plan Urged -- A second editorial on the same page of the 3 February BEELD states that "the joint rescue plan for the black townships on the East Rand is of vital importance, not only for the tattered communities at whom it is aimed, but in a sense for the whole country. The East Rand plan is the first one drawn up after consultation with all political role players, the local community, and the security forces. For this reason it has a better chance of success that previous plans, even though success is not guaranteed. The black community on the East Rand is not the only one where the social fabric has been reduced to the point of total anarchy. Similar situations exist in parts of Natal and the Western Cape .... so what is being done now on the East Rand will have to be duplicated in several other areas. This East Rand rescue plan will, therefore, provide an early indication of whether the country has a chance of success in the massive task of stabilization and upliftment which must be tackled after the April election. If it succeeds, chances are good that the same success will be repeated elsewhere too. Failure will be a forecast of misery for virtually the whole country."
