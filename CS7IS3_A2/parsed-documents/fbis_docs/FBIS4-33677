The main obstacle was the asylum seekers' persistent refusal to leave the building. The Belgian authorities continued to try to convince them to do so. According to Havana, the Belgian authorities submitted a list with 121 names to the Cuban authorities. On Wednesday, a Brussels communique stated that there were 124 Cubans in the embassy. The Cuban Foreign Ministry announced it would not resort to violence to chase the intruders from the Belgian ambassador's residence. "It is up to Belgium to take action," the Cuban Embassy spokesman in Brussels stated. Brussels and Havana fully agree on the position to be taken. "Belgium should try and talk the intruders into leaving," spokesmen said. Brussels sent Willy Verriest, former Belgian ambassador in Havana, as a special envoy to Cuba. According to the Belgian Foreign Ministry, this is necessary because of the problems the Belgian Embassy is experiencing with simultaneously negotiating with the Cuban authorities, convincing the intruders, and finding food for 124 people. [passage omitted] Both countries agree that all legal procedures for traveling abroad should be respected. Since Cuba has promised not to prosecute the intruders for unlawful entry, Belgium is trying to make them leave. [passage omitted] During the present incident, Belgium has not issued any statements about human rights. Shortly after the embassy takeover, Foreign Minister Claes said that "the intruders should not have any false illusions." [passage omitted]
