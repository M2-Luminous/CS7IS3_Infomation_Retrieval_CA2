The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word article by correspondent Pak Tu-sik from Washington on the possibility of a new turn in the North Korean nuclear issue. Reviewing the contents point by point, the article analyzes that the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman's 12 February comment implies another new turn in the North Korean nuclear issue, which has been aggravated since a statement was issued by a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry on 31 January. The article says that although it cannot be expected that the North Korean nuclear issue will be resolved through dialogue by 21 February, it notes: "it has been confirmed that North Korea does want a breakthrough of the current situation which could only result in UN Security Council's measures." The article notes North Korea's sudden assertion that it received "new facts" that the United States is willing to continue dialogue and that the inspections of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are purely for the continuity of safeguards -- while the two conditions are not new at all -- are to "accumulate pretexts for internal reporting procedures." The article concludes that the behind-the-scenes communications between the United States and North Korea in the remainder of the week will be noteworthy. The moderate CHOSON ILBO in Korean publishes on page 3 an 800- word editorial on the follow-up measures on the nuclear issue. The editorial says "if it is inevitable to seek resolutions in the frame of sanctions instead of negotiations, the government should clearly convey to North Korea that the sanctions are not threats but a reality, and should be prepared to clearly interpret North Korea's response." Therefore, the editorial urges that a communications channel is established to quickly communicate our decision to the top decision maker in North Korea in order to prevent a crisis resulting from delayed communications. If this does not work out, the editorial says crisis management measures should be sought at this stage. The editorial stresses that the most important thing at this stage is to cautiously manage the domestic systems in the ROK and the United States so that a prudent countermeasure to minimize the crisis can be carried out with a national consensus of opinion. The moderate TONG-A ILBO in Korean publishes on page 2 a 600-word article by correspondent Nam Chang-sun from Washington entitled "Main Role and Supporting Role in Handling the North Korean Nuclear Issue." Noting that there had been frequent contacts between South and North Korea a year ago for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the article regrets that now the nuclear issue has become an issue to be resolved between North Korea and the United States or the IAEA. The article analyzes that North Korea succeeded to exclude South Korea from the issue because "it was aware of the effects and limits of South Korea's carrots and sticks and disregarded them." The article says Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's hasty visit to the United States to pull back the Clinton Administration from rushing into a hard-line position and to "confirm" that the U.S. policy on the North Korean nuclear issue was the same as ours, vividly shows the ROK's supporting role. The article asserts that we should seek a way to play the main role in the North Korean nuclear issue because it is directly linked with our destiny. The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN in Korean publishes on page 3 a 1,400-word article by correspondent Yi Sung-chol from Washington analyzing the possibility of a breakthrough in the North Korean nuclear issue. The article notes that the comment made by a spokesman of North Korean Foreign Ministry was announced on the same day NODONG SINMUN carried a hard-line commentary that any sanctions will be regarded as a proclamation of war, and quotes an ROK Government official as saying: "the NODONG SINMUN commentary and Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment can be analyzed as a fake operation." The article reports North Korea seemed to have put considerable emphasis on the Foreign Ministry spokesman's comment because it even distributed copies of the contents to ROK and Western correspondents in the United States. The article analyzes that "such a move of change resulted from the North Korean leaders' crisis awareness" as well as "the ROK Foreign Minister's efforts during his recent visit to the United States to create an atmosphere for North Korea's change." The article worries that optimism can be destroyed at any moment if the real emphasis was on the NODONG SINMUN commentary and the other comment was a harassing tactic noting that no changes were seen in North Korea's contact with the United States in New York or with the IAEA in Vienna. The article reports the ROK and U.S. Governments are establishing phased countermeasures while analyzing North Korea's real intent.
