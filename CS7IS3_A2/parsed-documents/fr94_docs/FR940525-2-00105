FR940525-2-00105 FR940525-2-00064 The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Local Public Document Room location: York County Library, 138 East Black Street, Rock Hill, South Carolina 29730. Attorney for licensee: Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422 South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242. NRC Project Director: David B. Matthews. Florida Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;250 and 50&hyph;251, Turkey Point Plant Units 3 and 4, Dade County, Florida Date of amendment request: April 19, 1994. Description of amendment request: The licensee proposes to change Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 Technical Specifications (TS) 4.0.5 a, ``Applicability_Surveillance Requirements.'' The licensee proposes to delete the wording ``.␣.␣. (g), except where specific written relief has been granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'' in TS 4.0.5 a, for the inservice inspection and testing programs. With the revisions to the Technical Specifications, upon finding an ASME Code requirement impractical because of prohibitive dose rates or limitations in the design, construction, or system configuration, the licensee may implement the relief request once it has been submitted to the NRC provided it has been: (1) Acceptably reviewed pursuant to 10 CFR 50.59; (2) approved by the plant staff in accordance with the administrative process described in the inservice inspection and testing programs administrative procedures; and (3) reviewed and approved by the Plant Nuclear Safety Committee. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: (1) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The proposed amendments remove the wording ``.␣.␣. (g), except where specific written relief has been granted by the Commission pursuant to 10 CFR, Section 50.55a(g)(6)(i)'', provided a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation is performed. The Inservice Inspection and Testing Programs are described in the Technical Specifications pursuant to 10 CFR 50.55a. In addition, the proposed amendments, in accordance with NUREG 1431 and draft NUREG 1482, provide relief to the ASME code requirement in the interim between the time of submittal of a relief request until the NRC has issued a safety evaluation and granted the relief. The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and do not affect assumptions contained in plant safety analyses, the physical design and/or operation of the plant, nor do they affect Technical Specifications that preserve safety analysis assumptions. Any relief from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not affect the probability or consequences of an accident previously analyzed. (2) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The changes being proposed are administrative in nature and will not change the physical plant or the modes of operation defined in the Facility License. The change does not involve the addition or modification of equipment nor does it alter the design or operation of plant systems. Any reliefs from the approved ASME Section XI code requirements will require a 10 CFR 50.59 evaluation to ensure no Technical Specification changes or unreviewed safety questions exist. Therefore, operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. (3) Operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendments would not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.
