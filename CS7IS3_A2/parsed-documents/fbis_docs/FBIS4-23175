[Begin recording] [Msomi] Khumalo Street in Thokoza has been until recently a no go area. Shooting incidents took place daily and many people died in battles between the ANC and Inkatha. However, a new beginning was made today. Tokoza's community -- hostel dwellers, ANC and Inkatha supporters lined Khumalo Street to welcome Premier Sexwale. Residents of the Kwamadala Hostel also welcomed Mr. Sexwale's message of reconciliation. [Sexwale, in English] We are saying, all of us are now working together. Nobody, nothing, must break the unity that we are building today. [Unidentified resident, in English] We are tired of what has happening before and that we are looking forward to come together and build our nation. [Unidentified resident, in Zulu] I am very happy. Of course what happened here today is a big thing. [Msomi] A similar spirit of reconciliation was also evident at Katlehong and Vosloorus hostels. The foundation has been laid for peace within East Rand communities, but only time will tell how long that peace will last. [end recording]
