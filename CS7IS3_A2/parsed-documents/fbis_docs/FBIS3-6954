Col Phongsak Ekbannasing, deputy commander of CPM-43, said the air attacks were launched on intelligence confirmed by aerial reconnaissance that about 30 separatists were at the camp. Three helicopters from Sirinthorn Camp in Pattani's Yarang District attacked the camp twice yesterday with machineguns. At the same time, troops were deployed at the foot of the mountain to intercept the bandits fleeing the air attacks which would continue for five days, he said. Seven government soldiers were wounded last week when a government force activated two landmines on Kudong Mountain while patrolling the area. Two of the wounded lost their left leg in the mine explosion.
