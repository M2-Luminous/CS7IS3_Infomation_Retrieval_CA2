As a result, the rural economy registered significant progress. According to statistical data, 1993 was a year of rapid development since the beginning of reform and opening up. With the exception of cotton, of which the output was about the same as the previous year, outputs of grain, oil-bearing crops, aquatic products, cocoons, meat products, and eggs set all-time records. Village and town enterprises as well as forestry production also registered great progress. Agriculture: The outputs of principal agricultural products all increased steadily. The outputs of grain, edible oil, and cocoons set all-time records. According to an estimate, the total output of grain in 1993 was 25.4 billion kg, increasing by 8.46 percent over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 25.2 billion kg in 1990. The total output of edible oil was 31.33 million dan [1 dan equals 50 kg], increasing by 11.86 percent over 1992 and exceeding the previous high of 30.21 million dan in 1987. The total output of cocoons was 32,300 dan, increasing by 13.3 percent over 1992. The peasants increased economic efficiency as well as their income. According to estimates, the total agricultural output value for the entire province totaled 41.7 billion yuan (based on 1990 constant price), an increase of 8.47 percent or 3.3 billion yuan over the previous year. The average cash income of peasants could reach 670 yuan, an increase of 16.9 percent or 97 yuan over the previous year. Agricultural markets also developed rapidly, with more fine quality products. The problem of structural surplus of agricultural products was solved. The total acreage of farmland sown for fine quality rice totaled 9.31 million mu. Experimental agriculture also developed in depth. Animal husbandry and fishery: According to estimates, the total output value of animal husbandry in the entire province could total 9.77 billion yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the previous year, accounting for 23.4 percent of the total agricultural output value. The quantities of pigs, cattle, sheep, poultry, and eggs increased by 3.7 percent, 15.7 percent, 2.9 percent, 12.7 percent, and 0.5 percent over those of the previous year respectively. Animal husbandry in 1993 had three special characteristics: 1) stress was laid on developing grain-saving livestock, and beef and poultry reached 29.3 percent of total meat production, with the proportion of beef and poultry increasing by 2 percent over the previous year; 2) large operations increased significantly, and production was geared to market needs; and 3) the extent of utilization of science was raised in livestock production. The total output of aquatic products for the entire province reached 350,000 tonnes, an increase of 15.8 percent over the previous year. Breakthroughs were made in producing famous, special, fine, and new products. Forestry: In 1993 people in the province afforested 1.692 million mu of land and planted 257 million trees at near houses, villages, roads, and water on a voluntary basis. The average survival rate of planted trees was more than 93 percent. People in the province also built shelter belts to protect 8.817 million mu of farmland. Two prefectures and five counties were named national advanced units in afforestation. The structures of trees became more reasonable. People in the province built 714,000 mu of economic forests and fruit trees, accounting for 42.5 percent of the total area of afforestation during the same year. Fifteen kinds of advanced forestry technologies were adopted in the province. The total value of forestry products exceeded 2.8 billion yuan, an increase of 14 percent over the previous year.
