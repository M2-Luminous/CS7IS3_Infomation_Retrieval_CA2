Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian Duma, who heads the delegation visiting Finland, says that he takes Zhirinovskiy exactly as seriously as he deserves. Lukin, who arrived in Helsinki today, pointed out that Zhirinovskiy represented only a small section of the second chamber of the Russian parliament, i.e., the Duma. According to Lukin, Zhirinovskiy is behaving as if 80 percent of the parliamentary deputies were behind him. The Finnish and Russian Council of Europe delegations began a two-day seminar in Helsinki today discussing Russia's prospects of becoming a member of the Council of Europe. Zhirinovskiy, who arrived in Finland already yesterday, thought that the Baltic countries still belonged to Russia. The statement is in sharp conflict with conditions for membership in the Council of Europe. David Atkinson, chairman of the committee that handles the Council's relations with countries outside the organization, sharply criticized Zhirinovskiy at the seminar that opened today.
