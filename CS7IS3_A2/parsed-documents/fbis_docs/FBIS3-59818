But these sources explained that these people were the target of repression not because they actually staged a coup, but also because they held meetings and contacts during which they discussed the deteriorating situation in the country. Some sources added that these people probably addressed a memo to Saddam Husayn calling on him to step down from power. In the meantime French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that his government supports maintaining UN sanctions against Iraq until it implements all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 688. He added that Paris supports sending UN observers to Iraq in order to monitor human rights violations. With regard to developments in Iraq, Iraqi sources said one of the victims was 'Ali 'Abd-al-Rahman Ahmad al-Dawud al-Hamadani, who was a security officer in the national command of the ruling Socialist Arab Ba'th Party who was arrested last Saturday. The sources said that Safar Mawlud Mukhlis and his cousin Jasim Amin Mukhlis were among the victims. The first was a retired lawyer and was considered one of the traditionally eminent personalities in the Tikriti circle. His father, Mawlud Mukhlis was one of the leading personalities in the area and one of the early pioneers who cooperated with late King Faysal I in establishing the state of Iraq in the twenties. Because of this background his family enjoyed special respect and influence, even among the ruling al-Tikriti family, particularly during the era of late president Ahmad Hasan al-Bakr. But the family's influence diminished in Saddam's era. Persons arriving in Amman from Baghdad said it was customary of Safar to talk in his regular private meetings about Saddam Husayn with sarcasm, sometimes calling him "this 'ajay," which in al-Tikriti slang means scoundrel, as an expression of contempt, which the al-Tikriti aristocrats feel toward al-Majid family, to which the Iraqi president belongs. As for Raji 'Abbas al-Tikriti, he, too, is considered an "aristocrat." In the seventies he was the commandant of al-Rashid military hospital, then director of medical affairs in the defense ministry. He was doyen of the doctors' association in 1990-92. On the other hand, Iraqi experts and opposition members told AL-HAYAH yesterday that bringing Husayn Kamil, President Saddam Husayn's son-in-law, back into the government and appointing him minister of industry and minerals; and appointing Safa' Hadi Jawad al-Habbubi minister of petroleum; is an indication that the Iraqi president intends to concentrate further on mobilizing the country's resources to serve military industrialization. The sources said that al-Habbubi (47 years), whose family name did not appear in the list of the new ministers, was an undersecretary for the ministry of military industrialization, which was headed by Husayn Kamil and was responsible for the Iraqi armament program, including nuclear and chemical programs. Up to that time he was director of the British Matrix Churchill company, which supplied Iraq with equipment for the manufacture of a giant gun. He is one of those accused in the case of the BNL Bank and in February 1991, he was charged with fraud. The sources noticed that even up to last year's winter he frequently traveled to Tunis via Amman in order to follow-up contacts with European companies specialized in armament. He invested his money in Jordan in order to buy a company for metal manufacturing. But he stopped traveling after he was involved in a car accident after which he was taken to the Amman Surgical Hospital. Husayn Kamil sent a squad of bodyguards to protect him. The sources said that the WASHINGTON POST in the United States reported then that al-Habbubi, who is in Jordan, is wanted for justice in the United States. In London, chairman of the executive council of the Iraqi National Congress, Ahmad al-Chalabi was informed through a message from the French foreign minister that Iraq has been urged to implement all the UN resolutions, including Resolution 688 that forbids the regime from repressing civilian inhabitants. He pointed in this regard to France's participation in the Western force to protect the Kurds. He said Paris's demand to ease sanctions on Iraq depends on Iraq's implementation of all the Security Council resolutions.
