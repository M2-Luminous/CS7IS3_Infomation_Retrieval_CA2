Groups of volunteers from the Ukrainian National Assembly (UNA- UNSO) [Ukrainian National Self-Defense] are reportedly getting ready for a massive landing in the Crimea on 17 June, causing alarm not only in the Crimean capital of Simferopol but also in Ukraine's Kiev. Assistant to the president of the Republic of Crimea Aleksey Baksheyev said the threats of Ukrainian nationalists are quite substantial. He told ITAR-TASS that he did not rule out the possibility that some of the groups had already penetrated the peninsula and added that he has information about the possible activity of the nationalists among the population. Aleksey Baksheyev's information about the possible acts of provocation in the Crimea is confirmed by the press centre of the Black Sea Fleet. The centre on Wednesday circulated information about forming a volunteer group for "an active recreation" in the Crimea by the nationalist forces in Lvov. The volunteers intend to "propagate the ideas of Ukrainian statehood and nationalism in the peninsula." Tens of self-styled "propagandists" will be accommodated in the recreation centres around Alushta. They travel to the peninsula with vouchers worth 2.5 million karbovanets, 90 percent of the price being paid by the UNA-UNSO organisation. The UNA-UNSO volunteers include many people with warfare experience acquired in the flashpoints of the Commonwealth, including Transdniestria. As concerns their motives, they said it was primarily the desire "to protect the interests of the Ukrainians residing in the Crimea." Sources in the Crimea said that Lvov nationalists are the most active in choosing the Crimea for "summer vacationing". But groups of nationalists are being formed also in other regions of Ukraine. Their advance guards are already in the peninsula, where they arrived in pairs or individually in order to avoid provoking suspicions. Their task is to reconnoiter and prepare for the arrival of the main force. Deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments told ITAR-TASS that they were against such moves. In their view, against the background of positive developments in the negotiating process involving Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol, nationalist activity can only build up more tension but is unable to exert any positive influence on the situation.
