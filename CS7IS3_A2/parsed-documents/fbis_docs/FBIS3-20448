Most proceeded from their patriotism, their love for Hong Kong, their support for reform, and their demand for the progress of the country and the CPC. Participation was widespread. People of the left, the middle, and the right all got involved. There were people ranging from big capitalists to ordinary residents such as taxi drivers and street vendors. Several middle-aged big capitalists told me personally that they had taken part in million-man marches, and walked some distance. When interviewed by a reporter, Li Ka-shing openly expressed support for the students' patriotic movement. Some large stores conducted "benefit sales," donating the revenues or profits to be used for supporting students' patriotic activities at Tiananmen Square. Vendors and small business operators along the streets also voluntarily carried out similar "benefit sales" activities. During that period the patriotic torrent swept most people in Hong Kong along with it and swept across every corner of Hong Kong, creating an unprecedented situation. Most workers of XINHUA SHE, and Chinese-owned institutions also, like others, voluntarily got swept along by the torrent, becoming an exceptionally prominent force in the movement, thereby creating an unprecedented episode in the history of the Hong Kong Branch of XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned institutions. Some time back when the Tiananmen student movement had just started, some workers of the XINHUA SHE and Chinese-owned institutions had already begun to participate in activities in society which were carried out to show solidarity with the patriotic student movement in Beijing; there were even signature drives in the XINHUA SHE in support of the patriotic student movement. Zheng Hua was in charge of party affairs and organizational work. He suggested that those activities should be stopped. During discussions at a meeting of the CPC Work Committee, I said: "Don't call such a move stopping; call it persuading. If persuasion is not successful, let it pass. They should not be forced to do things!" "Leading cadres of the level of directors and deputy directors of the departments or above must be persuaded, in whatever ways, to refrain from taking part in activities in society and to refrain from giving their signatures." Actually, almost all directors and deputy directors of the departments had by then given their signatures. After being informed of the decision of the CPC Work Committee, most retracted their signatures, but a few people stubbornly refused to retract their signatures. Zhen Hua asked me the question of what to do. I asked him to let it pass if they should refuse to retract their signatures, and told him not to force them to do things. At that time some cadres of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE not only took part in the marches but also used identity banners of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE. Furthermore Xu Haining made a speech at a mass rally held at the racecourse. With regard to those incidents, I told him not to blame them. We also decided that mass organizations and trade unions of the left be also permitted to take part in marches and show their identity banners and that their leaders be permitted to openly take part in marches or other activities. In my view, amidst the current upsurge of mass patriotism on such a scale in Hong Kong, if leaders of mass organizations did not participate, those leaders would become seriously divorced from the masses, and the mass organizations might collapse; or, even if the organizations did not collapse, they would weaken greatly. Only by taking the initiative in participating would it be possible to keep contact with the masses. Later things developed to the extent that some marchers shouted the slogan, "Down with Deng, Li, and Yang." We decided that mass organizations of the left should not use such a slogan, and we pointed out that using such a slogan was a radical move. We applied the same policy to Hong Kong's leftist newspapers like WEN WEI PO and TA KUNG PAO, imposing no restrictions on their reporting and letting them report the student movement in Beijing and activities in Hong Kong in support of the student movement in an objective manner. We did not impose restrictions on the newspapers' own statements, but only asked them to say less. On 20 May, after Li Peng imposed martial law on Beijing, Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE, told me that colleagues at WEN WEI PO intended to react to the development by leaving the editorial space blank, and were planning to use one of the two phrases, "extremely pained and bitter" and "what else to say." After discussions, most colleagues at the newspaper favored using the phrase, "what else to say." Zhang Junsheng was inclined to use the phrase, "extremely pained and bitter," and asked for my advice. I knew that the action could not be stopped, and that such a way of handling things might have serious consequences. Nevertheless I still nodded approval, saying: "You handle this matter." In this way I clearly indicated my approval of his idea. The four Chinese characters meaning "extremely pained and bitter" appeared in the editorial position on the first page of WEN WEI PO on the next day, causing quite a stir. Beijing was very angry. Li Peng ordered the Hong Kong Affairs Office to investigate into the incident. I asked them to tell Beijing in their reply: that Hong Kong was different from the hinterland and that we would handle the matter in an appropriate manner. In this way I indicated my refusal to cooperate. Later this incident developed into quite a storm. I will discuss the incident again later in the book. In terms of my personal emotions, I had very complex feelings, seeing the warm support given by the masses of residents of Hong Kong as well as the marches, rallies, benefit sales activities on an unprecedented scale in Hong Kong. After 20 May Hong Kong was hit by a typhoon, and No. 8 wind globes were hung. Amidst violent storms Hong Kong people of all walks of life still persisted in carrying out a sit-in all night long in front of the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA SHE, singing petition songs. I was in my bedroom on the 12th floor. Seeing the rain and wind and hearing the continuous singing and slogan shouting of people on the ground, I had all kinds of complex emotions. The CPC got started by promoting mass movement. In the past, in order to promote the interests of the masses of the people, the CPC led them in the fight against the Kuomintang rule; now, in a reversal of roles, the masses were demonstrating against the CPC and raising their demands. The CPC not only was unable to satisfy them but would also suppress them. In the face of such a situation that I could do nothing to change, I was unable to fall asleep. Seeing the masses sitting on the ground in the wind and rain and hearing their mournful and indignant singing and shouting, I could not stop my tears from flowing down. [End of Installment No. 117] [30 Aug 93 p 2] [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core (Part One): Zhao Ziyang Regretted the Publication of the April 26 Editorial of RENMIN RIBAO; Intended To Ask Yang Shangkun To Persuade Deng Xiaoping To Change the Conclusion on the Nature of the Student Movement On 30 April 1989, Zhao Ziyang returned home from his visit to Pyongyang. He telephoned me on the next day, asking me to go to Beijing. I immediately set out on the journey. I took with me many materials and videos on the student movement in Beijing presented by the Hong Kong media so as to show them to Zhao Ziyang. On 3 May, Zhao Ziyang talked with me for nearly two hours at his Zhongnanhai residence. First of all, he asked about my views on this student movement. I said: "This is a patriotic movement and a movement which supports the CPC-led reform; some people hope that the reform can advance further, while some people fear that the reform will stop or even go backward." I told Zhao Ziyang that after coming to Beijing on 2 May I had met with some people in order to grasp the situation in Beijing, and that support for the student movement was widespread, with supporters including most cadres of party and government organs. There were two categories of people in society who supported the student movement. In the first category were individual business operators, and in the second category were executives of reformed enterprises; those people had benefitted from the reform and feared that there would be policy changes, leading to retrogression. I said: "This student movement appears to be high. The slogans, indicating support for the CPC and Deng Xiaoping, are very wise in a tactical sense. On the one hand this shows that most people do think this way, but on the other hand this also shows that some people are giving them advice. I estimate that it is perhaps some young teachers and researchers at universities and research institutions who are doing the advising. But it should not be ruled out that some foreign forces or even some reactionary forces from Hong Kong are involved and have a hand in the movement. Nevertheless, the movement is good in the main." I said that the 26 April editorial of RENMIN RIBAO labeling the student movement as "turmoil" had exacerbated the conflict and had thus been, in my opinion, very unwise. I had been told that Beijing's cadres and residents at large had been shocked by the editorial, and that most people had been in disagreement with the opinion expressed by the editorial and had cursed Deng Xiaoping, with some people also saying that Deng Xiaoping had been hoodwinked by Li Peng, Chen Xitong [7115 1585 0681], and Li Ximing [2621 6932 6900]. According to a rumor, during discussions at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Ximing and Chen Xitong had reported that the students would launch a rebellion. Chen Xitong had even said that if he should be given 50,000 troops he would be able to put down the students immediately. It seemed that Deng Xiaoping had believed them, thereby making a mistake. I suggested: "It is still necessary to persuade and divide people but not suppress them. It is necessary to win over the overwhelming majority of the students, and to isolate a handful of anti-Communist elements who are trying to carry out sabotage." I also suggested: "We (the Communist Party of China) cannot afford making another mistake. The Cultural Revolution ruined Mao Zedong, resulting in the emergence of the confidence, conviction, and belief crisis. Over the past few years we depended on Comrade Xiaoping. Now it is imperative not to allow Comrade Xiaoping to also be ruined." After listening to me, Zhao Ziyang said: "We are in agreement." He specially stressed: "We must safeguard Comrade Xiaoping's prestige. I am willing to publicly accept the responsibility. We should tell Comrade Xiaoping the actual state of affairs, and persuade him to change the conclusion on the nature of the movement." Zhao Ziyang said: "In fact I am also responsible for the 26 April editorial in RENMIN RIBAO. I was in Pyongyang. The CPC Central Committee sent me the draft of the editorial, asking about my opinion. I indicated my approval. I will not have the Standing Committee held responsible. I am willing to publicly accept my personal responsibility." He also said: "The students demand clean government, oppose corruption, oppose "official profiteering," and oppose privileges... those ideas have all been put forward by our party. It is good that students and the masses are now supporting the ideas. We should accept the reasonable part of the masses' demands through carrying out a dialogue. I intend to recommend the Standing Committee to take some concrete measures to suppress and eradicate those problems." Zhao Ziyang discussed some specific ideas. For example, the fight against privileges should start at the center; Central Standing Committee members should take actions first. First, terminate the "special supplies" (referring to the system of proving central cadres of the vice premier level or above with inexpensive food and living goods) for Central Standing Committee members. Implementation of the measure may be delayed in the case of old people. Reform the system governing the special planes, special trains, guards for Standing Committee members during their trips outside the capital. Some old people should be allowed to keep the privilege. But the idea that new Standing Committee members should travel in a simpler manner and have smaller entourages should be considered. With regard to privileges enjoyed by children of high-ranking cadres, Zhao said: "I intend to write a letter to the CPC Central Committee, saying that my children should be investigated first, that if they have problems they should be punished according to the law of the land, and that if I myself am involved, I should be dealt with in the same manner." He also said that he would propose convening a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to discuss and formulate measures to fight corruption, officials' profiteering, and privileges. We also discussed some other issues, such as the issue of price increases and inflation. I suggested that from a long-term perspective it was necessary to consider carrying out financial reforms, and that for the time being it might be proper, first of all, to raise bank interest rates, so as to promote savings and gather more idle funds from society. We also discussed the issue of the Autonomous Students' Union and the Workers' Autonomous Federation, that is, how to view the situation where aside from the traditional trade unions and student organizations there were now also independent organizations of students and workers. Zhao Ziyang said that we should not be afraid of such independent organizations and that it was proper to let them operate and participate in elections. As long as our mass organizations represented the interests of the masses, there should be no fear of competition. Zhao said that the main issues for now were, firstly, to persuade Comrade Xiaoping to change the conclusion on the nature of the student movement and, secondly, to solicit opinions from Standing Committee members in an effort to change the decision. Zhao Ziyang said: "Please give me some help. You get along well with Shangkun. Please tell him the ideas we discussed today and, especially, the reactions from the outside world and your views, and ask him about his views. If he is in agreement, then ask him to go to talk to Comrade Xiaoping so as to persuade Comrade Xiaoping to change the conclusion on the nature of the movement." Zhao Ziyang indicated that he planned to talk with Li Peng. He estimated that among the Standing Committee members, Qiao Shi and Hu Qili would agree with him, and that the main problem lay in Li Peng and Yao Yilin. [End of Installment No. 118] [31 Aug 93 p 2] [Text] Got Involved in the Infighting at the Core (Part Two): Zhao Ziyang Was in Danger of Losing His Power Because of Indiscreet Remarks Made During a Meeting With gorbachev; the Political Bureau Rejected Zhao Ziyang's Idea on Handling the Student Movement I agreed to do the thing that Zhao Ziyang asked me to do because I felt duty-bound. After coming back to the place where I was staying, I immediately set an appointment with Yang Shangkun. We met in Yang Shangkun's home on the next day. I told Yang Shangkun the main contents of my talk with Zhao Ziyang and the main ideas discussed during the talk. Yang Shangkun readily expressed his total agreement. Yang also told me that he had just returned from the Great Hall of the People and had listened to the speech made by Zhao Ziyang to the heads of delegations to the annual conference of the Asian Development Bank [ADB] and senior ADB officials, and that in his opinion the speech was very good. When he had met Qiao Shi, Qiao Shi had also expressed his approval. In view of the statement contained in the April 26 editorial that "this is a planned conspiracy and a case of turmoil," Zhao Ziyang said in his speech: "There will be no large-scale turmoil in China." He argued that the basic demands raised by the student marchers "are exactly our party's policy ideas." He also said that efforts would be made to resolve problems of common concern through a dialogue involving various social strata. Later I learned that Zhao Ziyang's speech had been discussed at a meeting of the Central Standing Committee, and had been drafted by Bao Tong, political secretary of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Zhao Ziyang's personal secretary. During the discussion at the Standing Committee meeting, Yao Yilin had suggested that a segment on fighting bourgeois liberalization be added to the draft. Zhao gave some explanation, arguing that the matter should not be stressed for the time being in view of such a climate. Standing Committee members all expressed their approval. Yang Shangkun said to me: "I will talk to the patriarch (referring to Deng Xiaoping). You know the patriarch's disposition. He may accept the idea, but may also reject the idea. You tell Ziyang to start handling the matter in this way. If there is any question of responsibility, I will be the first to be held responsible." I told Yang Shangkun: "It is rumored that this time either Zhao or Li will be out of power." Yang Shangkun said resolutely: "No one is going to be out of power. Neither Zhao nor Li will step down." After talking with Yang Shangkun, I telephoned Zhao Ziyang to tell him what had happened. He met me again to discuss in detail my talk with Yang Shangkun. Zhao Ziyang told me that he had talked to Li Peng. But he did not tell me the results. At that time Zhao Ziyang's speeches at the May Fourth Commemoration Meeting and to ABD officials were well received by those within the party as well as the students and society at large. As a result I and Zhao Ziyang became overly optimistic in terms of our assessment of the situation of the time. Zhao Ziyang said to me then: "It seems that the student movement can stimulate reform." Thus I returned to Hong Kong, feeling assured. After coming back to Hong Kong, I transmitted the basic policy on handling the student movement (without touching on the related situation in the Central Standing Committee) to members of the CPC Work Committee. We discussed the relevant policies followed by Hong Kong and Macao and sent a special written report to the CPC Central Committee, so as to provide support for Zhao Ziyang's work in Beijing. The report contained mainly four points, basically embodying the contents of the talk with Zhao Ziyang in Beijing. On 13 May things changed suddenly. Students began a hunger strike. The strike went on for several days in a row. As the domestic and foreign media reported the strike continuously in a sensational manner, the situation of the student's hunger strike became increasingly tense, and some students even declared that they would refuse to drink water. I specially telephoned Zhao Ziyang and Yang Shangkun, suggesting that the matter of students' hunger strike be dealt with without any further delay, that several hundred buses be prepared, that hospital beds be made vacant, that doctors, nurses, some office workers all put on white gowns and take students on hunger strike to hospitals in a compulsory manner at dawn through having several people support or carry one student, that then Tiananmen Square be closed, and that a dialogue be carried out. I feared that conflicts would further intensify if some students should die because of the hunger strike. Both of them said on the telephone that those were good ideas. But then I waited and waited, but never saw any action. Perhaps they were also unable to do anything at that time. On 15 May CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev came to visit China. On the morning of 16 May Deng Xiaoping said in his meeting with Gorbachev: "This evening you will also meet Zhao Ziyang, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee; that meeting will signify the normalization of relations between the Chinese and Soviet parties." However, in the evening Zhao Ziyang said to Gorbachev: "Your summit meeting with Comrade Deng Xiaoping this morning is the climax of your trip to China. I want to say that your summit meeting signified the restoration of relations between our two parties and the normalization of relations between our two parties. Therefore the normalization of relations between our two parties did not happen now but in the morning." Zhao Ziyang then went on to say: "The First Plenum of the 13th CPC Central Committee made a formal decision that Deng Xiaoping would still be needed to steer the course when important issues should be involved." After seeing this news on television I said to several deputy directors that these remarks would make things worse, and that although he might have meant well in making the remarks, making the remarks at this point in time would result in having the remarks misunderstood by Deng Xiaoping. Just as expected, the news from Beijing was that the Central Standing Committee had held a meeting, that Deng Xiaoping did not approve of changing the conclusion on the nature of the student movement, and that Zhao Ziyang had resigned. But, on the morning of the 19th Zhao Ziyang still went to visit students on hunger strike at the square. As I learned later, on the night of the 18th the Political Bureau meeting, which lasted to the early hours of the next day, rejected Zhao Ziyang's idea on handling the student movement. After the meeting, Zhao immediately went to visit the students at the square, saying tearfully that he hoped that the students would stop the hunger strike and take care of their health. And he said that he had come too late, and also said sorry to the students. After I learned, while in Hong Kong, that Zhao Ziyang had gone to visit the students at Tiananmen Square, I also decided to visit the Hong Kong students in front of the XINHUA SHE Building for there were also Hong Kong students who were carrying out a sit-in and hunger strike night and day in front of the XINHUA SHE Building. At the scene some reporters asked me about my views on the student movement. I said that I was in total agreement with the views of General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. On the night of that same day (19 May), Li Peng, with a stern face, declared the imposition of martial law on Beijing City. (Installment No. 119)
