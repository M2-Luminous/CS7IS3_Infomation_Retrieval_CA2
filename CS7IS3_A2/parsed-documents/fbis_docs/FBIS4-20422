What is more outstanding is the fact that this was accomplished in face of organizational restructuring and a close to 10 percent reduction in the work force that was diverted. The annual output of nonferrous metals in China grew from an annual output of 13,000 tons during the early years of the Liberation to almost a million tons annual output within 30 years to reach its first step. During the next ten years, from nearly a million tons annual output, the industry grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent to reach the second step marked by an annual output of 2 million tons. From the second step to the third step of 3 million tons annual output, the industry only took five years, growing at an annual rate of 10 percent. Not only did production show rapid growth, the supply of ore resources also continued to be structurally adjusted in accordance with market demand. When market demand was great, the output of aluminum (an abundant resource in China) rose from its already great proportional share of 31.2 percent of the nonferrous metals produced on the second step level to 38 percent. Growth of its absolute output was so great that it had reached 1.22 million tons per annum. As the international market looked encouraging, the output of zinc, which is also assured in China, also rose from its proportional share of total output, from 20 percent to 23 percent. China's nonferrous industry, as a "traditional" industry has the disadvantage of being a single industry utilizing too many workers. Last year the head office for the nonferrous industry diverted the work force in a move to reform the inner structure of enterprises by changing their mode of operation throughout the whole system to increase productivity. They obtained good results. According to statistics from last year's annual report on worker wages, the number of workers in the system under the head office in 1993 was fewer than the number for 1992 by more than 70,000, but productivity was increased by 11.5 percent. Income per capita, after adjustment for inflation on goods sold, rose 7.85 percent over the previous year's figure. After some study and discussion, the Xinan [Southwest] Aluminum Processing Plant separated 12 production subsidiaries and service units from itself. Reorganized and given a social orientation, these units were economic entities that served the plant at the same time. This move separated 2,473 persons from the parent plant. At another group of large enterprises including the Tongling Co., the Yunxi Co., the Guizhou Aluminum Plant, the Shenyang Ore Refining Plant, the Daqing Bureau of Mines, the Jiangxi Copper Company, the Lanzhou Aluminum Plant etc., work force diversion and new enterprise creation were coordinated, whereby the separated workers developed new kinds of start-up business entities. According to statistics from the 838 economic entities completely separated from their parent companies, income from their operations last year grossed 2.7 billion yuan, of which 100.8 million yuan was realized interest tax, and 90 million yuan was net profit.
