The woman arrested in Narathiwat allegedly confessed to setting off a grenade in order to kill an unfaithful lover after arranging to meet him at a noodle stall on the platform of the Nakhon Si Thammarat railway station. She told police the grenade had belonged to her ex-husband, a soldier. Now it seems the authorities have decided to wrap up the case and are willing to rule out the possibility that saboteurs seeking to discredit the government were behind the blast. It comes as no surprise that this woman has been arrested, because ever since the blast police officers including national police chief Pratin Santipraphop have said a "soured love affair" was behind the bombing. [sentence as published] Army chief Wimon Wongwanit also said "an affair" was behind the incident. Whether the woman has been made a scapegoat or not is subject to debate. Several lawyers have already threatened to file defamation suits against police officers who had claimed, allegedly without substantive evidence, that jealousy involving the noodle vendor was the motive behind the blast. The lawyers are representing Sutchai Butngam, the vendor who was one of the three killed and said to be involved in a love triangle. Citing love triangles as reasons for bomb blasts in Thailand is nothing new for the police. In February last year, an ex-soldier was charged with murder after he confessed to sending a parcel bomb which exploded at the Samsen Noi post office, killing a postal officer and injuring five others. The ex-soldier, according to police, intended the parcel bomb for a female department store employee after she had decided to end their relationship in order to marry another man. The accused parcel bomber later claimed he was tortured by police into confessing to a crime he did not commit. There is still a big question mark over whether a failed love affair was behind the Nakhon Si Thammarat blast. Political terrorism should not yet be ruled out as a factor behind last week's tragic incident. If Interior Minister Chawalit Yongchaiyut or the government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai are the targets, then we can expect to see more bombings. There is little doubt that many groups are out to discredit the Chuan government and are just waiting for its collapse so they can get back to business as usual. Under no circumstances should we allow certain elements out to create anarchy in the country to jeopardize our hard-earned democracy. Intelligence gathering by the police and the Fourth Army Region based in the South has to be beefed up. As it is right now, there is a serious gap in the sharing of intelligence information between the police and military in the South. Very often, the Fourth Army Region's intelligence network would be tipped off before certain events occurred. Somehow or another, for reasons best known to themselves, army intelligence is often reluctant to let their police counterparts -- who work with civilians -- in on the information. When a criminal act keeps repeating itself at a certain frequency and innocent lives are lost, the authorities in charge of security have to be more responsible. There are still many gaps in the Nakhon Si Thammarat bombing story and, unless there is watertight evidence, the case at this juncture should not be wrapped up by the authorities in the hope that the public would conveniently forget about it.
