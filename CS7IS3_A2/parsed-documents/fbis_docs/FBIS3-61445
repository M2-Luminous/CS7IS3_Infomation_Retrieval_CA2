This homespun sentence, popular in the recent socialist past, was evidently first spoken by some humorist after vain attempts to restore his health at a public hospital. And it was immediately seized by the broad masses of patients and physicians: Both knew that you can only hope for qualified and quality medical care after you transfer some amount of good cognac from a slack wine store to the physician's office. Now other times have come upon us, and one of the main achievements of socialism, free medicine, is gradually lowing its position in favor of medical care requiring payment. Well, many of our fellow country women know what it means to give birth for free in a conventional Soviet -- I beg your pardon -- Russian maternity hospital. But if it were for money? Would it really be more pleasant? An employee of the Medilyuks, a medical cooperative that I randomly selected from a directory and that is affiliated with the Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Perinatology Scientific Center, who wishes to remain anonymous shared the following information. The Medilyuks rents a building at the center. The cooperative has single- and double-occupancy rooms. There is one nurse and two physicians for every four women. There is one pediatric nurse and physician for every four infants. Each infant compartment contains one newborn. And in the center's free-care department, women lie literally up against the wall in six- to eight-bed rooms, each infant compartment holds six infants, and there is one physician and two nurses for 40 women giving birth and one physician and one nurse for 40 infants. Among the other advantages of births for payment, the Medilyuks workers list single-use instruments. But the bed linens are laundered in the common laundry center. In the cooperative there are individual meals at a a cost of about 1,000 rubles a day (of that amount, 200 rubles goes for the cook's salary), and food is bought to the room. But the main thing is that here births occur in a separate room in the presence of a physician, midwife, hospital attendant, and anesthesiologist. The medical personnel, as my anonymous informant emphasized, have had at least 12 years of work experience. The physicians are all candidates and doctors of medicine from the very same Scientific Center. They ``treat'' in their off time. And now about prices. First visits, depending on the physician's academic degree, cost a mother-to-be about 3,000 to 3,500 rubles. Repeat visits are less expensive -- only 2,000-2,500. Service for the course of a week in cases of physiological (that is, normal) births costs 150,000 rubles. In cases of pathological births and cesarean section, the cost is 50 percent higher. But a mother giving birth will remain in the hospital for 10-11 days. ``Is this really expensive?'' the cooperative employee asked me. If you consider the mad course of the dollar, of course it isn't. Normal births cost on the order of 150 ``greenbacks.'' But if you take the average Russia salary, not exactly every woman will be lining up at the Medilyuks. But in actuality there is a line. The cooperative can only service six women giving birth at a time -- that is the number of beds. Not every woman can end up as part of the ``magnificent six'': Only women who have reached their 37th week of pregnancy and who have no type of infection can enter the Medilyuks. And if you are a woman who has some pathology and there is no guarantee of a live birth, you cannot give birth in the cooperative for any amount of money. In the normal way and in the public hospital, please. It seems that the receiving physicians do not want to risk the name of their precious enterprise. And indeed, I repeat that they are the same people who deliver babies during the day free of charge as employees of the government medical institution. Two or three shifts in the cooperative can cover their monthly government salary. According to this scheme, free medicine is doomed to obscurity. But medical care requiring payment does not offer any guarantees. Everything will still be ``as with them.'' Really, people turn to medical offices requiring payment in the hope of receiving the full attention and qualified assistance of a physician -- something they are deprived of in government polyclinics and hospitals. They go there, and they meet the very same specialists. This is all strange....But it is nevertheless necessary to give birth. ``Think for yourself, decide for yourself'' when and how.
