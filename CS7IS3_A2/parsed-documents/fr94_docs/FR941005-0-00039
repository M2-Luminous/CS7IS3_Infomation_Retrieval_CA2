FR941005-0-00039 FR941005-0-00011 B. Over-utilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. Delisting of the Arctic peregrine falcon will not result in the over-utilization of the subspecies for the following reasons. All Falco peregrinus found in the wild in the conterminous 48 States are listed as endangered due to similarity of appearance. Therefore, take of arctic peregrine falcons migrating through the conterminous 48 States will be prohibited by the Act. Additionally, the take of all migratory birds, including arctic peregrine falcons, is governed by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the corresponding regulations codified in 50 CFR Part 21. Migratory bird regulations allow for the take of wild peregrine falcons subsequent to obtaining a permit, for recreational, scientific, and educational purposes, but require that harvest is limited to levels that prevent over-utilization. C. Disease or predation. Although individuals may be vulnerable to disease or predation, these factors are not known to affect arctic peregrine falcons at the population level. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. Arctic peregrine falcons will remain protected by the similarity of appearance provision of the Act while in the conterminous 48 States as long as other subspecies occurring in this area remain listed. This protection will not extend beyond such time that other peregrine falcons occurring in those areas are removed from the list of endangered and threatened wildlife. Arctic peregrine falcons are also protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which governs the taking, killing, possessing, transportation, and importation of migratory birds, their eggs, parts, and nests. A more thorough discussion of the protection offered by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act is included in the Effects of This Rule section below. In addition to Federal laws governing the taking of arctic peregrine falcons within the United States, international agreements govern the transport of arctic peregrine falcons across international borders. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) is an international agreement that regulates trade in species threatened with extinction and those that may become threatened if trade is not regulated. The arctic peregrine falcon is currently listed under Appendix I of CITES, and, as a result, international trade in arctic peregrine falcons is restricted by the United States and 122 other signatory nations. This final rule only affects United States domestic endangered species law and does not result in removal of arctic peregrine falcons from Appendix I of CITES. E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. There is general agreement within the scientific community that contamination with organochlorine pesticides was the principal factor responsible for the decline of arctic peregrine falcons. The population decline was likely a result of both reproductive impairment from sublethal dosage and direct mortality from lethal dosage, although the relative importance of those two factors remains unknown. Change in population size, therefore, is the best indicator of the total impact of pesticides because population size is affected by both direct mortality, which is extremely difficult to measure in wild populations, and reproductive impairment, which is more easily quantified in the wild. The consistent growth in arctic peregrine falcon numbers since the late 1970's, previously discussed in the Background section of this rule, provides the strongest supporting evidence that organochlorine pesticides no longer pose a threat at the population level. The use of organochlorine pesticides was restricted in the United States and Canada in the early 1970's. Their use in Latin America continues, however, and some arctic peregrine falcons undoubtedly winter in areas where organochlorines are currently used. It has been shown, by comparing blood samples collected during fall and spring migration, that migrant peregrine falcons accumulate pesticides while wintering in Latin America (Henny et al . 1982). Additionally, some of the avian prey utilized by arctic peregrine falcons during the summer in arctic and subarctic areas also winter in Latin America. Many of these prey return to their northern nesting areas with pesticide residues accumulated during the winter (Fyfe et al. 1990). Peregrine falcons preying upon these birds during the summer are thus further exposed to Latin American pesticides. Pesticide use in Latin America, however, may never have been great enough to cause a decline in the number of arctic peregrine falcons. The widespread reproductive failure and population crash coincided with the period of heavy organochlorine use in the United States, and a noticeable increase in productivity occurred in Alaska within a few years following restrictions on the use of organochlorines in the United States. Furthermore, the exposure of arctic peregrine falcons to organochlorines continues to decrease. Average DDE residues in blood collected from peregrine falcons during spring migration in Texas decreased 38 percent between 1978&hyph;1979 and 1984 (Henny et al . 1988). Pesticide residues in arctic peregrine falcon eggs have decreased similarly. A sample of eggs from 9 clutches collected in arctic Alaska in 1968 averaged (geometric mean, wet weight basis) 23.5 ppm DDE with a maximum of 99 ppm (Jeff Lincer, BioSystems Analysis, pers. comm., in litt ., 1992). By the late 1970's to early 1980's, the average DDE concentration in eggs collected from 19 clutches had declined to 9.3 ppm with a maximum of 46.4 ppm (unpubl. Service data, on file in Fairbanks, Alaska). In 1990&hyph;1991, eggs from 13 clutches averaged 3.3 ppm with a maximum of 5.3 ppm (unpubl. Service data, Fairbanks, Alaska). Similar trends were observed in Canada. Residues in eggs collected in arctic Canada averaged 9.9 ppm DDE in 1965&hyph;1972 (maximum 72.0); 8.5 ppm in 1973&hyph;1979 (max. 19.6); and 6.8 ppm (max. 18.5) in 1980&hyph;1986 (Peakall et al . 1990). Eggs from 36 clutches collected at Rankin Inlet, NWT, in 1981&hyph;1986 averaged 7.6 ppm DDE (Court et al . 1990). Eggs collected in Greenland between 1972 and 1978 averaged 12.8 ppm DDE (Burnham and Mattox 1984), but by 1981 and 1982 the maximum (average not given) in 9 eggs was 9.1 ppm (Mattox and Seegar 1988). To put these values in perspective, concentrations of DDE in peregrine falcon eggs in excess of 15 to 20 ppm (parts per million, wet weight basis) are associated with high rates of nesting failure; if residues average less than this critical level, productivity is usually sufficient to maintain population size (Peakall et al . 1975; Newton et al . 1989). Residues of other organochlorines in arctic peregrine falcon eggs have also decreased since the 1970's, and residues are currently well below concentrations associated with reproductive impairment or population declines.
