WARNING: ATTN USVIENNA FOR IAEA FBIS TRENDS-KOREA North, South Agree on Summit, DPRK Upbeat on U.S. Talks North, South Agree on Summit, DPRK Upbeat on U.S. Talks SUMMARY With a swiftness that clearly reflected both sides' eagerness to defuse the crisis on the Korean peninsula, the North and South have agreed to hold the first ever inter-Korean summit next month in Pyongyang. The summit agreement comes in the wake of Pyongyang's upbeat assessment of the prospects for U.S.-North Korea high-level talks scheduled to begin in Geneva early in July. Underscoring its desire for better relations with Washington, Pyongyang has muted its commemoration of the Korean war anniversary. END SUMMARY Judging from the initial reporting by Pyongyang and Seoul media, both sides seemed to have made concessions in adopting an agreement at the 28 June vice-premier-level meeting held to pave the way for the summit (Pyongyang radio, Yonhap, 28 June): + The North accepted the South's proposal that the meeting between ROK President Kim Yong-sam and DPRK President Kim Il-song take place from 25 to 27 July, thereby giving up a propaganda opportunity. The North had insisted on 15 August, the date Pyongyang uses to stage a joint North-South celebration marking Korea's liberation from Japan, an event to which the North perennially invites South Korean dissidents and the South prevents them from attending. + The South accepted Pyongyang as the venue for the summit without an explicit pledge that a second summit will be held in Seoul on "principle of reciprocity." The agreement calls for the following round of talks to be "decided" on by the two presidents. + The agreement stipulates that both sides "make joint efforts" to build an atmosphere conducive to the summit, presumably keeping Seoul from openly pressing for international sanctions against the North and binding Pyongyang to refrain from extreme vituperation against the South. In addition, the agreement calls for working-level contacts, to start on 1 July, to hammer out procedural and logistic matters. Further underscoring the eagerness with which both sides attempted to avoid controversy and make rapid progress toward defusing the current crisis, the agreement conspicuously avoided listing any summit agenda, thus leaving it unclear, at least on paper, what the two leaders will be discussing when they meet. In the annals of inter-Korean dialogue, the North and South have frequently engaged in bitter and prolonged wrangling over agendas, often resulting in the failure of bilateral talks. DPRK-U.S. Talks The agreement on an inter-Korean summit comes on the heels of Pyongyang's upbeat assessments of the upcoming DPRK-U.S. talks, slated to start on 8 July in Geneva (KCNA, 27 June). In the first confirmation of earlier Western reporting on former U.S. President Carter's recent visit to Pyongyang, a 23 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement said that during the visit President Kim Il-song had made a proposal on the nuclear issue (KCNA). The statement described President Kim Il-song's proposal as an "important" one containing "well-intentioned measures" Pyongyang will take to "break the present deadlock" between Pyongyang and Washington and reach a "fundamental solution" of the nuclear issue. It also said that the Kim Il- song proposal led to agreement on the upcoming bilateral talks and claimed that President Clinton has "welcomed" the North Korean stand and pledged to formally withdraw the discussion of sanctions at the UN Security Council. The spokesman's statement also expressed hope that the talks will result in a "fundamental solution" of the nuclear issue and an improvement of bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently, a 25 June Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement hinted at a possible resolution of the issue of opening up two suspected nuclear sites that the international community insists could yield important clues to North Korea's history of past nuclear reprocessing activity. Criticizing alleged insistence by South Korea and Japan on a "special inspection" of the sites, the spokesman linked the resolution of this issue to conf idence- building between Pyongyang and Washington. As the upcoming bilateral talks proceed "successfully and confidence is built" between the two parties, the spokesman said, the issue of past reprocessing will be resolved "naturally." War Anniversary Clearly seeking to provide an favorable atmosphere for bilateral talks, Pyongyang has, for the third year in a row, toned down its commemoration of the 25 June anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war. Pyongyang media have again conspicuously refrained from reporting on any anti-U.S. rallies in North Korea that have traditionally kicked off a monthlong "anti-U.S. struggle" period. Moreover, in a move that signified further downgrading of the war anniversary, Pyongyang radio has, for the first time, failed to broadcast the commemorative editorial carried by the party paper Nodong Sinmun. The North Korean news agency KCNA, however, carried a summary of the editorial as usual (25 June). Far from being belligerent, the KCNA summary of the editorial called on Washington to end the confrontation with Pyongyang and on Seoul to work toward unification so as to avoid the repetition of "the disaster." However, apparently in anticipation of Seoul's release of Korean war related Russian documents, which ROK President Kim reportedly received from Russian President Yeltsin during his recent trip to Moscow (ITAR-Tass, Yonhap, 2 June), the editorial revived the claim that the United States started the war. Moreover, Pyongyang radio in a 27 June commentary underscored this point, claiming that Washington "planned, prepared for, and provoked" the Korean war. According to the South Korean press agency Yonhap, the Russian documents reportedly "prove" that the North invaded the South (2-10 June). Implications Pyongyang may calculate that in the worst case scenario the scheduled inter-Korean summit could provide the North with a fallback position should the Geneva talks fail. However, by placing the prestige of Kim Il-song behind the current push for DPRK-U.S. talks, Pyongyang seems to be projecting optimism for their success at least for now. (AUTHOR: YIM.
