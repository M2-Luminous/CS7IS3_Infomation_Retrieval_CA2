The IAEA and Pyongyang still adhere to opposite views on the possibility of inspecting the two North Korean installations, where, the agency suspects, work is under way to create a nuclear bomb. In such a situation, the possibility of the sides' reaching a compromise appears unlikely. Pyongyang "has neither the capability nor the wish to create a bomb" In an exclusive interview with KOMMERSANT-DAILY, North Korea ambassador to Russia, Comrade Son Song-pil stated that Pyongyang, contrary to U.S. assertions, "has neither the capability nor the wish to create a bomb." Up until recently, he noted, the United States, in an effort to justify the conduct of military exercises and to preserve its contingent in the south of the Korean Peninsula, has talked about a threat to South Korea on the part of the USSR and the DPRK. Now there is no USSR, and Washington needs "new excuses." "The essence of the North Korean nuclear problem," the ambassador said, was explained by Great Leader Comrade Kim Il-song in his New Year speech: It is the "product of U.S. hostile policy." Pyongyang, however, believes that the problem can be resolved only through negotiations with the United States. According to Son Song-pil, immediately after the consultations, a general outline for resolving the problem was delineated. The DPRK promised to suspend its withdrawal from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty, stop using the nuclear reactor with graphite moderator, and freeze all nuclear programs. Washington for its part promised to abandon the policy of "threatening the DPRK" by stopping its joint Team Spirit military exercises with South Korea. At the same time, Pyongyang will agree to IAEA inspection "on a limited scale." As the ambassador noted, however, the IAEA has again "irresponsibly" demanded a full-scale inspection, which does not correspond to North Korea's "special status" under the nonproliferation treaty. The United States, the diplomat believes, not only is not seeking to adjust the IAEA's position, but has actually renounced the obligations it assumed earlier, thereby violating the principle of using a comprehensive approach in dealing with the problem. And now, according to the ambassador, Pyongyang is right to abandon its promises (although the decision to suspend the withdrawal from the treaty still stands). As for the economic sanctions, the DPRK, "which has a powerful industry, will not be stifled." The United States, in the ambassador's opinion, may try to exert pressure by military methods. Washington has already announced its intention to deploy Patriot missiles in South Korea and hold new exercises analogous to Team Spirit. In this event the DPRK, according to the diplomat, will take "adequate measures" (he did not specify which). Son Song-pil also stated that even in the event of a full-scale inspection (which will become possible only after Pyongyang has returned to the nonproliferation treaty), North Korea will not admit the IAEA to the two installations it wants to inspect. He explained that only nuclear installations are subject to inspection, while these two are not such. [passage omitted]
