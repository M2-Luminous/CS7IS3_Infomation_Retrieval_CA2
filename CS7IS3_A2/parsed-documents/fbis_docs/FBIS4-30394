"We have discussions going on, and there is a Naples Summit. Those are two interesting but unrelated events," said Robert Rubin, director of the White House National Economic Council. Officials from the two countries have been negotiating almost continuously over the past month in an effort to mend their strained trade ties, which have roiled financial and currency markets. They have expressed hope of hammering out a deal prior to the Naples Summit, which is scheduled for July 8-10. The prospect, however, has become murky in view of the political turmoil in Tokyo that has engulfed the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata. Rubin, who briefed reporters on the agenda of the G-7 summit, sought to steer away from any comment on the prospect of a trade agreement with Japan, saying it would "not be fruitful, useful or productive" to comment on prospects while negotiations are in progress. The so-called "framework" trade negotiations focus on how to measure progress of imports to Japan as part of a Japanese commitment to improve the access of foreign products in the Japanese market. Rubin, who serves as the top economic aide to President Bill Clinton, also declined to make any comment on the turbulence in the currency markets following a sharp fall of the dollar. "In our view, we should have a single person commenting (on exchange rates). The single person clearly should be the secretary of treasury," Rubin said. The currency upheaval, which Clinton described as "puzzling," prompted the monetary authorities of the major industrial countries to launch a massive operation Friday to support the dollar by direct intervention in currency markets. In a statement that acknowledged the concerted dollar-buying operation, estimated at 2-3 billion dollars, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the turbulence in currency markets has become a matter of "shared concern" among monetary authorities in the G-7 and other developed countries. Commenting on the dollar's fall during a trip to Missouri, Clinton said, "this is a development that is puzzling a lot of economists." Stressing that the U.S. economy "is performing so well," Clinton said that "in a funny way the currency values are running in the opposite direction of economic strength." Rubin said he expects the G-7 leaders to discuss policy coordination on both macro and microeconomic issues at the Naples Summit but declined to say whether exchange-rate issues will be on the agenda. The Naples Summit will bring together government leaders from Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and Russia. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has been invited to join the G-7 leaders as a "full participant" after the summit leaders complete the economic part of their agenda and move on to political issues, a senior U.S. official said.
