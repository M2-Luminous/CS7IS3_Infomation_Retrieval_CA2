[Muhammad] I am against the dialogue of rifles, tanks, aircraft, guns, and rockets. I support the fraternal and peaceful dialogue that could lead to a solution and possibly to a relaxation in the Yemeni situation. I made some proposals and stated some ideas to contain the crisis in Yemen last year and this year. I made my latest proposals one month ago. Regrettably, this initiative and these sincere and honest efforts collided with some irresponsible stances. [Abu-al-Majd] Who do you mean? [Muhammad] I cannot say now who is responsible. But it was not only my initiative that was rejected, but also other Arab and international initiatives that could have contained the crisis in Yemen had there been a positive response to them. Battles are raging today and everyone will be harmed by these battles in which every weapon of destruction -- naval, land, air weapons, and Scud missiles -- is used. The winner in these battles is a loser. This is why I say that returning to understanding and dialogue in Yemen is the only way to solve the country's crisis. [Abu-al-Majd] Who is responsible for making the situation in Yemen so grave? [Muhammad] Everyone is responsible for the eruption of the fighting and for the Yemeni people's tragedy. We are not discussing who fired the first bullet or who caused the crisis to erupt. We are discussing the consequences of this mad and destructive war that could damage the Yemeni people's gains, security, stability, and also the stability of the region. [Abu-al-Majd] Now that the situation has erupted in this way, what, in your view, as a son of Yemen and as an observer who is remote from events, is the means of stopping this bloodshed? Can you specify? [Muhammad] I first call for halting the bloodshed in Yemen and urge caring about Yemen's unity. I reject secession and the fighting in Yemen and advocate a return to the dialogue that could contain the crisis. Some people might ask with whom can we have a dialogue today. I tell them that we can search for the parties that might reach an understanding and solve the crisis. [Abu-al-Majd] Who are these parties? [Muhammad] I do not want to name names but it is known that there are three parties in the ruling coalition. There is also the dialogue committee that comprises the political forces in Yemen. [Abu-al-Majd] But this committee has achieved nothing. It was the one that drew up the Pledge and Accord Document but failed to achieve the required result. How can it achieve anything now when battles are raging? [Muhammad] I agree with you that the committee achieved the Pledge and Accord Document. But the committee has played no role in implementing this document. [Abu-al-Majd] Was this the fault of the committee or of the parties to the current conflict? [Muhammad] I believe the coalition committee is not responsible for the nonimplementation, because the three ruling parties are the decisionmakers in Yemen. [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to visit Yemen and work out a new solution? [Muhammad] I am quite prepared to visit Yemen and help the leadership find a solution if this would serve the public interest and the supreme interest of the Yemeni people. I am also prepared to offer sacrifices for the sake of the Yemeni people. [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think the current situation in Yemen dictates that you should visit Yemen now? [Muhammad] The situation dictates that all the good people, whether Yemenis, Arab brothers, or friends, should be there now. I believe that every concerted effort must be made to enable Yemen to ride out its crisis and ordeal and end the bloodshed and destruction. [Abu-al-Majd] Are you prepared to coordinate positions with some Arab sides, like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates [UAE] or others, to take a new initiative to end the situation? [Muhammad] Personally, I am ready to carry out any effort, whether with my brothers in Egypt or the UAE, any effort that is bound to contain the crisis and solve the problem in Yemen. I am also ready to coordinate efforts on the Arab and international levels to resolve the crisis in Yemen. But what matters is that the political leadership there should respond to such initiatives, because many initiatives taken by our brothers and friends did not succeed in view of the various stances. [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say that Arab forces should be sent there to disengage the two warring sides. But the political leadership in Sanaa said that this is an internal dispute and does not necessitate this. [Muhammad] This proposal has [words indistinct] the views of the political leadership in Yemen. I previously stressed the need for Arab efforts and welcomed the initiative taken by Egypt and the UAE. I also welcomed the initiative carried out by the Arab League secretary general to send a committee to Yemen to follow up the developments there and help work out a solution. [Abu-al-Majd] Do you think that unity could survive amid such circumstances? [Muhammad] The current events in Yemen will cause a deep wound in the body of Yemeni unity and in the heart of the Yemeni people, even the Arab people. This is because the unity does not only concern the Yemeni people; it concerns the entire Arab nation as well. [Abu-al-Majd] Some people say the unity was founded on the wrong basis, because the military, economic, and political institutions did not unite. Do you concur? [Muhammad] I would like to say that the unity [word indistinct] for the Yemeni people. But Yemen experienced difficulties, problems, and crises in the absence of unity. That is why the Yemeni leadership sought unity to avoid all these crises. But various attempts were carried out to avoid unity. I support every effort made to solve the problems that cropped up in the absence of unity. You cannot solve problems by avoiding unity. The [words indistinct] and accord summed up the crisis in Yemen and defined the solutions to the crisis. [Abu-al-Majd] Thank you, 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former president of south Yemen. [Muhammad] Many thanks to the Voice of the Arabs, the voice of the Arab nation.
