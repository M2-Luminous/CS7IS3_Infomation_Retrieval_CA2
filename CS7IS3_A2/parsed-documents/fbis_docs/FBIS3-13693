In a statement it issued today, the NPUG notes with deepest feelings of resentment that this U.S. statement in support of the policy of aggression and the annexation of the occupied territories comes at a time when world public opinion is unanimously condemning the criminal massacre that Israel committed at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque. The NPUG called on the Arab League and the Islamic Conference Organization to adopt a firm stand on this new escalation of the attacks on the rights and dignities of the Arabs and Muslims.
