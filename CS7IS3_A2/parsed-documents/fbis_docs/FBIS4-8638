Slobodan Milosevic is expected to hold talks with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, cochairmen of the Geneva conference, this evening. In the meantime, President Karadzic held a news conference [words indistinct]. [Correspondent] What did you talk about with Mr. Milosevic? [Karadzic] We discussed the newly created situation, the crisis, and so forth, and, of course, our usual issues. [Correspondent] Are there any signs of progress (?concerning) this proposal. [Karadzic] We will see. It appears that the international community is currently most aggravated with us breaking off relations with the UN. We will see whether our supreme command will change something in this respect tomorrow. [Correspondent] Lord Owen stated that you have accepted in principle to meet Mr. Akashi, which means the civil sector, in order to maintain contacts. [Karadzic] Not to maintain contacts. We agreed to meet Mr. Akashi tomorrow and to tell him what the stand of our supreme command is. Whether there will be any contacts with the civil sector will depend on the stand of the supreme command. [Correspondent] In view of agency reports on the situation around Tuzla and Doboj, can you tell us briefly what is happening there. [Karadzic] First of all, I will tell you what is happening around Gorazde. The first nice day that facilitated the flights of NATO U.S. planes was used by the Muslim forces to try to drive us from the right bank of the Drina. They launched an offensive. They set off in large numbers at our positions and our forces from the left bank, over the bridges, probably expecting to receive the support of U.S. aircraft. Regarding Doboj, the town is constantly being shelled and we are having civilian casualties all the time. Fortunately, most of the casualties are wounded and not dead. Finally, we have an offensive on almost all the fronts, near Kupres, Srbobran, that is formerly Gornji Vakuf [name as heard: Donji Vakuf is what the Serbs call Srbobran], and Teslic. The fiercest offensive is between Teocak and Zvornik, via Kladanj and Olovo all the way to Ilijas. In other words, this is an all-out offensive. They pulled out about 20,000 troops from Sarajevo because there is peace in Sarajevo now. They were obliged to keep these troops in Sarajevo, but they pulled them out and deployed them on other fronts. Regarding Tuzla, transport planes have been landing there for days and they are bringing military materiel. We warned them. The airport is not open. It will be open only in accordance with our agreement with President Yeltsin and his special envoy Churkin, and finally with Mr. Kozyrev. Before that, the airport must not be misused for military purposes. It must not be misused after the opening either. It should be opened for humanitarian purposes only. Two transport planes were preparing to land today. We warned them not to land. We thought it better to warn them than to shoot them down. [Correspondent] Mr. Karadzic, just one more question. Mr. Churkin today stated that he had conveyed to you some proposals regarding the global settlement of the crisis and that he expected an answer from you. Can you tell us something about that. [Karadzic] There are some proposals, there are some proposals that could even lead to total peace. Not immediately, of course, to the political solution, but total peace could perhaps facilitate a speedy political solution. We will examine these proposals and see what can.... [Correspondent] Are the cease-fire and the end to hostilities possible at all on the entire territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not, as you said, only in some parts? Is this possible? [Karadzic] A partial cease-fire is impossible. The cease-fire on the entire territory would be desirable and possible. It cannot be done partially, because if they attack us in Olovo we will attack all their other positions. In other words, we have the right to defend ourselves and to launch counteroffensives on all points. Regarding the halting of hostilities, we take the view that we should reach an agreement on that. Of course, one must understand that the sanctions on Yugoslavia are an act of aggression and that if the hostilities are to be halted, then the sanctions should also be lifted.
