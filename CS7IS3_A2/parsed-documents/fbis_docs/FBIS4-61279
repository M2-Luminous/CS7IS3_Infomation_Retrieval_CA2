The meeting is being held in a constructive and friendly atmosphere, said Russian Deputy Chief of Staff Dmitriy Kharchenko today. In an interview with ITAR-TASS Kharchenko said that the sides exchanged opinions on problems of European security, the situation in Bosnia, Russia's joining the Partnership for Peace programme, nuclear weapons in Ukraine and prospects for the development of contacts between the armed forces of the two countries. General Kharchenko pointed out that the Pentagon delegation led by the U.S. defence secretary's aide for issues of nuclear security, Ashton Carter, displayed a particular interest in cooperation in ensuring nuclear security, the reduction and elimination of weapons of mass destruction. The Russian delegation to the talks led by the Russian defence minister's aide for military politics, Gennadiy Ivanov, informed the American side about the Russian Duma's stance on joint Russo-U.S. exercises of peace-keeping forces scheduled to be held at a Totsk test site in the Orenburg region in May. Pentagon officials believe that it is important to explain to Russian lawmakers that similar exercises are scheduled to be conducted next time on the American soil. The U.S. point of view will be brought to the notice of the Russian military and political leadership, Kharchenko said. The meeting between the two working groups of the U.S. and Russian defence departments continues.
