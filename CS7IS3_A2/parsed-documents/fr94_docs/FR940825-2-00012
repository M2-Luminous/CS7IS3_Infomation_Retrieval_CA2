FR940825-2-00012 FR940825-2-00008 Comment 5: With respect to warranty expenses, Sandvik maintains that the Department based its calculation of U.S. warranty expenses on the mistaken belief that Sandvik failed to report U.S. warranty expenses in its response. Contrary to the Department's belief, Sandvik maintains that all warranty-related costs, consisting of the cost of reworking defective merchandise and the transportation costs associated with returning the merchandise to the factory and reshipping the reworked merchandise, were included in the cost and expense data submitted in its responses. According to Sandvik, reworking costs are indistinguishable from normal production costs and are accumulated in cost centers with other costs associated with further manufacturing. Thus, Sandvik maintains that reworking costs are fully accounted for in the direct labor and factory burden components of Sandvik's conversion costs. Accordingly, Sandvik argues there is no need to create a separate adjustment for costs incurred in reworking defective merchandise. With respect to the freight expenses for returned merchandise and reshipment of reworked merchandise, Sandvik claims that these expenses were included in its total freight calculation. Thus, to the extent the Department deducted total freight expense from the U.S. price (USP), it must not deduct separate freight expenses pertaining to return of defective and reshipment of reworked merchandise. In addition, Sandvik characterizes the Department's calculation of warranty expense as inappropriate since it is based on the total value of returned defective merchandise and the cost of reworking defective merchandise. Sandvik maintains that the value of returned merchandise does not constitute an expense incurred by the company because defective merchandise is not discarded or scrapped at the company's expense, but rather is reworked and either returned to the customer or placed in inventory for sale to another customer. Thus, Sandvik claims that the company only incurs the cost of reworking the merchandise and the cost of return freight, which therefore constitute the entire amount of U.S. warranty expenses. Sandvik claims that these warranty-related expenses were fully reported and have been deducted elsewhere in the cost and expense data. Thus, any additional deduction would be unfair and impermissible double-counting of warranty expenses for U.S. sales. Department's Position To the extent that freight expenses, pertaining to the return of defective merchandise and reshipment of reworked merchandise, were part of Sandvik's total freight expense, we agree that such expenses should not be included in U.S. warranty expenses since they have already been deducted from USP. Thus, we have adjusted the warranty expense accordingly. We disagree with Sandvik, however, that USP need not be adjusted for the cost of reworking the defective merchandise based upon Sandvik's contention that these costs are already part of the total cost of production. Inclusion of reworking costs in the cost of production by itself has no impact on the calculation of dumping margins. Rather, dumping margins are primarily price-based calculations, and therefore prices net of warranty expenses are essential for apples-to-apples comparisons. Hence, the Department has adjusted USP for warranty expenses. In addition, since Sandvik did not separately report the cost of reworking defective merchandise, we continued to use, as BIA, the value of the returned merchandise to represent Sandvik's warranty expenses. Comment 6: Sandvik claims that the Department incorrectly treated expenses pertaining to transportation of merchandise from the U.S. port to Sandvik's U.S. factory as an element of further manufacturing contributing to U.S. value added, rather than as a cost of the imported input. Sandvik claims that, by attributing these movement expenses to U.S. further manufacturing costs rather than to the cost of the imported redraw hollow, the Department artificially increased the amount of U.S. value added, and thus allocated too large a share of profit to U.S. further manufacturing. Second, Sandvik maintains that this method of allocation is inconsistent with the antidumping statute and the Department's regulations. Citing both section 772(e)(3) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.41(e), Sandvik contends that both authorities direct the Department to reduce exporter's sales price (ESP) by any increased value ``resulting from a process of manufacture or assembly performed on the imported merchandise,'' which does not specifically include the cost of moving the component or product from the port to its factory.
