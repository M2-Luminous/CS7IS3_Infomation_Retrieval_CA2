FR941122-1-00006 FR941122-1-00001 On June 11, 1982, the Department published a rule at 47 FR 25496 to implement section 129 of Public Law 96&hyph;249, which allowed enhanced FFP at the 75 percent level for costs associated with the planning, design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems. On January 19, 1994, the Department published another final rule at 59 FR 2725 which reduced the Federal reimbursement rate to the 63 percent level effective October 1, 1991 for system proposals which were approved on or after November 28, 1990 unless the State had an approved Advance Planning Document and had submitted an Implementation Advance Planning Document with all the paperwork required for approval prior to November 28, 1990. The requirements and procedures for State agencies for system development at both the enhanced and standard rates of funding were codified in 7 CFR 277.18 of Food Stamp Program Rules. Section 13961 of the Leland Act amends Section 16 of the Food Stamp Act to reduce the rate of Federal funding for system development to the regular 50 percent rate. The change in rates is effective, by law, on April 1, 1994. The new rate applies to costs associated with the planning, design, development, acquisition, or installation of ADP systems. The change in the funding rate applies to new proposals as well as proposals approved prior to April 1, 1994 at the enhanced rate of either 75 or 63 percent. Previously approved projects will continue to be reimbursed at the enhanced rate for costs incurred, as defined in the Background section of this preamble, only through March 31, 1994. The Federal reimbursement rate will then drop to the regular 50 percent rate for the time remaining in the approval period. Modifications on or after April 1, 1994 to existing systems will be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent rate. All new systems developed on or after April 1, 1994 will be reimbursed at the regular 50 percent rate.
