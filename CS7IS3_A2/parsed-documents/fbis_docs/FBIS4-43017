"It was a tactical conversion, for the purpose of pressing forward with our struggles and our values," explains Alessandro Ambrosini, 22, a political science student at the University of Padua, who wears his beard and hair in the style of Che Guevara despite his "Naziskin" past and his predilection for Roman salutes, which he says "are for us what the clenched fist is for the Left." He was welcomed with open arms, among other things because the Front in only a few weeks "reached 150 members" and because these young men with their "testicles of marble" had made a noteworthy contribution to the MSI [Italian Socialist Movement] election campaign in Vicenza with their frenzied activism, which consisted of composing handwritten manifestoes at night and devoting entire days to distributing fliers door to door. Alessandro Ambrosini in this way obtained his stripes as secretary of the Youth Front and also the esteem of the party's top leadership, in addition to a provincial notoriety as an artist, because Alessandro and his friends--with their "Black Rats" rock group--were preparing for the Sanremo festival. But his heart yearned for the surroundings that he had frequented ever since his teenage years, and for the Naziskins, with whom "you get together on Saturday night, at the discotheque or the beer hall." And the rallies in Vicenza--with the Roman salutes and the swastikas--held an irrestible attraction for Alessandro. He preferred street demonstrations to a career in the party. They had warned him in the federation, but he went there anyway in the company of his friend Piero Puschiavo, the acknowledged head of the Vicenza Naziskins. "It is a friendship that I am not going to repudiate. Piero is a valiant fellow--a working man, not the head of a gang. They have constructed a myth in an effort to discredit him." Puschiavo's parents are of the same opinion, and greet with insults and threats any journalists who approach their little house in Gambellara. Piero does not talk to the press and has made only one telephone call to IL GIORNALE DI VICENZA: "My fellow residents of Vicenza," he said, "need not worry. We are not going to organize new street demonstrations. The autonomists are allowed to hold them, so why aren't we? We certainly did not want to cause all this uproar." [Ambrosini] I have marched with my comrades to demand justice. I am participating personally, as a gesture of solidarity in opposition to the attacks by the autonomists, which have gone unpunished. I have had to resign from the party, in anticipation of my expulsion, but I repudiate nothing. Certain values must be defended. [Nava] Even racial hatred, Mussolini, Hitler, and Hess? [Ambrosini] The Italian Naziskins are different from the German ones. We oppose violence against immigrants; we are fighting to save our European culture. That is different. The Naziskins are not empty heads, as Fini says. We are also putting some good ideas into practice. [Nava] Such as? [Ambrosini] Such as the fight against drugs and crime; the campaign against homosexual marriages; and a reassessment of the Republic of Salo, not as a historical event that cannot be repeated but as a set of ideals, of universal values. The fascist style, let us say. [Nava] And also the denial of the Holocaust. [Ambrosini] I have read Irwin, but I do not agree with him. It is not possible to deny the Holocaust. Nor do I agree with anti-Semitism. My friend Puschiavo is of the same opinion. [Nava] Fortunately. From what you say, however, the National Alliance is a little too confining for you. [Ambrosini] We underwent a conversion; we were won over to a softer [preceding word in English] language. We understood Fini's tactics--which have indeed been successful--but I cannot agree with the content of the new policy line. The values of the Social Movement have been betrayed. Fortunately, Gianfranco Fini has at least remembered to say that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the century. It has all been heard before, however. I will not be able to reenter the party. [Nava] But they had warned you. [Ambrosini] To be sure. We had spoken with the provincial secretary on Friday evening, but my feelings got the better of me. I even went to the Blues Bar [preceding two words in English] (the meeting place of the Naziskins--CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note) which the autonomists have destroyed. I even received threatening phone calls and found my name on walls in Vicenza, but the autonomists remained unpunished. There had to be a response; we had to make our voice heard. Do we not live in a democracy?
