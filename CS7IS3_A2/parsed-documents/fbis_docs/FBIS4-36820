Minister Buwayz has categorically denied that the United States or any other party has proposed to Lebanon that it hold separate or collective talks with Israel. He said so far we have not received any new U.S. offer to resume the talks. He stressed that U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Mark Hambley did not discuss this subject during his meetings with Lebanese officials. Nor did the U.S. Ambassdor hint, insinuate, or deliver a message on this subject. Regarding the Palestinian Yusuf Sha'ban, who is accused of assassinating [Jordanian diplomat] Na'ib al-Ma'aytah, and Sha'ban's new confession that he was behind the bombing of the Pan American plane over Lockerbie, Minister Buwayz will leave it to the court to take measures regarding this subject. He noted that judicial proceedings will begin if this claim is true.
