Such goods shall no longer be transported on the Danube. The ban not only applies to ferryboat transports. In this manner, our country is formally complying with the restricted Yugoembargo. This is how Bulgaria itself is actually erecting another barrier obstructing its already weakened foreign economic relations. In addition to this, our country is doing so while perfectly realizing that it cannot expect any advantage whatsoever from its action. There is even more: Quite a few Bulgarian companies that benefited from the cheap river transport faciilities for re-exporting oil products are going to complain. With one stroke they are all practically ostracized as embargo violators. It is not difficult to forecast that the elimination of the Bulgarian competition would be very profitable for some foreign companies -- simply because any vacuum in international trade is easy to fill. The candid enthusiasm with which we recently joined the embargo against Iraq led to losses that are expected to affect our economy for a long time in the future. Hundreds of millions of dollars have vanished somewhere in the course of Desert Storm, as a result of unfulfilled business deals and more than $1 billion were lost as a result of Iraq's unpaid debts toward our country. It appeared at one time that we would be placed at the end of the queue of those waiting for compensation in connection with the Iraqi embargo, but even this was forgotten with time and we never got anything. The act of submissively joining the Yugo-embargo cut off the main route of Bulgarian exports to the West. Transit corridors through Serbia have been opening repeatedly over the last three months, but not even one truck has passed through them. As far as Turkey is concerned, it is about to further complicate the procedure for the transport of oil products and petrol through the straits, after the tragic incident in the Bosphorus. Gas deliveries through Ukrainian territory are frequently causing concern because of the controversies between Russia and the Ukraine, and also because of unsettled accounts. As things are going, we might nostalgically remember some Bulgarian magicians who used to set fire to water and transform it into fuel. After the Danube was closed for petrol barges, no one is talking about compensations. However, even if anyone should mention them, he should immediately remember the lessons of the past. It is interesting to learn, whether anyone knows that compensations should be better sought before one has inflicted his own goal against himself. After we have voluntarily fallen into our own trap, it is difficult to find volunteers willing to rescue us.
