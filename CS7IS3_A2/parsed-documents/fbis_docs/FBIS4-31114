The Croatian Government last night rejected the Slovene Foreign Ministry's proposal that Slovenia take over full control of the Bay of Piran, and Croatia continue the building of the Secovje border crossing near Portoroz. On this occasion, Drnovsek threatened to cancel the official visit of Slovene President Milan Kucan to Croatia and place the Secovje border crossing down the list of priorities. Despite the claims of Prime Minister Drnovsek that Slovenia is opposed to a further exacerbation of relations, the official cancellation of Kucan's visit to Zagreb, scheduled for 7 June, is expected soon. The failure of the Slovene president to depart for Zagreb would represent yet another diplomatic clash between Ljubljana and Zagreb, which until recently were firm allies, and mutual relations would fall to an ever lower level.
