It forecasts a gradual recovery with 1.3 percent growth in the Belgian economy this year and growth of 2.5 percent in the following years (2.5 percent in 1995, 2.6 percent in 1996 and 1997, and 2.7 percent in 1998). There will be a gradual improvement thanks to the recovery in Europe and better prospects for domestic demand despite the negative effects of the overall plan on household incomes. The latter should drop by 0.3 percent this year and only experience limited growth until 1996. The Office estimates that there will be a gradual fall in the present high rate of savings and hence a revival of consumption; the announced drop in interest rates makes investments less attractive and the gradual restoration of a climate of confidence, linked to a more favorable economic environment, makes precautionary reserves of saving less vital. Inflation will remain below 3 percent (2.9 percent in 1994, 2.5 percent in 1995, 2.4 percent in 1996, 2.6 percent in 1997 and 1998). The public finances deficit (central state) will be reduced to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1994, 5.5 percent in 1995, 4.7 percent in 1996, 4.3 percent in 1997, and 3.7 percent in 1998). The Planning Office thinks that one of the most positive results of the overall plan is to achieve both an improvement in social security finances and the net creation of jobs in the medium term. In 1994, more than 20,000 jobs will be lost (a total of 622,000 unemployed); the stabilization of the unemployment rate will come in 1995 thanks to job creation in the enterprises. There will still be 622,000 unemployed in 1998, in other words 14.2 percent of the working population (Planning Office definition). The overall plan should contribute to this "positive" development. Of the 59,000 private jobs created from 1994 to 1998, wage restraint would contribute to 20,000, reductions in contributions and employment promotion would contribute to 28,000, economic growth would contribute to 26,000. Conversely, measures to improve social security finances and tax increases would lead to 15,000 job losses. It is the sector of market services which would increase; in all others, aside from construction, employment would fall. A decrease in jobs in public administrative departments should also be noted (especially in national defense): 600,000 employees in 1998 as against 661,000 in 1990.
