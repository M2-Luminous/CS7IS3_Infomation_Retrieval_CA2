Or, at least, this was not ruled out by Silvio Berlusconi, who at the Confcommercio [General Confederation of Italian Merchants and Shopkeepers] conference yesterday replied with a significant "no comment" to a journalist who asked him explicitly about it. Late yesterday evening his spokesman denied that his silence constituted an expression of assent. But the proper interpretation lies in the axiom on which the prime minister earlier centered his political argument -- that is, that the present electoral law prevents him from governing. The conclusion is that he needs a new electoral law before he can govern. And an electoral law is a pressing necessity only if another election is imminent. In any case, this newspaper has already revealed this desire for an election on Sunday. Today Pilo himself -- the high priest of opinion polls -- recounted to LA REPUBBLICA the long hours spent at [Berlusconi's residence] Arcore evaluating the figures applying to Berlusconi's "magic moment." It is very likely that we are right: If an election were to take place now, especially with a single-round system with no proportional quota, Forza Italia would swallow [League Secretary] Bossi whole and half of [National Alliance leader] Fini, and would undermine the Popular Party a little more. So an election in November would benefit Berlusconi. But, if we may be permitted to ask, would it benefit the country? The first uncertainty that arises concerns the desirability of starting such a debate, which certainly does not constitute evidence of the solidity of the majority, in the midst of a currency crisis in which, in our case, the credibility and reliability of the government are at stake. Perhaps in order to reassure the markets it would have been more advisable to adopt a resolute stance in defense of the treasury minister and his desire to keep public spending under control, even if it means introducing an additional economic package during the course of the year, the unpopularity of which is very easy to predict. The second uncertainty concerns the need for another general election. Usually they are justified -- and the president can only call them for this sole reason -- in the presence of a parliament that is incapable of promulgating laws, without a majority, and unable to provide an alternative. But this does not seem to be the situation, even though Berlusconi has had, and may still have, problems in the Senate. In sincere and even somewhat disarming terms, the leader of the left-wing opposition in the Senate pointed out that hitherto he has had no opportunity to stand "either with or against the government's proposals: We seek them but do not find them." There is some truth in this: The government was sworn in 1 May, and since then not a single measure has been turned down by the opposition. The only upheavals have occurred within the majority itself -- over the INPS [National Social Security Institute] and the RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation]. The third uncertainty concerns the political legitimacy of another election so soon after a historic election conducted under a new electoral system, which raised so many hopes in the majority of Italians, who brought Berlusconi to the Palazzo Chigi [office of the prime minister]. We do not deny that Bossi's bluster may be annoying for the prime minister and -- we fear for the League -- for the voters, too. But so far there has been no more than that -- a great deal of skirmishing, with no substance. For that matter, even in the most radical first-past-the-post system, such as Britain's, poor Mr. Major has to deal with the fringes of his parliamentary base (and they are all Conservatives there; the single party of the Right already exists.) And even in the United States, which elects its head of government directly, Bill Clinton has to earn the vote of each individual Congress member or senator, day after day. Democracies -- including those that emphasize the right of the executive to govern -- are a constant exercise in consensus, both in the country as a whole and in parliament. If only, at least, a new election were not to serve solely to increase what Galli della Loggia in yesterday's CORRIERE DELLA SERA described as "the plebiscitary-charismatic legitimization of the parliamentary majority from above, its exclusive appointment by royal investiture." The government is faced with many things that need to be done, and that need to be done at once. Both what we could call the more traditional things, such as reorganizing the public accounts, deciding how and when to introduce an additional economic package, how and when to impose additional income tax in order to fill the gap created by the ruling on pensions, whether to compensate with an increase in the price of cigarettes for the reimbursement of the 85,000 lire medical tax. And also what we could call more innovative things, comprised in the government's program and based on the economic liberalism which Italy, tired of the Christian Democratic regime, has so clearly shown that it appreciates -- from the million new jobs to the reduction of fiscal pressure. Well, let it do them before airing the possibility of another election. In order to bring his ministers, who too often issue conflicting messages, into line, Berlusconi needs not another election, but simply Article 95 of the Constitution: "The prime minister directs the government's general policy and is responsible for it." In other words, this is his job. If, then, Bossi abandons his lion's roars in favor of parliamentary ambushes, or if what remains of the opposition is able to obstruct the path to the country's recovery and renewal, then the prime minister will be fully entitled to ask the president to call another election. But if that happens, we will at least know why we have been summoned to vote again. Unfortunately we have no idea what Pilo thinks about it, but the impression is that the Italian people are now hungrier for government than they are for the arguments of political scientists about how they are to be governed. It is rather like in [soccer coach] Sacchi's Italy: We would all welcome rather fewer strategic lessons about how to play without a ball and prefer to see a few more balls in the adversary's goal.
