FR940620-1-00008 FR940620-1-00002 The Council commented that §617.2(c) (now §617.2(b)) should define ``management'' as senior management of the institution or the institution's criminal conduct officer/coordinator. The proposed regulation would require that management make the criminal referral. The board of directors of a System institution, which is responsible for the safe and sound operations of that institution, should establish appropriate policies and internal controls for management to comply with these regulations. However, the board would have the discretion to implement the regulation in a manner suited to its institution and could require senior management or the criminal conduct officer/coordinator to make the criminal referral. The Council suggested eliminating §617.2(d), which requires prompt notification, by telephone or other expeditious means, to the appropriate law enforcement agency of situations requiring immediate attention or of ongoing reportable violations. In coordination with other Federal financial regulatory agencies, the FCA included this section to provide for circumstances in which direct telephone or other expeditious communications with the appropriate law enforcement agency would be necessary or appropriate, even though an institution would have begun the referral process required by §617.2(a). While a 30-day notification period may be adequate in many situations, immediate notification would be considered essential when the safety and soundness of an institution may be threatened by potential fraud, losses, or an ongoing criminal activity, when there is a likelihood a suspect will flee, or when key institution personnel are involved. For the foregoing reasons, it does not appear that this section would impose any unnecessary burden on System institutions. C. Section 617.3_Notification of Board of Directors and Bonding Company The Council commented that the regulatory reporting requirement concerning criminal referrals should be left to the discretion of each board of directors, rather than requiring a report to the board of directors by their next scheduled meeting. The intent of this section is to keep the board of directors informed when a known or suspected crime has been committed against the institution. In response to the Council's comment, this section has been amended to require that the board of directors be notified promptly of the filing of any Referral Form by the institution's management. Reporting ``promptly'' to the board of directors means reporting the criminal referral at a regularly scheduled meeting, or earlier if the estimated loss is of such magnitude that it would have a significant impact on the safety and soundness of the institution. Alternatively, reports involving insignificant losses may be summarized and reported periodically at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board. Because violations of Federal criminal statutes may affect the safety and soundness of FCS institutions and/or undermine public confidence in the FCS, a board of directors should be promptly notified of all known or suspected criminal activities. Furthermore, boards of directors should treat this information with the same degree of care and confidentiality as other similar types of information are treated. Additionally, the proposed regulation was amended to provide some discretion in the event a member of the board of directors is the subject of a criminal referral. In this instance, it may be appropriate to seek guidance from legal counsel or other appropriate sources.

For the reasons stated in the preamble, part 617 of chapter VI, title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations is proposed to be revised to read as follows: PART 617_REFERRAL OF KNOWN OR SUSPECTED CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS Sec. 617.1␣Purpose and scope. 617.2␣Referrals. 617.3␣Notification of board of directors and bonding company. 617.4␣Institution responsibilities. Authority: Secs. 5.9, 5.17 of the Farm Credit Act (12 U.S.C. 2243, 2252). §617.1 Purpose and scope. (a) This part applies to all institutions of the Farm Credit System as defined in section 1.2(a) of the Act (12 U.S.C. 2002(a)) including, but not limited to, associations, banks, service corporations chartered under section 4.25 of the Act, the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation, the Farm Credit Leasing Services Corporation, and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (hereinafter, institutions). The purposes of this part are to ensure the reporting of known or suspected criminal activity, the safety and soundness of the institution, and public confidence in the Farm Credit System, thereby reducing potential losses to institutions. This part requires that institutions use the Farm Credit Administration Criminal Referral Form to notify the appropriate Federal authorities when any known or suspected Federal criminal violations of the type described in §617.2 are discovered by an institution.
