Exner, the KSCM deputy chairman, heads the new group. The nine deputies left Wednesday's session of the LB group before a vote was taken on the proposal to change the group's name. Eventually, the remaining deputies decided to retain the name Left Bloc, but it will be followed with the abbreviations of the names of the three parties comprising it, listed in brackets. The three parties are the Left Bloc Party (SLB), the KSCM and the Democratic Left Party (SDL). Originally the Left Bloc group consisted of the KSCM, the Democratic Left, and several smaller entities. On the basis of the June 1992 election results, the LB got 35 out of the total of 200 parliamentary seats and formed the second strongest group in the parliament. The original number of nine parliamentary groups has increased to 11 due to various changes affecting non-government party groups.
