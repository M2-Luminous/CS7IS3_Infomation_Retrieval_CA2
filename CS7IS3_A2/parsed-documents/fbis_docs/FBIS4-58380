Pictures of these aircraft can even be seen pasted on rickshaws and pushcarts. Is it true that our Air Force will become weak if we do not get the F-16's? [Khan] The people themselves have raised the bogey of the F- 16's, and certain circles have tried to spread the word that if the F-16's are not received it would be a disaster. The truth is that if the F-16's are delivered, it will be good; if they are not, we can acquire alternative planes without any problem. [JANG] We have been hearing about the alternative planes for a long time now. Much has been said about the Mirage 2000, Su-27, and MiG-29, but no agreement has been finalized for alternative aircraft. Why? [Khan] We should not make any hasty decisions regarding the F-16's. In any case, if we do not receive the F-16's we have other options. We can acquire planes from France or Russia, but there must not be public debate on the acquisition of the alternative planes. The government has thus far not imposed any decision on us about the purchase of the new aircraft. The government never told us which plane to buy and which one not to. Air Force experts are analyzing every aspect of our requirements and selecting the new aircraft. This is not a decision that can be made in one day. We have to select an alternative plane that can be used for at least 20-25 years. [JANG] Has any progress been made on the purchasing the Mirage 2000-5 planes? [Khan] The Mirage 2000-5 has just rolled out of the factory. It still has to progress from infancy to adulthood. If we conclude an agreement today to purchase the Mirage 2000-5 planes, we will not be able to receive these aircraft for three to four years. Therefore, I am examining the possibility of buying planes that can be delivered and inducted into our Air Force immediately. [JANG] The U.S. signal is very clear that we will have to choose either the nuclear program or the F-16's. What are the prospects for acquiring the F-16's given this situation? [Khan] We all agree with the government's stand on this issue. In our view, the nuclear program and the F-16's are two different issues and cannot be linked. There should be separate discussions on these two separate issues. We have already made it crystal clear that the nuclear program cannot be sacrificed for the F-16's. We cannot give what we are being asked to in return for the F-16's; that is why I had stated that I do not see the F-16 question being resolved soon, and perhaps not even this year. The PAF's [Pakistan Air Force] stand is that the F-16's are good, but we can get by without them. The PAF is not dependent on them. [JANG] Would you please say something about the threats facing our country's defense? What are the threats and what preparations have been made to counter them? [Khan] None of us wants war. War breaks out when diplomacy fails. Currently, by the grace of God, our diplomacy is proving very successful, but our threat perception has increased because of the Kashmir situation. If a war is imposed on us against our wishes, we are confident we have the full capability to defend the motherland's airspace. We will demonstrate our full professional capability in the event of aggression. [JANG] But certain elements try to scare us with the large number of planes India has. [Khan] We will not play the numbers game. It will not be a numbers game, because our professional training is very realistic. If India commits an aggression, it will have to beat a retreat under all circumstances. The air defense of the Kahuta plant is in strong hands. We have the appropriate means to counter those who may cast an evil eye on the Kahuta plant's airspace. Had security around Kahuta not been appropriate, it would have already been attacked by now. The fact that nobody had succeeded in advancing toward Kahuta proves that it is not only the air defense that is strong; due attention is also being paid to Kahuta's ground defenses. [JANG] Certain circles have alleged in the media that commissions are demanded while purchasing new planes. To what extent are these allegations true? [Khan] The Air Force's work is to select the plane. Our experts only advise which planes will be suitable for the PAF. The Air Force only gives its opinion at the technical stage. Those who know how planes are purchased could never think of such baseless things. [JANG] How has the vacuum created by the expiration of the lease on the U.S. T-37 trainer aircraft been filled? [Khan] We have readjusted our training requirements. We have also signed an agreement with China for the K-8 aircraft.
