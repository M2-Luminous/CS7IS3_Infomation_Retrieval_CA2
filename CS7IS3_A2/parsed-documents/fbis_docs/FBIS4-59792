THE WASHINGTON POST in its Friday issue quoted an unknown source, saying that using a jumbo jet to fly between Iran and Zagreb, Iran has transfered to Zagreb 60 tons of explosives and raw materials used in manufacturing arms. Issuing a statement, the ministry said that the plots of the arrogant world media are merely aimed at tarnishing the humane image of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Iran's Red Crescent Society (IRCS) has extended a large amount of relief aid to Bosnian Muslims since the start of the war between the Muslims and the Serbs. The Islamic Republic of Iran recently opened its embassy in Sarajevo, the city which was under Serbian siege for a long time. Opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo created a condition in which the Muslims and Croats reached understanding and created co-existence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces Logistics said that raising such baseless claims especially at the time of opening of Iranian Embassy in Sarajevo and the announcement of Iran's repeated declaration of readiness to send 10,000 troops under the United Nations peace keeping force (UNPROFOR) to Bosnia are attempts to prevent Iran's diplomatic moves to end the massacre of the oppressed Muslims in Bosnia.
