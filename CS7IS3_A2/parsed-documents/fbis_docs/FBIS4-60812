Ukraine will be unable to solve those problems without the world community's assistance, Kravchuk said on Tuesday at a rally marking the eighth anniversary of the tragedy. "We can understand those who demand that the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant be closed down immediately," he said, adding that Ukraine would need international assistance in that too. But Ukraine "cannot do without" nuclear plants, he told the rally, held outside the fire station whose personnel fought the fire at the Chernobyl plant on 26 April 1986. Also on Tuesday, local activists of the international Greenpeace erected a symbolic earth mound to commemorate the Chernobyl victims. Last year Ukraine's nuclear plants generated 33 pct (the Chernobyl plant 7 pct) of the country's electricity.
