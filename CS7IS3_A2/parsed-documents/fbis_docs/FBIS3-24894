Addressing a public rally yesterday at (Kochgoma) health center, in Gulu District, President Museveni pointed out that one of the remaining major weaknesses among the people are politicians whose politics is lies. He reminded the people who gathered to listen to him that, in the past, Uganda had been reduced to a laughing stock by leaders whose main characteristic was lies. Explaining that it is his duty as a leader to expose such lies for what they are, President Museveni enumerated the major lies being spread around by some of the aspiring candidates, and challenged those spreading them to come out in public and substantiate them. He dismissed the lie that the National Resistance Movement [NRM] government had sold land to foreigners as nonsensical, and asked the propagators to explain to the public under what law the contract or arrangement for this has been done. In the same light, Museveni dismissed the allegation that the NRM government has sold the Murchison Falls National Park to foreigners, saying that the government has only given permission to various companies to build or rehabilitate hotels in the parks. He also condemned politicians who go around discouraging the people from paying taxes and emphasized that the people of Uganda need to be aware that they must finance the biggest portion of the national budget. He, however, advised the district leaders to assess the tax of peasants realistically and correctly, according to their income. Museveni also dismissed the talk being propagated that the NRM government is a government of Banyarwanda [tribe]. He said that the NRM government is a government of the people of Uganda in their entirety. He explained that Banyarwanda make one of the tribes of Uganda and they occupy the District of Kisoro which is part of Uganda. He therefore challenged the propagators of this lie to tell the people of Uganda what should be done about the District of Kisoro which is in Uganda. Mr. Museveni strongly warned those people who go around trying to foment hatred among the people that they are not only violating the Constituent Assembly statute but they are also breaking the law. On the issue of compensating the cattle which was eaten by the NRA [National Resistance Army] during the period of insurgency in the north, President Museveni assured the people that they will definitely be paid and that the money is now available and will be paid out in phases. [passage omitted] The rally was also addressed by the former head of state, General Tito Okello Lutwa, who expressed happiness at being back home after years in exile. The general, who expressed total disgust with some of the brutal acts carried out by the rebels during the period of insurgency, called on the people of Gulu District and Acholis in general to unite and totally reject such inhuman acts.
