FR940728-0-00019 FR940728-0-00007 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;25&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8943; AD 94&hyph;13&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives: The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX Series Helicopters AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule; request for comments. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Model F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, ␣ F&hyph;28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters. This action requires a visual inspection for cracks in the tail rotor spindle; a repetitive dye penetrant inspection for cracks; and removal and replacement of the tail rotor spindle upon reaching 1,200 hours' time-in-service (TIS). This amendment is prompted by five reports of cracked tail rotor spindles. The actions specified in this AD are intended to prevent failure of the tail rotor spindle, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. DATES: Effective August 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 12, 1994. Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before September 26, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;25&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137&hyph;4298. The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation, Twin County Airport, P.O. Box 490, Menominee, Michigan 49858. This information may be examined at the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Joe McGarvey, Aerospace Engineer, Chicago Aircraft Certification Office, Airframe Branch, FAA, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Room 202, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (708) 294&hyph;7136, fax (708) 294&hyph;7834. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive that is applicable to The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) Model F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, ␣ F&hyph;28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters equipped with tail rotor spindle (spindle), part number (P/N) 28&hyph;150064&hyph;11 or 28&hyph;150064&hyph;13. The manufacturer advises that there have been five reports of cracked spindles that had time-in-service (TIS) ranging from 282 to 3,449 hours. Three of the five defects were found during a visual preflight inspection. One of the reported incidents resulted in an emergency landing due to a tail rotor imbalance and the resultant high vibrations as a result of the cracked spindle. Based on an analysis and evaluation of the data, the FAA has determined that an unsafe condition exists in the spindle. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the spindle, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The FAA has reviewed and approved The Enstrom Helicopter Corporation Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992, that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the area around the spindle teeter bearing bores for cracks prior to the next flight and prior to each subsequent flight, and if cracks are found, removal and replacement of the spindle with an airworthy spindle; continuing the visual inspection before each flight and performing a dye penetrant inspection of the spindle for cracks within the next five hours' TIS; securing the spindle bearing caps with safety wire following the dye penetrant inspection; and removing and replacing spindles with 1,200 hours' or more total TIS. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Enstrom Model F&hyph;28C, F&hyph;28C&hyph;2, F&hyph;28F, 280C, 280F, and 280FX series helicopters of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of the spindle, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. Before further flight, this AD requires a visual inspection of the spindle, part number (P/N) 28&hyph;150064&hyph;11 or 28&hyph;150064&hyph;13, for cracks in accordance with paragraph 5.2 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. A dye penetrant inspection is required whenever track and balance procedures are required more than once within a 5 hours' TIS period. Additionally, within the next 25 hours' TIS and thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 25 hours' TIS, this AD requires an inspection of the spindle for cracks (without removing the tail rotor from the helicopter) using a visual and dye penetrant inspection in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. Also, this AD requires replacement of spindles with cracks or scratches, nicks, or surface discontinuities that are in excess of certain specified tolerances, or, if the spindle is not required to be replaced, returning the helicopter to service in accordance with paragraph 5.4 of SDB 0077, Revision B, dated November 16, 1992. Replacing a spindle, P/N 28&hyph;150064&hyph;11 or 28&hyph;150064&hyph;13, is also required within the next 100 hours' TIS, or on or before reaching 1,200 hours' TIS, whichever occurs later. Installing a spindle, P/N 28&hyph;150074&hyph;11, constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. Since the unsafe condition requires an immediate inspection to ensure safety of the fleet, this AD needs to be adopted immediately, without prior public comment. The compliance requirements of this AD and take precedence over those stated in the Service Directive Bulletin, except where specifically referenced in this AD. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found that notice and opportunity for prior public comment hereon are impracticable, and that good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days. Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;25&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.
