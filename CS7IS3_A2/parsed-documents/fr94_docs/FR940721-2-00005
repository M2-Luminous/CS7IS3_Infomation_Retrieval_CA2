FR940721-2-00005 FR940721-2-00004 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Agency Form Under Review by the Office of Management and Budget DOC has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for clearance the following proposal for collection of information under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. chapter 35). Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Investment Plans Survey (Formerly Plant and Equipment Expenditures Survey). Form Number(s): IP&hyph;1, IP&hyph;2. Agency Approval Number: 0607&hyph;0641. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Burden: 44,000 hours. Number of Respondents: 30,000. Avg Hours Per Response: 42 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Bureau of the Census proposes to replace the Plant and Equipment Expenditures Survey (P&E) with a new economic indicator survey called the Investment Plans Survey (IPS) which will have close connection to the Annual Capital Expenditures Survey (ACES) (OMB approval number 0607&hyph;0782). The reasons for replacing the P&E are: 1) to improve the quality of the economic indicator of investment plans, 2) to improve consistency and definition of investment data, and 3) to simplify respondent reporting. The IPS will provide an early estimate of investment in structures and equipment for the year ending and an indicator of planned investment for the upcoming year. The Federal Reserve Board, the Council of Economic Advisors, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis are among the principal data users. We plan to replace the P&E with this new survey beginning in November 1994. At that time we will collect actual expenditure data for 1994 and planned spending for 1995. Affected Public: Businesses or other for&hyph;profit organizations and non&hyph;profit institutions. Frequency: Semi&hyph;annually. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Gerald Taché, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230. Written comments and recommendations for the proposed information collection should be sent to Maria Gonzalez, OMB Desk Officer, room 3208, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503. Dated: July 18, 1994. Gerald Taché, Departmental Forms Clearance Officer, Office of Management and Organization.
