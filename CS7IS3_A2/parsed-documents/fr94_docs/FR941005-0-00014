Amend EPA's general regulatory definition of VOC appearing in 40 CFR 51.100(s) (see 57 FR 3945, February 3, 1992) so as expressly to exclude VMS from the term ``VOC'' by final regulatory action. 2. In taking action on any currently-pending or future proposal to approve State VOC regulations as part of a SIP, clarify that EPA lacks authority to approve or enforce VOC regulations to the extent that they apply to VMS or otherwise regulate VMS as precursors to tropospheric ozone. 3. In taking any future proposed or final regulatory action to amend or promulgate VOC regulations for the purpose of reducing tropospheric ozone (e.g., any action pursuant to section 183(e) of the Act to control VOC in consumer and commercial products), take such action and make such statements as may be necessary to ensure that such regulations will not apply to VMS. 4. Take such other actions and make such other statements as may be necessary to implement the exemption of VMS from regulation as precursors to tropospheric ozone. In support of its requests, Dow Corning submitted supporting information and documentation to demonstrate that VMS:
