FBIS4-5270 "dreas069__a94005" FBIS-EAS-94-069-A Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI Objects to U.S. Dumping Charges as Unfair MITI Objects to U.S. Dumping Charges as Unfair OW0704224794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 5 Apr 94 Evening Edition p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0704224794 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] On 5 April, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] decided to include, in a list of unfair trade practices in a report to be compiled in May, U.S. accusations against foreign countries of dumping which are based on its customs act clause concerning multinational corporations. In the "report on unfair trade practices," MITI will also refute the provisional finding of the U.S. Department of Commerce at the end of March that the Fuji photo film company's Dutch subsidiary is dumping color photographic paper on the U.S. market. Because the random use of the clause may affect Japanese companies' inroads [setting up factories] into foreign countries, MITI will consider making a complaint to Washington about the unfairness of the dumping accusation after seeing what action the Dutch Government and the EC Commission take. The clause on multinational corporations is special legislation attached to the customs act that allows for the imposition of dumping charges on goods produced by multinational companies and imported to the United States. When it is impossible to compare a multinational company's sales in the United States to sales in the country of origin, the clause allows the U.S. Government to make dumping accusations based on production costs in the company's home country or any other country where the company sells the same product. In the case of Fuji photo film's subsidiary, the U.S. Department of Commerce provisionally ruled on 30 March that "the Dutch company has sold a small amount of its photographic paper in the Netherlands." And based on the clause on multinational corporations, it used Fuji photo film's own production costs in Japan and calculated that the dumping rate for the goods produced by the Dutch subsidiary was 321.23 percent. In refuting the decision, Fuji photo film said, "The Dutch subsidiary sells goods throughout Europe, and the small amount of sales in the Netherlands is due to the country's small market." The Dutch Government also protested unofficially to the U.S. Government over its decision. The Dutch company was the third Japanese subsidiary charged under the clause. A Japanese subsidiary in South Korea was charged in 1982 for dumping steel wire and a Taiwan subsidiary in 1989 for dumping telephone receivers. However, because this was the first time for a European subsidiary to be charged, MITI is more cautious in the Fuji case. A MITI official said, "The random use of the clause may affect Japanese companies' inroads into foreign countries which have been boosted by the yen's appreciation." Thus, MITI has decided to include the case in its report on unfair trade practices. The report is to be compiled by MITI's Industrial Structure Council (an advisory panel to the international trade and industry minister) to investigate whether Japan's main trading partners' trade policies and practices violate international rules such as those of the GATT. It is a Japanese version of the annual U.S. National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers.
