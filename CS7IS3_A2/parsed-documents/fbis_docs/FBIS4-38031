A statement issued by the council and faxed to MENA tonight says: "The Sanaa regime has no respect for the resolutions and pleas made by the international community. It has consistently declared cease-fires, breached them, and blamed the southerners." The statement accuses Sanaa's authorities of depriving Aden's inhabitants of water, saying that wells are the only source of water following the destruction of water pipes and reservoirs and the purification station. The statement vows continuing "national resistance in the occupied areas" and says that the southerners refuse to surrender.
