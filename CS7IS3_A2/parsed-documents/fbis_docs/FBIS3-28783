The third extra budget, endorsed at a cabinet meeting for introduction to the Diet next Tuesday, lifts the scale of the entire general-account budget for the current year ending in March to 77,437.50 billion yen. The initial fiscal 1993 budget earmarked 72,354.8 billion yen. Spending for public works projects was revised upward by 1,920.1 billion yen to cover a larger part of the largest-ever 15.25 trillion yen package released by the government Tuesday to turn around the ailing economy. The extra budget also calls for additional outlays of 82.1 billion yen to help salvage struggling small companies. A sum of 143.8 billion yen was additionally budgeted to make up for possible losses among farmers after Japan opens its rice market. On the other hand, 10.8 billion yen was cut off the planned expenditures. The spending increases under the extra budget will be financed by 2,182 billion yen in proceeds from construction bond issuance and 3.2 billion yen in nontax revenues. The cabinet also approved an increase of 844.9 billion yen under the government's fiscal investment and loan program for fiscal 1993.
