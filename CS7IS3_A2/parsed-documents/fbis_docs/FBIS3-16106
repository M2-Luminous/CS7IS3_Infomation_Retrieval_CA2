Kozyrev: NATO Membership Card Is Not a Credit Card"] [Text] It is essential not so much to enhance the military and political partnership of European countries, but rather to improve the mechanisms that have already been tested lest Europe be split by "a new Yalta." The thesis about setting NATO against the CSCE will, at Russia's prodding, apparently top the agenda of the December European summit. These ideas were also heard yesterday in Andrey Kozyrev's address before the Foreign Policy Council. The meeting discussed the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program (Pavel Grachev also spoke about it in Germany). After the minister's address the journalists were asked to leave, but your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Sergey Tsekhmistrenko, managed to learn interesting details about the meeting in the lobby. Kozyrev's speech has left the impression that Moscow is concerned by how the "Partnership" initiative is being put into practice. It is not a coincidence that the minister focused on the subject of counterbalances to NATO, pointing out that it is the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the CSCE that should become the core of Europe's future security system. To substantiate his stance, Kozyrev cited the following argument: "It is not NATO, but the CSCE that won the Cold War." But for the time being, in his words, "millions of misgivings" by the East Europeans and NATO members prevent a joint strategy from being devised. Moscow's former allies are flocking to NATO's doorstep, driven "by primitive calculations as they mix up a NATO membership card with a Western bank credit card." Making the reservation that he meant only "certain circles," Kozyrev still cautioned East European leaders, too, against mistakes for which they will have to pay "at the highest political rates." The Atlantists were also given a raw deal for their "NATO-centrism," being established "in a pretty simple and trite fashion" -- by expanding the bloc in numeric terms. Most addresses by council members that followed had a fairly radical idea for a leitmotif: the "Partnership" is not as advantageous for Russia as might be seen from the Kremlin or Smolenskaya Square [Foreign Ministry]. The speakers said that Russia should not expect equality in its cooperation with the West. Moreover, many people saw the concept as a desire to isolate Russia. This point of view was summed up by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma committee for CIS affairs. He said that Russia's participation in the "Partnership" would dash its hopes in the near abroad, because even at present CIS countries are trying to blackmail Russia by appealing to the West. Given that, the parliamentarian has gotten the impression that "even Kazakhstani shores" were washed by the Atlantic Ocean. Vitaliy Churkin (who disagreed with Zatulin's view in general) conceded that the "little brothers," once they have grown up a bit, sometimes become, indeed, Moscow's main opponents in international organizations. The very question of "isolation" as raised by Mr. Zatulin, however, was somewhat strange, all the more so because the latter did not specify how Moscow could avoid it outside the "Partnership" once all former USSR republics join it.
