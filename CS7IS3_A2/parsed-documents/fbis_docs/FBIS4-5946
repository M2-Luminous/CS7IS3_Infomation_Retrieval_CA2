Ozawa and Hosokawa;" moderated by unidentified BUNGEI SHUNJU staff member; date and place not given] [Excerpts] [Takeshita] Many politicians are graduates of Waseda University, but it is rare to find an alumnus of Waseda under the old system, the Higher Institute [college] of Waseda University, like you. [passage omitted] [Akamatsu] Around 1955 I was still going to primary school. [passage omitted] It must be admitted, however, that at that time the Socialist Party was high-spirited at the least in its determination to take the reins of government. But after a while, it became natural for the Socialist Party to be one half of the LDP in its strength, thus creating a 1.5 order rather than the two big parties. [Takeshita] One merit of the order of 1955 was, to put it in good terms, the sharing of diplomatic roles -- the LDP toward the nations siding with the West and the Socialist Party toward those of the Eastern camp. That kind of diplomacy was not backed up by force of arms, but in an active sense it could be interpreted that Japan since the period of the occupation by the allied powers has made crafty, in a sense, use of two parties. For example, the Socialist Party used to tell the Eastern camp, "We want to be on good terms with you, but it is difficult to do so because we are at loggerheads with the stubborn LDP." On the other hand, the Western nations made demands on Japan to bear more burdens as it gained economic power little by little. Then the LDP used to make such excuses as, "We fully understand, but in view of the opinions represented by the Socialist Party we are not at liberty to go along with you." In the field of trade, Japan utilized the friendly-firms method to do business with all areas of the world. Thanks to such methods and to the advantages of free trade in both the East and West camps, Japan has become the world's biggest economic power. In addition, with the expression "Siding With the Working People," the Socialist Party contributed to preventing society as a whole from suffering a gap between the rich and the poor and becoming one governed by the law of the jungle in a free economy where originally the rule of competition is at work. By incorporating the "principle of equality" -- the roots of socialism -- into the establishment, Japan succeeded in maintaining a balance with "liberalism" and the "rule of competition." The existence of the Socialist Party contributed to full institutionalization of such social security systems and welfare policies as the world's leading medical insurance and pension systems. I have a strong conviction that the existence of the Socialist Party contributed to the maintenance of so-called equality by mitigating the gap between the rich and the poor and by preventing the strong from eating the weak, which is permitted under the rule of competition. Having Become A "Yu" Party [Takeshita] What I like to add is the inevitability of realignment in the political world. It is due to the fact that the double-faced diplomacy is no longer needed because one side of the East-West camps has disappeared and that Japan, with more than 100 billion dollars in ordinary surplus, has come to a point where a distinct diplomacy with an identity has to be carried out. Political realignment was long due domestically, because the Cold-War structure itself went through fundamental changes and partly because we [the LDP] lost the trust of the people. [Akamatsu] Our Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is no longer allowed to carry on in the 1.5 order. We labelled ourselves the "party of the working people," but now we have to ask ourselves whether we are earnestly pursuing policies fit to represent the "party of the working people." "Rengo," which boasts 8 million in membership has almost become a dualistic structure, and owners of medium and small enterprises are casting votes in favor of the LDP. The order of 1955 has lost its meaning as a reflection of the times, and I am afraid that we cannot create our own regime nor system unless that order of 1955 is smashed. Simply speaking, we were pursuing the idea of how to surpass the opponent LDP under the order of 1955, but now we have to take the idea of creating an entirely new political structure by finishing off the old order itself. My father was a Diet member when I was born. So it seems that I came into the world with the Socialist Party tatooed on my body. [laughter] I had such a thorough education in socialism that I made rounds distributing Socialist handbills from primary school days and became a Socialist Party member at 18. But now that Socialist Party itself [the SDPJ] has changed. The present coalition government does not need to maintain its present shape, and it probably will not. Pairings may change in accordance with various alliances and unions, and the LDP may even come back to power. In the future, various situations may take place, and that is in accordance with a democracy. Looking at it from a different angle, it is more than natural for the government to change hands. "The government would change hands if it were in power for 10 years" will become common sense. In the meantime, Japan's political society will mature. I do not know whether it will be a multiparty system or a two-big-party system, but it never will happen that one political force will continue to rule for 10 or 20 years. And that is how it should be in the first place. [Takeshita] The coalition government came into being simply because we were under criticism, for which I was one of the responsible persons. The LDP is the leading political party in the Diet by holding the largest number of Diet members, but as it did not win a majority under criticism, it is natural for somebody else, whether it be a coalition or something else, to take over the reins of government from the LDP. In principle, the LDP must exert efforts to take the political initiative as the leading political party, but I myself had a clear-cut view that the LDP had to step down. When the LDP became an opposition party, a certain man made an interesting comment that "the LDP now has become a `yu' party, Mr. Takeshita. By order of the Japanese syllabary in the line starting with `ya,' it is gruelling for `yo-to' [ruling party] to become 'ya-to' [opposition party] but you are somewhere around `yu' [in between the ruling and opposition parties]." [Akamatsu] Ha, ha, ha... [Takeshita] I groaned when I heard him say that. Modesty aside, I did so because I had been well aware of the importance of a government. It is no use only howling "the ruling parties are unpardonable." Thus, the LDP cannot quite become an opposition party to the bone. Therefore, it remains a "yu" party with a strong desire not to shake the foundation of the state, to put it in clean expression. I myself am not quite used to being completely on the opposition side. When the idea of a national welfare tax was brought up for the first time, for example, I recalled the time when a Socialist Party member had pointed out, "Hey, Take-san, make it a special-purpose tax," when the consumption tax was introduced in 1988. Cause and effect were not distinct enough to make it a special-purpose tax, as in the case of the gasoline tax, and as rudiments of public finance tell you, a special-purpose tax will lead to financial rigidity. So, I replied that it will be used for various welfare purposes. Asked about the basis of the 7 percent tax rate of the national welfare tax concept, Prime Minister Hosokawa replied that "it was a rough estimate," and I did not wonder. It cannot be helped that he has less accumulation of knowledge than I and others who have been engaged in tax affairs for scores of years. Because this government was created following the LDP's loss of confidence and the people are allowing it to exist, inconsistencies such as not knowing answers to abrupt questions or taking some time to work out policies should be generously tolerated, in my opinion. [Akamatsu] It is contradictory for me to criticize it, but it is certain that the SDPJ will be laughed at if it insists om making the tax an objective one. Even "democrats" within the SDPJ are saying stop it. If the tax were classified a special-purpose tax, approximately 10 trillion yen out of about a 70-trillion-yen budget would be fixed, leading to financial rigidity, and the tax rate should be raised automatically when the pension fund dries up. Is it not more fundamental to consider changing the character or the mechanism of the budget as a whole to a welfare-style budget? I think it is wrong to think that welfare will advance if the tax is made a special-purpose tax to be used only for specified purposes. However, the idea came out all of sudden, and the SDPJ was compelled to say "it is going to be a special-purpose tax for welfare" in an emergency. As the situation developed, Mr. Ichikawa of Komeito and Mr. Ozawa of Shinseito could not help but acknowledge "it is all right with us to make it a special-purpose tax." Both sponsors and those who accepted the idea are to blame. I was worried what would become of it if the proposal were accepted. [Takeshita] In the coming gray-haired society, it is too heavy a burden for the income tax to take care of welfare of the aged. I had explained, therefore, that the tax burden should be spread out thinly and evenly at the stage of consumption, and I also made clear that "it has a character of something like a special-purpose tax." So I feel I am a little responsible. By saying that a discussion of a pseudo-special-purpose tax reflects a kind of opinion, I maneuvered the debate on the consumption tax to, or pulled it into the arena of the Diet. [Akamatsu] Because you are a crafty politician. [laughter] It is the opposition party's way of thinking to make tax revenue the source of funds for specific purposes while responsible men in the government cannot say such things. Regrettably, the SDPJ has a long way to go to be a genuine ruling party. At any rate, the recent Hosokawa concept was very reckless. [Takeshita] His government is young and the idea could be termed rough and ready. Popularity Rates of Takeshita and Hosokawa [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Wednesday, 9 February marked exactly half a year since the Hosokawa regime was established. Despite being called glassware, it has successfully managed to deal with various important problems. Although premature, what are your evaluations of the half year of the Hosokawa regime? [Akamatsu] Generally speaking, it has a 70 percent rating in popular support, although it went down to 50 percent when the idea of a national welfare tax was revealed. This reflects the underlying sense among the people that the government has made politics something close to them, rather than what it has achieved. It is worthy of high evaluation. It has dealt with various problems such as deregulation of controls, redeeming the margin gained by high yen rates, rice problems, political reform, and measures to give impetus to a stagnating economy. It may take some time before an evaluation is made on their effects. It has been said time and again that the SDPJ is standing in the way, but a close watch will reveal that a kind of tug-of-war like that between the LDP and the Socialist Party during the order of 1955 is being waged among the ruling coalition because the SDPJ is in it. Thus, the course of policies is settled in an agreeable direction. [Takeshita] The popularity rate is astonishingly high. But, it does not reflect the actual evaluation of achievements, and as Mr. Akamatsu pointed out, the rate incorporates expectation and encouragement. On the contrary, the LDP was in power for a long time and it was judged by its actual record. And that rate fell to a single-digit figure in my case when the consumption tax was finally enforced. Somebody encouraged me, "Come on Mr. Take. Stand firm until it drops to 3 percent." [Akamatsu] That is the consumption tax rate. [laughter] [Takeshita] Still, the sense of expectation is going on and time is too short for actual evaluation of achievements. In such a problem as rice, a negative legacy left over by the LDP was dealt with successfully. During my cabinet days, beef and oranges were liberalized and the rice problem could have been settled within the Uruguay Round if it had been treated in the same manner. It was said that Japan gained the most in the GATT system. The biggest future problem lies in domestic measures. As to recoupling [measures to compensate income], Germany and France have a traditional consciousness that agriculture is an important tourist resource, plays a role of preserving the land, and provides a resting place for urban inhabitants and therefore those in rural districts are encouraged to preserve the pastoral scenery as it is. And this consciousness serves to support the recoupling measures. In Japan's case, a change of consciousness is also necessary. Compensation should not continue to take the form of farmers wearing headbands clamoring for rice price hikes, but urban dwellers should also support the farmers as preservers of the land and natural scenery. If the problem is dealt with smartly in such a manner, I think the Uruguay Round agreement will lead to a more advantageous direction for Japan and the whole world. `A Muffler Does Not Become Me' [Takeshita] If you would allow me to use a rough expression, I think it is all right for political reform to go through many trials and errors; defects are corrected if there are any. [passage omitted] Roughly speaking, there are only single member constituency systems and proportional representation systems as methods of conducting elections. However, elections are held in many countries in a way suitable to their national conditions and no absolute way exists to conduct them. In Japan's case, I do not mind changing the system, if Japan is not confident that the multiple-member constituency system is the best. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] By the way, how do you evaluate Mr. Hosokawa as a person? [Akamatsu] When I asked my supporters "why" they "like Mr. Hosokawa," the largest number of them answered he has a refreshing air, followed by a "clean" image. And that impression leads to his very high popularity. In the case of contributions from the Sagawa trucking company, Mr. Hosokawa disposed of the money the same way as Mr. Ozawa did, dividing it into separate accounts of one million yen each. While Mr. Ozawa was exhaustively criticized for that matter, Mr. Hosokawa received mild criticism. I think he is a very lucky man. Apart from his appearance, he has political skill for having managed to maintain the coalition of eight different groups for the past half a year, by making compromises where necessary. It is questionable, however, whether his way of handling matters will be successful in the future, now that such measures as political reform and the pump-priming measure of reducing taxes beforehand have passed. With an eye on the forthcoming elections, every political party is trying to display outstanding characteristics in its political stance. In particular, Mr. Ozawa is decisively on bad terms with Mr. Takemura and I am afraid that the combination of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] is actually impossible in the next elections. It depends entirely on Mr. Hosokawa's leadership whether the two big questions of cooperation in the elections and the formation of a new political party are successfully solved. In retrospect of the process that led to the formation of the current coalition, none other than Mr. Hosokawa is able to do it. And the maintenance of the coalition depends on whether he succeeds in settling the matter. [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, you have known Mr. Hosokawa from his youth, did you ever think of his becoming prime minister one day? [Takeshita] Well, he has given me an impression of a so-called new leader. He is gentle characteristically, and I have associated with him for a long time, including our personal relationship. When he was governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, he seemed to have a comparatively high evaluation of his achievements backed by overwhelming support from prefectural inhabitants. I experienced going to international meetings with him. When we were attending a meeting in Davos, Switzerland, a skiing resort, he went skiing after meetings. I did not ski because I was afraid of breaking a bone. He is for sure a skiing star. [Akamatsu] As a matter of fact, he represented his prefecture as a skier at a national athletic meet. [Takeshita] He has something we old ones do not. He is taller than we and a neck scarf fits him perfectly. If I wear a scarf, people might think that I caught cold. [laughter] From my old-fashioned sensibility, you will really feel the heavy responsibility once you take charge of the government. I was prime minister for one year and seven months and served under Prime Minister Eisaku Sato for seven years and eight months. During that time I had felt like I was climbing up stairs step by step with a heavy load on my back, with eventual relief upon completing the reversion of Okinawa in the end. Mr. Hosokawa was reported to have done quite a bit of redecorating of the official residence of the prime minister, but he must be feeling that grueling load of the knapsack of his administration biting into his shoulder. Artificial Image of Mr. Ozawa [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Ozawa seems to have quite an influence over the Hosokawa coalition government. In the case of Mr. Takeshita, you are one of the foster parents by having had him as deputy chief cabinet secretary and raising him to important positions from the time of the Sosei-kai. Meanwhile, Mr. Akamatsu has experienced big debates with him at representatives' meeting of the ruling coalition parties and worked together to form the Hosokawa regime. Now, please tell us your opinions of Ozawa. [Takeshita] It is a difficult subject for me to speak on. He served as minister of home affairs and chairman of the National Public Safety Commission, both posts of an attestation official, but later when I formed a cabinet I asked him to become deputy chief cabinet secretary, one rank below the attestation official. I certainly acknowledge his ability, because he managed to settle the problems of U.S. participation in Japanese construction projects and Motorola car phones once he had been given full authority. He settled the construction issues and solved problems before economic friction flared up. The Motorola issue is pending, but he is a tough negotiator, I am sure. I do not think he is well versed in English, but I highly appreciate his ability for settling problems, not quite in a smart manner but by holding fast and getting to the point. Characteristically he is well described as "hito-mishiri" -- shy with strangers. In other words, he is shy. These days I have had no contact by phone neither have I had a serious talk with him, but I am compelled to think that it is an artificial image to make Mr. Ozawa responsible for everything that is done forcibly. He was born in 1942 and is six years senior Mr. Akamatsu, but certainly he is a politician of the future. He is not a man of the past like us, and his artificial image should be cast off and he must work in that direction. [Akamatsu] I agree that his image, good or bad, has certainly been inflated too much and has become artificial. From the initiation of the coalition government to working out the political reform bill, he has not dashed through everything. I think he is a kind of politician who knows very well when to withdraw and where to make a compromise, because he has gained political experience under the guidance of Mr. Takeshita. Aside from being good or bad, Shinseito and the SDPJ in the coalition are far apart in their policies and eventually they have to decide on matters by compromise. The same thing can be applied to SDPJ Chairman Kubota, and in that sense Mr. Ozawa is a more subtle man of compromise than the public thinks. By the same token, Mr. Ichiro Ozawa is nothing more nor less than Mr. Ichiro Ozawa himself. So, I think he deserves a better appraisal of his real image. I do not know who is responsible for the artificial image. If he is judged by a wrong image, the political situation may well be misjudged. [Takeshita] In view of the present relationship between the ruling and opposition parties, the problem of reducing taxes before taking measures to make up for them cannot be settled without "confidence" and "a relationship of mutual trust." By confidence, I mean the determination that this policy must be carried out or the support of a majority. The relationship of mutual trust means such a relationship that both ruling and opposition parties mutually understand what the intentions of the other side are, something like that kind of cooperation is needed to prevent bills from being passed at the last moment with a natural understanding that the SDPJ takes an opposing action. When such a confidence and relationship of mutual trust exist, most issues are settled well by the method of consultation between the ruling and opposition parties. The other day, somebody complained that "at present both confidence and a relationship of trust do not exist" and I admonished him "not to say such things." [Akamatsu] At present, such a relationship of trust does exist within the ruling parties as firm as it can be, but not between the ruling and opposition parties. When the political reform bill was finally worked out, I told Mr. Ichikawa, "You have not sided with the SDPJ even once while drafting the bill, despite your repeated reference to "sha-ko-min" [collaboration among the SDPJ, Komeito and DSP (Democratic Socialist Party)]. He replied, "I intentionally took such an attitude only to work out the bill. So do not hold a grudge against me." By the same token, I tell him what I have in mind without hesitation and he talks back instantly upon hearing a view he cannot agree with. I think it is better to associate with each other in such a way without caring too much for coming into harmony with the other party. Two Big Parties Or Tripartite Structure? [BUNGEI SHUNJU] At long last, political reorganization has become a matter of reality. Mr. Masayoshi Takemura mentioned three points as fundamentals of forming a new political party in relation to the political reorganization: its basic policy plus its views on the times and methods it will employ and its constitution. What will be the axis which future political reorganization will concentrate on? Please expound on your opinion of this. [Akamatsu] In my opinion, the next election at the least should be dealt with in the coalition framework. It is better, however, to think separately about the matter of forming a new political party and how to deal with the election. In this connection, the basic policies should be identical, even if they are rough and general. Then, what are the guidelines for deciding on the new framework after all? Messrs. Takemura and Ozawa have already made their guidelines clear, but they are ambiguous about what to do with the international contribution and the problem related to amendments to the Constitution. They have to make it clear where they are going to take the nation, to be an ordinary country or a brightly shining nation. They have yet to distinguish themselves not with ideology, but with ideals of justice or freedom. Even the LDP is divided through various opinions, and our side has not yet clearly defined our framework. But one thing is clear, our side is destined to split among itself. In my personal opinion, the coalition cannot win in the forthcoming election unless the seven coalition parties are firmly united against the powerful LDP. And when the coalition wins a landslide it will become something like the Imperial Rule Assistance Association [before World War II]. Then, the coalition will have to split into two in accordance with aforementioned ideals or fundamental policies, and I think it would work better for Japan's politics to have three parties, including the LDP. But the leftist group of the present SDPJ will not run on the ticket of the coalition because other political parties would not support it. I have told Mr. Sukio Iwatare: "You and members of your group think that the new election system is designed to destroy minority parties, but that is a misunderstanding." "In a proportional-representation constituency, one can be elected by winning 250,000 votes. Although winning more than 250,000 votes has become necessary because votes are counted by blocks, in principle you will be elected by mustering 250,000 votes. Therefore, you had better organize a political party, something like a "goken-shinto" [New Party for Safeguarding the Constitution] in accordance with your political ideals and beliefs." The SDPJ should not remain an entity by forcing people to change their beliefs but rather should negotiate a divorce by consent to make full use of its members beliefs and political principles by forming a new political party. That will become a matter of course as such matters as the demarcation of constituencies, the selection of candidates, and actions by the reformist group in the LDP make progress. The point is that we will side with the line of "from Mr. Gotoda to Mr. Yokomichi," as Mr. Takemura said, by letting obstinate people within the SDPJ go. Official policy study meetings with the Japan New Party have been held many times already, and I think that our policies are the closest. If I may borrow the expression by Mr. Yamagishi of Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Federation], my basic idea is that we should support the B group of the conservatives and bring it together with the liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP. [Takeshita] I said that a political realignment is inevitable, and I think that "freedom" and "equality" are the two nuclei of ideals when a political reorganization is under way. Therefore, something like two big political parties are good for Japan eventually in that the spirit of justice and equality and the principle of competition which respects freedom coexist. With respect to the Constitution, there once was such a difference in positions, which can be simplified in terms of safeguarding the Constitution and proposing amendments to the Constitution. My way of interpreting the Constitution is that the obligation of observing the Constitution includes Article 96 of Chapter IX, which provides for constitutional amendments. And those who advocate safeguarding the Constitution are interpreted as observing the spirit of the preamble of the Constitution-- internationalism, pacifism, and fundamental human rights or to protect the sovereignty residing with the people and democracy. And those in the LDP who advocate constitutional amendments are also believed to be observing what is said in the preamble. Such a simplified classification of either safeguarding the Constitution or advocating constitutional amendments is no longer so clear-cut, and today versatile views are held on the Constitution, and debates are maturing. I think that the trend is in transition in the direction of having two big political parties. With respect to the political realignment, we have the wrong question because we are in the past perfect tense. [Akamatsu] No, not in the past perfect tense. (laughter) [Takeshita] I did not mean to be discourteous. From now on, politics is in the hands of the new generation such as Mr. Akamatsu. I think that men like myself deserve to exist to fulfill the duty of storytellers at the most. The "Kojiki" [Record of Ancient Matters] was compiled in accordance with what Hieda-no-Are told from memory, so storytellers should exist. I will discipline myself to be a storyteller, not to lead in politics. It is said, "Wise men learn from history while fools learn from experience." I have a little experience (laughter), and also a little knowledge about history. Where Is the LDP Heading? [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Mr. Takeshita, where do you place the LDP in what you said about the inevitable future political realignment? [Takeshita] It will rid itself of the obstinacy and bigotry of reactionary conservatives. It may not be an appropriate expression, but I think the LDP will survive self-reformation, just as the SDPJ has "democrats" within the party. The LDP is expected to undergo various movements while the demarcation of single-seat election constituencies is carried out. Through such movements, the LDP will continue to play the role of carrying on the accumulated knowledge of having maintained government for a long time after the war in a series of trials and errors, despite mistakes. Conservatives are to maintain and safeguard the so-called universal values, and the LDP should continue to exist as a political party that can immediately respond to the needs of the times. [Akamatsu] Because Mr. Takeshita may feel awkward in saying things about the LDP, let me say what I think from my standpoint. Basically, the conservatives will continue to survive among the Japanese people in the future. I do not think that they will unite in one organization. As Mr. Ozawa and his supporters have said, there will certainly be "new conservatives" and conservatives opposing them. Whatever shapes they take, it is most probable that they will be divided into "old conservatives" and "new conservatives." It may be impossible for us "Democrats" to be incorporated into their camps. Then it will be realistic to anticipate a combination of two conservative groups and one liberal group. I think it is most probable that such a system will come into being, irrespective of the shapes of their combinations. Although I am not critical, Mr. Ozawa's idea of having two conservative parties is based on a simple premise that his party is overwhelmingly powerful and therefore "it is all right to have one more party." Mr. Ozawa's basic strategy seems to be that his party should have overwhelming power; otherwise, Japan cannot fulfill its role in the world to the fullest extent; or the rate of the consumption tax cannot be raised to 10 percent; or it cannot fulfill with responsibility what it has proposed in spite of people's repugnance. And that is how Mr. Ozawa is decisively different from us. [Takeshita] Unlike the new political parties, the LDP should explore the way to make the best use of its wisdom of policies and accumulated knowledge by working hard together within the party. For example, Japan's explanation of its planned tax cuts was insufficient in the recent Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks for a new economic partnership. The United States was critical of the Japanese plan because it perceived mistakenly that the tax cut was intended for only one year, which was not the case. It was not explained that the consultative meeting on the tax system planned a further examination of more tax cuts in its later full-scale discussions. In this respect, I doubt whether Mr. Clinton, who is two years Mr. Akamatsu's senior, possessed that much information. The report of the aforementioned consultative meeting on the tax system merely indicated what the tax system should be but was not intended to recommend pump-priming measures. Therefore, I would rather think that a tax cut should have been carried out first as a pump-priming measure. Its pump-priming effects will be mitigated when the tax cut is implemented from this January, and the rate of the consumption tax is to be raised in April 1995, as everybody knows. This is where the LDP should be consulted to provide its wisdom. [Akamatsu] It is not good to be reckless. [Takeshita] So, with confidence and trust, the matter should have been referred to a consultative body composed of both ruling and opposition parties, and it should have agreed to cut the tax by 20 percent this year with ceiling of the cut for an individual set at 2 million yen. Then the real tax cut could have taken place during the current Diet session. Criticism could have been avoided if such an explanation were made to the United States. [Akamatsu] The tax cut cannot actually be felt if a direct refund is not made to the people. Wisdom Is Required To Deal With Numerical Targets [Takeshita] As an old saying goes, "The mind rules the body," and illness and business conditions are at the mercy of the thinking of the people. Japanese consumers' thinking currently is to postpone buying new cars although the time has come to replace old ones. Therefore, they have to be shown concrete figures of how much of a tax cut they can expect. Then they will spend money. In setting numerical targets, I think that both sides had room for compromise. For instance, at the Japanese-U.S. structural impediments initiative talks, I succeeded in working out a 430-trillion-yen public investment program for the ensuing 10 years with the talks with U.S. Secretary of State Baker serving as its basis. The amount of 415 trillion yen was compiled by multiplying by 1.5 the past 10 years of investment in public projects, and a reserve fund of 15 trillion yen was added to it. Therefore, the issue of setting numerical targets in the recent framework talks could have been discussed by presenting whatever our side could have decided on and having the two sides discuss this, thus being devoid of policies leading to managed trade. [Akamatsu] That is a good idea. [Takeshita] The remaining problem of government procurement can be dealt with independently to a certain degree, such as introducing U.S. medical equipment to hospitals at national universities, and talks will progress about the problems of Motorola and those of a financial nature [insurance]. [Akamatsu] Actually, Japanese insurance policies and the like are superior quality-wise, and the United States is urging stronger controls to prevent Japanese insurance companies from entering the U.S. market. Contrary to what it urges on deregulation, the United States is moving in the other direction. [Takeshita] Yes, it is. Because U.S. insurance companies cannot form such organizations as "Nissei's sales ladies." (laughter) [BUNGEI SHUNJU] Looking at the coalition, we find that a political realignment will not proceed if the coalition is to be maintained, while the political foundation will become unstable because the coalition will split when a political realignment is pursued. Despite such a contradiction, do you still intend to maintain such a front until the next election? [Akamatsu] If the coalition cannot be maintained, the election will follow. Because of demarcation [of constituencies] problems, the new system will require about six months to allow voters to familiarize themselves with it, thus restricting the prime minister's ability to dissolve the Diet. [Takeshita] That is right. From now on is the crucial period. And I keenly feel that the new era has come. Today I personally experienced the difference between the new and old alumni. [Akamatsu] The evaluation of Mr. Takeshita will have to be entrusted to a future generation, as you said you wished would be the case. (laughter) I would like you, as a senior figure in politics, to guide and teach me, especially in how to grasp the thinking of people. The coalition is very poor in handling and maneuvering the elite group of several thousand bureaucrats, and I hope that you will give us guidance in the future for the benefit of Japanese politics and the administration. [Takeshita] I am much obliged to you.
