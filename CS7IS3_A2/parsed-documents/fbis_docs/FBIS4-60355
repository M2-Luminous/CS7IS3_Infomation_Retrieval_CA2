In today's editorial, the paper notes that this is not the first time the al-Bashir-al-Turabi regime has resorted to such cheap acts, which may be designed to test Egypt's reaction and exploit it domestically and abroad should our reaction be violent and firm. But, it adds, Egypt has been patient more than once with the fabricated battles into which the Sudanese regime seeks to drag Egypt. The paper says that Egypt, with its international standing and sincere people, rejects all the schemes of the Sudanese regime, which imposes control over its people by force. The paper adds that if those who unexpectedly assumed power in Sudan believe that Egypt's patience is limitless, they are fooling themselves and should realize this fact very well. The paper asserts that Egypt alone is the one who will decide how to answer these failed attempts to provoke it; and if the response takes some time, it is because of Egypt's deep concern for the Sudanese people. AL-AKHBAR concludes its editorial with the Arab adage: "Avoid the patient man's anger."
