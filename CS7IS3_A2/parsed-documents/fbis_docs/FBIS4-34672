"This is the first time our electoral legislation has recognized this type of participant. I believe this is a major step forward," Zedillo, a 42-year-old economist who has a doctorate degree from Yale University, said during an interview with the Mexican newspaper EL SOL DE MEXICO. The "foreign visitors" category was incorporated this year into legislation that allows, together with an invitation to the United Nations, international observers to issue a technical report on the Mexican electoral process. Zedillo said this measure, together with new electoral provisions, "fosters better conditions so that anyone who is interested may witness that the Mexican elections will be an example of legality and democratic commitment." Approximately 45 million Mexicans carrying their electoral card with their photograph will be called to the polls to elect a new president and renew part of Congress on 21 August. Zedillo also said there is no party in Mexico with the organizational capability, structure, militancy, and social involvement as the PRI, which has uninterruptedly governed the country since 1929. The presidential candidate said "Mexico is a consubstantial part of Latin America," and that is an irreplaceable and invaluable condition of its geographic location and the civilization to which Mexicans belong. "A fundamental idea that must guide Mexican politics toward Latin America is to promote a greater cooperation toward two of our geopolitical borders --Central America and the Caribbean." "It is fundamental for us that cooperation prevail in that region" so as "to maintain and improve the different mechanisms for consultation and consensus, including the Group of Three, the Rio Group, and the Ibero-American Conference," he added. "It is also important to decidedly continue the promotion of regional integration and foster the expansion and consolidation of opportunities for free trade and economic complementariness, as we have done with Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Venezuela," he added. Zedillo, one of the nine presidential candidates, added he will promote an "ambitious program of reform that will provide a tax framework that will be competitive at the international level," if he wins. He also said he would stimulate competition through a greater opening of the financial sector and promote greater deregulation in order to expand the variety of financial services and expedite more businessmen's access to the debt and capital market. In addition to Zedillo, other top contenders for the Presidency include Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, of the conservative National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
