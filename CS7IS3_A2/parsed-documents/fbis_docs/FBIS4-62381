According to the duty officer of the maritime territory civil defence headquarters, the explosion occurred at 15.40 local time in the village which is located 100 kilometers north of the territory's administrative centre Vladivostok. There have been no immediate reports about damages or casualties. Armored vehicles have been dispatched to the area to evacuate the inhabitants. A group of specialists of the federal counterintelligence service and the commander of the Pacific Fleet's air wing have departed for the area. The effects of the explosion were felt in Vladivostok and the city of Artem as earthquake tremors. Alarmed people have been phoning the Far Eastern regional rescue service to find out what caused the tremors and what they should do in the situation. Meanwhile the civil defence headquarters has reported that there is no danger for the cities of Artem and Vladivostok. The explosion occurred exactly two years after the Pacific Fleet depot in Vladivostok exploded on May 14, 1992. There were no nuclear or chemical weapons in the aviation bomb depot of the Russian Pacific Fleet's air wing where a shattering explosion occurred on Saturday afternoon, sources in the Russian Federal Ministry of Emergencies told ITAR-TASS. There was no immediate information about the causes and effects of the explosion. An electrical train has arrived at Novonezhino to evacuate local inhabitants, and a special group from the Russian Defence Ministry has left Moscow by plane en route to Vladivostok and the site of the explosion. As reported earlier, another explosion occurred two years ago today, on May 14, 1992 at the Pacific Fleet ammunition dump on the outskirts of Vladivostok near the factories Izumrud (Emerald) and Varyag (Varangian). At that time a fire broke out through negligence of the service personnel at the ammunition dump which held 2200 truckloads of ammunition. 122-mm and 100-mm artillery shells and 120-mm mines kept exploding for several days with their splinters sent hurling for miles around. Civil defence and army units, the city militia, firefighters and ambulance cars were brought out in force to combat the fire. Several people, including military school cadets were killed and considerable damage was done to the storage facilities of the Russian Pacific Fleet in the region. First Deputy Commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet Igor Khmelnov flew to the site of the explosion at a Pacific Fleet air wing ammunition dump, which occurred at 16.00 local time, the Russian Defence Ministry's information and press department told ITAR-TASS. According to the same source, for the time being there is no direct communication with the military settlement in which the disaster occurred. Forces and means of Pacific Fleet units have been dispatched to the site to look into the situation and clean up the effects of the explosion. Interaction has been arranged between the Defence Ministry and the specialists of the Russian Federal Ministry of Emergencies. The fire at the Pacific Fleet Air Wing's ammunition dump, which resulted from today's explosion, is being localized, according to the fleet's senior duty officer Vsevolod Fadeyev. According to Fadeyev, groups of specialists, including sappers, have arrived on the scene, where first deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov is in charge of the clean- up operations. The Pacific Fleet Commander Georgiy Gurinov is at the fleet's main command post, coordinating the activity of all the forces involved. The fleet's structures are on the stand-by. Fadeyev also said that fleet units and security forces are controlling the situation in the disaster area, and the evacuation of residents from Novonezhino is being managed effectively.
