The six Super Galeb aircraft were in the air a short period when they were spotted by an AWACS radar plane which relayed their location to two US F-16 fighter jets, the source said. He added that the order to shoot down the planes was given by the NATO headquarters in Italy after the Bosnian Serb planes ignored orders to land. Earlier, the [French] Defense Ministry here said the Galeb aircraft were in the process of bombing a Moslem-operated weapons factory near the central town of Vitez when four of them were shot down. Speaking in Mostar in southern Bosnia-Herzegovina, UN special representative for the former Yugoslavia Yasuchi Akashi said he "understood that (the) two other planes landed in Banja Luka airport." Akashi added that he had contacted Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and the two had agreed "on the importance of not overdramatising this particular incident." The Bosnian Serbs have often been accused of using the Banja Luka airport for helicopter flights which were in violation of a UN no-flight ban over Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although the flights were detected by AWACS radar planes, NATO jets could not intervene as the helicopters were flying low and in moutainous regions.
