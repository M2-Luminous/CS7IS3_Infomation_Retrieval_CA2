FBIS4-2967 "drchi073_w_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Hong Kong Officials With PRC Ties Reportedly Bugged Hong Kong Officials With PRC Ties Reportedly Bugged OW1504044394 Beijing XINHUA in English 0424 GMT 15 Apr 94 OW1504044394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Hong Kong, April 15 (XINHUA) -- A former Executive Councillor and the former treasury secretary of Hong Kong had their telephones bugged for a long time because they had close relationship with China. This was revealed by Alex Tsui, a sacked investigator of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) during the second day of the inquiry into his sacking yesterday. Tsui claimed he was ordered by his boss, Jim Buckle, to investigate Yeung Kai-yin, the former transport secretary and secretary for treasury, because Yeung was found to have a close relationship with the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong branch. "Jim Buckle immediately wrote a report and shortly after that Yeung left the government," Tsui said. Tsui also disclosed that former executive and legislative councillor "Rita Fan's (phones) had been bugged for a long period" in 1993. In addition, he alleged that buckle was preparing a political target list for use by the British Government after 1997. "He (Buckle) told me that we had to prepare a list of names, a list of targets. The targets will first be those who are involved in corruption,. "And later the list should include political targets," he said. The list would collect all dirty things related to the targets. And these documents would shipped to Britain after 1997, he added. "Indeed, the ICAC has done the work of the special branch, that's true," Tsui said. He deemed that a key reason for his dismissal was the conflict with Buckle over the change in the role of the ICAC to include political vetting. However, ICAC official Jim Buckle issued a statement shortly after the hearing, saying what Tsui said is totally ungrounded. Responding to the news coming to light yesterday, Fan, now a member of the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Future Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative region, said, "I would be very concerned if what Mr. Tsui said was true." She warned that such an "intrusion into her privacy" could shatter the long-time image of the ICAC being an independent body committed to combating corruption. Yeung, who resigned last September after 30 year's service in the government, reacted with shock, saying his close links with XINHUA officials were a result of his work. But he asked, "since the signing the of joint declaration in 1984, can you tell me who in the civil service has not had a close relationship with the Chinese side?"
