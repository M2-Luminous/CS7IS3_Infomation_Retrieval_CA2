At a press conference, Ozawa, co-founder of the coalition's core party Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), said at a news conference, "It is unreasonable for the LDP to hold Diet deliberations hostage." The LDP has refused to attend lower house Budget Committee sessions to discuss the 73.08 trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994 for a month, demanding that Hosokawa submit further documents relating to a 100 million yen loan from the Sagawa Kyubin business group, the country's leading but scandal-tainted trucking group, and that his former secretary testify in the Diet. The Diet last Friday enacted a 50-day provisional budget for the current fiscal year with a record outlay of 11.05 trillion yen to bridge the delay in Diet passage of the full fiscal 1994 budget. The LDP has said the loan might be an illegal donation, contrary to Hosokawa's assertion that he borrowed the money to buy a condominium in Tokyo and to repair the gate and walls of his house in his native Kumamoto Prefecture, western Japan. The premier has resisted the LDP demands, saying he presented as much evidence as he could and there were no illegalities in the loan from the Sagawa Kyubin group, whose now-defunct Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. was implicated in a mob-and-money scandal involving politicians such as disgraced former LDP don Shin Kanemaru. On international affairs, Ozawa expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' reinstatement of the so-called Super 301 trade legislation in early March, which allows the U.S. Government to take retaliatory steps unless Japan meets its demands for greater access to its markets. "This is a type of political fighting and could lead to nationalism, aggravating the feelings of the people of the two countries," Ozawa told reporters.
