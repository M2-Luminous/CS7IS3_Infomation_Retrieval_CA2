Unlike previous meetings, Premier Li Peng did not attack Governor Chris Patten's proposals for political reform but instead emphasised the need to maintain Hong Kong's capitalist economy after 1997. Mr Li added Beijing was not against political change in Hong Kong as long as it was consistent with the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration. "The attitude does seem very much more relaxed than it was until comparatively recently," Mr Evans said. "The (Hong Kong) issue was treated in a much lower key way than has been the case in the past." Mr Evans said China's more relaxed attitude probably reflected a desire, following last year's disputes, to get on with business as usual and let events take their natural course. On human rights, however, China showed no sign of backing down from its hard line of recent months. Mr Evans raised several specific concerns, including the detention on Friday of dissident Wei Jingsheng, the reported sentencing of Ming Pao journalist Xi Yang and the detention in Shenzhen of Australian businessman James Peng. But he got no response. Both Mr Li and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen were unaware of the specific cases and suggested they were not an appropriate subject of discussion for visiting government officials. "The premier's reaction was not forthcoming on the subject of Wei Jingsheng. It is not a subject Chinese government authorities care to talk about (not in very polite terms anyway)," Mr Evans said. "The view was that it was a matter better left un-raised by me or anyone else, and that it was an internal affair of China." Mr Evans received an equally blunt response to his request for China to send a human rights delegation to Australia to maintain a human rights dialogue between the two countries. He was told the "conditions" for such a visit were"not appropriate" following the establishment of the Tibet Information Office (the Dalai Lama's unofficial embassy) in Australia, and recent statements on China's human rights record by Australian officials at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Despite the rebuff, Mr Evans vowed to continue raising the issue of human rights with China, stating human rights were "everybody's business" and that China could not avoid international dialogue on the issue. He stressed, however, Australia would not engage in "grandstanding or drum beating" on the issue but would engage China in a persistent, comprehensive and systematic manner. Taking a more aggressive approach towards human rights as the United States has done could "generate a negative response", he said, arguing a quieter, less confrontational approach could lead to better results. On North Korea, one of the main topics of discussion during his two days of talks in Beijing, Mr Evans said he was confident China was playing an active role in defusing the tension over North Korea's nuclear programme. He also said he personally thought China would not necessarily oppose sanctions if dialogue on the issue broke down completely. Officially, the Chinese position remained that they had only a limited role in the dispute, he added.
