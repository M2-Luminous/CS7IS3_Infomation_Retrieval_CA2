FBIS4-55792 "dreeu099_a_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 21 May 1994 ALBANIA Ministry `Regrets' Greece's `Blocking' of Aid Ministry `Regrets' Greece's `Blocking' of Aid AU2105205994 Tirana TVSH Television Network in Albanian 1800 GMT 21 May 94 AU2105205994 Tirana TVSH Television Network Albanian BFN ["Statement by the Foreign Ministry of Albania"; place and date not given -- read by announcer] [Text] Being informed that the Greek Government representative blocked the decision to grant 35 million ECU's to Albania for assistance with the balance of payments at the 16 May 1994 meeting of the EC economy and finance ministers, the Foreign Ministry expresses its regret over this action, which runs counter to the European Union [EU] Commission recommendations and the unreserved approval of the European Parliament. Besides this, no other representative from the 12 EC countries present in the aforementioned meeting had any objection to granting this assistance. We stress that this assistance was recommended by the IMF. We would like to point out that such an act is neither in conformity with the EC's revolving presidency, which Greece holds, nor with the relations of good-neighborliness that Greece professes to have with Albania, and the efforts made to improve the relations between Albania and Greece. The claim that the Greek authorities are dissatisfied with the respect for the rights of the Greek minority in Albania cannot be taken as sincere and serious, as these cases have been examined by the EU Commission and Parliament and no other country of this community that is interested and informed on developments in Albania presented such observations. Over the last two years, dozens of international commissions of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, and the EU have come and they have made no significant observations, apart from asserting the great improvement in the situation and in the rights of the Greek minority. We also express our regret that, because of political passions, the Greek Government does not hesitate to penalize, with this act, the Greek minority, by blocking assistance aimed at the development of reforms in Albania, from which the minorities would profit along with all other Albanian citizens. Considering its timing, such an action is prejudicial for the meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, proposed by the Albanian side and accepted by the Greek side. We hope that the EC's 12 other member countries, which have given great assistance to Albania in this difficult period of transition, will not comply with such a stance, which aims at blocking reforms and will influence the approval of this assistance. We believe that the blocking policy does not do honor to Greece, the EC's revolving president, from whom its neighbors are waiting for concrete assistance in the common interest of integration, stability, and peace in the region.
