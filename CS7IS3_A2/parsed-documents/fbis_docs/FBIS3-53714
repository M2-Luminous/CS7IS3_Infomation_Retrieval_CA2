Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id said around 400,000 jobs taken up by Asians and other expatriates were awaiting Omanis and asked local religious and tribal leaders to encourage young men to engage in work. Qabus, whose speech was broadcast on state-run Omani television Thursday night, said foreigners accounted for 26 percent of the population and the government wanted to cut the level to 10 percent. "It is time for serious work. Let us work together to achieve that objective," he told Omanis in an outdoor meeting, part of his annual meet-the-people tour in remote areas of the Sultanate. "I have information that the majority of Omanis are aged under 15 years. This means that the youth are coming... There are at least 400,000 jobs occupied by expatriates and are awaiting the Omani youth." Qabus, 48, rejected excuses by Omanis that they could not find jobs because they did not have academic qualifications. He said jobs in farming and other traditional sectors that were the main living source before oil was discovered did not require such qualifications. "Educational qualifications are not the ultimate goal. It is training and rehabilitation. There are certain types of work that do not need many qualifications. Farms and other facilities inherited from our ancestors are still there and testify for their capabilities," he said. "Those who make such excuses are lazy. Only lazy people make excuses. We all must not listen to these people and we all must say to them: no." Qabus said his government was chalking out an intensive training programme for Omanis so they will replace foreigners, who began to stream in when oil was discovered around 20 years ago. Oman produces around 800,000 barrels per day of oil and its crude reserves exceed 4.5 billion barrels. It has used the oil wealth, which fetches it more than three billion dollars a year, to build a modern infrastructure and turn its barren territory and mudhouses into a green spot and large buildings. Other oil-rich Gulf states depend heavily on foreign labour given a large shortage in skilled native labour. But they have joined Oman in launching campaigns to lessen reliance on expatriates, which they believe have become a threat to their security and conservative tribal society. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have the biggest percentage of foreigners, who have become a majority. But the Iraq invasion has prompted measures in Kuwait to turn its local population into a majority by expelling some expatriates and restricting entry visas. "The Omanisation programme is moving ahead," Qabus told his citizens, who flanked him as he sat on the ground. "Shaykhs and dignitaries are asked to urge the youth to engage in work. This encouragement is their most important duty." Qabus, who joined other regional states in creating a consultative body after the Gulf war, said he was planning to revise representation in the council according to the size of population in the provinces. "Representation in the consultative council will be proportionate with the population density. The distribution will be fair," he said.
