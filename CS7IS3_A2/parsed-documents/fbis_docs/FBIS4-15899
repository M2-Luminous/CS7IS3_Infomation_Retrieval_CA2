ITAR-TASS has learned about these differences from participants of the Tuesday meeting in Geneva, attended by the Georgian and Abkhazian delegations, as well as representatives from the United Nations and Russia. The Georgian delegation moved to deploy U.N. peace-making units and inspectors along the entire parameter of the conflict zone in Abkhazia, in particular, along the Psou river (the border with Russia) and the Inguri river (the border with Georgia), on mountain passes, along the littoral and at the airports of Sukhumi and Bombara. It believes the "blue helmets" should prevent the resumption of hostilities and should put an end to the delivery of weapons and manpower to the conflict zone. The Abkhazian side believes that U.N. peace-makers should be posted only along the Inguri river, which now separates the two conflicting sides, and that the "blue helmets" should ensure the disengagement of the conflicting sides, should prevent the infiltration of their troops into the 6-10-kilometre wide disengagement corridor. The discussion will be continued in the course of further consultations on Wednesday and possibly on Thursday. The U.N. experts are expected to outline their views during these consultations, which will not adopt any decisions. However, the exchange of views will help Eduard Brunner, the U.N. secretary- general's special envoy, who is presiding over the meeting, and then the secretary-general himself to formulate the U.N. Security Council's proposals. The council is to decide whether it is worth sending U.N. peace-makers to the region and how many men should be dispatched there if a corresponding decision is adopted.
