The federation also urged the government to take positive economic measures, including an increase of investment on public works projects by more than 100 trillion yen over the next decade. It said the appeal was contained in a proposal timed to Hata becoming prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosokawa who stepped down over questions about financial impropriety. The proposal also called for early enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget which is up for parliamentary approval and readjusting the yen's exchange rates against other currencies at optimum levels. The proposal also expressed hope that the government will take action to remove economic frictions with the United States and other countries to overcome the recession. The federation also urged the government to reduce income and corporate taxes by reforming the tax system and carrying out thorough deregulation in real estate transactions, housing, communication and information, and distribution sectors.
