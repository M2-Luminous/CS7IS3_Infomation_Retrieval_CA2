The third worker died from his wounds in hospital Wednesday following the attack by opposition rebels Tuesday. Reopening the railway was to have been one of the first achievements of a fragile peace in conflict torn Congo following a sudden ceasefire agreement reached Sunday between the party of President Pascal Lissouba and the main opposition of Bernard Kolelas. The two parties agreed Wednesday to put back the reopening of the railway until February 8. The 400-kilometer (240-mile) line between the capital and its main port and economic centre has been cut for over 40 days by barricades and removed rails. During that time, food has become scarce in the capital and prices have soared. The delay should give time for the parties to tell their supporters of the ceasefire, the parties added. The attack on the carriage carrying state railway workers was a result of "a lack of awareness" of the ceasefire and "lack of coordination" between the parties, said Michel Malonga, a member of Lissouba's party.
