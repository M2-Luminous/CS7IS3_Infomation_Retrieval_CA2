Ostensibly, it is a local branch of the central NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, which is a top-level government department. Other local branches, such as those in Beijing and Shanghai, are also top level. But XINHUA is the same grade as the central branch, that is, both are ministries. Apart from its news section, XINHUA has no subsidiary relationship with the central organisation. Its function corresponds only minimally to its name. The Hong Kong Government and all other representative bodies of foreign governments in Hong Kong recognise XINHUA as the Chinese Government's chief representative in the territory. But it has no legal status, and has no diplomatic immunity. Its legal status is not as high as that of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group [JLG] or of the Land Commission, or even of the Foreign Ministry's visa-issuing office. The directors and deputy-director of those bodies are equivalent to the director of XINHUA. All three bodies enjoy the diplomatic immunity that XINHUA lacks. If XINHUA needs to purchase a car, it does so in the name of the JLG or the Land Commission in order to pay lower import tax. XINHUA's unique circumstances are a product of Hong Kong's unusual history. When the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY organisation was established in Yanan (Shaanxi Province) during the Japanese occupation, it was openly an organisation of the Chinese Communist Party [CPC]. When a branch was set up in Hong Kong in 1947, it was as a private organisation, with a corresponding legal status. When the PRC was established on October 1, 1949, the Chinese Government publicly announced that XINHUA was a national news agency (and at the same time was the news agency of the CPC). The Hong Kong Government did not recognise it as part of the national news agency, and even intended to close it down. In 1949 and 1950 the Hong Kong Government made the growing power of leftists in Hong Kong a target, passing many new laws intended for use against them and even using laws to disband some leftist organisations. One of those laws was the Control of Publications Consolidation Ordinance. This ordinance required the re-registration of all news organisations in Hong Kong and payment of a deposit of $10,000, even for private organisations. At the beginning of 1951, XINHUA registered in accordance with this law of the British Hong Kong Government but it registered as a national news agency. The British Hong Kong Government rejected this application on the grounds that XINHUA was originally registered as a private organisation. This was the reason the Hong Kong British Government gave for allowing Agence France-Presse to register as a national news agency, but rejecting registration of XINHUA. The intention was to close down XINHUA. When XINHUA was established in 1947, the PRC was itself not yet established, so there was no possibility of it having national news agency status. When the PRC was established, the government officially announced that XINHUA was a national news agency and it naturally followed that XINHUA had the status of a national news agency. The Chinese and British Governments did not have formal diplomatic relations at that time but the British Government announced that it recognised the PRC and the government in London had already recognised the London branch of XINHUA as a national news agency but the Hong Kong British Government still did not acknowledge this status for XINHUA. In 1951, the news division of the Chinese Government and XINHUA issued a joint statement to clarify the status of XINHUA as a national news agency to counteract the intentions of the British Hong Kong Government. This conflict continued for nearly a year before it was resolved. In the meantime, Xinhua had made all the necessary preparations for being shut down. In April 1951, the director, Huang Zuomei, sent me to Macao to establish a branch there. Huang's instructions to me were explicit: if the Hong Kong branch was closed down, the Macao branch should immediately be activated to take over work relating to Hong Kong. When the Macao branch began operations, I was the only one working there. Later there were two people, but at no stage did the number exceed 15. Only in 1952, when the Hong Kong British Government could no longer continue to refuse recognition of XINHUA as a national news agency, was I able to shut down the Macao branch's operation and return to Hong Kong. Even though the Hong Kong British Government was forced to recognise the official status of XINHUA, it used every means to ignore it. For a very long period, lasting nearly 20 years, the Hong Kong British Government would only assign a member of the police special branch to deal with XINHUA. This situation continued until the end of the 1960's when the political adviser was assigned to deal with XINHUA. Right up until the early 1970's, the Hong Kong British Government still treated XINHUA as a mere news unit. When members of the royal family visited Hong Kong, the Hong Kong British Government refused to invite a XINHUA representative for an audience in his official capacity. Only at the end of the 1970's did a Hong Kong governor meet the director of XINHUA, and take part in XINHUA's national day celebration. Once XINHUA's official status was established, in 1956 Mao Zedong, monitoring the work in Hong Kong through Guangdong Province, recommended that the fullest possible use be made of XINHUA's status in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong and Macao Working Group was also transferred from Guangzhou to Hong Kong. Liang Weilin was appointed the director of XINHUA, and also the secretary-general of the CPC's (CCP) Hong Kong and Macao Working Group. From the time that Chairman Mao began monitoring Hong Kong, the CPC's central leadership became increasingly well-informed about Hong Kong. The preservation of Hong Kong's unique status would be of enormous benefit to China. In 1958, Zhou Enlai set the direction of the basic approach to Hong Kong: "In the long-term, aim for maximum utilisation." At the same time, Hong Kong's relationship with the mainland was becoming increasingly close. Even though XINHUA had taken on the status of a national organisation, it was still a national organisation in the form of a news agency, and a news agency could not easily take on the official duties of a top-level government department. For this reason, beginning in the 1960's, the premier, Zhou Enlai, told the British Government that China hoped to have an official central government representative in Hong Kong. The British Government refused outright, saying it did not want a system of "two governors" to take root. Apart from the development of closer relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, there were many issues that required official government discussions. For the Hong Kong Government simply to send a special branch official to communicate with XINHUA was plainly inadequate. One example will illustrate the problem. Hong Kong people will remember that from the mid-1950's Hong Kong experienced frequent water shortages. Reservoirs were built one after another, each one larger than the last but, if there was not enough rain, the problem remained unsolved. Not only did the people's livelihood suffer but industry also lacked adequate water and the serious water shortage limited Hong Kong's industrial development. In 1962, the situation became so serious that water was only available for four hours every four days. Looking back, it is clear that if the water shortage had not been solved through communal use of the Pearl River, Hong Kong's industrial development would have been impossible. At the end of the 1950's, the Hong Kong British Government agreed to talk with China about a plan to purchase water from the Pearl River. Talk alone would not bring the water to Hong Kong. It had to come a long distance via engineering works through Shenzhen. Because the Hong Kong British Government lacked even the most basic communication channels with the Chinese Government, this plan, so crucial to Hong Kong, was delayed for several years. Only at the beginning of the 1960's did the Hong Kong British Government send an unofficial member of the Legislative Council, Chau Ling-nin, to seek out representatives of XINHUA. The British trusted Chau Ling-nin, and he had a very high standing in society, but he was not an official of the Water Supplies Department and he was also quite advanced in years. When he was sent to XINHUA to talk, he knew very little about the subject. He could not even clearly put across the message that the Hong Kong British Government had sent him to convey. The Hong Kong British Government had only given him basic information in writing, which he read out loud. Any reply from XINHUA to the Hong Kong British Government had to be sent in writing through him. It became obvious that it would be impossible to continue in this manner beyond a few such talks but the Hong Kong British Government then sent a younger, unofficial member of the Legislative Council, Lee Ming-chak, in his place. This is what actually happened at that time. For this reason, not long after the talks on water supply were concluded in the mid 1960's, Zhou Enlai suggested to the British Government that a representative of the Chinese Government should be allowed to be posted in Hong Kong. Zhou repeated this suggestion many times from the mid-1960's right until the early 1970's, spanning a period of nearly 10 years. The British Government had no reason to refuse, but it counter-proposed that it hoped the Chinese Government would establish a consulate or embassy in Hong Kong. This was clearly unacceptable to the Chinese Government because the Chinese Government's basic position was that Hong Kong was Chinese territory and the Chinese Government did not recognise the three "unequal treaties." This position had been stated worldwide since the establishment of the PRC. If the Chinese Government established a consulate or embassy in Hong Kong, it would be acknowledging Hong Kong as a foreign country, as a British colony, and thereby would be recognising the validity of the three "unequal treaties." Even the old government of China under the Kuomintang had been unwilling to establish a consulate in Hong Kong. At that time its representative organisation was "the Office of Two Special Envoys from the Foreign Ministry Office in Hong Kong" headed by Guo Dehua. That organisation was disbanded at the end of 1949. After the beginning of the 1970's, when Zhou Enlai again suggested that China establish a representative in Hong Kong and again was refused by the British Government, the subject was no longer raised between the two countries. Having eliminated this form of official channel, the Hong Kong British Government continued to raise the status of XINHUA, in effect recognising it as the Chinese Government's channel for communication in Hong Kong and in that way solved the problem. Finally, the Chinese Government also tacitly conceded this point. That is how XINHUA's unique status came about. In the 1980's, when the Chinese Government set out a timetable for resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong, and the mainland's reforms and open policies developed steadily, relations between Hong Kong and China developed to an unprecedented extent. Correspondingly, XINHUA as the Chinese Government's highest organisation in Hong Kong, also became increasingly important, and its operations became more diverse and all-encompassing. XINHUA's relations with Hong Kong society and Hong Kong people naturally grew much closer. The Hong Kong British Government, representatives of foreign countries in Hong Kong, and people from all sectors of Hong Kong society, all recognise XINHUA without any doubt as China's highest representative body. Few people understand how unique that status is. Most interesting is the question of the status XINHUA will hold three years from now, after 1997. This question has been discussed for some time within the local branch. According to Annex 1 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will come under the direct jurisdiction of China's central government. At that time, all its "ministers" can be in direct communication with the central government. Hong Kong's foreign relations and defence will be handled by the central government. So, after 1997, there should be a bona fide foreign ministry office in Hong Kong and a military representative from the Defence Ministry. At that time, XINHUA will no longer need to exist under its current special status. It will revert to its ostensible and legal status. That is, it will be no more than a local branch of the central NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, and carry out genuine news agency functions. XINHUA at that time will perform the same functions as the existing office in Sharp Street West. At that time, XINHUA, by then in existence for exactly 50 years, will have fulfilled the role set out for it in history and its brilliance will dim. Is that how it will be? I think that's how it should be.
