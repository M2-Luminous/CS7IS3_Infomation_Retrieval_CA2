The European Union would remind the Congolese parties concerned that it was asked to participate in implementation of the agreement, inter alia by making magistrates available to the Congo for the arbitration board. The board's careful and independent work cannot be called into question and the European Union would find it impossible to understand any contesting of its decisions. The European Union urges all Congolese political forces to respect the provisions of the Libreville Agreement and seek a political solution to the crisis through dialogue.
