Kumagai was referring to reported calls by the Advisory Committee for Energy, his advisory organ, for reviewing Japan's policy in favor of plutonium use as a way to meet energy demand in the future. The committee is now formulating a report on Japan's new energy policy by accounting for recent rapid changes in the energy field. Speaking before a regular press conference, Kumagai said the committee is moving toward a consensus against active use of plutonium. "Discussion so far by the committee seems to be convincing," Kumagai said. Japan has come under global criticism for its plutonium policy as leading to nuclear proliferation. Doubt has also been cast at home over the feasibility of commercial use of plutonium. Kumagai said he will meet Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Tuesday to discuss Japan's stance on the so-called trade "framework" talks with the United States. Discussion will focus on assessing last week's meeting between Hata and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Marrakech, Morocco, in search of a breakthrough in the stalled framework talks, the trade minister said. Kumagai said Japan should maximize its efforts to reopen the bilateral trade talks before the annual summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Naples in July. The Hata-Kantor meeting failed to produce an accord on setting a time for resumption of the trade talks. But reports said some progress was made over "objective criteria" or numerical targets. The framework talks have been suspended since Japan rejected a U.S. request to use numerical targets to measure the openness of its markets.
