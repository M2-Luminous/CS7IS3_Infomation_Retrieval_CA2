The military chief explained that Hondurans are not ready for such a step because they do not have enough education and culture, aside from the fact that it would weaken the Armed Forces. When asked if that meant he opposed the approval of the new recruiting system, he reiterated that "it is the institution's destruction," adding that not only the military but all Hondurans are against it. He said it is necessary to change recruitment practices and suggested that the Civil Registry provide a list of citizens who are over 18 years of age. "There are so many young people in the appropriate age bracket that we would only need 3 to 4 percent of them," he said. Concerning the privatization of the Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise (Hondutel) -- which is of great interest to President Reina -- Gen. Discua said that "as general commander of the Armed Forces, we must support him; otherwise, we would be disloyal." This answer by the military chief is contradictory inasmuch as he has voiced opposition to the new recruitment system proposed by President Reina. He explained that the Armed Forces do not have any direct involvement in the administration of Hondutel with the exception of the fact that it is managed by a military officer. Actually, the company is governed by a board of directors chaired by the communications, public works, and transportation minister, Discua noted. The military chief said that the money circulating in the nation's drug market is far exceeds the national budget of a country such as Honduras. He reported that the Police, Army, Air Force, and Navy are conducting joint operations that have led to the arrest of drug traffickers and the seizure of large amounts of drugs. He added that efforts have been intensified, particularly in Islas de la Bahia, which has become a key point for drug contraband. Discua said he could neither confirm nor deny charges by a former judge that the traditional political parties paid for their campaigns with drug money because he does not have any information to that effect. According to the high-ranking officer, Health Minister Enrique Samayoa is very poorly informed when he says that the Armed Forces' budget has been increased. "I think he has been confused by a UN report that dates back to 1993 and which talks about nonexistent amounts of money," Discua stated. "I do not understand why the figures were handled in that way. Perhaps they sought to confuse the public," he added. The general, who arrived yesterday morning at the 105th Military Brigade in San Pedro Sula to attend the seminar of the Permanent Committee for Emergencies (Copeco), also referred to the complicated issue of the whereabouts of the 7 million lempiras received following Hurricane Gert. He said a government-appointed commission is investigating the case.
