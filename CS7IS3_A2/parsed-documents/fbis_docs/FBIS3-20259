Without political reform and developments towards a fair legal system, the economic reforms in China would reach their limits, Kinkel warned during talks with Chinese Justice Minister Yang Xiao in Bonn today, according to the Foreign Ministry. Kinkel also underlined the German government's willingness to provide support in all areas which would serve to develop a system based on the rule of law in the People's Republic. The foreign minister also called on the Chinese government to use its influence on North Korea and to do everything to prevent a military conflict. The North Korean nuclear issue had to be solved within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
