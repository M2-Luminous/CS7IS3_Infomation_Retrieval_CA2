Reporters from the Mexican newspaper ULTIMAS NOTICIAS said EZLN members are using their hostages as shields in case the Mexican Army stages an attack to end the Zapatists' violent actions. Journalists were able to enter Guadalupe Tepeyac, where some 60 families live and which is located approximately 800 meters from the border with Guatemala in the middle of the Lacandona jungle. The newspaper reported that the more than 100 hostages, mostly doctors and nurses, are in the hamlet's Social Security clinic. The doctors and nurses issued a public letter in which they state they "have not suffered any harm" and that they were taken hostage on 31 December -- one day before the beginning of the armed rebellion which, according to unofficial Mexican sources, has killed 200 people.
