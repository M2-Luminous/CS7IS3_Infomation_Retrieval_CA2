The guerrillas opened fire with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades as the marchers were being escorted by government troops in northwest Battambang's Bavel district, said Mek Dara, the deputy police commissioner for Cambodia's second city of Battambang. Kol Sarul, one of the three injured monks who was brought to Battambang hospital, told AFP that the Khmer Rouge "came from everywhere." "The army of Pol Pot then stole all our money and medicine," he said. Up to 12 foreigners walking with the monks might have been taken hostage during the attack, a spokeswoman for the march, Kong Nary, said in the Cambodian capital. Police in Battambang could not immediately confirm the report. The marchers were being led by Nobel peace prize nominee Maha Ghosananda. "How can the Khmer Rouge dare attack Buddhist monks like that? When will our country ever have peace," Kong Nary said. "When they attack the Dhammayietra (peace walk), it's just like they attack our nation."
