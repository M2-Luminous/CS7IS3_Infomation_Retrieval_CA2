From that standpoint we have to wage a great revolutionary war." So reads a document from Popular Line, a movement that began in this city in the early 1970's and later spread to other regions of the country, including the Chiapas jungle, where it sowed the ideological seeds of the guerrilla war, according to Jesuit priest Mardonio Morales. According to the document, the Vietnamese started "with small bases that later grew larger, on the one hand. On the other, the bases were isolated, and they gradually integrated them. Our process has also been like this. We started with little points in various areas of the country, and these points have been spreading. In the beginning they were isolated; now they are being integrated...They are support bases for the revolutionary movement; they are the embryo of a Proletarian State." According to the testimony and pamphlets compiled by this reporter, Popular Line's "little points" emerged in this city in 1970 and soon spread to other towns in the Lagunera region, Coahuila, and Durango through the invasion of urban and rural lands. In addition, Popular Line's "cadres" came to dominate most of the schools of the Torreon Unit of the Autonomous University of Coahuila (UAC). During a second expansion phase in the mid-1970's the movement spread to Monterrey, Monclova, Durango, Valle del Yaqui (Sonora), Zacatecas, San Luis Potosi, Hidalgo, and the Chiapas jungle. Popular Line, also known as the Mass Line, had the support of around 12 priests in the Lagunera region; they helped out in the efforts at consciousness-raising and organization among colonia [urban settlement] residents and peasants. "We supported them because we saw it as organizational work, as furthering the common good, as a search for answers to the problems of the poorest people. It was overt work. We remained discreet in some matters, but there was no underground activity or apologies for violent solutions," several of these priests say. Father Benigno Martinez says that brigade members of Mass Line penetrated the Chiapas jungle on the express invitation of the bishop of the diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz: "He was in Torreon, saw the work that they were doing, and liked it...And he invited them into Chiapas. That was in late 1976." Two years before, Bishop Ruiz had said no to the Torreon Group, Father Mardonio told Guillermo Correa last September (PROCESO 880). The same source says that the "visible heads" of the Mass Line movement are Adolfo Orive, the current director of training of the National Peasant Confederation (CNC), and Hugo Andres Araujo, a PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] deputy and leader of the confederation: "The one we had the most contact with was Hugo Andres, because he practically lived in La Laguna, although he traveled a lot. Orive, in contrast, showed up from time to time. Neither of the two liked to keep a high profile; they did not want to appear in the press or anything like that." Gustavo Gordillo, the current deputy secretary of the SRA [Secretariat of Agrarian Reform], was prominently involved in the Yaqui Valley; he later wrote about his experiences in his book `Campesinos al asalto del cielo' [Peasants Attacking Heaven]." For a long time, says Father Benigno, "we believed naively that Araujo and Orive did not have political contacts. We thought that they were acting independently. We realized later, especially after 1976, that they have political godfathers...." A native of Mexico City, where he graduated from the National School of Economics of UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] (the 64-69 generation, according to the Biographical Dictionary of the Mexican Government), Araujo de la Torre settled in Torreon in 1970. He began working as a professor in the economics department, which at the time was part of the Humberto Perez Hinojosa School of Business and Management of the UAC (Perez Hinojosa was a Popular Line activist). For a month now he has been the PRI president in this municipality. By 1971, the Popular Line philosophy, contained in a thin book called "Hacia una politica popular" [Towards a Popular Line], was already making the rounds in university circles, to which this reporter belonged. The 48-page text clarifies in its introduction that this is the second edition of a document that was originally written "by student brigade members for student brigade members. It was even written on the basis of a whole series of implicit assumptions about the student movement and severely criticizes certain tendencies that posed a very direct threat to the movement back in November 1968." "Why publish it again then? The fact is that the document is a text suited to the present moment, inasmuch as it tells us what must be done urgently: to join with the masses to pursue a grass-roots policy with them. But it is also a text for the long term in that it proposes a grass-roots policy as a general political line to transform Mexico...This time the document is designed not only for students but for every Mexican who sincerely wants to engage in politics with the lower classes." Through its brigade members, most of them university students, Popular Line steadily penetrated urban centers, particularly among colonia residents who lacked housing and public utilities. In 1972 it established its first "social support base": the Tierra y Libertad colonia. It was later joined by other colonias in the eastern outskirts of the city, including Francisco Villa and Division del Norte. In the nearby city of Gomez Palacio, the Ricardo Flores Magon, Ruben Jaramillo, and Jacinto Canek colonias were organized. Father Jesus de la Torre, who helped organize these colonias and is currently in charge of public relations for the Torreon diocese, recalls how he had made contact with Popular Line: "Father Jose Batarse and I hosted a TV program, called Sign of the Times, in which we addressed social and political issues. It was an open program, so much so that we even criticized the waste during Luis Echeverria's presidential campaign. I assume that Adolfo Orive heard about us through this program; he sought us out and proposed that we work together." He and other priests "were already doing work in very poor colonias. We were helping people organize to meet their needs. We started running into university brigade members...and we managed to get along, although not without some tension. Little by little we gained the ability to argue with them and we had it out on some issues. We cared about the people, not a given political line. What we saw was that all these joint efforts led to the development of a very broad solidarity movement and a very strong motivation to stay involved, which to us was inspired more by the Book of the Apostles than by Maoist texts." The Popular Line people "were, I thought, quite studious, quite quick in analyzing the times, dogmatic on some issues. They were systematic, very pedagogical; they analyzed everything, from the president's reports to the pope's encyclicals...I never heard either the brigade members or Orive or Araujo talk in favor of weapons as an answer to problems, and I am not aware that they engaged in underground activities. To be sure, they acted with discretion, especially Araujo, who used to say that he had to be careful because he was not from La Laguna." Benigno Martinez, the current parish priest in Concordia in the municipality of San Pedro de las Colonias, relates that in the early 1970's in the Torreon diocese "several of us priests were very motivated by the proposals in the Medellin documents. We were trying to get the Catholic movements to push forward and find options for a commitment in tune with the demands of the real world. One day Father Jose Batarse went to Durango to give a talk at the university, and in the audience was Adolfo Orive, who became very enthusiastic about what Pepe was saying." Orive came to Torreon "and explained Popular Line's program to us. We thought that its proposals were very sensible and in accord with those of the Mexican Social Secretary. The point was to invigorate the intermediate bodies, in other words, to encourage people's involvement in decision-making, in opposition to the prevailing custom of having only the leaders of the colonias take action. The point was also to have the people take care of their needs and, at the same time, to grow politically and ideologically. We, as pastors, wanted to see their faith become an element that would revitalize an entire grass-roots process." Once contact had been established with Orive, Araujo "introduced himself to us as a commissioner around 1971. Because he was a university student, he established connections there and won over people who later developed nicely, among them Miguel Murillo and Salvador Hernandez Velez (now a member of the CNC). We began to spur the worker-grass-roots movement, first by trying to democratize the railway union, Section 27. Then came the Tierra y Libertad colonia, in which what would become the Mass Line was established." "First we identified the most strongly felt needs, and everyone who was experiencing the problem organized to solve it, not in a pyramid arrangement but rather by acting on the decisions of the rank and file. The colonia residents organized block assemblies, then sector assemblies, and finally came the general assembly, which was the highest body. Once this structure had been established, a brigade was formed with the most advanced elements, whose job was to guide the others. The brigade encouraged discussion and general involvement; it was what was called the ideological apparatus. There was also the political apparatus, which executed all of the resolutions: to go and see certain authorities, to hold rallies, demonstrations, etc." The highest body of the Popular Line was the so-called Guiding Ideological Organization (OID), which was officially established in 1976 according to the document "Major Issues Concerning Our Line and Our Organization," published in June 1978. When Mass Line grew, both in this region and elsewhere, Father Benigno says, "the feuds in the top echelon, the OID, began, and two factions appeared in the organization: the so-called Proletariats, led by Adolfo Orive, and the so-called Christian Democrats or Ultrademocrats, represented by Araujo. At that time, Orive was in Monterrey.... The internal struggle led to the abandonment of the working-class colonias, emigration, and the so-called Policy of Two Faces (hit the internal enemy hard but pursue a policy of negotiations with the external enemy)." "I do not know whether by pursuing this policy Orive and Araujo wound up working together for the government, thus making a turnaround that we still do not understand and that hurt a lot of people who believed in them, especially Araujo. He helped people discover how corrupt the system was...and now he is part of the system. What I do know is that the ideological struggle and the struggle for power that Orive and Araujo waged back then wound up separating them. Orive founded Proletarian Line, and Araujo continued with the Mass Line." By 1976 the Mass Line had spread to several municipalities in rural La Laguna, in particular San Pedro in colonia Emiliano Zapata and Francisco I. Madero on the small estate Batopilas and in colonia 2 de Marzo. Several priests also helped out in this expansion, most prominent among them Benigno Martinez, Jesus de la Torre, and Jose Batarse. The latter relates that the shining moment during this stage was the struggle of the day laborers at the Batopilas winery (owned by Manuel Suarez). It began as a strike in January of that year to demand decent wages; then the workers invaded the lands in April to ask that they be turned into an ejido, which finally happened on 21 May. During the invasion at Batopilas, Father Martinez asserts, "we started to realize Hugo Andres' political connections." The action triggered mobilizations in several municipalities, also demanding lands that were in the hands of latifundio holders. In response, the government of Oscar Flores Tapia began cracking down in October 1976. Araujo de la Torre, some 20 peasants, and Fathers Benigno Martinez and Jesus de la Torre were arrested and all thrown in prison in Saltillo. The priests were behind bars for five days, Araujo for two months. In October 1976 Bishop Ruiz was in Torreon. "And it was on that occasion that he invited those of us in Mass Line to Chiapas," says Concha Castro, who back then was a brigade member and today is coordinating the opening of the CNC's Institute of Rural Area Studies in this city. "Some 12 of us brigade members went to Ocosingo. I was there from September 1977 to December 1988. We took part in forming the `Quiotic ta Lecontusel' ejido union and we spurred several economic projects." She says that the work of the Mass Line brigade members in the Chiapas jungle involved "organizing, raising the awareness of people through workshops and seminars, all designed to relieve the most pressing hardships. Our work was overt, not at all clandestine. Neither the communities nor we ever proposed violence as a way of resolving problems. If Father Mardonio says that we planted the ideological seed of the guerrilla war, that is his opinion. We never brought up the issue of the armed struggle, nor did people bring it up with us." She says that Araujo was not in Chiapas. According to newswoman Olga Quirarte, who at that time was news chief for the paper LA OPINION, Araujo, his wife Carmen, and a lot of university students "went into the Chiapas jungle. Some returned very soon. Others, like Hugo Andres and Carmen, stayed for a few months. It was a sort of great March, an imitation of the one that Mao did into Beijing. When the Chiapas mosquitoes got the best of them, they left. It was the big pullback of 1968. There were not guerrillas; they were people who went to support the most backward people in La Laguna."
