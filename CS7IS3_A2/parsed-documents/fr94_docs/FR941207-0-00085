FR941207-0-00085 FR941207-0-00015 In addition to the proposed precontroversy discovery procedures, the Office asked for comment on several matters: We particularly seek comments on the scope of such precontroversy discovery: whether it should include interrogatories of witnesses as well as production of supporting documents, and whether it would advance Chairman Hughes' goal of reducing costs by being able to stipulate facts and remove issues, or whether the additional procedures might add costs to the proceeding. Id . The commentators did not approve of the NPRM's precontroversy discovery proposal. In fact, the commentators urged the Librarian and the Copyright Office to refrain completely from conducting any precontroversy discovery, and proposed a unique solution whereby the CARPs could be convened for conducting such discovery prior to the beginning of the 180-day arbitration period. See 59 FR 23964, 23976 (1994). Under the proposal offered by Copyright Owners, a distinction would be made between ``the commencement of proceedings'' in 17 U.S.C. 803(d) and the ``notice initiating an arbitration proceeding'' described in 17 U.S.C. 802(b) and (e). The Copyright Office would first declare the ``commencement of proceedings'' and then immediately require the filing of written direct cases and empanel the CARP; discovery motions and objections would be ruled on by the CARP. After discovery was completed, the Office would ``initiate an arbitration proceeding,'' and at that point the statutory 180-day arbitration period would begin to run. 59 FR 23977 (1994) (comments of Copyright Owners at 9&hyph;12). We considered the statutory basis for Copyright Owners' proposal and concluded with respect to the Interim Regulations that it was without support: [A]s a matter of statutory construction, the Office cannot agree that the ``commencement of proceedings'' can be conceptually separated from ``initiating an arbitration proceeding'' so as to permit the CARP to sit earlier than the 180-day arbitration period. Section 802(b) (of the Copyright Act), which first uses the phrase ``initiating an arbitration proceeding,'' employs it in the context of ``a notice in the Federal Register initiating an arbitration proceeding under section 803␣*␣*␣*'' In §803, the notice to which §802(b) refers is the ``notice of commencement of proceedings.'' Therefore, the phrases refer to each other and must be considered synonymous. (parenthetical added). 59 FR 23977 (1994). We acknowledged that Chairman Hughes recommended that our regulations provide for precontroversy discovery ``to the extent practicable,'' but concluded that ``there is no way to accomplish this goal under the statutory scheme.'' Id . The result was that the Interim Regulations contained no rules for precontroversy discovery or exchange of documents. Copyright Owners have changed their approach 7 and now seek restoration of a precontroversy discovery procedure similar to the one proposed by the Office in the NPRM. The Copyright Owners' proposal has three principal facets: (1) mandatory exchange of direct cases among all parties to a proceeding prior to commencement of arbitration; (2) formal scheduling of a precontroversy discovery period by the Librarian; and (3) submission of and ruling on direct case discovery motions and objections by the Librarian, including motions, objections, and petitions contemplated in §§251.4, 251.41(b) and 251.45(a) of the Interim Regulations. 7 Copyright Owners ask the Copyright Office to reconsider their proposal of convening CARPs prior to commencement of the 180-day arbitration period, suggesting that the Office could consider that the phrases ``notice initiating an arbitration proceeding'' and ``notice of commencement of proceedings'' have different meanings and therefore could constitute two separate events. For the reasons described in the Interim Regulations, however, the Office is adhering to its position that CARPs may not be convened prior to the commencement of the 180-day arbitration period. See 59 FR 23977 (1994). Copyright Owners argue that in order for precontroversy discovery to be in any way productive, the Copyright Office rules must be amended to require the parties to a proceeding to exchange their direct cases prior to the commencement of arbitration, as opposed to after a CARP has been convened. Copyright Owners, comments at 3&hyph;5, 7&hyph;10. They assert that without an exchange of direct cases, precontroversy discovery would become a fishing expedition as the parties attempt to guess at each other's theory of the case and principal evidence. Exchange of direct cases would allow the parties to focus on the evidence that will be presented at a hearing and reduce the amount of time the CARPs will need to devote to discovery matters. Id . at 3&hyph;4. In order to streamline the process and promote efficiency, the Copyright Owners suggest that the Librarian coordinate and schedule the precontroversy discovery process. Under the Copyright Owners' plan for distribution proceedings, the Librarian would first publish a notice seeking comment as to the existence of a controversy. 8 Id . at 8. The notice would specify a filing date for comments, request that interested parties file their notice of intent to participate in the proceeding with their comments, and ask the participating parties for their comments on scheduling issues. Id. After receipt of the comments and participation notices, the Librarian would evaluate the existence of controversies, and then issue a scheduling order that would provide: 8 Copyright Owners propose a similar plan for rate adjustment proceedings. Copyright Owners, reply comments at 7 n.5. 1. dates for the filing of: (a) motions and objections contemplated by §251.45(a) of the Interim Regulations;
