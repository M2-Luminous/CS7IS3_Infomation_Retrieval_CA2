"Enough bloodshed, enough casualties, our material and moral resources have long been exhausted," the letter says. "The refugees have reached the point where they have begun begging." The documents [as published] are signed by several hundred people driven to desperation, they voice their indignation at the irresponsibility of opposition-minded deputies and their "jingoist speeches" in parliament. "We ask you to take all the necessary measures for a timely and unimpeded bringing in of peacekeeping forces and their deployment in Abkhazia," the authors of the letter insist.
