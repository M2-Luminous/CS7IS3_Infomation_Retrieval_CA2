FR940527-1-00207 FR940527-1-00014 Appendix D: Recommendation of Update Factors for Operating Cost Rates of Payment for Inpatient Hospital Services I. Background Several provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) address the setting of update factors for services furnished in FY 1995 by hospitals subject to the prospective payment system and those excluded from the prospective payment system. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act sets the FY 1995 percentage increases in the operating cost standardized amounts equal to the rate of increase in the hospital market basket minus 2.5 percentage points for prospective payment hospitals located in urban areas. For hospitals located in rural areas, section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) requires the Secretary to apply an update so as to make the rural national average standardized amounts equal to the other urban national average standardized amount. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(iv) sets the FY 1995 percentage increase to the hospital-specific rate applicable to sole community hospitals equal to the rate of increase in the hospital market basket minus 2.2 percentage points. Section 1886(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act sets the FY 1995 percentage increase in the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system equal to the rate of increase in the excluded hospital market basket minus a reduction factor (not to exceed 1.0 percent) depending on the provider's operating costs and target amounts. In accordance with section 1886(d)(3)(A) of the Act, we are proposing to update the average standardized amounts, the hospital-specific rates and the rate-of-increase limits for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system as provided in section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act. Based on the currently forecasted market basket increase of 3.6 percent for hospitals subject to the prospective payment system, the proposed updates in the standardized amounts are 1.1 percent for hospitals in urban areas and approximately 8.4 percent for hospitals in rural areas. The proposed update in the hospital-specific rate applicable to sole community hospitals is 1.4 percent (that is, the market basket rate of increase of 3.6 percent minus 2.2 percentage points). The proposed update for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system is based on the percentage increase in the excluded hospital market basket (currently estimated at 3.7 percent) minus a reduction factor (not to exceed 1.0 percent). Sections 1886(e)(2)(A) and (3)(A) of the Act require that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (ProPAC) recommend to the Congress by March 1, 1994 an update factor that takes into account changes in the market basket rate of increase index, hospital productivity, technological and scientific advances, the quality of health care provided in hospitals, and long-term cost effectiveness in the provision of inpatient hospital services. In its March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC recommended update factors to the standardized amounts equal to the percentage increase in the market basket minus 1.5 percentage points for urban hospitals and the market basket rate of increase plus 1.6 percentage points for hospitals located in rural areas. Based on its market basket rate of increase estimate of 3.7 percent, ProPAC's recommended updates to the standardized amounts equal 2.2 percent for hospitals located in urban areas and 5.3 percent for hospitals located in rural areas. ProPAC recommended that the update for the hospital-specific rates applicable to sole community hospitals be equal to the average update for all hospitals (that is, equal to the percentage increase in the market basket minus 1.0 percentage point, or 2.7 percent based on a market basket rate of increase estimate of 3.7 percent). The components of ProPAC's update factor recommendations are described in detail in the ProPAC report, which is published as Appendix F to this document. We discuss ProPAC's recommendations concerning the update factors and our responses to those recommendations below. Section 1886(e)(4) of the Act requires that the Secretary, taking into consideration the recommendations of ProPAC, recommend update factors for FY 1995 that take into account the amounts necessary for the efficient and effective delivery of medically appropriate and necessary care of high quality. Under section 1886(e)(5) of the Act, we are required to publish the recommended FY 1995 update factors that are provided for under section 1886(e)(4) of the Act. Accordingly, this appendix provides our recommendations of appropriate update factors, our analysis of the derivation of the amount of the update factors, and our responses to the ProPAC recommendations concerning the update factors. II. Secretary's Recommendations Under section 1886(e)(4) of the Act, we are recommending that the standardized amounts be increased by an average amount equal to the market basket rate of increase minus 2.5 percentage points for hospitals located in urban areas and the market basket rate of increase plus 4.8 percentage points for hospitals located in rural areas (before the effects of adjustments for outlier, geographic reclassification and recalibration of the DRG relative weights). Our recommendation for a higher update to the rural standardized amount is intended to eliminate the differential between the standardized amounts for other urban and rural hospitals, as required by section 1886(b)(3)(B)(i)(X) of the Act. We are also recommending an update of the market basket rate of increase minus 2.2 percentage points to the hospital-specific rate for sole community hospitals. These figures are consistent with the President's budget recommendation, given the new market basket forecast of 3.6 percent. We recommend that hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system receive an update equal to the percentage increase in the market basket that measures input price increases for services furnished by excluded hospitals minus 1.0 percentage point. That market basket rate of increase is currently forecast at 3.7 percent. Subtracting 1.0 percentage point would result in an update for hospitals excluded from the prospective payment system of 2.7 percent. As required by section 1886(e)(4) of the Act, we have taken into consideration the recommendations of ProPAC in setting these recommended update factors. Our responses to the ProPAC recommendations concerning the update factors are discussed below. III. ProPAC Recommendation for Updating the Prospective Payment System Standardized Amounts For FY 1995, ProPAC recommends that the standardized amount be updated by the following factors: •The projected rate of increase in the hospital market basket (which was estimated to be 3.7 percent in ProPAC's March 1, 1994 report) with an adjustment of 0.0 percentage points to account for the different wage and salary price proxies used for the ProPAC market basket rate of increase. •A correction of ^1.1 percent to reflect the forecast error in the FY 1993 market basket rate of increase.
