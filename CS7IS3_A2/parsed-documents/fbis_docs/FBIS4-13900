No two observers would disagree that the peace process has stumbled and that chances of peace are gradually narrowing as a result of Israel's intransigence and the fact that the U.S. role has been confined to wishes rather than using Washington's huge capabilities to force Israel to implement Security Council resolutions and withdraw from the occupied Arab territories. TISHRIN adds: By virtue of its great responsibilities as a major and leading party to the peace process, Syria has made every possible effort to make concrete progress. It has also contributed actively to saving this process from collapse more than once on account of Israel's reckless conduct and practices, which are far from the spirit of peace. Syria expected the round of talks held following the Geneva summit to yield substantive results to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. The results of the talks, however, clashed with the same Israeli intransigence and the Israeli negotiating team's refusal to discuss the question of withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan. The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre then came to shed light on the crimes of the settlers and the risks inherent in the continued presence of settlements in the occupied territories. The massacre also placed the international community before its responsibilities toward the removal of Israeli occupation. As Christopher was preparing to come to the region, the rulers of Israel, as usual, released a spurt of statements ostensibly stressing efforts to achieve peace, while the substance of these statements points to obstructing just peace, reshuffling cards, complicating the situation, and confusing responsibilities. Syria and the other Arab parties to the Washington talks have a simple, clear demand that is in perfect harmony with UN resolutions, the principles of international law, and the foundations of the Madrid conference. TISHRIN adds: Since the launching of the U.S. peace initiative, Syria has made it clear that it will not relinquish an iota of its national soil nor any national or pan-Arab right; that there can be no compromise on the Golan; and that there is no alternative to the return of the Golan in full to its motherland and the return of the Syrians who were displaced to their homeland. In return, and for over two years, Syria has not heard anything from the rulers of Israel except vague hints and has only seen evasion of withdrawal. The paper concludes: The U.S. secretary of state's tour will be fruitful inasmuch as it places the rulers of Israel before the facts of a just and comprehensive solution and employs the U.S. weight to establish a just and comprehensive solution. The peace process has been going on for far too long and it faces the threat of collapse if the Arabs do not see tangible results toward regaining all of their occupied territories and usurped rights. AL-BA'TH devotes its editorial to the contradiction in Rabin's statements. Perhaps, the paper said, the head of the Israeli government thought, through the statements he made on the eve of Christopher's visit to the region, that he had scored a great success in the peace process or that he had fulfilled all his obligations, so he left for Moscow having on top of his agenda bringing in more Jewish emigrants to settle them in the occupied Arab territories. AL-BA'TH adds: If we pause for a second to consider what Rabin said about the dismantling of the settlements on the occupied Golan, we see that the words he used hide concepts that do not serve the peace process in any way. Thus, we quickly come to the conclusion that Rabin was only playing on words and resorting, as usual, to maneuvers and deception. AL-BA'TH goes on: Rabin chose to make his statements only hours before Christopher's tour of the region to sound as if he were making concessions on the peace process. He has, however, as usual, ignored the fact that what he termed concessions is something that contradicts reason and international charters because anyone who makes a concession should own whatever it is in the first place. Since Israel does not own an inch of the territory, it cannot claim to be conceding it. The paper asserts that the question of settlement activity has been an obstacle to the peace process in the same way the absence of a clear, unequivocal commitment to withdrawal from the occupied territories is an obstacle to this process. Therefore, we can conclude that Rabin, who spoke at great length about the Golan without announcing full withdrawal from it, has once again sought to circumvent the aim of Christopher's tour by making deceptive, propagandistic statements that do not at all change the Israeli position, which still rejects the peace process. AL-BA'TH concludes: Hence, the U.S. secretary, who said he was not optimistic about his current tour, will meet an adamant Israeli position. To break this position, emphasis must be placed on the requirements of the peace process and rectifying its course through Rabin's commitment to full withdrawal from the Golan and consequently translating what he said into action on the ground if he truly wants peace.
