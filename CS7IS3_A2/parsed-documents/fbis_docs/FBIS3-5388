This is because there are few profitable projects in Russia due to political unrest and inflation, and because the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is reluctant to insure exports to Russia. Although the industrialized nations launched their aid plans for Russia with a flourish, in actuality, the plans have produced almost no results. Japan decided to contribute $2.5 billion in emergency aid to the former Soviet Union in October 1991. It also pledged $1.1 billion in aid to Russia at a G-7 meeting of foreign and finance ministers in April 1993. The first aid plan includes $1.8 billion for export insurance and the second plan $1.1 billion, totaling $2.9 billion for export insurance. However, among this, only $1.1 billion has been used, including $700 million paid against events related to the export of steel pipes to Russian natural gas companies. The subject of the insurance is limited to energy development, such as developing and refining oil and gas supplies, to help Russia build up a system in which it can acquire foreign currency by producing and exporting oil and gas, which are the country's major resources. However, because Russia's internal structure has not yet been strengthened, no specific energy development projects have been drawn up. According to MITI, business talks between Mitsui & Company and Luk Oil (in Moscow) [name as published] over the export of oil well pipes have been stalled, and thus are not subject to the export insurance. MITI exercises prudence when it comes to paying insurance money. It has made a strict rule that events insured against are not subject to export insurance if they occur as a result of business failures on the part of Russia. Beginning this year, unpaid export charges from the former Soviet Union have become subject to export insurance, and MITI has begun to pay insurance against some unpaid charges. Because the amount of insurance money MITI will pay against events related to exports to Russia is likely to reach 70 billion yen during the current fiscal year, MITI has no choice but to be cautious about paying insurance. A source at a trading firm said: "Although MITI has decided on the amount of the export insurance, it has no intention of paying it." The export insurance is not applied to a nation which fails to pay export charges. However, Japan set up the export insurance for Russia when the United States and Germany launched their aid plans and strongly requested Japan follow suit. A source at a trading firm who is critical of the government, said: "This is a good example of failure in Tokyo's policy of following in the footsteps of the United States."
