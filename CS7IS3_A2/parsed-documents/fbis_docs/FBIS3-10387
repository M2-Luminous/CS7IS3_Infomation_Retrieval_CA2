They were all beneficiaries of the pardon announced by President Rafael Caldera. Rear Admiral Gruber Odreman abandoned his sickbed at the military hospital and before going home to continue resting on the recommendation of his doctors, who had performed surgery on him, he stopped to talk to journalists. At that time he justified the military uprisings in many ways. He said his plans were for the president's pardon to benefit him once all the subordinates who accompanied him during the 27 November uprising are released. However, since that is not currently the case, he did not ask for a discharge. [Begin Gruber recording] Undoubtedly, no one should be afraid. I -- and I am sure the same went for my companeros -- never had the idea of rebelling against the government. I want to emphatically state, however, that we have always observed the laws and the regulations of the armed institution. We heeded the spirit of Article 28 of the National Armed Forces Law, which more or less states: No one is forced to do more than is demanded of him but in all unforeseen accidents or incidents military officers must join the ranks leading toward the banners that are most fitting for military honor. We, therefore, ask ourselves: What banners are we going to follow? I am referring to the circumstances under which we were forced to rebel. Should we join the black banner of the nation's moral and physical rottenness or the banner of dignity, honor, and justice? That was the feeling and spirit of all my companeros that led us to rebel at that time. I do not believe the same conditions exist under the present circumstances because the leader of the nation is a man in whom all Venezuelans and especially the officers of the National Armed Forces have placed their trust. [end recording] Later, General Raul Alejandro Salazar, chief of the 3d Infantry Division, pointed out that President Caldera also pardoned the following persons: [Begin Salazar recording] Today the president of the Republic pardoned Rear Adm. Hernan Gruber Odreman, Aviation Lieutenant Luis Miguel Magallanes Andrades, Aviation Lt. Rafael Arturo Brito, Aviation Lt. Edgar (Cruz) Arteaga, National Guard Lt. Franklin Garcia Duque, and citizen German Robles. [end recording] Rear Adm. Gruber Odreman said that he is willing to request his discharge from the Armed Forces just as he had announced when he met with the president of the Republic.
