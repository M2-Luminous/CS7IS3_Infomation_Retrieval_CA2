Talking to BILD AM SONNTAG, Horn said: "Urged by the government coalition, the defense minister seems to be planning to cheat the voters. He says that all the garrisons will be maintained, even if the Bundeswehr is cut down in forces. But in fact, under the Ruehe concept there will be several barracks where there will only be uniformed caretakers left, who will maintain the buildings. These facilities will, of course, no longer be used for military purposes. The full truth will not emerge until after the Bundestag elections, when a number of barracks will be closed down for cost reasons." Horn demands: "The tasks of the Bundeswehr have to be clearly defined now, so that the army can be made smaller and more efficient." The SPD politician is offering to cooperate on this matter: "I will support the CDU minister in this honest and important task, even if his concept includes closing down several garrisons. But the voters must be told the truth before polling day!"
