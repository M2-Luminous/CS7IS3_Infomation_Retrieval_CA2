SADF spokesman Maj Frank Halforty told SAPA on Tuesday the requirement for 1994 was 5,000 volunteers. If this figure could not be attained, an electronic ballot draft system would be applied to school leavers to make up for the shortfall. However, at this stage it appeared the target of 5, 000 volunteers would be reached. He said 200 of the volunteers would go to the navy and the rest would be mustered into the army unless the air force required volunteer manpower. The new volunteer intake would be recruited over two to three days, Maj Halforty said. He added the basic standards applicable to national servicemen of old, such as basic educational qualifications and health requirements, would apply to volunteer recruits of all races. When asked whether recruits would be expected to answer questions about military experience gained in formations such as Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing], Maj Halforty said he did not think this would be the case. He said the volunteers would be required to complete a year's full-time military service after which they would have to attend eight 30-day camps spread over eight years.
