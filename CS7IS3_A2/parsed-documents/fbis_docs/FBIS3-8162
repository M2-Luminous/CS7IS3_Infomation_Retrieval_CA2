Participants said the talks, which began at the U.S. Embassy, will aim for concrete results by March 15. The U.S. special envoy for former Yugoslavia, Charles Redman, said he was optimistic. "We will have serious work and serious talks," he commented before the start of negotiations. The Moslem-led Bosnian Government is being represented by Justice Minister Kasem Trnka. The Croats are represented by Croatia's deputy foreign minister Ivo Sanader and Bosnian Croat leader Kresimir Subak. [passage omitted] Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic told journalists Friday he would probably go to Vienna this weekend to take part in the talks. He planned to continue to Moscow Wednesday to meet his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev, in a bid to secure Serb participation in the project. "Russia can play a positive role" in exerting its influence on the Serbs, Granic told journalists during a visit to the northern Italian city of Trieste, where he was taking part in a meeting of Central European foreign ministers. The main job for the Vienna talks, according to diplomatic sources, is to work out the details of a constitution inspired by the Swiss model of autonomous cantons. There could be three cantons, the sources said; one Croat unit grouping the present self-proclaimed Bosnian Croat republic and two Moslem units in central Bosnia. The central government would have limited powers, taking charge of foreign affairs, defense and trade. Each side would take turns in holding the presidency and would hold a balance of power in the parliament. The talks should also lay the basis for a long-term military agreement between Croat and Moslem forces, following a ceasefire which began last Friday. In Sarajevo on Friday, UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink said the two sides had given the green light for UN troops to patrol frontlines as early as Saturday, to be accompanied by unarmed Croats and Moslems. Talks will also begin on opening up six routes across frontlines. UN peacekeepers will be deployed immediately at the Croat-Moslem hot spots of Mostar, Vitez, Gorni Vakuf, Prozor, Konjic, and Jablanica where ceasefire violations have been rampant, said UNPROFOR spokesman Major Guy Vinet. Bosnian Army leaders and the United Nations have also warned that more international troops were needed to enforce the ceasefire. Brigadier-General Fikret Muslimovic of the Bosnian Army, speaking from Zenica in central Bosnia, said the UNPROFOR force was not large enough to keep the peace between Moslems and Croats, who are confronting each other over large tracts of territory. "It won't be possible," he said, "if more troops do not come." [passage omitted]
