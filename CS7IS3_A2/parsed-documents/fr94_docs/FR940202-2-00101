FR940202-2-00101 FR940202-2-00071 The revised guideline addresses common problems encountered by infection-control practitioners regarding the prevention and control of nosocomial pneumonia in U.S. hospitals. Sections on the prevention of bacterial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated and/or critically ill patients, care of respiratory-therapy devices, prevention of cross-contamination, and prevention of viral lower respiratory-tract infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza infections, have been expanded and updated. New sections on Legionnaires' disease and pneumonia due to Aspergillus spp. have been added. Lower respiratory tract infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is not addressed in this document; it is covered in separate guidelines. 1 * *Footnotes to appear at end of docket. Part I, Issues for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia_1994, can be an important resource for educating healthcare workers regarding prevention and control of nosocomial respiratory tract infections. Because education of healthcare workers is the cornerstone of an effective infection control program, hospitals should give high priority to continuing infection control educational programs for these staff members. PART I. ISSUES ON PREVENTION OF NOSOCOMIAL PNEUMONIA_1994 BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA I. Etiologic Agents The reported distribution of etiologic agents causing nosocomial pneumonia varies between hospitals because of differences in patient populations and diagnostic methods employed. 2&hyph;11 In general, however, bacteria have been the most frequently isolated pathogens. 2&hyph;7,10,12&hyph;14 Schaberg et al. reported that in 1986&hyph;1989, aerobic bacteria comprised at least 73%, and fungi 4%, of isolates from sputum and tracheal aspirates of cases at the University of Michigan Hospitals and hospitals participating in the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS); very few anaerobic bacteria and no viruses were reported, probably because anaerobic and viral cultures were not performed routinely in the reporting hospitals (Table 1). 4 Similarly, cultures of bronchoscopic specimens from mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia have rarely yielded anaerobes. 6&hyph;8,10,12,15,16 Only the report by Bartlett, which was based mainly on cultures of transtracheal aspirates in patients not receiving mechanically assisted ventilation, showed a predominance of anaerobes. 5 Nosocomial bacterial pneumonias are frequently polymicrobial, 5,8,10,12,13,16&hyph;20 and gram-negative bacilli are the usual predominant organisms (Table 1); 2&hyph;7,10,12&hyph;14 however, Staphylococcus aureus (especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus ) 6,8,11,16,21 and other gram-positive cocci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, 6,8 have recently emerged as significant isolates; 15 and Haemophilus influenza has been isolated from mechanically ventilated patients with pneumonia that occurs within 48&hyph;96 hours after intubation. 4&hyph;6,13,16,22 In NNIS hospitals, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Proteus spp. comprised 50% of the isolates from cultures of respiratory tract specimens of patients for whom nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed by using clinical criteria; S. aureus accounted for 16%, and H. influenzae, for 6% (Table 1). 4 Fagon and co-workers reported that gram-negative bacilli were present in 75% of quantitative cultures of protected-specimen brushings (PSB) from patients who had received mechanically assisted ventilation and acquired nosocomial pneumonia; 40% were polymicrobial. 6 In the report by Torres et al., 20% of pathogens recovered from cultures of PSB, blood, pleural fluid, or percutaneous lung aspirate were gram-negative bacilli in pure culture, and 17% were polymicrobial; however, 54% of specimens did not yield any microorganism, probably because of receipt of antibiotics by patients. 7 II. Diagnosis The diagnosis of nosocomial bacterial pneumonia has been difficult. 8,9,17,23&hyph;32 Frequently, the criteria for diagnosis have been fever, cough, and development of purulent sputum, in combination with radiologic evidence of a new or progressive pulmonary infiltrate, a suggestive Gram's stain, and cultures of sputum, tracheal aspirate, pleural fluid, or blood. 4,5,23,25,33&hyph;36 Although clinical criteria together with cultures of sputum or tracheal specimens may be sensitive for bacterial pathogens, they are highly nonspecific, especially in patients with mechanically assisted ventilation; 9,10,13&hyph;16,19,24&hyph;26,29,31,37&hyph;42 on the other hand, cultures of blood or pleural fluid have very low sensitivity. 9,19,20,43 Because of these problems, a group of investigators recently formulated consensus recommendations for standardization of methods to diagnose pneumonia in clinical research studies of ventilator-associated pneumonia. 44&hyph;46 These methods involve bronchoscopic techniques, e.g., quantitative culture of PSB, 6,8&hyph;10,14,16,27,31,38,41,47,48 BAL, 8,13,41,47,49&hyph;54 and pBAL. 15 The reported sensitivities and specificities of these methods have ranged between 70% to 100% and 60% to 100%, respectively, depending on the tests or diagnostic criteria they were compared with. Because these techniques are invasive, they may cause complications such as hypoxemia, bleeding, or arrhythmia. 9,14,42,44,52,55,56 In addition, the sensitivity of the PSB procedure may decrease in patients receiving antibiotic therapy. 10,14,27 Nonbronchoscopic (NB) procedures, e.g., NB-pBAL 13,27,57,58 or NB&hyph;PSB, 14 which utilize blind catheterization of the distal airways, have been developed recently; however, they have not been extensively evaluated. Although the use of bronchoscopic and nonbronchoscopic diagnostic tests can be a major step in better defining the epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia especially in mechanically ventilated patients, further studies are needed to determine their applicability in daily clinical practice.
