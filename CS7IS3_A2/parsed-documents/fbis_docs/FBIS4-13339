Is it possible that U.S. fighter planes downed U.S. helicopters? Frankly, had such an incident taken place in a Third World country, the United States would have screamed and shouted, cried and mourned over the souls of the victims who are worthless and priceless. If the catastrophe had been the fault of a state other than the United States, the world would have been up in arms. Washington would have called for a Security Council meeting and demanded the international community's intervention to punish the wrongdoer, even if the mistake had been committed unintentionally. There are numerous examples of this kind of U.S. behavior. However, because the United States is the one who made the mistake, the issue will not go beyond forming a committee that will look into the circumstances and justifications of the incident. Of course, Britain also reacted calmly to the catastrophe, despite the fact that it lost two of its officers working with the UN forces. But it is a friendship that cannot be forfeited very easily. To put it another way, Britain was afraid of U.S. anger if it protested the incident and accused the United States of negligence. On the other hand, Iraq quickly issued a statement in which it denied involvement in the incident so that it could avert further sanctions that might have been imposed on its people, but this time for no reason. At any rate, with every passing day there is further evidence that the aura with which the United States surrounds itself, thanks to its famous and distinctive media, does not agree with reality. Once again I repeat that had the incident been caused by any other country, demonstrations would have erupted in the whole world condemning the backward people who fail to use the inventions of our age and do not appreciate the value of a life.
