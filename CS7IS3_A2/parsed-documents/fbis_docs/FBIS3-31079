It is in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that the power, transformation, and even the very purpose of NATO are tested. It is in the crisis in the former Yugoslavia that power, that is, powerlessness, and the very purpose of the United Nations are tested. If NATO pushes itself to the foreground, that would in fact mean the beginning of the end of the United Nations. NATO's threats directed exclusively at the Serbian side have brought exactly what was desired -- despite the very transparence of the almost obviously stage-managed event on the Sarajevo marketplace -- that is to say, they have brought the currently better negotiating position for the Muslim side at the Geneva negotiations. The Geneva peace negotiations are virtually not taking place at all. They are being merely simulated, because the Muslims are waiting to see what will happen with the threat. After all, Lord Owen could not but say that the Muslims will be obstructing the talks until the deadline given to the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry expires. As regards the air raids themselves, things nevertheless are not to Izetbegovic's liking. Firstly, things are so serious that Washington and Moscow are holding direct mutual consultations. They are serious to such an extent that all of this is affecting direct relations between the White House and the Kremlin. In this case, we would say, all considerations are even more heedful. Moscow said that it does not accept the NATO ultimatum and that no final decision can be made without the Security Council. A demand was issued by the Russian Parliament to the Russian representatives at the United Nations, to use their right of veto. According to information received from New York, the already convened Security Council session has been adjourned until Monday so that the Russian demand can be thoroughly studied. When one studies more carefully the behavior of UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Yasushi Akashi, then it is also clear that they are going to do everything they can to reach a solution to the conflict in Bosnia at the negotiating table. This is among other things because, as Yasushi Akashi has put it, there may come a fatal strike on the United Nations itself. The Japanese diplomat said that he is going to make a decision following his own conscience, and not according to wishes of the world public. I cannot ignore that public, but I can also not woo it with my decisions, Yasushi Akashi said. While we are on the subject of the public, let us point to a statement by Vitaliy Churkin, who said that Russia also has a public that is equally as legitimate as the American, French, or German ones. Finally, the telephone conversation between Clinton and Yeltsin, according to what has been announced, could mean a political draw that would indicate: There will be no air raids, but also one has to meet the new Muslim territorial demands at least partly. Exactly these new increased Muslim demands seem to have been the reason for all that happened at the Sarajevo marketplace.
