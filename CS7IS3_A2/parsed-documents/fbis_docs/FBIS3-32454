Six of the nongovernment parties and political groups represented in Congress characterized the approval of new commission staffs for the 1994 legislative period as arbitrary and antidemocratic. The ruling Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition on 1 February modified most of the 16 commissions, 13 of which will be chaired by the ruling coalition, two by groups allied with the government, and one by the opposition. The removal of Roger Caceres, former Human Rights Commission chairman, and his replacement by progovernment Congressman Carlos Blanco prompted angry protests and a walk-out by opposition deputies. According to critics, the ruling majority "will have in its hands another mechanism with which to continue covering up" violations of human rights in which "the state apparatus is presumably involved." They mentioned as an example the disappearance of nine students and one professor from "La Cantuta" Teachers School in southeastern Lima following a military incursion on 18 July 1992 by perpetrators who have not yet been punished. "The year has opened with evidence that the ruling coalition will impose a dictatorship in Congress and will not listen to the opposition's proposals or their demands for participation in legislative and supervisory efforts," an opposition statement read. The Moralizing Independent Front (Fim), Peasants and Workers National Front (FNTC), Democratic Left Movement (MDI), Independent Agrarian Movement (MIA), Democratic Coordinating Group (Code) and Popular Christian Party (PPC) have said the ruling coalition is trying to control the supervisory commissions. Coalition Deputy Victor Joy Way, who has coordinated the preparation of the commission staffs, maintains the productivity and punctuality of its members were considered. The MDI's Julio Castro Gomez said congressional regulations do not establish that every year the commission staffs must be modified, adding that every change requires two thirds of all the votes for approval. The formation of the new commissions was only approved by 39 of 80 members of the so-called Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD). CCD President Jaime Yoshiyama said the staff of the ordinary commissions can be modified with the agreement of all the members of the working groups. Yoshiyama expressed regret over the withdrawal of the opposition congressmen, and he announced the ruling majority is seriously working on the preparation of its own draft bills. Joy Way, the CCD's second vice president, established a 72-hour deadline for the opposition to present, by consensus, any changes of its representatives in the congressional commissions. The ruling coalition controls the following commissions: constitution, supervision, production, justice, environment, human rights, decentralization and local governments, foreign relations, defense, health, budget, energy and economy. Carlos Torres, who will continue at the head of the Constitution Commission, announced the work groups will be installed during the week, thereby dismissing the possibility of the modifications the opposition is demanding. Torres said the Change 90/New Majority Movement Coalition has every right to renew the chairman of the Human Rights Commission, and he acknowledged the work of Caceres, a member of the FNTC.
