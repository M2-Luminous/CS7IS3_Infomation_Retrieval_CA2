FR940826-2-00132 FR940826-2-00068 [Release No. 34&hyph;34565; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;02] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Equity and SPX RAES Participation Requirements August 19, 1994. On January 22, 1994, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or Commission''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposal to amend its rules to impose fees on market makers who fail to observe certain participation duties on the Retail Automated Execution System (``RAES'') for equity and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (``SPX'') classes of options. Among other things, the CBOE proposes to amend CBOE Rules 8.16, ``RAES Eligibility in Equity Options'' and 24.16, ``RAES Eligibility in SPX/NDX,'' to impose the following fees for failures to satisfy the rules' log-off requirements: 3 (1) a fee of $100.00 for each of one to three failures within one twelve-month period; (2) a fee of $250.00 for each of four to six failures within one twelve-month period; and (3) a fee of $500.00 for each of seven or more failures within one twelve-month period. In addition, the proposal provides that members who fail to meet the log-on requirements of CBOE Rules 8.16(b) or 24.16(b) ordinarily will be suspended from participation on RAES at the applicable trading station for a period extending to 21 consecutive business days. 4 1 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(1) (1982). 2 17 CFR ยง240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 CBOE Rules 8.16(a)(iii) and 24.16(a)(iii) require a market maker participating in RAES for equity or SPX options to continue on the system only as long as he is present in the trading crowd and to log off RAES when he leaves the trading crowd, unless the departure is for a brief interval. 4 CBOE Rule 8.16(b) states that in option classes designated by the Market Performance Committee (``MPC''), any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in that option class whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. CBOE Rule 24.16(b) states that unless exempted by the MPC, any market maker who has logged on RAES at any time during an expiration month must log on the RAES system in SPX/NDX whenever he is present in that trading crowd until the next expiration. Notice of the proposed rule change was published for comment in the Federal Register in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34270 (June 28, 1994), 59 FR 34457 (July 5, 1994) and 34329 (July 7, 1994), 59 FR 35954 (July 14, 1994). No comments were received on the proposal. The CBOE states that the purpose of the proposed rule change is to impose fees on members who fail to observe the RAES log-off requirements set forth in CBOE Rules 8.16(a) and 24.16(a). The proposed fees for equity and SPX RAES are identical in amounts and graduated structure to the fees approved recently for failures to comply with the log-on and log-off requirements for Standard & Poor's 100 Index (``OEX'') options. 5 For OEX options, and as proposed for SPX and equity options, the fee amounts increase in relation to the number of times each calendar year that a member does not log off as required. 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34376 (July 14, 1994), 59 FR 37109 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;12) (``OEX RAES Approval Order'').
