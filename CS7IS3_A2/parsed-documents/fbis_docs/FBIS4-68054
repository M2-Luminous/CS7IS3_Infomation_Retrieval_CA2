Police officials said about 15 people living in the two apartments have been placed under investigation for falsifying papers and receiving stolen goods after searches in the apartments revealed false passports and identity cards and an unspecified number of cellular telephones, car stereos, cameras and other electronic equipment. Also confiscated were Arab language newspapers and FIS propaganda leaflets, as well as "dozens" of videocassettes showing people wearing ski-masks and demonstrating how to use a variety of weapons, police said. The nationalities of those under investigation, most of them between the ages of 20 and 25, were not revealed but investigators said they did not believe the group was preparing any attacks or engaging in paramilitary training.
