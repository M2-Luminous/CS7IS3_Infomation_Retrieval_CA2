I have mixed feelings with respect to the persons who were named among its authors. After all, I worked with them for many years and I am very friendly with them, despite what they write and the kinds of views they express. I am deeply convinced of their high values and respectability. This makes it more complicated to evaluate the document they drafted. Nevertheless, in pointing out the prism of personal relationships, I realize that the public is not very concerned about my emotions in this regard. I would single out three elements, three lines, in this document. The first concerns the critical assessment of the current situation and the condition of the Russian economy. A great deal is right here, and many facts which attest to the situation that has taken shape are absolutely correct: it is really alarming and precarious. I do not think there can be any particular disagreement about this. Moreover, I do not think it possible to share the views of those who reassure us somehow and maintain that nothing in particular, nothing alarming, is taking place and that everything is more or less normal. I do not think we can permit ourselves to make such an assessment now and over the next several years. Second. In my view, the assessment of the situation, mainly its roots, the underlying causes, is subjective in nature to a significant degree. The persons who made the assessment are honest and reputable, of course. Although not all their names were given. All the same, it is one-sided, and it seems to me that this is not suitable for an academic approach to consideration of a problem. What does the lack of objectivity consist of? First of all, the unequivocally negative conclusion about the intention and progress of those reforms which were implemented in 1992 and 1993, the condemnation of monetarism and price liberalization. It seemed to me that an objective analysis of the positive changes and shifts in the economy, mainly toward a transition to the market, would have been more appropriate. But these shifts are completely obvious, and only a blind person can fail to see them. Those who were called upon for many years to restructure the Soviet planned economy into a market economy ought to have turned their attention to this. I am deeply convinced personally that objectively, regardless of anyone's will or wishes, we approached a turning point at the end of 1991 when there should have been a breakthrough. By that time, we could no longer continue on a evolutionary path. I have written about this many times, and I continue to hold the same view. There were other alternatives as well, of course. But then the program's authors should have said what these alternatives were and the price we would have to pay for them. My analysis shows that the ones which could have been proposed for that period and later, through 1992, would have resulted in more severe consequences than the ones which exist now. For this reason, it is not right to make a categorical judgment about what is worse and what is better in this case: when some plan has already been implemented, the alternatives which were not put into effect always can seem better. I insist: a sensible, unbiased analysis shows that other alternatives would have been worse. What I observed, working together with L. Abalkin in N. Ryzhkov's government, convinced me: the gradual, evolutionary path of development which was conceived in the political and economic situation at that time led to a catastrophe. A breakthrough was inevitable sooner or later. It took place. The consequences turned out to be severe, not only because of errors and miscalculations in the work of the Gaydar government, but the problems which had accumulated before then. I would say that the scale of the challenge was much greater than human abilities to respond to it so that everything turned out all right, so that no one suffered, so that there were no complaints from the academicians. This is why they are not assessing the situation as a whole adequately, in my view. Third. What is the constructive part of the document? I will not deny that there are individual elements in it which deserve to be discussed, and possibly even realized. But as a whole, the spirit of these proposals seems unacceptable to me. And not because it may seem that I am ideologically inclined in favor of one alternative as opposed to another. No, there is a different reason: either the measures proposed will not produce the results expected and will lead to negative consequences that are even more serious, or they simply do not take the actual situation into account and cannot be implemented. I will not make unsubstantiated statements. I will cite a few examples. One of the program's key features is the proposal on price controls. Meanwhile, it is being implemented. Prices for energy and energy resources are partly controlled, and the tariffs in transportation and municipal services are partly controlled. The document gives particular emphasis to the need to freeze prices for energy resources. I should say the following in this connection. The process of shaping a market economy is now taking place independently, without regard for the wishes of the government, the Academy of Sciences, or anyone else. It is linked with the establishment of new relative prices and new price ratios. And they are being shaped in spite of all types of obstacles stemming from the structure of our economy. The analysis which we conducted last autumn states: where there is no interference from price controls, the process of moving them closer to world prices is under way. On the whole, a very positive process. Unfortunately, however, it it has its unfavorable aspects, because enterprises are beginning to feel that while they had a comfortable life last year and all the price correlations, outlays for production and technologies, and so forth were balanced, they are now being upset. However, if these upsets had not taken place, there would have been no incentives for restructuring, either! Practically all our enterprises felt the need to reduce costs for the first time at the end of 1993. And not because someone from the top ordered them to reduce production cost. This has now become a vitally necessary task for them. They must reduce costs or run to the government and ask it to increase excise taxes, particularly because foreign competition is becoming stronger. The prices for energy and energy resources are the most urgent problem. Because the entire Russian economy has been adjusted to technologies which waste energy, those which consume vast amounts of energy. The gap between domestic prices and world prices for it in the starting period was greater than ever before. Our cost was 7 percent of the world cost of oil. Now the ratios have changed. But we still have to come up to real price correlations, all the same. I can agree with what was stated in the report: this goal cannot be reached too quickly, instantly. However, liberalization of prices for energy resources is inevitable, and they should be controlled by domestic supply and demand. And so that there is some balance with world prices, we should introduce an energy tax or export duties and nothing else. Of course, the proposal to freeze the prices for energy resources eases the situation for the processing industry, enabling it to remain in this uncertain position for some time: it may survive, but it cannot reach normalcy. At the same time, the fuel and power complex is in a very difficult situation. It is not receiving the appropriate incomes or the appropriate funds for investment. In the meantime, whether anyone likes it or not, it has a key role in the struggle for Russia's position in the world markets and to restore Russia's economy and competitiveness. It is precisely from the fuel and power complex that we can obtain specific funds to invest in other sectors and to support them, inasmuch as they will not be able to get up to the world level by themselves. Even the best sectors of our processing industry and the science-intensive sectors of the VPK [military industrial complex] require major support from the state for 3 to 5 years in order to come up to world standards and compete in world markets as an equal. Where are we to obtain these funds? Our raw material, petroleum, and gas are the only competitive products. Clearly, we have to invest funds in this sector to obtain the resources needed. I share the view of the Academy of Sciences economists who say that we should take more from the fuel and power complex, because this is the only complex where a positive value-added is really being created in world prices. All the other sectors are producing a negative value-added. In theory this is absolutely correct, but in practice the situation today is such that the extraction of raw material is falling and oil production is falling, and huge investments are needed; in addition to this, prices in the world market are dropping disastrously. Our price for a metric ton of oil is now 41,000 rubles [R], but the world price was R120,000 not long ago. Think of it, we had 30 percent of the world value at one point. Now it has dropped to 80,000! For this reason, it is vitally important for us that the TEK [fuel and power complex] stand on its own feet. This is why I believe that freezing prices for energy resources is essentially a conservative idea. I do not think we can follow this path. Some control is possible, but not so that it interferes with the process of shaping the new relative prices. The program states that the process under way is making the structure of the Russian economy heavier, while structural reorganization is moving in exactly the opposite direction. Can we avoid this or not? Let us assume we were now undertaking, in conformity with the canons and our way of thinking in the 1970's, to restructure the production structure this way: by giving more to the consumer sector, less to the extractive industry, and more to machinebuilding, as in the years of acceleration. Is this correct? I have serious doubts about this. The consumer sector. In itself it is not needed, but it has been called upon to provide the public with inexpensive, high-quality commodities. But very often the imported products turn out to be better than the domestic ones and more preferable for the consumer. I do not know what kind of sector will survive in the consumer sector, but there is simply no sense in protecting everything in succession. For this reason, the thesis about making the economy heavier, as a reproach and indication that some problem is increasing, is really unconvincing. It seems to me this reflects the ideology of the 1970's, when we assumed that perestroyka would take place within a closed Russian economy. But now we do not even know exactly those strong aspects which will make their appearance, and how the structure of the Russian economy will take shape. Moreover, very positive structural shifts in the country are clearly apparent. Trade and the banking and monetary sectors are developing rapidly. Not everyone likes this. In this case we say that everything is going into middleman operations, but we need real production. From the viewpoint of Marxist theory, this is correct, perhaps. However, trade and banking also produce a gross domestic product, generally speaking. And if capital has been channeled here now, it means it is more profitable to put it here. [11 Feb p 7] [Text] Let us remember what the Russian economy suffers from the most and what it needs to increase its effectiveness. Trade and banking. This is precisely where the mechanism to regulate market relationships is being shaped, where we will be prompted to direct our money, how prices will be formed, and so forth. For this reason, simply to condemn intermediary operations means to ignore the very progressive structural shifts which are taking place in Russia, regardless of what we wish to happen. They are taking place precisely because its economy has turned out to be liberalized and open to a substantial degree. Let us turn to another thesis in the program, which states that we should control prices and why we cannot make the transition to a market economy like all the other countries. The reason is indicated: the excessive monopolism of the Russian economy. It is really extensive. But in a closed economy it looks simply colossal. Incidentally, I was one of the first to study monopolism in Russia in the 1986-1987 period. And I am very careful how I treat this opinion now. I will explain why. Monopolism in the Russian economy has undergone quite extensive transformations, to which few persons devote any attention, for some reason. Many monopolies which seemed to be particularly dangerous ceased to appear that way with the opening of the economy. Moreover, they turned out to be more vulnerable than other enterprises and other sectors. Here is one of the examples. AvtoVAZ [Volga Automotive Plant] is obviously a monopolist enterprise. But today it is running to the government, asking for higher tariffs on imported motor vehicles. The ZIL [Automotive Plant imeni Likhachev] is doing the same thing. Many of our other major plants have rushed to the center: rescue us quickly. because our products are not competitive and our costs are excessively high. In other words, they felt the competition. This is what the opening of an economy means. Meanwhile, the economists argued: can it have a substantial effect on the status of the domestic market of a vast country such as Russia, with a low proportion of imports in domestic consumption, and the like? In my view, it has now become clear that opening of the economy is exerting a revolutionizing influence on the condition of the domestic market, on competition, and so forth which is much stronger than could have been expected. Does this mean that monopolism is not a problem? Of course, it is. But only now its solution requires not general theoretical academic debates, but a more specific and active analysis. The monopolism which exists in the rayon around a dairy plant or a meat combine, or a trade and distribution network, is much more important than the monopolism which we see at the level of industrial giants. From this point of view I may argue with A. Chubays, let us say, that all the statements against financial-industrial groups or large holding companies are not always well-grounded. If foreign competition is really a factor, their influence does not turn out to be so strong. But of course, these groups will enjoy greater influence within the country than the foreign competitors. And there is unquestionably a certain danger here. But in the document under discussion, this matter is discussed in a very general way and the following verdict is handed down: we have monopolism, and for this reason we should control prices, although the latter does not completely follow from the former. In fact, it is important see where monopolism is particularly substantial now. If we are referring to power companies which raise the rates for electricity, let us say, there is monopolism here and we must combat it. Because we cannot replace energy with a foreign product. At the same time, the regional power commissions are misusing their position: they set the rates lower for their customers and higher for other regions. And it is necessary to control prices for a period of time. The same thing applies to railroad tariffs. We cannot overcome the monopoly here, and no one in the foreign market will replace it. It is another matter when we are talking about milk and meat, let us say. But don't we freeze bottling? We have to follow a more difficult, but more reliable route, which consists of establishing alternative ways to bring a product created on sovkhozes and kolkhozes, let us say, to the consumer and giving them the opportunity to build small processing plants, and so forth. This is the kind of work which is being conducted at the microlevel and does not require significant state intervention. So it is necessary to control prices in the exceptional cases when a monopolist becomes too bold, and so forth. There are laws for this as well. But there should not be price controls on a broad scale in any case. There is one more thesis in the program--on support for certain sectors of industry with state orders. When proposals of this kind are made, the question arises right away: how do we do this? I am not opposed to it. Let us assume that an enterprise needs more time to accumulate investments and many other things in order to adapt to a new situation. How can this be done, how can the process be extended, and what opportunities exist for this? In principle, can this problem be resolved? Let us assume that we have resorted to the help of state orders. Then whom do we give the obligatory orders to and at a low price? After all, an enterprise may refuse to fulfill it, since most of them are not state enterprises. Moreover, there is a law in accordance with which making it obligatory for an enterprise to accept such orders is prohibited. But even if it agrees, it will say: give me inexpensive materials as well. And then we return to the distribution system which we had before. What for? To make the shift to the market easier? To restore the planning system? This is more than astonishing. There is another approach. Let us follow the market route. And establishing state orders means they must be paid for at market prices from the state budget. The newspapers are writing here that the government is allocating R14 trillion to purchase agricultural products. Let us assume that the agrarian lobby shook out an order from the government without the hope that the products purchased would be sold at the same prices at which the state acquired them. But after all, there are other sectors of the economy, the military industrial complex, for example. Should it be given an order too? The program did not state which sectors should be rescued with the help of state orders and where the money is to be obtained. I heard an unpleasant report the other day: our level of tax collection is declining at a catastrophic rate, and the proportion of taxes in the VVP [gross domestic product] as of January this year decreased to almost one-third as much in a year's time. I ask: Can academicians permit themselves to approach the state budget so thoughtlessly, without the appropriate accounting, without evaluations, without weighing the actual opportunities seriously? After all, they must bear responsibility for what is stated in the document. In my opinion, if the state does not have the money, it should reduce all kinds of purchases, namely those expenses which are least efficient. I would prefer, in following the recommendations of the program's authors, to spend more money on investments, especially the ones that are most effective, and on a reliable choice of projects. And this means it must be done jointly with private companies, with private capital, with banks and the like. The document says practically nothing about this. Regrettably, I must come to the conclusion that this is a very poorly grounded proposal which is unlikely to be applied in practice. If the government considered it possible to adopt these proposals as they advise, it ought to reject them very quickly, because it does not have the opportunity to realize them. Now about the agreements on prices and incomes. This idea is being championed by Yevgeniy Saburov. And I am also inclined to support it. This is a very popular theme now, generally speaking. And even Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, in speaking about the application of nonmonetarist methods, seemed to refer to the possibility that there there will be such agreements. A positive case of a similar agreement may be cited: coal miners in the Kuzbass and transport workers agreed that transportation tariffs would be lowered for the coal being exported, in exchange for which the coal miners would share their foreign currency earnings with the transport workers. It would be good if measures such as these are multiplied. But I fear that on the whole, this is a completely unrealistic proposal as a phenomenon on a wide scale. First of all, we are referring to agreements between producers and consumers, who naturally have different interests. Moreover, both sides are poorly organized. They say that our Russian economy is corporate in nature owing to the ministries and horizontal integration. For this reason, they say, all the enterprises know each other and can easily come to an agreement with each other. They are not reaching agreement well at present. But if we come to the level of a trilateral commission, where negotiations are conducted on incomes, prices, and other matters (I mean trade unions, businessmen, and the government), it will turn out that these persons do not enjoy prestige among those they have undertaken to represent. For this reason, the decisions adopted at the level of this trilateral commission will not be considered obligatory by anyone below it. So we are not prepared to realize this idea yet. In our domestic market, representatives are not inclined to consolidate and uphold their interests together at the state level. There is only competition among them at present. Each one is fighting for his own piece, for himself. For this reason, I do not believe that such agreements will become an effective tool of the market soon. But if this is true, the government has no other alternative left to hold back inflation except a strict monetary policy. They call it monetarism. But this is normal financial discipline which is the norm in economic life, and until such discipline exists, there can be no discussion about any kind of market economy. I would agree with authors of the report which state that elimination of the budget deficit cannot become the meaning of life and that domestic industry cannot be strangled for the sake of it. I would agree with them if this deficit were not as large: it is actually more than 10 percent. If we put together all the proposals by ministries and departments on expenditures now, the deficit would be over 16 percent. That is a catastrophe. Who can proceed to do this, what kind of government, even if it is the most protectionist one? Let the academicians speak with the directors about what is impeding them the most. They say: we are being impeded primarily by the high taxes. But when you begin to touch upon the essence of the processes taking place, it turns out that inflation interferes with them most of all. Because while they have earned a certain amount of money, it is quickly devalued. They have to invest in working capital all the time. There is not enough money, and then the directors begin saying: they collect the taxes, they say, and credit is expensive... Correct, but the only means of doing away with all these ailments is by beating inflation. This is why I believe it is not at all correct to resort to the false pathos of the slogan: down with monetarism as a foreign invention which is harmful to the Russian soul. We are referring not to monetarism, but elementary financial discipline and realization that the printing press ccannot be the source of the country's welfare. I believe the program's authors are well aware of this.
