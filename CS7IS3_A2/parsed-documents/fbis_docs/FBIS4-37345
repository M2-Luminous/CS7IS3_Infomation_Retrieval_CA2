'Arafat was given data showing that 45,000 permits for work in Israel have already been given to residents of the territories and that the entry of women and of youths up to the age of 15 is no longer restricted. 'Arafat had called on Rabin to ease the plight of the residents of the territories, lift the closure and the restrictions on work in Israel, open the roadblocks at the entrances to Jerusalem, and immediately transfer to the Palestinian Authority funds from taxes and customs Israel has imposed on the Palestinians. This amount comes to approximately 6 million shekels, and Israel is holding on to the funds until accounts are settled with the Palestinian Authority. Rabin informed 'Arafat that Israel will meet its commitments but will not be able to go beyond that. Israel will also not lift the roadblocks at the entrances to Jerusalem. [passage omitted]
