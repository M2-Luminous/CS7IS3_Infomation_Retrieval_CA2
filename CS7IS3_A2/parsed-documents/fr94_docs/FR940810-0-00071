FR940810-0-00071 FR940810-0-00021 ``Initial assessments'' are different from ``initial monitoring'' required in the 1986 standards. ``Initial monitoring'' as used for processes in general industry, was rationally relied on to estimate future exposures for that purpose. Historic monitoring data were considered second-best data. The new requirement for ``initial exposure assessments'' acknowledges that initial exposure monitoring in many cases cannot adequately predict all future exposures on construction jobs. Even if monitoring results were instantaneously available, the value of early exposure monitoring in predicting later exposures over a multi-day asbestos job is limited. First-day exposures are likely to be lower than later exposures, because they reflect early set-up rather than removal activities, conducted in relatively clean areas before disturbance may contaminate the regulated area. One purpose of the initial exposure assessment is to identify which asbestos jobs are likely to exceed the PEL in time for employers to install and implement the extra controls required to reduce such exposures. Such additional controls may consist of ventilation which redirects the air away from the over-exposed employees, and mandatory protective clothing and hygiene facilities associated with donning and removing such gear. Even employers who are planning to install full negative pressure enclosures with air flushing technology must conduct initial exposure assessments. This will insure that the ``competent person'' has reviewed the success of controls in past projects, in order to evaluate the planned controls for the current project. Testimony and comment to the record emphasized that the evaluation of industrial hygienists or other properly trained personnel was essential to decision making on how best to protect workers. For example, David Kirby of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, agreed with the statement that before there is any operation involving asbestos containing material, the industrial hygiene staff makes a determination as to whether that's likely to be a high risk, relatively high risk or a low risk operation (Tr. 197). Other participants endorsed requiring advance assessment of asbestos-disturbing jobs (see e.g., ORC, Ex. 145, p. 6).
