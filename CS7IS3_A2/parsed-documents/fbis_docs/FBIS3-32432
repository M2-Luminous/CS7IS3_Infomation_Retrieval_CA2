At the same time, we wanted to verify, in situ, the United Nations' weight in this peace process. In our case, we asked for UN participation as soon as we initiated talks in Guatemala. We ratified our request in the agreement signed on 10 January. We have called on the United Nations to act as a mediator in the process and this, of course, includes verification of all the agreements. [end recording] URNG Commander Gaspar Ilom, who is the son of Miguel Angel Asturias, a nobel laureate for literature, considered that the UN experience in verifying the implementation of the agreements in El Salvador is promising. Ilom said the Guatemalan peace process will be very complicated but not, as a result of this, irresolvable. He added that they hope to reach agreements leading to peace very soon. Ilom insisted that the main points of the negotiation are to establish the role of the Army in a democratic society, the country's economic problems, and issues related to the Indian problem.
