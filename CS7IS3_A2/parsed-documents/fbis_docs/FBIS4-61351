This high-ranking Russian diplomat told newsmen today that his place in the contact group established to step up UN peacemaking efforts in Bosnia will be occupied by Aleksey Nikiforov who has "direct experience" of work in former Yugoslavia. The new contact group, which comprises Russian, American, French, German, and british officials, heads for Sarajevo April 28. "I'll maintain links with it and, probably take part in its work from time to time" said Mr. Churkin. But he is going to focus his efforts on Russia's possible affiliation to NATO's partnership in the name of peace program. Western diplomats watching developments in former Yugoslavia do not rule out that Mr. Churkin's departure at such a responsible moment may be connected with his recent harsh statements regarding the Bosnian Serbians who angered them very much.
