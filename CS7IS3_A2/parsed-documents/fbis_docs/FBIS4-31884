Goncz received Horn as part of his ongoing meetings with leaders of parties that won seats in the new Hungarian Parliament. Following the meeting, Horn told reporters the president had welcomed the briefing. He said both the MSZP and the SZDSZ have excellent relations with President Goncz, and they have held regular consultations with him in the past. The two politicians agreed to strive for direct, protocol-free contacts in the future as well, with the intention that the new government will continuously inform the president. If the coalition agreement is concluded, the new government can be formed by mid-July, Horn said. Horn also said he is looking forward to receiving the information on the state of the country which Prime Minister Peter Boross is to provide to the six parliamentary parties on Wednesday [15 June]. He said he expects to receive documents regarding the government's international and domestic payments obligations, and ongoing privatization transactions. He also expects to be informed about the country's actual financial situation, particularly, how the ministries managed their finances in the last months.
