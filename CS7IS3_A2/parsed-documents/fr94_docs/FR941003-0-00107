FR941003-0-00107 FR941003-0-00018 ``FIRREA'' (Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act 1989) has been included as definition (d) under §267.2 to aid the reader. A broad description of ``Single family program'' has been included as definition (j) under §267.2. ``USPAP'' has been included as definition (l) under §267.2 and to it has been added the provision of former §267.4(c)(4). That provision states the Department's policy of recognizing any changes or additions to USPAP which the Appraisal Standards Board may from time to time adopt, unless HUD publishes in the Federal Register its decision not to recognize a change or addition. In §267.3, paragraph (b)(1) [formerly §267.6(b)(1)] prohibits certain discriminatory acts. It has been extensively revised in response to numerous comments about the burdensomeness for mortgagees of reporting on the relative frequency with which they use women and minority status appraisers. At the same time, we have been careful to ensure the public availability of the data which would have been provided by those reports and which for single family programs the Department will now obtain elsewhere in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of §267.3. The Department will be scrutinizing that data carefully. We will not countenance discrimination by lenders against female and minority status appraisers. For single family programs, HUD will compile an annual report directly from information which the Department will maintain for each appraiser listed on the Roster. Information with respect to gender and minority status will be furnished by the appraiser at the time he or she applies for listing. This is permitted by the newly-added reference to ``such further information as HUD may require'' in §267.8(d)(2). When the mortgagee accesses the Computerized Homes Underwriting Management System (CHUMS), giving the appraiser's certification or license number, the information on the appraiser will be recorded from the Roster data bank. For fee panel appraisers, HUD will record the information from the Roster data at the time the panelist is assigned. The Department will be able to prepare the annual report directly from this information and will make it available to members of the public upon request. See §267.3(c). With respect to multifamily programs, there do not exist systems analogous to CHUMS and the Roster, and consequently the data must be furnished by Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants, and each housing finance agency (HFA) participating in the Department's HFA Risk-Sharing Program. Since the number of multifamily cases processed is considerably less than single family activity during a given time span, this burden should not be unreasonable. Details of this reporting requirement will be specified in one of the terms of the contract/agreements which HUD executes with its Delegated Processors, contract appraisers and consultants and HFAs. Because reporting under multifamily programs is being implemented by contractural obligation, and because that obligation is not set forth under existing contracts, the data will not become immediately available when this rule takes effect. As of the effective date provided at the beginning of this preamble, however, all new contractural agreements and all renewals or renegotiations of existing agreements will provide for the data to be furnished thereafter. See §267.3(c)(5). Proposed §267.6(c) relating to competency is now paragraph §267.3(d). A new §267.4, entitled `` waiver'', has been added at the end of subpart A. The section authorizes the Assistant Secretary-Commissioner to waive any requirement in part 267 not mandated by statute when enforcement of that requirement would adversely affect the purposes of the NHA. It is unlikely that this waiver authority would be invoked often under part 267. However, HUD has been including a similar waiver provision in many recently adopted rules because it does permit administrative flexibility in unusual circumstances when invariable application of a rule would be unfair or contrary to program objectives. Subpart B_Single Family Programs In §267.5, entitled ``Definitions applicable to single family programs'', paragraph (a), defining ``Appraisal'', no longer includes the phrase ``as estimated by HUD staff or an appraiser under contract with HUD'' which appeared in proposed §267.2(b)(2). The effect of this change is that the DE lender, not HUD, will be responsible for estimating replacement cost under the section 220 single family program. In customary usage, the term ``single family'' is well established. However, there are FHA programs that do not fit the usual concept of one-to-four family dwellings, yet are governed by one-to-four family appraisal standards and procedures, specifically, Title I multifamily and non-residential property improvement loans. The revised definition (c) under §267.5, ``one-to-four family residential property'', covers this anomaly. Note that there is no parallel definition of multifamily programs, which simply include all other FHA mortgage origination transactions. Section 267.6 follows proposed §267.3, but with minor editing to improve readability and clarity.
