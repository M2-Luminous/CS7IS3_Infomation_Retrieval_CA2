The document on the basics of national defence, formulated more than a year ago, is superficial and somewhat naive, Tupp said. He added that the first stage of introducing total defence was completed with the passing of the law on conscription. A draft law on peacetime defence is currently debated by the Riigikogu [parliament] and the draft law on wartime defence is to reach the parliament in a month. Tupp discussed further Estonia's defence capability, stressing that a direct aggression is unlikely in the near future, but that the Defence Forces must be capable of countering any minor conflicts. He stressed the importance of training the reserves and also predicted that Russia will complete the troops withdrawal by August 31, despite the invalidation of the corresponding item in the draft agreement. "The Russian military here are a political plaything, rather like the Skrunda radar station in Latvia," he said. Head of the ministry information section Jyri Kork added that approximately 30-40 Russian military are leaving Estonia every week. Kork also discussed the strength of the Defence Forces, announcing that approximately 450 men out of full complement of 800 are present in each infantry battalion. However, only one third to a half of the officers' posts are currently occupied.
