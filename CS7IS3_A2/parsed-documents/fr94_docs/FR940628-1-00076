FR940628-1-00076 FR940628-1-00014 As discussed previously, NHTSA concluded that both of the vehicle metrics, tilt table angle and critical sliding velocity, were statistically and causally related to the likelihood of rollover in a single vehicle crash. To determine whether to propose a vehicle stability standard, NHTSA next compared the benefits and costs of such a standard. A detailed discussion of the benefits analysis can be found in ``Potential Reductions in Fatalities and Injuries in Single Vehicle Rollover Crashes as a Result of a Minimum Rollover Stability Standard,'' which has been placed in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03. A detailed discussion of the cost estimates can be found in the Preliminary Regulatory Evaluation, which has also been placed in Docket No. 91&hyph;68, Notice 03. A. Estimate of the Benefits of a Standard The agency made two basic estimates of benefits of a minimum standard for rollover stability. One was based on the reductions in RO/SVA predicted by the logistic regression model for increases in critical sliding velocity. The other was based on reductions in RO/SVA predicted for increases in tilt table angle. All other factors being equal, it is reasonable to expect an inverse relationship between rollover risk and either critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle. Thus, the higher the lateral sliding velocity necessary to trip a vehicle, the less likely it is to roll over, and vice versa. Similarly, the greater the angle necessary to tip a vehicle from the tilt table, the less likely it is to roll over, and vice versa. To quantify the benefits of potential minimum standards for rollover stability, NHTSA examined the net prevention of fatalities and serious injuries associated with various minimum levels of critical sliding velocity and tilt table angle. Fatality and injury levels were estimated by using: 1. The reduction of the rollover risk predicted for increases in critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle; 2. The number of single vehicle accidents per registered vehicle expected to occur; and 3. The reduction in fatalities and/or injuries if a single vehicle accident does not result in a rollover. The estimate of the benefits of a minimum stability safety standard incorporated several simplifying assumptions. First, the agency assumed that the severity of the accidents would be reduced but that the accidents would not be prevented. Because single vehicle rollover accidents are more severe than single vehicle non-rollover accidents, prevention of rollover reduces the number of serious injuries and fatalities. However, under this scenario, the total number of single vehicle accidents is assumed to remain constant. This assumption is somewhat pessimistic, because an unknown number of crashes would most likely be avoided. But the remaining assumptions used may tend to overestimate the benefits since NHTSA also assumed: 1. The numbers of rollover injuries and fatalities prevented would be proportional to the number of rollovers prevented, and 2. The fatality and injury rates of the late 1980s for the make/models which would be affected by a minimum standard will remain representative in the future. The second assumption may overstate the benefits if increased safety belt use in the 1990s, as is the goal of NHTSA, reduces the overall harm from rollover accidents. That is, as belt use increases, rollover casualties decrease, even though the number of rollover crashes remains constant. 1. Rollover Risk Reduction To estimate the reduction in the rollover risk that would be obtained by changing a vehicle metric, the agency used logistic regression to determine the sensitivity of rollover risk to changes in critical sliding velocity or tilt table angle. The outcome of each accident of the subject make/model in the data base was re-evaluated individually changing the stability metric but retaining the other vehicle, driver, and road characteristics present in the actual crash. A new RO/SVA ratio was determined on the basis of the predicted outcome of each accident. To examine the sensitivity of the model to a change in critical sliding velocity, the agency divided the range of critical sliding velocities from 14.26 to 16.73 kilometers per hour (kph). The low end of this range is representative of vehicles in NHTSA's database with the lowest critical sliding velocity. The high end of this range is representative of a critical sliding velocity equivalent to the 1.20 value for static stability factor recommended in the Wirth petition (also equivalent to a tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees). (A discussion of the Wirth petition can be found in the ANPRM, 57 FR 242, 244&hyph;45.) The highest value in the range is greater than the proposed European tilt table angle limit of 44.3 degrees, and in the agency's judgement represents the highest practicable standard. A standard at the upper limit of the range would affect 1,648,000 vehicles manufactured in 1991, including 87 percent of compact sport utility vehicles, 100 percent of standard vans, and 31 percent of compact pickups. The agency then divided this range into six even increments and calculated the RO/SVA for each increment for various classes of vehicles. Each successively higher increment represents an increase in critical sliding velocity of 0.41 kph. The agency then predicted the decrease in single vehicle accident rollovers for each incremental increase in critical sliding velocity. (See Table 3.)
