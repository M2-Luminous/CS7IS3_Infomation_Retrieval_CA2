FBIS4-6191 "dreas075_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-075 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK General Interviewed on Site Inspection DPRK General Interviewed on Site Inspection SK1904004094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0016 GMT 19 Apr 94 SK1904004094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Washington, April 18 (YONHAP) -- North Korea reiterated Monday that two alleged nuclear facilities at Yongbyon are military sites and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has no right to inspect them. "About the two military sites, there was no inspection allowed. It's not within the authority of the IAEA to inspect military sites," said Maj. Gen. Kim Yong-chol of the North Korean People's Army in an interview with America's Cable News Network (CNN). In a dispatch from Pyongyang, CNN identified Gen. Kim simply as a senior military official. The taped interview was aired in the United States Monday night. CNN also broadcast an interview with a former Costa Rican president who was visiting Pyongyang, presumably for North Korean President Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday last Friday. Gen. Kim reiterated the North Korean position when CNN's Beijing correspondent, Mike Chinoy, asked why the Stalinist state refuses to let the IAEA inspect its facilities at the Yongbyon nuclear complex if it has no intention, capability or desire to develop nuclear weapons. "Inspecting military sites is an issue that has to be dealt with between North and South Korea in the process of disarmament between the two sides," Kim said. "The authority the IAEA was given is to inspect peaceful nuclear facilities." Asked if North Korea cooperates militarily with countries like Iran, Syria or Libya, Kim said, "that is a question which is directly related to the distortions and the bad rumors about our country which are all fabricated, made up, by the West." North Korea, as an independent state, has a right to maintain multilateral relations including military cooperation with other countries. "There is no limited scope in the cooperation," Kim said. "If it suits our interests, we do it. If it doesn't, we don't do it."
