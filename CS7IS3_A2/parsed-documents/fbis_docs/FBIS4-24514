Taiwan, in a bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is planning to open the car market by lowering tariffs, abolishing local content rate requirements and canceling existing bans on imports from certain countries. But Taiwan will follow the example of the United States and the European Union and seek to reach "tacit agreements" with Japan and South Korea, asking them to voluntarily set quotas on their car exports to the island, The officials explained that to ask a country which enjoys a surplus to sign such a voluntary restraint agreement is not in violation of the spirit of GATT. Japan had a trade surplus of U.S.$15 billion last year, while South Korea's was U.S.$1 billion. The government, in the meantime, will consider allowing foreign carmakers to set up production here in a bid to "force" the 11 local makers to streamline operations. Poorly performing local makers then would be phased out in the face of stronger competition brought in by the newcomers, they said. The officials revealed that three foreign makers have contacted the ministry on the possibility of setting up plants in Taiwan. According to an earlier assessment by the ministry, local makers' market share will fall to 30 percent from the existing 50 percent after Taiwan enters GATT.
