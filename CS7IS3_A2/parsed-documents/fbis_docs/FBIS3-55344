Belarus Has the Ruble Once Again"] [Text] The lengthy hesitation about whether there should be a ruble zone were crowned on Christmas eve by the signing of a treaty merging the monetary systems of Russia and the Belarus Republic. Andrey Illarionov, deputy chief of the Economic Reforms Working Center, thinks that in its content, the agreement brings us back to a situation where the noncash monetary systems of the former Soviet republics were still undivided. But the situation is essentially fundamentally new. Russia has presented Belarus with a really royal Christmas gift. The thing is that the National Bank of Belarus keeps its independence, and two emission centers are being created -- that of the Russian Federation Central Bank and that of the Republic of Belarus National Bank. Curiously, the agreement envisions no effective mechanism to keep tabs on emissions, primarily noncash emissions. One is also amazed, to put it mildly, at Article 6 of the agreement. Under it, the National Bank of Belarus and our Central Bank undertake to create a joint fund of gold [hard] currency, and other highly liquid assets in an agreed amount. Remarkably, the fund is to be formed in proportion to the share of the sides in the aggregate credit emission. Belarus has practically no such assets, with the result that the fund will be set up by Russia, with Russia having to transfer to Belarus part of its gold and hard currency reserves. Being too big does not end there. It is proposed to merge the republics' [as published] on the basis of one "hare" [Belarus ruble has a hare depicted on it] per one ruble. Given the real market rate of 4.5 or 5 "hares" per one Russian ruble, this means that Russia would give Belarus virtually an interest-free loan of approximately 1.6 trillion rubles. According to the most conservative estimate, Russia will simultaneously pay for it with a 10-percent rise in inflation in one fell swoop.
