Committee Chairman B. Mironov told those attending about the results of the work of the two-day central and regional newspaper editors' conference. There was also a kind of committee report on the work it has done in the last four months. As is known, at the end of December and beginning of January the mass media was in a crisis situation -- typographic service prices sharply increased because of an revaluation of polygraphic capacities. This could have led to the closure of many publications. A solution was nevertheless found. "We proposed two options for solving the problem," Mironov said. "The first is to continue subsidizing the press in 1994. This is not a promising route because not everyone can be given help. Over 1 trillion rubles would be needed to do this. Naturally the government does not have that kind of money at the moment. The second is to draft a law on state protectionism for the press. This means preferential taxes, rent, and customs duties. A draft of such a law has been prepared. At a meeting between mass media leaders and V. Chernomyrdin it was decided to consider it at a Government Presidium session and then send it to the State Duma. But for the time being the premier confined himself to a subsidy of R110.4 billion. The committee leadership is concerned by the fact that because of the high cost of polygraphic services many publications are having to be printed abroad, where prices are somewhat lower. We are being enticed by the cheese in the mousetrap. New jobs are being created abroad for Russian money, while our print shops are closing down and high-caliber specialists are leaving. In a year or two foreigners will increase their prices. Russian fugitives will be forced to return home and will be no better off than before, because by that time print shops will have become completely run down.
