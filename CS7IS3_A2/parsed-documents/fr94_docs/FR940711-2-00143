Connecticut Light and Power Company (70&hyph;7320) Connecticut Light and Power Company (``CL&P''), Selden Street, Berlin, Connecticut 06037, an electric public-utility subsidiary company of Northwest Utilities, a registered holding company, has filed a post-effective amendment under Sections 6(a) and 7 of the Act and rule 54 thereunder to its declaration previously filed under Sections 6(a) and 5 of the Act and rule 50(a)(5) thereunder. By order dated December 16, 1986 (HCAR No. 24263), the Commission authorized CL&P, among other things, to issue a promissory note up to an aggregate principal amount of $25 million to the Industrial Development Authority of the State of New Hampshire (``IDA''). The note evidenced IDA's loan to CL&P of the proceeds from pollution control revenue bonds (``Bonds'') issued by IDA to finance the cost of acquiring, constructing and installing certain pollution control facilities and/or sewage or solid waste disposal facilities at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Station, Unit No. 1 in Seabrook, New Hampshire. In an effort to improve the credit ratings of the Bonds, CL&P obtained a letter of credit (``LOC'') from the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Limited (``Credit Bank''). Subsequent to the issuance of the Bonds, Credit Bank's rating in the financial markets deteriorated. CL&P has been informed that many institutional investors that otherwise would be interested in purchasing the bonds will not purchase securities secured by letters of credit issued by the Credit Bank, and investors that are still willing to purchase the Bonds are demanding an interest rate premium that is causing CL&P's effective interest cost to be higher than it would have otherwise been using a bank with a higher rating. CL&P now seeks authority to: (1) replace Credit Bank LOC and the Bank Reimbursement Agreement with a new Letter of Credit and Reimbursement Agreement (``Substitute Agreement''); (2) replace the LOC with a new letter of Credit (``New LOC''); and subsequently thereto (3) extend, modify, or replace the Substitute Agreement and the New LOC from time to time during the term of the bonds supported thereby. The terms of any such extensions, modifications or replacements, including the New LOC and the Substitute Agreement, shall provide that (a) the total amount available to be drawn under any such extended, modified or replacement letter of credit does not exceed $16.2 million, representing principal in the amount of $15.4 million and interest in the amount of $800,000 calculated at the maximum rate of 15% for 123 days, (b) the annual letter of credit costs applicable to any such extension, modification, or replacement do not exceed 1% per annum of the total amount available to be drawn under the extended, modified or replacement letter of credit, and (c) the reimbursement agreement applicable to any such extension, modification or replacement shall provide (or shall afford CL&P the option to elect) that tender advances tear interest until paid at a rate not to exceed the higher of the prime rate plus 2% or the federal funds rate plus 2%, (d) such extension, modification or replacement is otherwise on terms that are substantially similar in all material respects to those applicable to the New LOC and Substitute Agreement (or previous extensions or modifications thereof or replacements therefore proposed to be entered into in connection with the replacement of Credit Bank, and (e) CL&P shall have obtained all necessary State Commission approvals applicable to such extension, modification or replacement.
