FR940913-1-00035 FR940913-1-00013 Additional material would be incorporated by reference and listed in 46 CFR 28.040: National Fire Protection Association (NFPA 70&hyph;1987), sections 310&hyph;13 and 310&hyph;15 would be incorporated in ยง28.865; Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE, section J1475 would be incorporated in ยง28.880; and Underwriters Laboratories, UL, standard 217&hyph;1985, ``Single and Multiple Station Smoke Detectors'' would be incorporated in ยง28.830. Copies of this material will be available for inspection where indicated under ADDRESSES , and from the sources listed in ยง28.040. Before publishing a final rule, the Coast Guard will submit this material to the Director of the Federal Register for approval of the incorporation by reference. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. The Coast Guard estimates that only 20 vessels out of an estimated U.S. commercial fishing fleet in excess of 120,000 vessels would be affected by this rule. This proposed rule includes a number of grandfathered provisions. Therefore, the Coast Guard believes that existing equipment onboard these 20 vessels should be upgraded and replaced only when the existing equipment is no longer serviceable. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include: (1) Small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields; and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. An estimated 20 commercial fishing industry vessels are involved in the Aleutian Trade Act. A number of these vessels are owned or operated by small entities. However, the Coast Guard estimates that the cost of complying with these revised proposed regulations will be minor. Because it expects the impact of this proposal to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment (see ADDRESSES ) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect your business.
