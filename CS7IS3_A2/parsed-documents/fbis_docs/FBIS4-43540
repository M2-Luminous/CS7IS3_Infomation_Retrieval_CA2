A Foreign Office spokesman said the relief workers had been detained at Huambo, in the country's central highlands, since Wednesday [15 June] by UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] rebels. He was unable to say how many British charity workers were being refused permission to leave the UNITA stronghold but said there was no evidence that any had been harmed. "We have registered our strong concern and protest to the UNITA delegation in Lusaka," he added. "We view any restriction on non-governmental organisation's freedom of movement very seriously and would want UNITA's assurance that it would be guaranteed." Angola's state-run daily newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, said UNITA had been holding 56 aid workers but "in unclear circumstances." But UNITA spokesman Jorges Valentim, quoted by Reuter in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, denied any involvement and said continued bombardments in the Huambo area had left people stranded. He said Aranda da Silva, head of the United nations humanitarian unit in Angola, had travelled to Huambo with eight other aid workers on Wednesday without telling UNITA leaders. Valentim said they had run into "complications" which led to the eight aid workers being left behind along with others who had been due to be picked up at Huambo. The Foreign Office said the workers were employed on humanitarian relief missions in the area and the Government was hoping for a swift response from UNITA. Reuter quoted aid director Philippe Borel, in Angola, as saying: "The situation is extremely, extremely tense, confusing and difficult."
