In the two presidents' letter, the following is stated, among other things: The delegations of the Bosniaks and the Croats in Vienna yesterday reached a concrete and detailed agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina's internal setup on the basis of the Washington agreement. This agreement offers a chance for an overall political solution for Bosnia-Herzegovina on a just basis. The Bosniaks and Croats do not harbor any aspirations for foreign property and territories, or the rights of others. We ask your help in the negotiations with the Serbian side. In our opinion, we must make it plain to both the Serbian side and the international public, that you are opposed to: -- aggression and ethnic cleansing being rewarded, -- that the conclusions of the London conference are your conclusions, too, and, -- that you will neutralize the Serbian military machinery in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia by political and other means if the Serbs reject a peaceful and reasonable solution. If we are to accomplish peace we need a firm stance. The decisions that you will make tomorrow are very important and will determine the course of international events, especially in the regions where the Communist regime has collapsed. So reads the identically-worded letters that Presidents Izetbegovic and Tudjman sent to the liaison group ministers.
