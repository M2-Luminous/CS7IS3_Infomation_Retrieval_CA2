Attending the function were Comrade Pham The Duyet, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Hanoi party committee, and representatives of the Ministry of Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare and other concerned sectors. In 1993, the Hanoi Labor, War Invalids, and Social Welfare Agency patterned its action program after the city's political tasks and 10 fundamental orientations. Thanks to well-defined guidelines and positive steps, the agency gave advice to local party committee echelons and administrative organs on ways to ensure the positive implementation of labor, war invalid, and social welfare policies. Satisfactory steps have been taken to generate jobs. More than 20 billion dong has been drawn from different public funds to create jobs for 33,500 unemployed people. A total of 181 households with 345 working people have been sent to various new economic zones. Due effort has been made to look after the well-being of war invalids and survivors of fallen combatants. Altogether, 91 houses have been built and 4,265 savings accounts have been opened for distribution to families that rendered meritorious service to the revolution. Furthermore, 560 seriously ill soldiers and 60 parents with two or more children listed as fallen combatants have undergone treatment or been admitted to nursing homes. The agency has also made extra efforts to educate and provide vocational training to drug addicts and prostitutes. In 1994, the agency will work out a program to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. It is expected that by 1995, no family in the city will be affected by hunger.
