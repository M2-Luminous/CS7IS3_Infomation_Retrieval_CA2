The number and gravity of the election irregularities make it difficult to speak of free and clean elections. The dignity of the Salvadoran people has once again been disregarded by the officials in charge of the process. While the political parties, the magistrates of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, and President Cristiani himself insistently yet pleasantly urged the people to vote in these elections, many citizens lost patience after having to wait for over two hours to enter their polling place. A still unknown number, despite having a voter registration card, were unable to vote either because they were not listed in the registry or because the information on their registration card did not agree with the registry data, or even worse, because someone else had voted in their place earlier. In large cities, where there were few voting centers and they were organized alphabetically, forcing people to travel for considerable distances, the citizens' efforts to vote were impeded by lack of transportation; a similar situation prevailed in rural areas for the same reason. Polling places opened late because of the inefficiency and disorganization of the boards of election officials that were to receive votes; at 1700, people still waiting in line to vote were turned away from some polling places, disregarding the instructions that had been given. Throughout the course of the day, the election boards demonstrated a lack of preparation and experience in controlling voting procedures, and the vote counting and preparation of the official election returns were slow and complicated. After 2200, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, despite having preliminary results from almost the entire country in its possession, began to read these return documents in a very unprofessional manner, amidst accusations from the opposition about impeding the presence of its representatives in the vote computation center. In the end, the blind were able to vote, but it is clear that all this expensive and inefficient election machinery is designed for a citizenry whose literacy level by far outstrips El Salvador's. In fact, with an officially acknowledged illiteracy rate of 45 percent, not including functional illiterates, it is practically impossible for an average Salvadoran to find his name in the registry and identify the right table, or one who can clearly identify the destination of each part of the ballot and his party choice, as well as sign the electoral registry. In a word, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal prevented a good number of citizens from voting. But in the end, it was the political parties themselves that were responsible for this fiasco, as this tribunal is in their hands. So the Supreme Electoral Tribunal demonstrated the inefficiency and lack of responsibility of the political parties. It is a good thing that they conducted voting tests; what might have happened if the system had not been tested! The first results revealed a high rate of abstentions: 47 percent of the citizens did not vote. That was due in part to obstacles the citizens encountered when trying to vote; it was also partly due to the fact that 400,000 citizens were listed in the registry whose names should not have been there, and that 150,000 did not remove their voter identification card, but it was also caused by the citizens' lack of interest, apathy, and lack of confidence in the electoral process. Many did not want to be deceived once again and decided to stay home. In 1989, Cristiani won with an abstention rate of a little over 50 percent. This time the abstention rate might be a little lower, but in any case the massive voter turnout that the politicians had hoped for still did not materialize. It should not be hard to determine how many citizens were not allowed to vote, and how many did not want to vote. So the civic festival the politicians were expecting was tarnished by the low turnout of the invited guests. The fiasco of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] is also evident. It trusted that what were called the rules of the game were going to be respected, without paying proper attention to the context in which the electoral process was taking place. It is interesting to compare its optimistic statements on Sunday morning with its critical attacks issued that night, when it was faced with the harsh reality. In the morning it had allowed itself to be deluded by the number and appearance of the crowds who were going to the polls, disregarding the warnings that we in PROCESO and ECA had been making on the limited historic scope of these elections as well as on their restricted freedom and their dubious transparency. The FMLN had been forewarned, but the illusion of political power counted for more. What appeared impossible actually happened. That is how the hard lessons of history are learned, lessons that are never forgotten. The preliminary election results indicate that the citizens did not give the party now in office the votes it needed to win the presidency in the first round or a comfortable majority in the legislative assembly. So the official party has been dealt an unpleasant surprise; the triumph it had expected slipped out of its hands. Its performance in office does not enjoy absolute support from the citizens, nor are its facile promises extremely credible. Cristiani was also hoping for a massive approval of his record in office, to the point of thinking that even the impunity which human rights violators have enjoyed during his presidency was going to be approved at the ballot boxes. ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] undoubtedly does have considerable support, but this support is not sufficient to win the presidency in the first round and obtain a majority of the deputies. ARENA's dominant position has now been abolished. This is good for EL Salvador since, despite its short time in office, this party's officials and members already consider themselves the lords and masters of the government. The coalition of the left won an honorable second place, but not enough to challenge the ruling party on an equal footing. Of course, it has become the country's second political force, but it still has much to learn and improve if it is to maintain that second place and move toward the presidency. One clear consequence shown by the election results is the need to strengthen the coalition internally. Even as the opposition, it is essential that it be strong and coherent. Christian Democracy continues to lose votes in relation to its performance in past elections, and now occupies a rather uncomfortable third place, as the IUDOP [University Public Opinion Institute of the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University] polls had already predicted. The polarization of the elections and its internal leadership crisis led to Christian Democracy's collapse. If this party wants to remain in the national political scene, it has to renew its leadership, as it is doing very poorly when its candidate for mayor of San Salvador wins a higher proportion of votes than its candidate for the presidency of the entire nation. There seemed to be no surprises in the smaller parties, despite the religious pressures of some ministers who had urged their congregations to vote for one of them. Therefore, the 20 March elections confirmed the objectivity and professionalism of the IUDOP polls. The politicians who so frequently challenged them during the campaign should now, in a spirit of ethics and honesty in relation to reality, publicly admit that these polls were on the right track. The results of the elections should not be allowed to overshadow the existence of grave irregularities, many of them caused by the scandalous shortcomings of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and of the state apparatus as a whole. Independently of whether or not the election results are favorable or unfavorable to a specific party, the electoral system needs to be totally revised and its failings corrected. It does a severe disservice to the democratization of the nation when it is simply said that the elections took place normally and the results are acceptable, for those statements tend to cover up the electoral system's antidemocratic defects. The 20 March elections exposed with crystal clarity, for anyone willing to see the facts, just how far the democratization process in El Salvador is from its goal. What happened should be analyzed in relation to the situation of noncompliance with the peace accords. It is appropriate to demand a cleaner second round, but it is not very realistic to think that in two weeks the political parties are going to correct what they did not do in two years. So it will be hard for the second round to be any different from the first. Still, not everything is negative; at least there is now awareness of the electoral system's structural defects. We sincerely hope that the illusion of power does not again blind the political parties, particularly those who only protest when the results are unfavorable to them. The 1994 elections could become a first step toward strengthening the democratization process if measures needed to begin to reform the electoral system are adopted.
