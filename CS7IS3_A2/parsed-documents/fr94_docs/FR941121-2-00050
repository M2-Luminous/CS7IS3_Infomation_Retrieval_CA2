FR941121-2-00050 FR941121-2-00042 Marketing Issues. Comments on Western's revised proposal were received from six commentors. These included UMPA, ICPA, Colorado River Energy Distributors Association (CREDA), the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), the Water Users, and the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (CUWCD). Commentors were supportive of Western's revised proposal. The following addresses the issues that were identified and explains how they were resolved. I. Issue: Inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects. Discussion: This issue had been included in the original proposal but was objected to by CREDA because the payment of power revenues to assist the Water Users repayment obligation would help repay investment in municipal and industrial water. In response to this objection, Western revised its proposal to market the PRP independently from the Integrated Projects. UMPA, ICPA, and CREDA commented that they support Western marketing the PRP independent from the Integrated Projects. Decision: Western will market the output of the PRP through contractual arrangements separate from the Integrated Projects. II. Issue: Marketing area for the PRP. Discussion: Western proposed to define the marketing area for the PRP as Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah, essentially the drainage of the Provo River. Two entities, Weber Basin Water Conservancy District (Weber Basin) and the city of Bountiful (Bountiful), Utah, claimed that since water was diverted from the Weber River into the Provo River above powerplants that were controlled by them, they were entitled to an allocation of energy from the PRP to compensate them for energy lost because of this diversion. Western, through Reclamation, was able to demonstrate that water rights for the Provo River diversion predated water rights held by Weber Basin and Bountiful for generation. Neither Weber Basin nor Bountiful commented on the revised proposal. In responding to the revised proposal, ICPA was the only entity to comment on this issue. ICPA supported establishing the Provo River Drainage as the marketing area for the PRP. Decision: PRP power will be marketed within Wasatch and Utah Counties, Utah. III. Issue: Marketing the output of the Deer Creek Powerplant to preference entities located in the marketing area. Discussion: Marketing of the PRP production to preference entities in the marketing area was supported by the commentors. All of these entities are members of either ICPA or UMPA, organizations established as purchasing agents for Federal power. Heber City, Lehi, Springville, Strawberry Electric Service District, and Payson are members of ICPA. Provo, Salem, and Spanish Fork are members of UMPA. Decision: Western will offer firm power sales contracts to ICPA and UMPA to purchase PRP power and energy in behalf of their members in the marketing area. IV. Issue: Relationship of ICPA and UMPA to their members concerning the allocation of PRP power. Discussion: In its comments, UMPA requested that language be included in its power sales contract which would clarify the relationship of UMPA and its members concerning the allocation of PRP power. If a member withdraws from either organization, the allocation of Federal power stays with the member, not UMPA or ICPA. Decision: Western will include language in both UMPA and ICPA's contracts to clarify the relationship between the members and the organization. The language will state that if a member withdraws from either organization, the percentage entitlement of PRP power remains with the member and not with UMPA or ICPA. V. Issue: Payment of all of the PRP's annual costs including an amount for the Water Users repayment obligation by the Contractors in return for receiving all of the marketable energy produced by the plant each year. Discussion: Generation from Deer Creek Powerplant has varied considerably from year to year. Without the Integrated Projects to back up Deer Creek, it is very difficult to determine the amounts of firm and nonfirm energy and capacity that should be used as marketable energy in ratesetting. Basing rates on average generation could result in surplus revenues in some years, and deficits in others. The proposal which was supported by UMPA, ICPA, CUWCD, and CREDA would eliminate the need to identify a specific rate for PRP power and would still allow Contractors to take full advantage of PRP generation.
