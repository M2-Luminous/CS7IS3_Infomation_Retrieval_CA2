Ibrahimi arrived from Cairo and was due to hold talks later with northern government officials, before meeting President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on Thursday. "The in-fighting between brothers must stop and must stop now, and give way to resuming negotiations," Ibrahimi, a former Algerian foreign minister, said as he arrived on a fact-finding mission. He has been sent under the terms of a UN Security Council resolution adopted last week calling on Salih's forces and those of his southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid to cease hostilities immediately. A ceasefire announced Monday by northern leaders collapsed within hours, and the UN has reported that up to one million people could be in need of humanitarian aid following the month of fighting. Salih warned Wednesday that the war would last longer because the international community had become involved in the conflict. "Bilateral, direct discussions are the best way. Since it has become an international issue the conflict will take much longer." And he added that international observers in Yemen would be "a flagrant interference in our internal affairs." Meanwhile, 27 civilians, mainly women and children, were killed and 45 wounded in an attack on Dar Sa'd village 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of Aden, officials at the al-Jumhuriyah hospital said. The morgue in the southern city was reported to be overflowing, and head doctor Muhsin 'Awad told AFP "we have 20 bodies outside the morgue." Southern officials accused the north of shelling the village late Tuesday. More shelling could be heard from Aden on Wednesday. Correspondents reported that female militia forces from the south's Yemen Socialist Party were deployed Wednesday at roadblocks on routes leading into Aden to press gang men into fighting. Ibrahimi told reporters on his arrival that he was starting his mission "with an open mind and a very strong desire to help the brothers in Yemen solve their problems."
