The congress consolidated the "blueprint for renewing and opening up the party" championed by Lerma with the inclusion of "new faces and new ideas" in the new Executive Committee. The fact that, contrary to what was expected, over 20 percent of the delegates abstained from voting for this Executive Committee was interpreted by Lerma as an expression of the fact that "in the face of the strong impetus for renewal being effected by the Valencian Socialists, there are people who still have their gaze set on the party, not society, and we will calmly surmount that opposition." In total, out of the 392 possible votes, 311 were in favor, 64 blank, and 17 invalid. Lerma, who also had the support of Economy Minister Pedro Solbes, who took part in the closing session, did not hesitate to describe the new Executive Committee as "an organization for the new times and new needs," and did not avoid references to corruption in his closing speech. In this connection, he stated that "it is the government that must lead the fight against corruption, and the response must be vigorous." Speaking with journalists, Lerma did not hesitate to interpret "the leftward shift" as "a demand that the progressive forces have a place in this party." [passage omitted]
