Mr Phaithun said Israel had also shown an interest in employing 5,000 more Thai workers and South Korea says it wants to hire 20,000-30,000 workers from Thailand. The minister was asked about news reports that Taiwan was considering stopping the recruitment of foreign labor. He said he had heard frequent reports of this kind. Taiwan has approved requests from companies to recruit 117,000 Thai workers, equal to 68 per cent of its total foreign workforce. Mr Phaithun said the Labor and Social Welfare Ministry yesterday issued an announcement fixing the brokerage fees which job placement companies can collect from workers in order to cope with Taiwan's requirements. The announcement stipulates a company sending workers to Taiwan can demand no more than 25,000 baht plus a month's salary from each worker. The company may charge the workers airfares for a single trip unless the airfares are provided by the employers. Workers must pay for other expenses such as medical examinations, skills tests, the translation of documents and passports. Brokerage fees collected from workers destined for other countries will differ, said Mr Phaithun. He said one measure to control the 174 job placement companies supplying workers to Taiwan was a requirement that they set up a central organization to make sure all companies comply strictly with the ministry announcement. He said the ministry had also been contacted by Israeli firms wanting about 5,000 Thai workers. Ministry officials have been instructed to check the work sites to see if they are secure enough. South Korea has also shown an interest in recruiting 20,000- 30,000 Thai workers for factories in the form of job training similar to in Japan. The employment is on the condition that the workers must have worked for South Korean companies in Thailand, said Mr Phaithun.
