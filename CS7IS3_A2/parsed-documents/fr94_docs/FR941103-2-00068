Comment: All years in the (Rio Grande) PRS except 1994 match the values from the 1995 Work Program. In 1994, the difference is $619,806. (The values shown in line 14 of Table 9 should be used in the PRS.) Response: The commentor is correct. An additional $619,806 has been added to the work program amount shown in FY 1994. Not all of the work in the Work Program for FY 1993 was completed or posted in that year. The amounts not completed, including those obligated but not spent in 1993, were carried over into FY 1994. This was the case with the $619,806 noted by the commentor. This is necessitated because of Western and Reclamation's accounting procedures (as explained in the previous section on the Collbran Project), which require the total investment (including IDC) to be moved to the plant-in-service account in the year it becomes operational, rather than recording incremental amounts of annual spending. Western has used the figures recommended by the commentor. The figures are the basis for the projected investment through the cost evaluation period (FY 1994&hyph;98). However, these amounts do not appear in the PRS in those years. As previously explained (see the example of the Collbran Project above), these amounts (plus IDC, where applicable) are shown in the PRS in the year the particular investment is scheduled to go into service. e. Comment: Commentor stated that: The intent of the work program review was to provide a less formal process through which customers could receive information and provide input regarding Western's and Reclamation's programs, allowing for this same information to then be used in determining the adequacy of rates. In departing in the rate process from data developed in the FY 1995 Work Program, the principal benefit of the process is effectively undone. Moreover, the departures were not trivial. For Western's O&M expenses, the 1994 figure used in the Rate Brochure PRS exceeds that contained in the FY 1995 Work Program by almost $4 million, or 20 percent. In new construction projects, the commentor identified over $45 million in additional investment included in the PRS that was not identified or had been excluded in the work program review. Response: Western has given a detailed explanation of the changes in the 1994 O&M figures between the FY 1995 Work Program and the 1993 ratesetting PRS earlier in this Rate Order. Construction cost modifications are also listed in detail. Western disagrees with the thrust of the commentor's statement. As Western follows its policy to develop the lowest rate to consumers consistent with sound business principles, all power customers, including the commentor's members benefit. For example, the FY 1995 Work Program includes over $527 million in construction costs for the SLCAO alone. Deducting what would normally be excluded from the PRS because it is not planned for completion by FY 1998 leaves $284 million. This figure ($284 million) is still more than double what Western finally included in the Rate Brochure PRS as new investment $131 million. The difference between these two figures (the $284 million in the FY 1995 Work Program and the $131 million in the Rate Brochure PRS) equals approximately 0.75 mills/kWh in the composite rate. In other words, following the commentor's instructions would have resulted in a 3/4 mills/kWh higher firm power rate than Western is proposing. Finally, Western will continue to work with its customers to identify and correct problems with the work program review process. 8. Environmentally Related Expenses a. Comment: The sum of environmental costs in the 1994 Rate Brochure is more than $0.5 million greater in 1993 and 1994 than contained in the FY 1995 Work Program. Western's response to CREDA's information request (WAPA/CREDA 67) indicated that the additional costs in 1994 were explained by about $6.0 million in ``unliquidated obligation'' in 1993. While actual costs were indeed lower than planned in 1993, the reduction does not explain the still greater increase indicated in the 1994 rate brochures. Environmental study costs should be limited to the amounts (with some allowance for carryover from prior years) developed in the work program process. Response: To compare environmental costs spent and budgeted for FYs 1993 and 1994 in the 1995 budget and work plan, the unliquidated obligations must be taken into consideration, as shown below: Environmental Expenses ($000) 1‚ê£ 1FY 1993 1FY 1994 1Total 1New Total 1994 Rate Brochure Appendix $11,885 $20,935 $32,820 $32,820 Adjustment 0 490 490 33,310 FY 93 Unliquidated Obligations ^2,391 0 ^2,391 30,919 FY 94 Unliquidated Obligations 6,005 ^6,005 0 30,919 n,s Total Obligations 15,499 15,420 30,919 30,919 FY 1995 Work Program 16,788 15,463 32,251 32,251 FY 93 Unliquidated Obligations ^2,391 0 ^2,391 29,860 n,s Total Obligations 14,397 15,463 29,860 29,860 n,s Difference 1,102 ^43 1,059 1,059 b. Comment: A customer organization says: It is clear that environmental expenses associated with Glen Canyon Dam have gotten out of hand, are not under control, and are not being subjected to any sort of cost-control analysis or audit. They urge Western to do what it can to urge the Bureau of Reclamation to limit environmental study expenditures to those that are calculated to produce necessary, credible information.
