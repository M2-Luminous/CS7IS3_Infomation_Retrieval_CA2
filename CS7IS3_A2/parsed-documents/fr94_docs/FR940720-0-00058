FR940720-0-00058 FR940720-0-00005 j. Section 86.159(j). Pennsylvania's proposed rule at subsection (j) requires that part of all of the self-bond amount be collateralized by the permittee's pledge of security interests in real or personal property. There are no counterpart Federal requirements of this kind in the Federal self-bonding program. These regulations implement Pennsylvania's statute requiring the same. Unlike collateral bonds, these security interests for self-bonds are not always the full amount of the bond. The amount of collateral required by the State's proposed rules is determined on a sliding scale of liability and net worth. This collateral is in addition to all the self-bonding rules. Also, as discussed at the Director's Finding 1.c., the requirement that the applicant submit a security interest to Pennsylvania is an expression of confidence of the company that it expects to be in existence for the term of the permit and to have the security interest which was proffered to the State released. Therefore, the Director finds that the State's proposal to require full or partial collateral is no less effective than the Federal regulations. k. Section 86.159(k) (1), (2) and (3). Proposed subsections (k)(1) through (k)(3) provide the Department with the authority to require appropriate forfeiture terms and conditions within the indemnity agreement that are in addition to the general forfeiture requirements of Pennsylvania's bonding program. Pennsylvania proposes a subsection (k)(1) that the self-bond will be forfeited if 90 days after the Department is informed or determines that the applicant is no longer eligible to self-bond and within the 90-day period the applicant fails to submit to the Department acceptable security as provided for in subchapter F to cover its self-bonded liability. The Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(g) contain a similar requirement with the statement that if the permittee fails to post an adequate substitute bond the provisions of 30 CFR 800.16(e) shall apply. Under 30 CFR 800.16(e) the operator would have to cease coal extraction and immediately begin reclamation operations. At section 86.151(h) one of the requirements is that the applicant complete the reclamation plan. At section 86.159(k)(2) liability under the self-bond is conditioned on the applicant complying with the various environmental statutes and regulations including Pennsylvania's Surface Mining Conservation and Reclamation Act. This obligation also falls upon the parent who under section 86.159(l)(2) is co-indemnitor under the self-bond. This along with the requirement that the self-bond becomes due and payable upon default is consistent with the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(e)(4), which require the applicant, parent or non-parent corporate guarantor to complete reclamation or to pay costs of reclamation. Subsection (k)(2) also requires the applicant or its parent to notify Pennsylvania if there is a material adverse change in its financial condition. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.23(g) also require a similar notification concerning the change in financial condition. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed amendment is no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23 (e)(4) and (g). At subsection (k)(3) Pennsylvania specifies conditions that relate to performance under the mining permit and Pennsylvania mining statutes and regulations and certain commercial lending based criteria relative to the value of the underlying pledged assets. There are no counterpart Federal regulations. However, the Director finds that the proposed rules are not inconsistent with SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations. l. Section 86.159(l). Pennsylvania is proposing that the applicant be a party to the self-bond, which is consistent with the definition of self-bond at 30 CFR 800.5. In addition, at subsection (l)(2) Pennsylvania is requiring that all parent corporations be a party to the self-bond whenever its subsidiary is an applicant for a self-bond. This is different than the Federal rules at 30 CFR 800.23(e) which only require a parent to be a party to the bond when it is a parent corporation guarantor. Nonetheless, the Director finds this requirement will reduce the risk of a bond forfeiture and therefore finds it no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(e)(1).
