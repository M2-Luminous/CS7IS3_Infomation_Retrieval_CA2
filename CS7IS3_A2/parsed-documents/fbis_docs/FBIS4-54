FBIS TRENDS-26APR94-EAST EUROPE East Europe: Russian Posture on NATO Irks Walesa, Havel East Europe: Russian Posture on NATO Irks Walesa, Havel Seemingly anxious that Russia is attempting to increase its influence in the region, Polish and Czech leaders have expressed concern about new Russian terms for participating in NATO's Partnership for Peace. On the eve of a meeting of seven Central European presidents in Litomysl, Czech Republic, Polish President Lech Walesa likened Russian conditions for joining PFP to the 1945 Yalta agreement, warning in an interview that a new NATO with a strong Russian role could "push America out of Europe" and "create the United States of Russia" (Prague radio, 13 April). Repeating his concerns during a debate televised by Prague TV at the conference, Walesa contended that Russia does not want to be a "real partner, the meaning of which they do not understand." Czech President Vaclav Havel echoed this sentiment at the meeting, saying that Russia "ought not claim superpower status on the one hand, while at the same time enjoying the same rights as the small Central European countries." Havel added that "some ideas now emerging in Russian politics should be really sharply criticized and denounced," particularly the view that "just because Russia is such a big state, it kind of owns us and automatically enjoys the right to advise us." During the same discussion, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and Slovak President Michal Kovac did not express similar concerns. Even before Russia suggested that new terms would be required for their participation in NATO, both Walesa and Havel were strongly critical of Russia's position on NATO expansion, particularly since Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed reservations about East Europe's admission in December (Trends of 5 January, pages 1-7). Yeltsin said in a letter to NATO members that he viewed East European efforts to join NATO with "alarm" (Mlada Fronta Dnes, 2 December), while Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev told Czech journalists that NATO expansion without Russia "does not suit us" (Rude Pravo, 29 November). Responding to this position in a 25 February Warsaw radio interview, Walesa said that although East Europe is "now forgiving" Russia for its past domination of the region, Russia "wants us again in its embrace." He warned that "yesterday it was our grandfathers" who suffered under the Russians "and tomorrow it will be you" unless "the whole of Europe says, 'Is Poland free, Mister Kozyrev? Is it entitled to make independent decisions? What business is it of yours?'" Havel also rebuked the Russians, saying on a trip to Rome that "Russia cannot decide on our behalf which international organizations we can or cannot join" (RAI TV, 7 March). In an interview with a French journalist, Havel sought to explain recent shifts in Russian policy by noting that "there is a sort of nostalgia appearing in Russian society for the time when the nation was a great power with a wide scope of influence" (Le Point, 12 March).
