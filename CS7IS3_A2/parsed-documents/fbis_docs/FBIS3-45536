In the first three years of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) the country increased its irrigated area by 1.4 million ha, accounting for 71 percent of the target set for the whole period. For various reasons, the country's irrigated area decreased year by year during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period (1981-1985). But the decrease trend was brought under control during the following five years. Since 1991 the irrigated area has kept increasing. By the end of 1993 the total irrigated area of the country had grown to 49.8 million ha from 16 million ha in the early 1950s, showing an average annual increase rate of 2.6 percent. Experts attributed the increase to the efforts of governments at various levels and the local people to build new and upgrade old water-control projects. So far, one third of the country -- Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Anhui, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi and Qinghai Provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region -- has fulfilled the irrigated area increase targets for the 1991-1995 period.
