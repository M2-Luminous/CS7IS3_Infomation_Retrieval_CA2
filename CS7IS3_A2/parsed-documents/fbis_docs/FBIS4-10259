He fears that the stabilization program, chosen by the PSDB as its main campaign banner, will be rejected in Congress for electoral reasons. His main concern is the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], which believes the PSDB candidate will be the main beneficiary if inflation is curbed. "We need maturity; the stabilization plan is not simply a convenient electoral banner, but a national commitment that must be complied with, even by future governments, for the benefit of the country," Franco said. On 6 April Franco discussed the subject during a meeting with Cardoso, Civilian Household Minister Henrique Hargreaves, and Deputy Luiz Carlos Santos (PMDB-SP) [Sao Paulo], the government leader in the lower house. Franco still intends to talk with the government leader in the Senate, Pedro Simon (PMDB-RS) [Rio Grande do Sul] and with other party leaders. Franco will probably even summon a cabinet meeting to explain that the economic plan must not be confused with the PSDB candidacy. [passage omitted]
