FBIS4-52758 "dreas093_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan `Operation Besiege' Against Hata `Kicked Off' `Operation Besiege' Against Hata `Kicked Off' OW1305093594 Tokyo KYODO in English 0800 GMT 13 May 94 OW1305093594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Excerpt] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Parliamentary forces opposed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata are poised to step up next week their attacks on his minority coalition cabinet, which was inaugurated only in late April. "Operation Besiege" against the Hata Government was kicked off by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday [13 May] when it submitted a resolution demanding the chairman of the House of Representatives Diet Steering Committee be sacked. The resolution against Keiwa Okuda, a member of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] which Hata leads, is virtually certain to be approved at a lower house plenary session Tuesday because the Social Democratic Party (SDP) supports the idea. The LDP demanded Okuda's dismissal because the coalition rejected its call for a change in the chairmanship. The LDP and the SDP -- the biggest and second largest opposition parties, respectively -- have a combined majority in the 511-member lower chamber. The Diet action will be taken at a time when speculation is mounting that hata will be forced to resign with all his cabinet members or dissolve the lower house for a snap general election after the overdue state budget for fiscal 1994 has been cleared through the Diet as early as June. Hata will be given another headache next week as his predecessor in the premiership and major coalition partner Morihiro Hosokawa might be forced to give up the post of head of the Japan New Party (JNP). The JNP is on the verge of another split because more than half its members favor disbanding the 130-member joint parliamentary group Kaishin (Innovation) in the lower house. The setting up of Kaishin triggered the SDP's withdrawal from the coalition. The group was formed mainly by Shinseito, Komeito, the JNP and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), excluding the SDP, after Hata was named new prime minister at the Diet in April. Three legislators have since quit the JNP and joined new party Sakigake [Harbinger] in a unified 18-member lower house group. The JNP is scheduled to call a meeting of its national delegates Saturday next week to discuss Hosokawa's political fate and the party's future political course. Political sources said if Hosokawa leaves the post, the party will withdraw from Kaishin, accelerating further realignment moves in Japan's political community. The LDP and the SDP this week agreed to cooperate with each other against what they termed as the coalition's high-handed management of state affairs -- a reference to the way coalition main strategist Ichiro Ozawa is running the show behind the scenes. Their alliance could drive the Hata administration into a tight political corner with a no-confidence motion against it, for instance. The SDP and Sakigake, an LDP splinter group, this week also agreed to bolster their parliamentary cooperation by exploring prospects for a future coalition. In an attempt to get out of the corner, Hata will meet separately with Yohei Kono, the LDP president, and Tomiichi Murayama, SDP chairman -- probably Tuesday. The LDP was in uninterrupted power for 38 years until last August when it was toppled by the coalition of Hosokawa. The SDP was the coalition's biggest party before its withdrawal. In a parliamentary interpellation this week, Kono questioned the authority of Hata's minority government and expressed his party's readiness to take over power from it. Kono made the statement in reaction to Hata's appeal to opposition parties in his first policy speech to cooperate to help his fragile government steer Japan through difficult times on the domestic and international fronts. Hata is also likely to meet Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake, a small grouping which was also a Hosokawa coalition member but which stayed out of the Hata administration. Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the Hosokawa government, said this week there will be a change of power after enactment of the fiscal 1994 budget, indicating the Hata administration will be short-lived. The Hata government is not in good shape and is merely an administration to take charge of "certain things" for a "certain period," Takemura told a public meeting in front of Tokyo's Shimbashi Station on Thursday. "A fire before the wind" is how one political commentator described the fate of the Hata government in the weeks to come. [passage omitted]
