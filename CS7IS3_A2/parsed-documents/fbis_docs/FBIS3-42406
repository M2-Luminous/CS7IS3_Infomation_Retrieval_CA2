Shirokorad: "`Grad' and `Uragan' -- These Are Not Bad Weather Phenomena"] [Text] The "Grad" 122 mm and "Uragan" 220 mm multiple rocket launcher systems are the most widely used modern domestically-produced systems. The "Grad" system on a BM-21 mount was accepted into the Soviet Army inventory in 1963 and recommended itself well in combat operations on Damanskiy Island, in the Middle East and in Afghanistan. The "Uragan" Multiple Rocket Launcher System (9K57) was accepted into the inventory in 1976 and also had combat employment in Afghanistan. Unfortunately, right now these systems are being widely utilized in interethnic conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. Because the dimensions and weight of the BM-21 mount were comparatively large, the light BM-21V mount, in which the number of 122 mm tubes was reduced from 40 to 12, was developed for the VDV [Airborne Troops]. The basic device of both systems is nearly identical. The combat vehicle consists of an artillery section and a chassis of a specially equipped motor vehicle. The artillery section consists of tube launchers, a cradle, a base, elevating, traversing and leveling mechanisms, a launcher frame, aiming devices, an electric drive and auxiliary equipment. The rocket projectiles of both multiple rocket launcher systems are also identically constructed. They have tail assemblies, the fins of which are secured by a ring in the closed position. When the contacts of the current distributor close, pulses of current flow to the contact sector of the projectile which results in the actuation of the squibs and the ignition of the powder charge. The gases that are formed tear away the contact lid and powder gases begin to escape through the nozzle opening. When the engine increases thrust, the projectile's lead pin comes out of the launcher's stopper-rod device and slips along its groove, forcing the rocket projectile to rotate with regard to the longitudinal axis. The tail assembly's fins unfold when it flies out of the tube and the MRV or MRV-U fuze is armed at a distance of 150-450 meters from the combat vehicle. The M-21-OF 122 mm high-explosive-fragmentation projectile and the 9M27F 220 mm high-explosive projectile are constructed in the same way. 9M27K 220 mm projectiles are differentiated from high-explosive projectiles by a cluster portion that consists of 30 1.85 kg fragmentation cluster submunitions. These rocket projectiles are equipped with a mechanical time fuze (120 second maximum time of operation). The fuze is set manually by the crew (using a key). After the projectile leaves the launcher, the fuze activates after the assigned time. The fuze's fors of fire ignites the warhead's burster. The fuzes of the cluster submunitions are armed from the pressure and temperature of the gases formed, the warhead breaks up, and they are dispersed in the direction of the projectile's movement. When a submunition encounters an obstacle, its fuze activates and an explosion occurs. During firings at short distances (1.5-5 km), all rocket projectiles provide a probable error range of 100 meters and the Firing Table states: "Conduct firing at ranges of less than 5 km in exceptional situations and only when friendly troops are not in the line of fire". Therefore, you need to be very careful when you read about cases of direct laying by rocket projectiles against tanks with massive destruction of the latter that are often described in the literature. But 122 mm and 220 mm rocket projectiles are an adequately modern and effective weapon to carry out organic missions, all the more so that far from all of the "Grad" and "Uragan" systems' munitions were cited in the article and some quite "exotic" projectiles are among those that were not named. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tactical-Technical Specifications of Multiple Rocket Launcher System Comba-| |t Vehicles | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Designation |BM-21 |BM-21V |BM-22 (9K57) | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chassis |Ural-375D |GAZ-66B |BAZ-135LM | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projectile calibe-|122 |122 |122 | |r, mm | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Number of tubes (-|40 |12 |16 | |launchers) | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Weight of the com-|13,700 |approximately 6,00|approximately 20,2| |bat vehicle in th-| |0 |00 | |e combat configur-| | | | |ation, kg | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Time of complete |20 |6 | | |salvo, seconds | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum speed alo-|75 |85 |69 | |ng paved roads, k-| | | | |ph | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tactical-Technical Specifications of Rocket Projectiles | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Model |M-21-OF |9M27F |9M27K | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Caliber, mm |122 |220 |220 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projectile length,|2,870/23.5 |4,832/22.0 |5,178/23.5 | | mm/calibers | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Projectile weight,|66 |280.4 |271.1 | | kg | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Warhead weight, kg|18.4 |99.05 |89.5 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Maximum firing ra-|20.1 |35.8 |35.0 | |nge, km | | | | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- COPYRIGHT: Izdatelstvo TsS SOSTO SNG "Patriot", "Voyennyye znaniya", 1993
