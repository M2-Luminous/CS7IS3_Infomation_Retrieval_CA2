According to the figures provided by relevant state departments, the urban and rural labor supply-demand contradiction was alleviated, the labor structure saw change, the speed of labor flow accelerated, and the labor market achieved an initial scale. The Urban and Rural Labor Supply-Demand Contradiction Was Alleviated In 1993, the number of persons who newly entered the labor force throughout the country (that is, the population reaching 16 years of age) fell by 1 million as compared with the previous year, while the population reaching the retirement age (55 years for women and 60 years for men) saw a slight increase over the previous year. Thus, seen from the labor supply situation, there was a slight reduction in the growth of labor resources. In 1993, the national labor resources totaled 731.78 million people. Seen from the labor demand situation, the number of people who were placed in employment was still quite large. According to estimates, in 1993, throughout the country 605.9 million were employed, an increase of 11.58 million as compared to the previous year. Of these, the number of staff and workers in urban areas was 150.4 million, an increase of 2.48 million. The number of people engaged in private and individual operations was 9.5 million, an increase of 1.12 million. In the rural areas, the laborers in the small towns and villages totaled 446 million, an increase of 7.98 million. At the same time, there was a slight increase in the urban unemployment rate. In 1993, about 4 million people in urban areas were unemployed, an increase of close to 400,000. The unemployment rate was 2.6 percent, a growth of 0.3 percentage points. According to some local surveys, of those currently unemployed in the urban areas, about 50 percent are not anxious to be allocated work posts. They wish to seek their own work and, in this way, they will likely achieve incomes which are no lower than those of the general urban staff and workers. There Were Changes in the Employment Structure Analyzing things in terms of the industrial structure, the proportion of primary industry employment has declined and the proportions of secondary and tertiary industry employment have increased. At the end of 1993, the number of people employed in primary industry was 348.39 million, an increase of 700,000 over the previous year. This was 57.5 percent of the total, a decline of 1 percent as compared with the same period in the previous year. The number of people employed in secondary industry was 132.69 million, an increase of 3.48 million over the previous year. They constituted 21.9 percent of the total, a growth of 0.2 percent. People employed in tertiary industry totaled 124.82 million, an increase of 7.4 million as compared to the end of the previous year. The proportion they constituted was 20.6 percent, a growth of 0.8 percent. In respect of the people employed in urban areas, the speed of growth of those employed in the nonstate-owned economy was faster than the speed of growth of those employed in the state-owned economy. The people employed in state-owned units totaled 110.94 million, an increase of 2.05 million people or 1.88 percent. The number of people employed in nonstate-owned units (including those employed in urban collective operations, urban private operations, and individual operations) was 48.96 million, a growth of 3.27 percent, 1.39 percentage points higher than the figure for state-owned units. Of these, the people employed in joint operations and foreign-funded operation units totaled 3.43 million, a growth of 21.63 percent, 19.75 percentage points faster than the growth of employment in state-owned units. The number of people employed in urban private operations and individual operations was 9.5 million, a growth of 13.37 percent, 11.49 percentage points faster than the growth of those employed in state-owned units. Within state-owned units, the proportion of permanent staff and workers declined, while the proportion of contract staff and workers increased. At the end of 1993, the permanent staff and workers in state-owned units numbered 74.33 million, a reduction of 1.28 million people. They comprised 67 percent of the total, a decrease of 2 percent. The contract staff and workers numbered 23.3 million people, an increase of 2.71 million. This constituted a proportion of 21 percent, up 2 percent. According to Ministry of Labor reports, the reform whereby within the labor system, the labor contract system for employees constitutes the main part, has now developed from the partial experimental stage to a stage where this is being implemented on a regional basis in over 70 cities throughout the country. This year, this reform will be implemented in an overall way throughout the country. The Renewed Increase in the Number of Staff and Workers Has Slowed Since the beginning of 1993, a prominent characteristic of the changes in the number of staff and workers is that the renewed increase in the number of staff and workers has slowed. In July and August last year, the number of workers had again reached the figure at the end of the previous year. However, by September 1993, the figure had dropped back to below the figure at the end of the previous year, a phenomenon which had not been seen for many years. According to an analysis, there are two main reasons for the slowing of the increase: The first is that there has been a strengthening of the labor-use restraint mechanism and, as a result, there has been a reduction in the use of labor. In 1993, all regions actively implemented reform of the employment and the labor assignment systems and, as a result, there has been a continued strengthening of the labor-use restraint mechanism in enterprises. Many enterprises, taking consideration of labor cost benefits, have done everything they can not to increase, or only slightly increase, their workforce, made efforts to tap latent potential within the enterprise, and dismissed a large number of temporary workers and workers outside the plan. Second there has been a change in employment concepts and the consciousness of the market has strengthened. In 1993, close to 1.5 million staff members and workers voluntarily left their jobs, retired, or terminated or abrogated their employment contracts. This was an increase of about 50 percent compared with the previous year. The Rate of Labor Flow Has Increased In 1993, the number of rural laborers who went to other regions to seek employment increased, with about 50 million people seeking work in other areas. Of these, about 13 million people entered various types of units or individual trades in urban areas. This large-scale flow of labor has also begun to move from a disordered to an ordered flow. For example, in 1993, Guangdong Province established labor cooperative links with eight provinces including Sichuan, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Those rural laborers who intend going to work in Guangdong need to consult their local labor department first before proceeding to Guangdong. To a certain degree, this prevents the blind flow of rural labor. Because of the change in employment concepts and an increase in market consciousness, some staff members and workers are no longer satisfied spending all their life in the work post to which they were originally assigned. Instead, they are seeking posts in which the income is higher or in which they can better use their special skills. A sample survey has shown that about 30 percent of staff and workers are unsatisfied in their present work and hope to shift jobs. According to estimates, in 1993, about 4.5 million people were transferred between units, an increase of close to 500,000 compared with the previous year. This figure represented about 3 percent of the total number of staff and workers. Of these, close to 400,000 transferred to other provinces. An Initial Scale Has Been Achieved in the Labor Market In 1993, all areas further strengthened the building of labor markets at various levels and all sorts of labor agents and human resources interflow meetings emerged to meet the needs. Now, 30 provinces, cities, and regions, as well as 15 ministries and commissions under the State Council, have already established human resources interflow organs, while the prefectural and county interflow organs number over 2,000 and nongovernment employment agencies number close to 200. They have thus formed a basic national human resources interflow network. In addition, throughout the country, 500 fixed human resources markets have been established and 10,000 human resources interflow meetings have been organized. The initial establishment of the various levels of labor market has promoted the rational flow of human resources. This has allowed our country's human resources interflow work to shift from the traditional system of unified arrangements and unified allocation to a new system where personnel choose their own employment and units choose their own employees.
