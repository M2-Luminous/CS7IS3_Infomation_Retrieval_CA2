Talks aimed at reaching peace and finding a negotiated solution to the crisis still remain the best option, which Croatia resolutely supports. But the way in which the Serb side is abusing the peace process shows that diplomatic efforts must be backed in the future by a credible threat of force. This is why Croatia supports the UN secretary general's initiative that the response to the militant Serb policy should, as the last resort, be NATO air strikes, the statement says.
