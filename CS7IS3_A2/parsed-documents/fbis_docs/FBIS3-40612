Under it he made plans to have the 8th Amendment approved by the newly elected assembly members, who were actually the political version of the counselors. When the amendment reached the House, there was a check for 500,000 rupees in the files given to the members for developmental plans. In other words, the martial law regime had used national resources mercilessly just to get some political support. This practice did not stop here. It spread to allotment of land plots, the issuing of loans and then writing them off, and the distribution of land for the armed forces personnel. This way the bureaucracy becomes more powerful in nondemocratic governments and such governments depend on it. Their expenses include unnecessary luxuries. Now the situation is so bad that 13 percent of the total budget is spent on administrative expenses while less than 2.5 percent of the budget is allocated for health and education. After General Zia's death, his followers followed the same method to strengthen their nondemocratic governments. The fact that they could not save their governments and that our country could not escape from their abuses is a separate issue. Now the situation is that investors have 60 billion rupees in loans from the banks and it will require a major operation to make them pay those loans back. Anyhow, this system which the martial law regime had started was strengthened by the governments that followed it. The control of bureaucracy over the government continued to increase in a royal manner and the assembly members continued to receive funds for developmental plans in addition to loans and land plots. Government's unproductive expenses also continued to increase, inflation spiraled, currency notes were printed, the people sank deeper in the quicksand of rising prices, rulers become rich overnight, and the budget deficit went up to 120 billion rupees. The country, thus, is facing a serious crisis. Keeping this situation in mind, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's government has issued instructions to reduce the budget deficit and has made plans to reduce unnecessary expenses to bring down the deficit of 120 billion rupees to 42 billion rupees during the next two years. The prime minister has ordered V.A. Jaffery, minister for finance and trade affairs, to issue a report soon. According to the finance minister and the Planning Commission, a huge amount was taken from the State Bank, and unproductive expenses were increased during Nawaz Sharif's government. This has increased the budget deficit. Many agencies were given additional assistance which emptied the treasury. The government has instructed all ministries and departments to live within their budgets and not to request additional funds. At the same time, plans are made to make tax administration more effective and to get the loans back. During the former administration, businessmen were given various forms of support to get help from them. Finance Minister Jaffery will meet with the business community to inform them of government's problems and request their cooperation. The PPP [Pakistan People's Party] government has always made progress in starting developmental projects for the people and providing stability to nation's economy. That is why whenever the government was under the PPP, not only did the standard of life improve, but the country's economy was also put on firm ground, and inflation and the budget deficit were reduced. Madam Bhutto's present steps are part of these efforts. However, the recovery will not be easy in the present situation, especially because of the innumerable problems in getting international assistance, and the actions of the previous administration which resulted in unproductive activities. The money received in aid was left with some favorite people to spend at their discretion instead of using it for the purpose it was given to us. This led to looting of these funds, affecting Pakistan's prestige at the international level, and the aid was stopped. The political changes also changed preference for livelihood. Pakistan was effected just like other countries. In this situation, the prime minister's decision can definitely be called a significant step in establishing economic stability. However, it is important that we make sure that these plans are implemented. It should have a "check" system to rectify problems and pave the way for achieving this goal.
