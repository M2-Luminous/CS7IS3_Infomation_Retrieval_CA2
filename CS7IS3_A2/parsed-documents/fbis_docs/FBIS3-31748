[passage omitted] President Michal Kovac received Yevgeniy Primakov in the afternoon. He briefed the Russian guest about the fact that the Slovak intelligence service has concluded an agreement with the counterintelligence service of the Russian Federation. The agreement concerns above all the exchange of employees in charge of contacts between the two services. The Slovak intelligence service keeps similar contacts with other intelligence services. Presidential spokesman Anton Bodis told us that during talks the view was voiced that our cooperation will not be used against third countries. After the talks we asked Yevgeniy Primakov to comment on the latest information concerning the fact that Russian spying activities had been uncovered in the United States. [Begin Primakov recording in Russian, fading to Slovak translation] On this subject I can only say that I heard this information only after my arrival here. I have no knowledge of those names, I have never heard them, so it is obvious that I cannot tell you anything before my return to Moscow. [end recording]
