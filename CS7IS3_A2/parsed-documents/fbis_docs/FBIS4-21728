Attorney General Diego Valadez Rios said in a news release that the person being held, Mario Aburto Martinez, 23, ``authorized'' prison officials to shave off his moustache, which he was wearing in the first photographs that were released. The attorney general, who is in charge of prosecuting federal offenses, stressed: ``Let there be no impression that there has been any kind of switch or some sort of cover up.'' Privately owned television stations have broadcast footage of Aburto's arrest. At that time of his arrest, just after he had shot Colosio, presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), he was wearing a moustache. On Friday, authorities presented an individual to the media they identified as Aburto. The man was behind bullet-proof glass at the Almoloya High Security Prison in Juarez, Mexico State, close to the Mexican capital. [passage omitted]
