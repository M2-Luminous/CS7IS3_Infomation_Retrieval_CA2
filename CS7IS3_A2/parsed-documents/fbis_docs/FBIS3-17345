This report caused serious concern in Azerbaijan and in all the neighboring countries located in an unstable seismic zone. The Azerbaijani Academy of Sciences and the Ecology and Environmental Protection Committee held a joint meeting today to discuss this issue in depth. It was announced that such nuclear stations, which are not up to international radiation safety standards and pose a serious threat to the surrounding region, cannot reoperate. In view of this and to draw the international community's attention to the problem, the Azerbaijani scientists and specialists have appealed to the United Nations, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the Ministries of Ecology in Russia, Turkey, Iran, and Georgia to seek their help in ensuring radiation safety for the region.
