The flying corps will have to stand the test in this respect in the future. The red pencil is still its main opponent following the end of the East-West conflict. The "historic low" of the defense budget (Kuebart) of just under 48 billion German marks affects the 83,400 soldiers of the Luftwaffe most. Although, according to an internal paper of the Luftwaffe leadership, its "weight and importance are continuously increasing, in view of future national and international tasks," an austerity course is announced on all fronts: By the end of the year, almost 300 aircraft -- about two-thirds of the total stock -- will be mothballed or scrapped, more than 30,000 military and 5,900 civilian permanent posts will be cut, and 71 bases will be closed. As Kuebart suggested menacingly, in the long run this cannot "be without consequences for the morale of the corps, the operation of the armed forces, and their operational capability." The savings are already a real drain on the resources, Luftwaffe generals complain. Because of Waigel's savings plan, Ruehe's fighter pilots operate the control stick for barely 180 hours per year -- this is NATO standard. A spokesman of the crews said: "The situation is becoming awful." In the opinion of the German Bundeswehr Association, the flying units have arrived at a critical stage because of the drastic cuts. "If further austerity measures in the field of training and exercises of jet crews are invoked, crashes are to be feared." The Luftwaffe inspector, who at least demands safe planning from the politicians -- "going beyond one day" -- sounds the alarm increasingly often. Kuebart, who will retire from his office in the autumn, leaves a flying corps that is shaken by violent turbulence behind. However, without it, nothing works in the Bundeswehr. As a matter of course, the blue-uniformed soldiers do their duty in Falconara, Djibouti, Phnom Penh, Bahrain, or Belet Huen. For decades, Bundeswehr pilots have jetted around the world to help people. In the opinion of some NATO alliance partners who are calling for a greater commitment, including combat missions, this is not nearly enough. For example, the Luftwaffe is to contribute at least a dozen combat aircraft squadrons to the international crisis-reaction forces who help allies in trouble. This is a major cost factor, particularly since their soldiers and equipment always have to be combat-ready, speedily transferable, and highly professional. Moreover, the modification of the Patriot antiaircraft missiles to combat ballistic missiles -- currently the only realistic threat -- is on the Luftwaffe's list of wishes. The decades-old Hawk antiaircraft missiles have to be replaced by a new tactical air defense system -- which costs billions.
