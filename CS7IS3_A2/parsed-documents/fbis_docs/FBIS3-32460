The situation is so worrisome, judging from what other politicians have said, that some of them have decided to unite in a common front to defend their political territory because the money is coming from persons in other departments or outside the country. He also asked Treasury Inspector Jorge Garcia and Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to investigate the source of financing of the different candidates for Congress since "the fortunes spent in this department in the months of November and December are not in conformity with the stipulated legal standards for investing in campaigns."
