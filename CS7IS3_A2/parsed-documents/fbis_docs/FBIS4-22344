Citizens of Russia Will Begin To Be Checked for Honesty"] [Text] Another item has been added to the spring concerns of our compatriots--by 1 April 1994, according to the law, it is necessary to submit a declaration of income to the local tax inspectorate. Many people are still regarding this measure as extraordinary. Therefore, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA asked Tax Police Colonel Vladimir Avdiyskiy, chief of the Control-Audit Administration of the Department of the Tax Police of the Russian Federation, to provide several clarifications. [Avdiyskiy] There is nothing extraordinary here. Moreover, declaring income began back in 1993. New mechanisms for implementing Russian tax legislation are being put to work in a planned way. What is now new to Russians has long been commonplace in countries with a developed market economy. For instance, for citizens of the United States, declaring incomes is nothing more than an episode in their intense, event-filled life. [Ivanov] But Russia is not America. We have many people who consider it their duty to evade the law, to find loopholes in it. [Avdiyskiy] So making citizens of Russia declare their incomes will contribute to closing up these loopholes. This is being done in keeping with the law of the Russian Federation "On Individual Income Tax" of 7 December 1991. The essence of the problem is this. In the system of market relations the possibilities for Russian citizens to acquire income have increased sharply. Today it is not prohibited to combine jobs, engage in free entrepreneurship, or obtain dividends by investing money in one enterprise or another. Therefore, it was decided to switch to a practice of taxing the aggregate annual income. The point of the declaration is extremely simple: each year the taxpayer must report his income to the state and, taking the amount into account, make the corresponding payments into the budget. [Ivanov] Does this pertain to all or only to certain categories of citizens? [Avdiyskiy] The declaration is mandatory for those whose aggregate taxable income during 1993 exceeded 3 million rubles [R]. True, there are exceptions here. For example, citizens whose incomes involve only their main job are released from filing tax declarations even if their aggregate annual income has exceeded R3 million. But citizens registered as entrepreneurs must submit a declaration regardless of the amount of income they received. All the fine points and details that interest the taxpayers can be explained at the local state tax inspectorates. As for the tax police, as a law enforcement organ, it mainly works with those who conceal from taxation incomes in large and especially large amounts. [Ivanov] Incidentally, what is the difference between "large" and "especially large"? [Avdiyskiy] According to criminal legislation in effect (Article 162-2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), concealing especially large amounts is when there is concealment of income or other objects of taxation on which the tax exceeds 1,000 (one thousand) times the minimum wage. And large amounts of concealment are when this indicator exceeds 50 (fifty) times the minimum wage. It is no longer billions but even trillions of rubles that bypass the state treasury. In 1993, for example, according to the budget, the income should have been R23 trillion-R25 trillion, but it actually amounted to R17 trillion. You can consider that whatever was due to the state settled out into private pockets. And a very great deal depends on this--whether or not wages will be paid promptly to workers of the state budget-financed sphere, stipends to disabled persons, pensions for elderly people, stipends for students, whether or not the government will be able to mobilize financial resources for fighting inflation, crisis phenomena in the economy, and so forth. Looking at the large picture, we are speaking about the very fate of the reforms that have been started and economic and social stability in society. And therefore, ensuring unwavering observance of tax legislation is among the priority tasks. Declaring income will be, if you will, a kind of test of honesty of many thousands of Russians and will give tax organs additional opportunities to figure out who is who. For today, in addition to honest entrepreneurs, there are many who steal billions, build villas or even entire palaces for themselves, buy up real estate, and submit to the tax inspector an official notice that they received wages corresponding to the wages of a teacher or a nurse. Such individuals will undoubtedly have to deal with the tax police, and they will have to give explanations of the origin of their income and make reimbursement to the state for damages caused, counting fines, and possibly they will also be held responsible in keeping with Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. [Ivanov] And how much can they be fined for such machinations? [Avdiyskiy] Concealment of large amounts is punishable by a fine in an amount of up to 350 times the minimum wage. And concealment of especially large amounts is punishable by incarceration for a period of up to five years with or without confiscation of property or a fine in the amount of from 300 to 500 times the minimum wage. [Ivanov] Harsh. But what if, say, I have not filled out the tax declaration by 1 April? [Avdiyskiy] That option, as they say, will cost more. If you fail to submit a declaration or submit it late, you can be fined 10 percent of the amount due for payment. Moreover, for each day of delay in paying the income tax there was a penalty of 0.3 percent last year, and this year it will be 0.7 percent. Plus there is the administrative fine. In general here one should mention Article 163 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. It says: "Failure to appear at the organs of the State Tax Service to submit explanations or refusal to submit explanations concerning sources of income (profit) and their actual amount, and also failure to submit documents and other information concerning the activity of the economic entity at the request of the State Tax Service shall be punished by a fine in an amount of from 100 to 150 times the minimum wage, set by legislation." [Ivanov] Declaration of income, like any report, presupposes documentary confirmation of expenditures and incomes. What does the taxpayer need for this? [Avdiyskiy] This is an extremely significant point. A waiter in the United States, for example, must even indicate the total tips he has received. Receipts, credit slips that have gone through the bank, personal checks, and other documents are saved like treasures there. An American will never throw away a check on which the amount paid for an apartment, summer house, or motor vehicle is registered, documents confirming the right to inherit property, the receipt of credit, etc. The Russian taxpayer has to get used to this too. It is necessary not only to document your income but also the sums of taxes paid throughout the year. For this, whether you like it or not, you have to be your own bookkeeper--keep track of your receipts and large expenditures, since "forgetfulness" is no excuse when determining liability for concealing income. [Ivanov] Why is the deadline set at 1 April and not, say, 1 March? [Avdiyskiy] The law gives the taxpayer three months to gather the necessary documents and determine how much income has been received during the year. Although there is no single criterion here. Different deadlines have been set in other countries. The American taxpayer, for example, must submit a tax declaration by 15 April of the following year. In Sweden the deadline for submitting it is 15 February. [Ivanov] And will the tax organs be able to handle the avalanche of declarations? Even without this, one has to stand in line for hours waiting for a tax inspector. [Avdiyskiy] There is a problem here, and an extremely serious one. The State Tax Service and we, the Tax Police, are experiencing a critical need for a modern computer base, a unified information system that will encompass the whole country. [Ivanov] Do you not see a danger that a good cause could be discredited by the willfulness of unscrupulous tax bureaucrats? [Avdiyskiy] If such cases occur, the taxpayer will always have the right to appeal incorrect actions on the part of the tax organ worker.
