Summary and Conclusions Based on the foregoing analyses, EPA believes that given the compliance flexibilities built into the program it is feasible for sufficient feedstocks, production capacity, transportation capacity, and blending capacity to be available to meet the full 30 percent renewables requirement by 1996. However, EPA is concerned that neither supply nor blending capacity will be adequate in 1995 to satisfy the full 30 percent requirement. While a supply shortfall could be filled by diverting ethanol from its current markets to RFG markets, such diversions would be costly and would not meet any of the objectives of today's rule, as has been discussed earlier in this notice. Furthermore, even if such diversions were to occur, EPA is concerned that insufficient blending capacity would be in place in 1995 to blend the requisite volumes of ethanol into non-VOC-controlled RFG. The risks of this are significant and the consequences could be dramatic with shortages, price spikes, and other market disruptions. For these reasons, EPA has decided that a phase-in of the 30 percent renewables requirement is both necessary and prudent. During the first year of the program (December 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995), 15 percent of the RFG program's minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement must be met by renewable oxygenates. In 1996 and subsequent years, the minimum renewables content will increase to 30 percent of the RFG program's minimum oxygen content. Even with such a phase-in, it is still likely that some shifting will occur from current markets into the markets created by today's program as a result of local economic conditions and logistical considerations. However, these shifts are likely to be small relative to the overall size of the renewable oxygenate program and would not materially alter the benefits of today's rule. G. Shoulder Season/Non-commingling Season 1. Summary of the Issue and Comments EPA received comment on the ozone impacts of the renewable oxygenate proposal, particularly during the ``shoulder season'' periods of April 1 through May 31 and September 16 through October 31 when the reformulated gasoline high ozone period is not in effect. During these periods, VOC-controlled RFG is not required at the retail level. Commenters expressed concern that the likely increase in ethanol market share in non-VOC-controlled RFG would increase VOC emissions both directly (since the RVP increase from splash-blended ethanol would not be constrained by vapor pressure limits in non-VOC-controlled RFG) and indirectly (since greater commingling effects would occur as the market share for ethanol-blended RFG increases). Commenters representing state air quality regulators (NESCAUM, STAPPA/ALAPCO, and CARB), argued that the net result of such increases in average RVP levels during the shoulder season would be increased VOC emissions and higher ozone levels, especially in the Northeast and California. NESCAUM suggested that EPA extend the season in which volatility-increasing alcohols would not receive renewable credit to April 1st through October 31st in order to eliminate the risk of any potential ozone increases. Other commenters such as the Clean Fuels Development Coalition and the Ethanol Ad-Hoc Committee argued that the use of ethanol-blended RFGs during the shoulder season would not cause additional ozone exceedances for two reasons. First, the spillover of VOC-controlled RFG, primarily ether-containing RFG, would reduce shoulder season RVP levels below current levels. Second, they believed other pollution reduction programs being implemented over the next several years would reduce ozone precursor emissions during the shoulder season. The combined effect would reduce such precursors by more than any increases due to increased ethanol use, thereby negating any detrimental environmental effects. 2. EPA Analysis of the Renewable Program's Shoulder Season Emission Impact Although EPA agrees that increased ethanol use in non-VOC-controlled gasoline is likely, the Agency's analysis indicates that any detrimental environmental effects should be negligible. The reformulated gasoline program requires VOC-controlled fuel at the terminal from May 1&hyph;September 15. Refiners have indicated that they would begin shipping such fuel as early as March 1 in order to assure that low-volume terminals and retail stations have fully converted to VOC-controlled RFG by May 1 and June 1, respectively, as required by the RFG program. Since most fuel is sold at high-turnover retail outlets, EPA's analysis shows that many vehicles will begin operating on VOC-controlled RFG during April. Also, most vehicles will continue to operate on VOC-controlled RFG until late September or early October, since the fuel distribution system requires some time to replace summer fuel with winter fuel after terminals are permitted to switch to winter fuel on September 16. Experience with the federal volatility program supports these conclusions, as discussed in the RIA.
