The standard 25 percent discount off the face value of debt bonds has been replaced with discounts ranging from 25 to 35 percent, depending on the type of bond involved. Bonds and contracts alone pertaining to the agreement that will take effect on 15 April total $52 billion. According to Central Bank [BC] sources, creditors have thus far used only $90 million of their credit in privatization auctions. The creditor banks have claimed that the discount rate on debt securities is very high. The creditors do not seem to have confidence in the Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2 Plan. A BC resolution provides that of the new bonds to be issued on 15 April, par bonds will be converted into shares with an initial discount of 35 percent. This rate will gradually decline until dropping to zero in 30 years. Foreign debt bonds converted into shares of privatized companies may not be repatriated over a six-year period. Profits and dividends earned on these shares may be freely taken out of the country. Brazilian companies that purchased debt bonds may not convert them into shares of privatized companies. The National Comptroller General extended from 31 March to 29 April the deadline for rescheduling fiscal debts registered as standing debts of the federal government.
