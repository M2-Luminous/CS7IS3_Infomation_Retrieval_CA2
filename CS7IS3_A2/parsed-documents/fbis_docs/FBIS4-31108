[passage omitted] You must be pleased with that decision. [Bugar] I am not so enthusiastic about the decision. There are matters on which we had already agreed with Coexistence--for example, that the conditions for the formation of a coalition would not include a common club of deputies because it is far more advantageous to have two clubs than just one. When someone formulates this condition, nonetheless, and adds that, if the MKDH does not agree, there will not be a coalition, he is actually shifting the blame to us. I cannot agree with that. We have therefore resolved to inform the mass media about every meeting we hold on the formation of the three-member coalition--if, for no other reason, than to let the voters find out who is actually slowing down the formation of the three-member coalition and who is asserting only narrow party interests. When something like that happens, all of society must know about it. We cannot play a game in which the voter learns about the result but does not know anything about its course. We will not accept that. [Vegh] How do you assess the conditions that Coexistence set for MOS? [Bugar] So far, we only know about them from the press, which is why we have called for an early meeting with Coexistence to discuss them. It could very well happen that we will not agree with some conditions. As I have already said, even now we disagree with a common club of deputies. Moreover, I am curious whether MOS, too, will agree with the conditions that have been published in the media. Personally, I do not consider it appropriate to say in advance: Take it or leave it. That is an ultimatum that need not be accepted.
