Personal Autonomy and the Buildup of Russia"] [Text] More than a half century ago the Russian philosopher I.A. Ilin predicted that the dismemberment and weakening of Russia would lead to very dire consequences for the entire world and reduce it to chaos. And the President of the United States is already admitting that in the new world, which was formed after the destruction of the communist system, there is less order. In the work of that same Ilin we find a precedent: Having been convinced that the weak Germany after 1945 became the gates for Soviet expansion to the West, the latter overcame its fear of the revival of a strong Germany and helped it to become a strong power again. In brief, we are gradually gaining the understanding that on the territory of the former USSR we must create some kind of unified state formation based on the principles of democracy and a market economy, one that is economically, socially, and politically strong and stable. The question arises: What about the numerous peoples who populate this space? One must assume that the principle of national-territorial autonomy has not justified itself. Under the communists these autonomous entities were an utter fiction and as soon as they began to be filled with real content, blood was shed. To preserve them in the posttotalitarian society would mean endless conflicts because of disputed territories, endless Karabakhs. And, moreover, "since all the modern ethnic groups have been dispersed, national statehood does not fully satisfy the aspirations of those peoples that are actively striving for it. What, for example, can be granted to the Tatar ethnic group as a whole by Tatarstan's acquisition of independence, if only one-fourth of all the Tatars of the former USSR live on this territory? Who will represent and provide for the national interests of the 75 percent of the Tatars who live outside Tatarstan? Otto Bauer, one of the creators of the idea of personal autonomy, wrote at the beginning of the 20th century: "The purely territorial principle everywhere places the minority in the hands of the majority...to implement the territorial principle in its pure form means that each nation will swallow up the minorities of other nations taken into its body, but at the same time it sacrifices its own minorities who are scattered throughout other national areas." All sober-minded political forces in Russia today are coming out in favor of restoring a unified state, admitting that the current principle for construction of the state, which was realized in the USSR--according to the ethnic principle, of course--will lead nowhere. At the same time we must be aware that we will not be able to restore the province-oblast system in the same form in which it existed before 1917. The peoples have become accustomed to sovereignty and national states, and with the elimination of the national-territorial autonomous entities the question of what will replace them will inevitably arise. What is the alternative? The way out, in our view, consists in separating the entire sphere of interethnic relations from the notion of territory and providing ethnic-personal autonomy, whereby the bearer of ethnic sovereignty is not the territory but representatives of a given ethnic group regardless of where they may live within the boundaries of the "large" state. And the right to personal autonomy may be exercised not only by individual peoples but also ethnic groups (for example, among Russians-Kazakhs). The idea of personal autonomy appeared approximately 100 years ago in Austro-Hungary. In Russia by the beginning of the 20th century it enjoyed support from all liberal and left-wing parties except for the Bolsheviks. Under the tsar the right to personal autonomy was actually enjoyed by many "nomadic foreigners," particularly Kazakhs and Kyrgyz. They had their own self-government, elected their own bolushes (district leaders), biys (judges) and had their own law (adat) by which they judged their fellow tribesmen, etc. The tsarist administration did not intervene in their internal affairs; it simply collected taxes. Naturally, the European population residing on these territories were not subject to the local "foreign" authority. After February 1917 attempts were made to realize principles of personal autonomy in other regions of Russia--in the Muslim Volga region, Siberia, Ukraine, and in Estonia, which had seceded, this principle was established right up until 1940. But as soon as the Bolsheviks came to power, promising all peoples "the right to self-determination right up to secession," and then turned their "sovereignty" into a fiction, no further attempts were made to realize the principle of personal autonomy. What should be the real content of the idea of personal autonomy for the peoples of modern Russia? In the first place, every nation should have the right to the external attributes of statehood--a president, a parliament, a flag, a seal, an anthem, etc. It is no secret that for 99 percent of any people sovereignty is needed for the sake of sovereignty itself. This must be taken into account. Let us consider the Tatar ethnic group as a concrete example. The president of Tataria should become the president of the Tatars, and all Tatars living in Russia should be under his rule, but representatives of other nationalities living in the Kazan Province would not be subject to him. Naturally, the question of whom to obey--their own personal-autonomous president or the Russian state--would have to be decided by every adult citizen for himself. Nobody would force a Tatar to be subject to the president of the Tatars if he did not wish this himself. Each ethnic group, exercising the right to personal autonomy, should have its own press, radio, television, and also system of education in its native language right up to higher education; the forms and ways of organizing this--to create their own educational institutions or ethnic courses, departments, and faculties in general Russian ones (for example, Tatar at Kazan University)--these, naturally, must be decided by the peoples themselves. It goes without saying that they must be permitted to create private educational institutions where the language of the training, naturally, would be determined by the owners themselves. The peoples must also be given the right to have their own legislation and courts. If a Tatar, for example, has killed or robbed another Tatar, why should the center intervene here? We must give them the right to judge the accused for themselves (the places for incarceration, incidentally, would most likely be common). The people should decide for themselves what kind of local legislation to have. The center would intervene only when the criminal and the victim did not belong to the same personal autonomous entity. It goes without saying that the center should retain the right to correct local laws in cases where they allow violations of the basic human rights or the integrity of the state. The principle of personal autonomy of peoples should be combined with provincial (oblast) division of Russia. The oblast (province) should have a certain contingent of bureaucrats headed by the governor who would be responsible for resolving statewide issues on the territory of the oblast: the deployment of military units, the collection of statewide taxes, the functioning of strategically important highways and railroads, etc. The personal autonomous entities might also be granted the right to issue their own money while, of course, all citizens and organizations of Russia would necessarily have to accept the Russian ruble as well. There is a precedent for this--in the Russian empire many national districts have the right to print their own money. It would be more complicated with the so-called municipal services--public transportation, water, sewerage, street cleaning, etc.--everything that should be under the jurisdiction of the local authorities (we will call them zemstvos). How would the zemstvos (provincial-oblast, district-regional, etc.) relate to the organs of power of the personally autonomous peoples? The experience of the Russian empire cannot help us here since in those oblasts and provinces where peoples with something like personal autonomy lived there were no zemstvos. Here is one of the ways of solving this problem: proportional representation. Let us say that in Kazan Province 50 percent of the population are citizens directly under the jurisdiction of the Russian state and the other 50 percent are representatives of the Tatar personal autonomous entity. In this case both would form up to half of the deputies of the province zemstvo. Whom the Tatars would delegate--elected, appointed, or if the deputies of the personal autonomous Tatar parliament residing permanently in Kazan Province would combine this deputy work with that in the zemstvo--they would decide for themselves. This, in my view, is briefly the content of the idea of personal autonomy as it applies to Russian reality today. In conclusion I shall mention the most widespread objections we have heard and try to respond to them. 1. This kind of organization of the state would be aimed at dividing the peoples. Excuse me, but why would there be division if the people belonging to various personal autonomous entities were living in one state, constantly communicating with each other, and learning from one another; if, for instance, a Bashkir saw that a Tatar living in Ufa had greater rights, he could suggest to his personal autonomous organs of power that it would not be a bad idea for the Bashkirs to learn from the Tatars. And if it comes to that, are the sovereign national-territorial formations not proceeding more toward separation, especially if you look at who is calling for "sovereignization" now (see above)? The "ideal" national-territorial sovereignty would entail separation and placement of peoples in various autonomous quarters. This is shifting the blame, as they say! 2. Such a policy is apartheid since there would be different laws for different nationalities. No. Apartheid is when one people or another have forced upon them a way of life that is different from the others. But no one will be forcing those Tatars to have their own legislation that is different from the Russian. They will be given the right to have it, and if they want to they will take advantage of their right--that is their business. And to be frank, national-territorial autonomous entities are similar to Bantustans. Every resident, for example, of Kazan, regardless of nationality, must obey the laws of Tataria whether he wants to or not. So again it is shifting the blame. 3. A very significant objection: The idea is not bad but the peoples who have developed a taste for territorial sovereignty will not go for it. I have also heard this: "Territorial-national autonomous entities are now hundreds of years old or maybe even thousands" (!). And this in our dynamic age when everything is changing almost every day, to speak about hundreds and thousands of years?! Whether or not the people will go for this will be shown in the near future. At the beginning of the article I already said that two years of sovereign life have affected the awareness of many peoples.
