Minister Hunguana was reacting to speculation concerning the Mozambican Government's successive requests to postpone the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC] meeting to analyze a report by UN Special Representative Aldo Ajello. Minister Hunguana described the report as extensive, adding it presents many problems that require action, rather than a formal response. He noted that the government has been working to present the CSC with concrete details concerning the schedule to be followed up to the holding of elections in October. Meanwhile, Radio Mozambique has learned that the CSC is scheduled to meet in Maputo tomorrow.
