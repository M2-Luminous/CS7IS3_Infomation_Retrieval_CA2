Mesic suggests that the Constitutional Court should annul the decision of the Chamber of Deputies of the Assembly of 24 May this year, whereby the president [speaker] of the chamber was relieved of duty. The protest note was received in the Constitutional Court today, and Stjepan Mesic's office distributed it to journalists in the Croatian Assembly. In his protest note Mesic explained why he postponed the 18th session of the Chamber of Deputies and stressed that, when the president was relieved of duty, provisions of the Constitution and the Chamber's code of practice--that is, the constitutional rights of the speaker of the chamber and the procedure for adopting documents on relieving him of duty--were violated.
