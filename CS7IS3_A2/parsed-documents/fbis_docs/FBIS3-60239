The international convention on biological diversity agreed upon at the Earth Summit in the Brazilian capital, Rio de Janerio, 18 months ago came into effect yesterday. Under the agreement, companies will have to pay royalties to states or nations if they want access to native plants and animals. Jim Divine of the Association of Forest Industries says that by any international standard, Australia's forest practices are a model of sustainability. [Begin Divine recording] With more than 100 years of operation, managed forest logging in this country has not resulted in any extinction or loss of a single animal or plant species. The other thing is the fact that we are working to sustain the yield patterns and we are working in less than one percent of the forest to (?state) annually [End recording]. State governments are expected to start work in the new year on a new strategy to preserve the nation's genetic material. The strategy is the first step towards implementing the international biodiversity agreement. Under the agreement, companies will be forced to pay royalties to states or nations if they want access to native plants and animals. The worldwide fund for nature which took part in the negotiations says the agreement will help ensure biological resources are used sustainably. A consultant for the organization, Alistair Graham, says its now up to the states to work out royalties. [Begin Graham recording] It will be state governments who can be expected to assert proprietor ownership of wild biological resources and they are the ones that would have the commercial interest to negotiate such royalty or rental payments. And it will be up to them and it has to be said that on the basis of past experience on royalties of minerals or wood, they may not do very well. But at least the opportunity is there [End recording].
