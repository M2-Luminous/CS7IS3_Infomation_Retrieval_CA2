Widespread rumors have exacerbated worries and fear among the people. In the northern areas of the capital, gunfire continues to be heard, with the inhabitants departing in the hundreds to other areas of the capital or to Zaire. A government communique that has just reached us deals with a few rumors in particular: A rumor particularly harmful for peace and national reconciliation in Burundi has reached the national and international press community. The prime minister categorically denies the allegations detailed by this rumor and states the following: There was no coup attempt during the night of 22 to 23 March 1994. The Presidential Palace and the government headquarters are enjoying the usual protection of the security forces. The president of the republic and the prime minister are at work as usual, as witnessed by the U.S. deputy under secretary of state, Mrs. (Prudence) [word indistinct]; the UN secretary general's special representative, Mr. Ahmed Ould Abdallah; and the ambassador of Cote d'Ivoire in Bonn, Mr. Simeon Ake, who heads the UN international commission in charge of investigating the events that have occurred since 21 October 1993. All these officials were received today officially at the government headquarters. There are not government members on the run abroad, and no definitive figures for losses have yet been established after Monday's [21 March] clashes in the northern areas of the capital between security forces and rebels armed with assault rifles, grenades and heavy weapons.
