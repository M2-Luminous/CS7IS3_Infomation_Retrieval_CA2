The first candidate to speak was Ruben Dario Carles of Change 94. He was followed by Jose Salvador Munoz of the Doctrinaire Panamenist Party, then by Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People alliance. Professor Ruben Dario Carles pointed out the previous government's administrative mistakes in handling public finances. Carles said that 21 years of military government left a $7.2-billion financial disaster due to the lack of an appropriate fiscal policy. The Change 94 candidate stressed that payment of the foreign debt must be preceded by attention to the country's social debt. [Begin Carles recording] There has been an obvious, general deterioration of basic public services, but this failure is not the result of a lack of funds. It is due to a lack of structural efficiency by the government caused in many cases by legislation imposed by the dictatorship. Gentlemen, forget it; the government cannot do it all. Those who believe that the government is going to satisfy everyone who asks for something are dead wrong. That is impossible. This country is bankrupt and has no credit. [end recording] The event is organized by the APEDE and is being held in a local hotel. Six of the seven presidential candidates are participating. Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya Moscoso de Gruber declined to attend. Doctrinaire Panamenist Party candidate Jose Salvador Munoz seriously criticized President Guillermo Endara's administration, calling it a continuation of militarism. He also said that the country's social problems have not been solved. Ernesto Perez Balladares of the United People alliance based his speech on giving priority to resolving the country's social problems as part of his government's platform. [Begin Perez Balladares recording] The potential natural, human, and financial resources that Panama has available guarantee an increase in Panamanians' quality of life. The previously mentioned human development guidelines implicitly include the adoption of a strategy of equitable economic growth to serve as a source of and support for the country's overall development. In my administration, the economic growth program will mean: 1. [number as heard] The rational and effective use of the reverted areas and areas that will revert in accordance with the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. This should allow us to coherently plan our development model, ensuring that the benefits gained are accessible to all areas of the country and to all Panamanians. [end recording] CADE 94 ends this afternoon.
