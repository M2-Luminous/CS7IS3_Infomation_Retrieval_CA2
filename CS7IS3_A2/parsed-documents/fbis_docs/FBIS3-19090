The meeting of the 189 representatives of regional and local government resulted in the appointment of a president for the institution. Of the four candidates, the Frenchman Jacques Blanc, president of Langedoc-Roussillon, was eventually elected. His appointment is the result of lobbying among his colleagues as well as the outcome of agreements with other candidates. Luc Van den Brande from Flanders, the main outsider was felt to be too supportive of the North, but above all handicapped by the separatist and radical image of a certain element of Flanders. Mr. Blanc will remain president for two years. He will then switch places with Catalan Deputy President Pasquall Maragall. The secretary general will probably be a German. Pause from Bavaria is the most likely candidate. Despite the celebrations, the Committee members did not forget that they are on probation until 1996, when the Committee statute may be modified. Some members, like Bavarian President Edmund Stoiber, intend to turn the Committee into a Third Legislative Chamber, alongside the Council of Ministers and the Parliament. To deserve this promotion, the Committe will have to prove that it means business. It will be consulted on numerous matters, such as the European transport and telecommunication networks, economic and social cohesion, structural funds, etc. With its first recommendation being sought by 9 April, the Committee will hold its next session in Brussels on 4-5 April. Jacques Blanc indicated that it will have to focus on clear objectives and avoid going in too many directions.
