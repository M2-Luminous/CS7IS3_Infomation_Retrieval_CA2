FR940825-1-00035 FR940825-1-00008 4. Extension of Time to Submit Evidence The 1994 proposed rule would require responsible entities to grant an extension of time in which to submit evidence if the applicant or tenant submits the declaration of eligible immigration status, and certifies that the evidence needed to support the declaration is temporarily unavailable, and prompt and diligent efforts to obtain this evidence will be undertaken. The proposed rule provides that the extension may not be for an indefinite period, but allows for the responsible entity to establish a time period that is sufficient for the applicant or tenant to obtain the needed evidence. 5. When Verification of Eligible Status is to Occur For applicants, the 1994 proposed rule provides for the responsible entity to verify evidence of eligible immigration status at the time the responsible entity verifies other aspects of eligibility for assistance (i.e., income, family composition). For persons already receiving assistance, the rule provides for the responsible entity to verify evidence of eligible status at the time that it verifies other aspects of eligibility (i.e., reexamination of income, family composition) for continued occupancy in the assisted unit. Verification of evidence of eligible immigration status is to be treated the same as any other factor which determines a family's eligibility for assistance. 6. Verification Procedures The proposed rule provides for the following verification procedures in accordance with the INS verification systems: (1) Primary verification of the immigration status is conducted by means of an automated system (SAVE) that provides access to the names, file numbers, and admission numbers of noncitizens; (2) Secondary verification is a manual search by the INS of its records to determine an individual's immigration status. If primary verification fails to confirm eligible immigration status, secondary verification must be performed. The results of primary verification are not sufficient to conclude that an individual does not have eligible immigration status. (3) No waiver of verification procedures. The proposed rule does not provide for waiver of the INS verification procedures. 7. Protection of Individual's Privacy Section 214(d)(3) requires HUD to protect the ``individual's privacy to the maximum degree possible.'' The 1988 proposed rule provided that evidence of immigration status submitted by an applicant or tenant to the responsible entity may be released by the responsible entity to HUD, or to a Federal, State or local agency under specific circumstances, or may be released by HUD to any Federal, State, or local government agency (including the Social Security Administration and the INS) under specific circumstances, and listed those circumstances. The 1994 proposed rule recognizes the impossibility of anticipating all circumstances under which a responsible entity or HUD may be required to release information. Accordingly, the 1994 proposed rule removes the list of circumstances, and provides that (1) the responsible entity may release the information to HUD and the INS for purposes of determining eligible immigration status, (2) HUD may release the information to the INS, and (3) the responsible entity and HUD may release the information to any other Federal, State or local government agency in accordance with applicable Federal, State or local law that requires the release of the evidence to that agency. 8. No Delay, Denial, Reduction, or Termination of Assistance Pending Verification of Eligible Status or Pending INS Appeal; but Delay for Applicant Following INS Appeal Consistent with section 214(d)(4), the 1994 proposed rule provides that assistance to an applicant may not be delayed, reduced, or denied, and assistance to a tenant may not be delayed, denied, reduced or terminated, during the pendency of the verification procedures for eligible status, or during the pendency of the INS appeal procedure. Consistent with section 214(d)(5), assistance to an applicant may not be denied, and assistance to a tenant may not be terminated during the pendency of the informal hearing procedure provided by the responsible entity. However, section 214(d)(5) only restricts denial or termination of assistance. Thus, assistance to an applicant may be delayed, but not denied, during the pendency of the informal hearing process. 9. Extension of Time to Request INS Appeal or Informal Hearing The 1994 proposed rule requires the responsible entity extend the time for requesting an appeal to the INS or for requesting an informal hearing upon good cause shown by the applicant or tenant. 10. Continued Assistance/Deferred Termination of Assistance Consistent with section 214, the 1994 proposed rule provides for assistance to be continued or termination of assistance temporarily deferred for certain families and under certain circumstances as set forth in section 214(c)(1). 11. Proration of Assistance The 1994 proposed rule provides for proration of assistance for applicant and tenant families containing family members with eligible and ineligible immigration status (``mixed families''). The allowance for proration of assistance departs from HUD's previous position on this issue. HUD previously took the position that proration was not authorized by section 214, and even if authorized, not feasible in its covered programs, particularly in HUD's public housing and section 8 programs. On further consideration, HUD acknowledges that the statutory language does not prohibit proration of assistance, and HUD has designed formulas for proration that it believes will make proration of assistance possible in covered programs.
