Described as part of the Ukrainian Air Force, the Antonov 30 will exercise its rights under the open skies treaty by carrying out surveillance sorties. The treaty provides for various nations to fly over each others territory to gather intelligence using aerial photography, radar and video cameras. It will be the first time an Antonov 30 from Ukraine is seen here as it flies over Lincolnshire to RAF Scampton on Thursday. The Ukrainians will be hosted by a team from the Joint Arms Control Implementation Group, which is based at Scampton and has reciprocal arrangements for carrying out similar spying missions over former Iron Curtain countries.
