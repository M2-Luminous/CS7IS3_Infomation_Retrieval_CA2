The Council of Ministers decided at the last moment last night to issue a decree extending by eight days the deadline for gathering signatures in support of the 13 abrogation referendums proposed by the Pannella Club and the Northern League. A subsequent period of seven days is expected for delivering the signatures to the Court of Cassation. This is the first time such a measure has been adopted. The decision followed a report from Interior Minister Nicola Mancino, who spoke about the need to "find a just solution to the referendums problem" since, he said, it is not enough to place an entry in the Official Gazette in order to terminate an initiative which, however much people may agree or disagree with it, is nevertheless legitimate. An extension of the deadline has been granted for gathering signatures and submitting the referendum proposals for which signatures are being gathered. So the volunteers assigned to gathering signatures -- which, according to the latest estimates, now total 440,000, Marco Pannella said -- can resume their work. But the Radical leader was cautious: "Let us not celebrate yet; we still have to read the decrees carefully." Be that as it may, he said, the rate at which signatures have been gathered in recent days is encouraging -- "an average of 25,000-30,000 per day," which, if maintained, would enable the promoters to achieve the quorum of 500,000 signatures. This, partly because, Pannella went on, "the margin of error when gathering signatures is about 3 percent of those gathered by us, 15 percent of those gathered by others who are less expert, and some 8-10 percent of those gathered by the municipalities." So does the Radical leader expect to end his fast? "We shall see.... Certainly, if the situation really is as we hope it is, I might at least end my water fast."
