In a statement read shortly after the expiry of the midnight GMT deadline as was set in a February 9 ultimatum by the NATO, Clinton warned that "all parties should be aware that the ultimatum stands." "The deadline has not been extended," Clinton said, "NATO and the United Nations will continue to monitor compliance extremely carefully." White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, who read the Clinton statement, said "the vast majority of heavy weapons have either been moved from the zone or placed under UN control." She was referring to the 20-kilometer heavy weapons exclusion zone in Sarajevo. "Only a handful of areas remain outside UN control and we expect that very soon most or all of those will be within UN control," Myers said. She said the U.S. and allies will continue to monitor the situations on the ground very carefully. Clinton congratulated the UN and the NATO allies as well as Russia for their contributions in the Bosnian peace effort. He said that "NATO's decision applies to any heavy weapon attacks on Sarajevo from within or beyond the zone." On the diplomatic front, Clinton said, U.S. diplomats will be working with the warring parties and allies and partners to transform the potential of peace into reality. During a 20-minute telephone conversation during the day between him and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to send their aides to Bonn, Germany for consultations over Bosnia with others from France, Britain and Germany on Tuesday [22 February].
