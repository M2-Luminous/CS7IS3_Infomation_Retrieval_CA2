AL-BILAD has learned that the United States will agree, during their meeting with Prince Hasan, to the inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound ships inside the port by Lloyds, not the U.S. Navy. AL-BILAD has also learned that the resumption of the [Arab-Israeli] talks and the expansion of participation in the multilateral talks will be raised by the United States during the talks. Meanwhile, Jordanian officials say that holding the talks the way the Israelis want is rejected by the Jordanians, because this is intended to bypass the agenda in order to postpone priority issues. Furthermore, the Israeli request to sign a peace treaty with Jordan before discussing substantial issues, such as borders, refugees, and water, is considered impossible by the Jordanian leadership. This, consequently, will not make Prince Hasan's U.S. visit at all easy.
