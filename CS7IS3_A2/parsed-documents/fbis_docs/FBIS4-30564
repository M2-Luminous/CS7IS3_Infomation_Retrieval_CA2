At the contact, Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and head of our side's delegation, made a keynote speech. The contents of the keynote speech are as follows: Mr. Yi Hong-ku, senior delegate, and delegates of the South side, today we are seated together cherishing the important mission of preparing for North-South top-level talks. I am pleased that both sides are holding a preliminary contact today after reaching an agreement [kyonhaeui ilchirul pogo] on holding top-level talks. We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division which we should no longer pass over. However, the reality facing our nation is grave. Rather than removing misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation between the North and the South, they have been accentuated, and even encouraged by outside forces. In such a situation, we were faced with a dangerous phase where even unstable peace [pulanjonghan pyonghwa] was endangered. Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common destruction [minjogui kongmyolinya], which cannot coexist. At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before. We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks between the North and the South will be an important historic occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation. Delegates from the South side, the authority of top-level leaders of the two sides and the destiny of the nation are entrusted to North-South top-level talks, and the interest of the world is focused on these talks. The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost, successful talks which achieve national reconciliation and unity of all of the countrymen and which give a bright hope for the country's peace and for its independent and peaceful reunification. We have consistently adhered to the position of marking the turning point for the start towards realization of the country's reunification through top-level talks without outside forces' interference. As your side knows, the respected and beloved President Kim Il- song personally initiated top-level talks as early as May 1972, when North-South dialogue first began, and since then, has paid special attention to seeing to it that top-level talks, which will be of significance for the country's reunification, are held. Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However, these efforts failed to bear due fruit. It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation lies our common position of worrying over the nation's today and tomorrow. We would like to believe that this position is precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength. If there are no differences in this national independent spirit between the North and the South, we can say that success of top- level talks has been guaranteed, because the top-level talks' ideal of linking the North and the South into one body is based precisely on our national, independent spirit, the source of our nation's will and strength to shape our destiny with our own strength, and the firm guarantee for defending the nation's common interests without falling prey to outside forces victimizing our nation's interests. If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the nation's position, the North and the South will be able to achieve reconciliation and unity; easily transcend all differences in accordance with the principles of independence, peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the difficult situation with the nation's united, national independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire. The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to have, will become the creation of a great new national history where the the history of antagonism that continued for half a century in our country changes into a history of great national unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history of peace; and the history of division becomes a history of reunification. It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow countrymen bright hope for reunification in the nineties and will also regain the great pride of our nation which has outstanding history, tradition, and wisdom. This will also give great happiness to the world's peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the Korean peninsula. While frankly stating our basic views on the pressing top-level talks between the North and South, and emphasizing the important responsibility of both sides for the successful preparation of the historic top-level talks between the North and South, I will now put forth our proposal on the basic issues to be discussed at the preliminary contact. First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in Pyongyang. As your side knows, when President Kim Yong-sam was in the opposition party, the respected and beloved President Kim Il-song had already asked him to visit Pyongyang, and President Kim Yong-sam had repeatedly expressed the will that he will meet with President Kim Il-song, irrespective of the venue, and that he will visit Pyongyang. We believe that setting Pyongyang as the venue coincides with the will of the top-level of both sides. Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe that this date is significant because it is right about the day when the North and South all celebrate 15 August. Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the top- level talks between the North and South. We must discuss various working-level procedural issues for holding the top-level talks. We believe that except for important issues such as the venue and date, it is rational to provide a delegates' contact right after today's contact ends with one delegate from the preliminary contact of each side and two suite members of each side to discuss the other working-level issues. The delegates' contact should start from 1 July, and should be able to discuss issues such as the organization and scope of the delegation, schedule of sojourn, dispatch of advance team, procedures for exchange of visits, guarantee of accommodations, guaranteeing personal safety, and other working- level issues. Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding the top-level talks. If the talks are to be successful so that the top- levels of the North and South can meet, we believe that it is important for both sides to create a good atmosphere. Thus, we propose that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts that may cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks. As such, while putting forth our proposal regarding the holding of the top-level talks between the North and South, we propose that an agreement on the preliminary contact for the top-level talks between the North and South be adopted along these lines so that it can be announced today.
