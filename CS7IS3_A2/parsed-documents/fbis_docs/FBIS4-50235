A survey by the broadcasting authority reveals that more individuals consider the portrayals of violence, sex, nudity, triad rituals, triad jargon, and homosexuality on commercial television unacceptable. Compared with 1990, four times as many viewers reportedly thought the quality of drama series was low, three times as many thought the same about children's programs and eight times as many thought cultural and arts programs were poor. Recently, the number of viewers' complaints are on the rise as two local TV stations -- the Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) and the Asia Television Limited (ATV) -- clashed with each other by screening the same episode of the drama series "Judge Bao" at the same time. One hundred such complaints have now been received, compared to an average yearly total of 800 for all programs, said David Webb, secretary of the broadcasting authority. The survey also found that more than 90 percent of those who responded consider it necessary to retain the option of the imposition of financial penalties by the broadcasting authority for breaches of ordinances related. The broadcasting authority has decided to call together the two TV competitors to find a solution to the problem and legislators have warned to look at what conditions, if any, could be added to the companies' licenses, which come up for their mid-term review next month. While many TV programs were complained about, the news programs of local TV stations became the only exception to be praised for high quality by most of the 2,000 respondents in the survey. Nearly all individuals aged between 12 and 64 have television sets in their households in Hong Kong and 30 percent of them own two or more television sets. In addition to the TVB and ATV, each of which has both Cantonese and English channels, satellite and subscription televisions were also introduced to the territory in 1991 and 1993, respectively, by the Star TV and the Wharf Cable Limited. Statistics show that local residents here tend to spend less time on average watching commercial, wireless television, from 4.2 hours per day in 1990 to 3.5 hours per day this year.
