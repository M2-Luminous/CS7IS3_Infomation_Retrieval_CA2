The suspects were charged Monday in a Jos magistrate's court with unlawful assembly, rioting, causing mischief with fire and possessing arms, NAN said. The demonstration last Tuesday in Jos, capital of the central Plateau state, was over the controversial appointment of a Moslem as the head of a local government council in mainly-Christian Jos. The Christian population expressed its opposition to the appointment, a step which made the government suspend the move, but this triggered off the protest by the Moslem population. The demonstrators set ablaze the main market in the city, two mosques and a church and some cars, eyewitnesses said. The state military administrator, Colonel Mohammed Mana, swiftly imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the city and nearby Bukuru town, and deployed soldiers on the main roads to restore order. The government later relaxed the curfew, according to NAN.
