FBIS3-5855 "dreas048__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-048-A Document Type:Daily Report 11 March 1994 ANNEX Japan Keidanren, Rengo Agree on Administrative Reform OW1103055494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 8 Mar 94 Evening Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1103055494 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Top officials of Keidanren [Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan] and Rengo [Japanese Trade Union Confederation] held a meeting at a Tokyo hotel on 8 March to discuss establishing a third-party organization aimed at promoting administrative reform, and deregulation in particular. They agreed that the third-party organization should be managed by the private sector without members who are ex-governmental officials. Japan-U.S. relations have become stressed due to Japan's surplus. Both Keidanren and Rengo believe that Japan should aim at reducing the surplus by promoting structural reform, particularly through deregulation, and that deregulation conducted mainly by bureaucrats may be limited in its effect. Keidanren Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa and other top officials intend to make a formal proposal on their demands to top officials of the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA], including Director General Koshiro Ishida on 24 March. The concept of setting up a third-party body is based on the recommendations previously made by the "Economic Reform Study Council" (known as the Hiraiwa Council) and the Ad Hoc Council for Promoting Administrative Reform. The MCA is currently studying details of this body. However, Keidanren thinks "the fact that bureaucrats, mainly from the MCA, assume leadership in working out the bill is, in itself, a problem," (according to the Keidanren Secretariat). Thus, top Keidanren and Rengo officials decided to discuss this matter in depth. During the meeting, Rengo Secretary General Washio said: "As a third-party organization, it should exclude members who speak for the government ministries and agencies and it should select members mainly from the private sector. It should have an independent secretariat and be granted rights to recommend investigations and to order submission of related documents." Keidanren Vice Chairman Isao Nakauchi said: "I quite agree with you." Thus, the participants agreed on excluding former governmental officials. With regard to the issue of reducing Japan's surplus, they agreed that "while we oppose setting up numerical targets, it is necessary to promote cutting the surplus in various ways, including expansion of domestic demand."
