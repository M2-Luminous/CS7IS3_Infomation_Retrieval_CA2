The president of the Republic of Mozambique arrived in Luanda at about 0800 aboard an Angolan Airlines aircraft. Joaquim Chissano, who is coming from Portugal, was welcomed by President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco and members of the government and the president's office were also present at the 4 February International Airport to welcome the Mozambican head of state. After protocol formalities at the 4 February International Airport, the two heads of state left in a motorcade to the Futungo de Belas Palace, where they held official talks at the highest level. The two delegations exchanged information on the political and military situations in their respective countries. Angola is facing a war that was caused by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA], which lost the first multiparty elections held in September 1992. Mozambique is implementing the General Peace Accord signed between the government and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] in October 1992. Difficulties faced by the two sides in confining troops have led to mutual accusations of the violation of the accords. Elections are scheduled to take place in Mozambique in October this year. The two heads of state also took the opportunity to review the general situation in southern Africa where their countries are situated, particularly the development of events in South Africa, where the first multiracial elections will take place in April this year. Almiro de Conceicao, spokesman for the president of the Republic, briefed the press on the talks. [Begin Conceicao recording] The meeting between the two presidents was principally aimed at exchanging experience. They examined the main issues facing the countries of the region in the military, social, political, economic, and financial fields. They also discussed some international issues. Evidently, the Mozambican side wanted to know how the pacification process took place in Angola with regard to the confinement and the formation of the armed forces. It also wanted to know about the role played by the United Nations in monitoring troops' demobilization. Above all, it wanted to know how UNITA had the capacity to resume armed conflict after elections. [end recording] This afternoon, President Joaquim Chissano met with Angolan Prime Minister Marcolino Moco. Prime Minister Marcolino Moco was accompanied by the government's economic team. They related their experiences with the economic readjustment programs in their respective countries. The Angolan Government is preparing an economic program for 1994, and Mozambique's experience seems to be useful. In turn, Mozambique is experiencing an atmosphere of preelectoral campaigning, and the Angolan experience serves as a barometer for the measures adopted by the Mozambican Government. President Joaquim Chissano is presently being honored with an official dinner given by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. The Mozambican head of state will give a news conference before leaving Luanda tomorrow.
