FR941227-1-00026 FR941227-1-00007 (2) How should FRA address accountability and enforceability if the carrier does not meet the 99-percent standard? (3) If a performance standard were adopted by FRA, penalties might be assessed based upon actual performance by the railroad. Such a penalty would increase geometrically for each percentage point below the 99-percent performance level, i.e., $1,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 98-percent level; $3,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 97-percent level; $9,000 penalty assessment for performance at the 96-percent level, etc. Please comment on this sliding-scale approach. (4) FRA has determined that a 100-percent verification of reporting for a major railroad is not practicable given the size of its current work force. Even 100-percent verification at a small facility might not be feasible. What is the minimum sample size that would be required before a performance standard should be applied? (5) The Association of American Railroads (AAR) acknowledged and agreed that most of its members already have internal control plans in place. Please describe these plans in detail. (6) If FRA determines that a written internal control plan is in fact necessary, how would you modify the existing proposal? (7) Should the regulation indicate that the internal control plan be continuously updated and maintained? B. Magnetic Media Submissions (Proposed Section 225.37) The proposed rule allows railroads the option of reporting data by way of magnetic media in lieu of paper forms. Please refer to proposed ยง225.37. (1) Would substitute forms be acceptable for verification when a railroad submits magnetic media? (2) What would be the railroad cost differentials for developing a new computer format or modifying an existing one? (3) Should ``railroad-designed formats'' for the various reporting forms be allowed? How would this be accomplished? C. Definitions (Proposed Section 225.5) FRA proposed several new definitions in ยง225.5. Those new definitions warranting further discussion are listed below. 1. ``Worker on Duty'' FRA proposed that a ``worker on duty'' be defined to include individuals who receive monetary compensation from the reporting railroad, or who are engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive function for reporting railroad as described in ยง209.303. Similarly, a ``volunteer'' would be sort of service for the reporting railroad without receiving direct monetary compensation from that railroad and are not engaged in either (1) the operation of on-track equipment or (2) any other rail safety-sensitive function for the reporting railroad as described in ยง209.303.
