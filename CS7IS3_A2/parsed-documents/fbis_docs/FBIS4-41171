In some "hot spots" it remains the only force that is actually exercising functions capable of ending fratricidal war, separating warring sides, and getting them to sit around the negotiating table. An analysis of the situation attests to a significant future broadening of the participation of Russian peacemaking subunits on the territory of a number of CIS republics. The participation of the Russian Federation, a permanent member of the UN Security Council, in peacemaking operations is determined by norms of international law, by the UN Charter, by documents of the Security Council and the CSCE, and, with the creation of the Council of CIS Heads of State, by the Commonwealth Charter and the Agreement on Groups of Military Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces [sily po podderzhaniyu mira], which were adopted in Tashkent in May 1992. Peacemaking problems were reflected in the Military Doctrine adopted in the Russian Federation Security Council, which noted for the first time that "Russia assists the efforts of the world community and various collective security organs in preventing wars and armed conflicts and in maintaining and restoring peace and, to this end, deems it necessary to have Armed Forces and other troops to conduct peacekeeping operations in accordance with a UN Security Council decision or international obligations." But the existing legal basis is plainly inadequate. A draft law defining the status, composition, maintenance, and functions of Russia's peacemaking forces has been submitted to the State Duma. The draft law lays down the procedure for providing military and civilian personnel of the Russian Federation to participate in operations to maintain and restore international peace and security and in other kinds of UN peacemaking activity, as well as in the fulfillment by the Russian Federation of obligations adopted under international treaties and agreements, including within the framework of the CSCE and the CIS, as defined in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 of the UN Charter. Following the State Duma's adoption of the law, it is necessary to draw up and adopt the Concept of Russia's Participation in Peacemaking Activity and the Statute on the Russian Federation's Peacemaking Forces. At the same time two or three motorized rifle divisions of the Ground Forces must be transferred to the authorized organizational structure of the military contingents participating in peacekeeping operations. It is proposed, starting in 1995, to relieve the airborne troops of peacemaking tasks. Peacemaking force subunits must be brought up to full strength, have modern, air-transportable hardware with high off-road capabilities, be equipped with light armament and means of communication and control, and be supplied with the necessary resources to cope with autonomous actions lasting two or three months. This hardware must not count toward the maximum levels restricted by treaty obligations in the European part of Russia. The Russian Ministry of Defense is prepared to take on the tasks of manning, training, and equipping military contingents of peacemaking forces and military observers and supplying them at permanent deployment garrisoning locations, but questions of funding are very acute. There are several reasons for this. First, legislation on peacemaking has not been created in any of the former republics of the USSR. Second, despite the protocol "On the Manning, Structure, and Material, Technical, and Financial Support of the Group of Military Observers and Collective Peacekeeping Forces in the CIS," which was signed by the CIS heads of state in May 1992 and which provides for these costs to be borne from contributions from the CIS states and the sides involved in a conflict, Russia has received nothing. Third, we consider it logical that the world community, in tending toward the recognition of Russia as a guarantor against the escalation of conflicts to the scale of regional wars, could express this support not just in words but also by partially covering Russia's expenditure on peacekeeping operations in the near abroad out of UN funds. Or else offset this expenditure against Russia's subscription to the United Nations for the same purposes. During 1993 alone more than 26 billion rubles [R] was spent out of the Defense Ministry's budget on the peacemaking activities of military contingents. It is perfectly obvious that Russia's peacemaking forces must be funded out of the federal budget under a separate subhead, while expenditure connected with peacemaking activity on the territories of the republics of the former USSR must be covered by the CIS states' contributions in monetary or other form on a shared basis. A few words about the participation of Russian peacemaking forces in the settlement of armed conflicts in the near abroad. In accordance with the bilateral agreement between the Russian Federation and Moldavia [Moldova] "On the Principles of the Peaceful Settlement of the Armed Conflict in the Dniester Region" of 23 July 1992, a contingent of the Russian Federation Armed Forces was formed on a voluntary basis, consisting initially of six battalions, and was sent into the regions of the conflict from 23 July through 31 August 1992. Today the strength of the peacemaking force there has been reduced. Personnel serve in the zone of responsibility between the sides involved in the conflict, which has an overall length of approximately 225 km and a width of between 4 and 15 km, a checkpoint-control regime is being organized, observation posts are being set up, mobile groups are being created to patrol sectors, important installations are placed under guard, and an alert-duty subunit is appointed. Purposeful and concerted actions have resulted in the stabilization of the situation in the region and control over its development. The blood of peaceful inhabitants is no longer being shed, and the talks process relating to the final settlement of the conflict by peaceful means is continuing, albeit with difficulty. It is clear, however, from a forecast of the development of the situation in the Dniester Region that the withdrawal of our units and subunits of the peacemaking forces appears premature, although the question of a further reduction in the quantity of men and equipment in the conflict zone has already been raised. A final solution to the conflict situation in the region is a matter for the politicians. In South Ossetia a military contingent of the peacemaking forces was sent into the conflict zone in July 1992 on the basis of "Directives of the Russian Federation Government" in the light of the fulfillment of the Dagomys agreements of 24 June 1992 on settling the Georgian-Ossetian conflict, and it is continuing to fulfill its tasks. A complex situation persists in the region. Deliveries of food and essential goods from Georgia have not been made for a long time. Paper currency has been virtually withdrawn from circulation. The crime situation is deteriorating. The population has been forced to defend itself against robbery and lawlessness. Practically the entire adult male population has weapons. A CSCE mission is working in the conflict zone to monitor the situation and give some humanitarian assistance. A fragile stability is being maintained in South Ossetia only thanks to the presence of the Russian peacemaking force. If it is withdrawn, the situation could instantly get out of control. The danger of a further explosion of military confrontation has now increased significantly. Russia's 201st Motorized Rifle Division has been performing peacemaking tasks in the Republic of Tajikistan for approximately two years. In October 1993 it became part of the Collective Peacemaking Forces which had been formed. The division is a deterrent factor in the escalation of civil war and the conduct of large-scale provocative actions on the Tajik-Afghan border. Russia is taking an active part in settling the Armenian-Azerbaijani and Georgian-Abkhazian conflicts. A peacemaking operation began 14 June in the region of the latter. The performance of peacemaking tasks is attended by daily risk to servicemen's lives and is carried out under conditions of unceasing provocations from both sides. Isolation from the permanent deployment garrisoning locations, the growth of antiarmy and anti-Russian feeling among the local population, and the lengthy stay in a zone of conflict (state of emergency) rightly arouse the concern of servicemen. But the greatest concern is aroused by the peacemaking forces' lack of status, the vagueness of their rights and obligations, and the poor social and legal provision: the low pay and remuneration, poor life and health insurance, and lack of privileges in the provision of housing. Despite this, today Russia's Armed Forces play the paramount role in maintaining peace and stability and in settling conflicts. But the success of any peacemaking action depends on the military contingent's qualitative training and on careful planning. To these ends we have set up training centers in the 27th and 45th Guards' Motorized Rifle Divisions. But the training facilities do not yet make it possible to fully train personnel. It is necessary to improve them, but again the matter is being held up by funding. Russia actively participates in theoretical elaborations and consultations on peacemaking activity with various international organizations (United Nations, CSCE, North Atlantic Cooperation Council, NATO, and others), including on a bilateral basis with interested countries. This year it is planned to hold the first Russian-U.S. joint command and staff exercise of the Russian Federation's 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle Division and the U.S. 3d Infantry Division. Their chief aim is to define mutually acceptable approaches to the planning of troop operations and organizing collaboration between units and subunits when conducting a peacekeeping operation. It is also proposed to rehearse questions of troop control during such operations, to work out unified sets of documents and views on operating tactics, and to enhance the subunits' readiness to operate as part of coalition peacekeeping forces in "hot spots." But the mass media and individual politicians have recently been fueling passions over the upcoming exercise. The polemic is undoubtedly being conducted by uninformed people, for the purpose of misleading public opinion. On 16 March 1994 PRAVDA published the article "Our Strategists Are Too Ingenuous" by Major General Viktor Chudov, retired. The article contains a number of gross distortions. In particular, it maintains that a full division on each side will be involved in the measure. The author casts doubt on the military-political advisability of the exercise and on the whole package of Russian-U.S. relations in the military sphere. The article attempts to link the upcoming exercise to a U.S. desire to introduce its own armed contingent onto Russian soil and to assimilate a new theater of military operations. The article's author distorted the scale and nature of the planned exercises. It is planned to conduct not a troop exercise but merely a command and staff exercise involving up to 250 people on each side and automotive equipment. The upcoming exercise is regarded as a real contribution by our countries to the preparation and conduct of peacemaking operations. The initiative for holding it came from the Ministry of Defense, and the presidents of Russia and the United States announced it back in September 1993. Several versions of a command and staff exercise were considered. The U.S. military proposed holding it on U.S. territory, but the U.S. side was unable to take on all the costs, including the transfer of hardware and personnel. Such expenditure was unacceptable to us. A proposal to hold the exercise on FRG territory -- the stationing location of the U.S. 3d Infantry Division -- did not meet with understanding on the German side. Therefore the territory of the Totskoye Range -- the stationing location of the 27th Guards' Motorized Rifle Division -- was chosen. This means minimal expenditure for our side -- approximately R100 million. The U.S. Congress is allocating $5 million just to transfer 69 units of automotive equipment and 250 personnel from Germany (city of Wuerzburg). The U.S. side is prepared to pay for the Russian side's work and services in preparing for the joint command and staff exercise -- equipping the checkpoint and the motor vehicle pool, refueling hardware, "damages" to the ecology, etc. -- in the sum of R0.5 billion. If the command and staff exercise were held on U.S. territory, our side's transport costs alone would increase by a factor of four or five times. If we were to abandon the holding of the joint exercise, as individual politicians demand, Russia would not fulfill its promises and would lose the confidence of the world public. And yet the exercises are the most humane and noble. On the basis of an analysis of the Totskoye exercise and of additional coordination, and given the adoption of political decisions, the next joint command and staff exercise or training session will take place on U.S. territory. Under conditions wherein the CIS states are pursuing a policy of strict neutrality, displaying no interest in resolving armed conflicts using their own forces, Russia remains the only state with the military and political potential to conduct operations to maintain and restore peace -- which it confirms by its practical activity. Russia's peacemaking role is a natural one. For decades the peoples of the former USSR lived as a single family, and a tight knot of interrelations was tied which had both achievements and problems. This was the result of joint efforts by all the peoples and ethnic groups of the USSR who had earlier linked their fate with Russia. It is now the latter's duty to do everything to ensure that the former members of one family are not at odds with each other. Russia has historically been a guarantor of other peoples' reconciliation and has always come to their assistance at a difficult time. In all conflict situations it has so far been perceived as a kinsman, not as a stranger. It is considerably simpler for it to get to the bottom of what is happening and to influence reconciliation. It directs its main effort into settling crisis situations in regions in direct proximity to its borders, since stability and peace on these territories are of vital importance to Russia and its citizens, 25 million of whom live in states in the near abroad. It was and still is the only force capable of fulfilling these tasks. Life itself suggests that no international organization or group of states will take the place of Russia's peacemaking efforts on the territory of the former USSR.
