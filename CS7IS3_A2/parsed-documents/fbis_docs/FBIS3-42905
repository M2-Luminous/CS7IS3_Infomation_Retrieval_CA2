Meanwhile, at present this is one of the most significant problems for commercial banks. We had to use the services of authors who are directly or indirectly wrapped up in the issue, and whose opinions we present today. It is a pity that the press service of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation does quite a poor job in assisting trade publications with the organization of interviews and other materials devoted to the operation of the banks. One gets the impression that the service was not organized to establish close relations with the press but, on the contrary, to isolate the press from interesting interlocutors from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. At times, it takes weeks or months to arrange a particular meeting. As a result, an issue of current interest takes care of itself: In our fast-paced times, topics become obsolete by the hour rather than by the day. On this score, the commercial banks of Moscow and other Russian cities differ favorably from the Central Bank. One is only left hoping that the situation here will change for the better. After all, it is in our common interest. Aleksandr Smolenskiy, president of the Stolichnyy Commercial Bank, is known as a consistent critic of Central Bank operations. It is up to the readers to judge how well his criticism is substantiated. [Talskaya] The year has ended. What did it amount to for the banking system of Russia? How did the commercial banks develop? How did the policy of the Central Bank influence their operations? [Smolenskiy] The Central Bank of Russia has not been emancipated from political activities, at any rate not before 31 December. It is carried away by such activities, as I see it--excessively. Besides, the Central Bank is overly emotional--there are leaps and bounds. So far, a Central Bank--such as the national bank of a mighty state, such as Russia, should be--has not been created yet. On one occasion, I was driving along Pyatnitskaya Street. There was a building without a sign, and a waiting line. I was curious what people could be lining up for now. It turned out that a financial company was accepting deposits from the population. Fantastic! Deposits of the population involve pure banking activities. The delineation should be strictly upheld. After all, it does not occur to me to bake pies or sew boots. It is the function of precisely the Central Bank to put an end to the attempts of impostors to engage in banking activities. In general, the entire Western banking ideology is built on the protection of individual depositors. In our country, the overall mentality of the state is such that private individuals so far mean nothing to it. The saddest part is that the Central Bank has still failed to lay a precise normative foundation regulating the operations of commercial banks. [Talskaya] Many bankers complain about this. Nonetheless, everyone appears to be alive.... [Smolenskiy] I would not be that categorical. According to my estimates, more than 50 banks are bankrupt and unable to honor their obligations (in the absence of proper auditing and review, we have to proceed solely from our knowledge of our "inner workings"). As a rule, they have unauthentic balances, which nobody is in a position to verify. [Talskaya] Effective in the New Year, commercial banks will switch to a Western accounts chart. May this partially resolve the issue of the authenticity of balance sheets? [Smolenskiy] This will not reverse the situation. That superfluous statistics will be removed from the balance sheets is the only improvement associated with the present innovation; however, balance sheets will still remain a dark jungle. It appears to me that the Central Bank should work on this issue very seriously. All bankers are interested in putting reports in order because at present we operate on the interbank market blindly. Our partners may provide us with a heap of documents; however, I will not be completely certain whether this bank exists in reality or only on paper. Meanwhile, a chain of bankruptcies will result from any mishap. If banks go under, we may close down the entire national economy. [Talskaya] At a press conference on the eve of the new year, Viktor Gerashchenko mentioned resolving the issue of the turnaround of payments as one of the definite accomplishments of the Central Bank last year. Do you agree with his opinion? [Smolenskiy] No. Funds travel for 72 hours within Moscow. This is very long. The volume of the Moscow Cash Clearing Center comes approximately to upwards of 1 trillion rubles [R]. For three days, this money sinks to the bottom and exists on paper and as bookkeeping entries. I also disagree with the view of the Central Bank that settlements should be effected by "his majesty's" office. I believe that this should be done by some unit established jointly with commercial banks. [Talskaya] During the entire year, there was talk about converting the Cash Clearing Center to joint-stock operations. [Smolenskiy] Unfortunately, it was just talk. I believe that settlement hubs should be converted to joint-stock operations, with the Central Bank holding the controlling share. [Talskaya] Throughout last year, the Central Bank kept postponing auctions to sell centralized resources. Many bankers believe that unequal access to these funds infringes on the rights of commercial banks. Are you one of them? [Smolenskiy] We have never used centralized resources and apparently will not use them, because the Central Bank restricts these funds in a number of ways, in particular, with regard to interbank credit. I do not need an extra headache because of R100 million-R150 million. Besides, centralized credit is earmarked for economically weak enterprises and organizations. As a rule, they are not in a position to pay back credit, because they hand out one-half of it as wages right away. So am I to sort this out with the workers? Or to buy this factory myself? Thank God, the auctions were not held. The plan was patently without promise. It appears to me that an arrangement on which the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank recently agreed is more acceptable: Contracts will be signed on behalf of the state directly with commercial banks, which will, in turn, service state programs. The Central Bank should not and will not engage in the distribution of centralized resources. It will extend credit to the state, and let the latter sort things out itself. This procedure will lighten the load of the Central Bank considerably. [Talskaya] Nonetheless, you are the first one from among my interlocutor-bankers who has no regrets about the auctions. [Smolenskiy] You see, the receipt of this kind of money corrupts the personnel. They stop using their heads. Why? The bosses will go to an auction and win everything. I think that the banks that do not want to do the homework themselves yearn for centralized resources. [Talskaya] How did an increase in the discount rate to 210 percent influence banking activities? [Smolenskiy] Ideally, it should have made credit resources contract. However, everything remained as it used to be. The people creaked, groaned, and calmed down. A profit margin of no less than 1,000 percent should be built in from the beginning in order to start some kind of enterprise at present. Ultimately, the interest on bank credit is paid by the consumer; it is included in the price. [Talskaya] An increase in the minimum size of statutory capital to R100 million has caused much talk in the banking community. Many of your colleagues believe that compliance by a bank with standards for proprietary and attracted funds is the main point in banking operations, rather than the volume of statutory capital as such. [Smolenskiy] I do not agree with them. What does R100 million amount to at present? It is $90,000. Meanwhile, according to the Basel international convention, the minimum statutory capital of a bank should be equivalent to $5 million. This number was not pulled out of a hat. Depositors must be sure that the bank is reliable. I believe that the plank of the minimum statutory capital of banks in Russia should be raised, and raised again. I am in favor of free competition among banks. However, as I see it, small, unreliable banks do nothing but discredit the banking system. What was possible in 1988, during the emergence of banks, is impermissible in 1993, to say nothing of 1994. You have mentioned standards. With a statutory capital of R100 million, a bank may have R2 billion in attracted funds. Given current prices, this is a whole lot of nothing! [Talskaya] Effective 1 January, foreign-exchange regulation will take effect in Russia. How would you comment on this event? [Smolenskiy] The national currency should be the only tender in the territory of a country. In our country, the ruble is such currency. Certainly, the decision of the Central Bank which discontinues the parallel circulation of currencies is correct. However, I am afraid that in this instance we will not do without excesses, either. I think that the citizens will not believe the promise that, at any moment, it will be possible to buy currency on the exchange, and that its exchange rate will change smoothly, without leaps and flip-flops. There have already been too many declarations that the state subsequently repudiated without batting an eye. [Talskaya] Let us assume that you have an opportunity to influence the development of the banking system in the country. Where would you begin? [Smolenskiy] Communications are the foremost point both for the national economy in general and banking operations in particular. If there are no communications, we will be done in. Information is now becoming more compact. The introduction of an electronic communications system would fundamentally change the ideology of interbank relations. Having automated the banking business, we would have pulled along the rest of the national economy. At present, close to R1.5 trillion "floats" somewhere around Russia in postal money orders every day. If we had normal communications, we could extend credit to someone in Vladivostok while Moscow is asleep. Except for us, the entire world makes money on time zone differences. I do not mean specifically our bank. We have found an opportunity to take advantage of time differences. I am not saying that the Central Bank should solve this problem alone. Commercial banks are prepared to help it. In the greater scheme of things, I believe that Gerashchenko lacks a team. For some reason, he is afraid of young people. The chairman of the Central Bank himself is an international banker, and all Russian "narrow" issues obviously annoy him. Apparently, the problems we are struggling to solve have long been solved in places where he has happened to work: One just plugs the computer into an outlet and begins to press buttons. At present, it is very important for us to have bankers on the team who could get a handle on the domestic Russian situation. Banking practitioners could work on it themselves, too. Unfortunately, the helping hand that we are holding out is not seen from the offices on Neglinnaya Street.
