Last week, 'Arafat spoke in a mosque in South Africa that "you have to come and launch jihad to liberate Jerusalem, your third shrine." Under pressure from Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, 'Arafat clarified his statement Wednesday at a press conference in Oslo by saying that he meant "peaceful jihad." 'Arafat promised to crusade for peace and reassured Israel that he had urged Moslems to wage a holy war for Jerusalem only in a religious sense. However, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin did not accept 'Arafat's such clarification Wednesday, saying it was "far-fetched." Rabin said here that 'Arafat's call for jihad was making the peace process with the Palestinians more difficult and would continue to do so in the future. Both 'Arafat and Peres attended a ceremony organized by the Atlanta-based Jimmy Carter Center honoring Norway's contribution to the Middle East peace process. After hearing 'Arafat's clarification, Peres said that "this was the minimum that I expected to hear, the situation was not simple. This is what was needed, or else, I would not have come." Earlier, Peres boycotted a lunch with 'Arafat, saying he would not attend a joint event until 'Arafat issued a clarifying statement. On Tuesday, Rabin said that the future of the peace process will come into question unless 'Arafat clarifies his call for jihad. If this statement is repeated, Rabin said, "this would be a clear violation of a basic element of the continuation of the process." "Therefore, we will ask for a clarification, and there is no doubt in my mind, Israel will not be able to accept such a violation and to continue the process between the PLO and us," he said. Under the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on September 13, 1993, the issue of the status of Jerusalem will be resolved by political means and will be discussed in 1996. Meanwhile, the opposition Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Rabin's reaction to 'Arafat's call for jihad was "totally unsatisfactory." "'Arafat has revealed just how much it is Gaza and Jericho first, with all of the other (occupied) territories and Jerusalem slated to follow," he said. A peace deal has just been signed, and now 'Arafat is declaring a holy war to liberate Jerusalem, he said. Netanyahu urged Rabin to "do more than just pay weak lip service," adding that "he must shut down the PLO offices in East Jerusalem and prevent Faysal al-Husayni and Sari Nusaybah from serving on PLO negotiating teams and in the autonomy institutions." The National Religious Party, which also opposes the peace process, said that "by giving up Jericho, the government has made Jerusalem and its vicinity all the more vulnerable to 'Arafat and his bands of terrorists, no matter what cover name they use." It is reported that the Knesset, the Israeli parliament, will hold a number of debates in the next few days on 'Arafat's call for jihad. Israel occupied East Jerusalem in 1967 and has declared a united Jerusalem as its eternal and undivided capital. But the Palestinians have been claiming that East Jerusalem is part of the occupied territories and should be returned to the Palestinians in accordance with UN resolutions which call on Israel to return all the occupied territories to Arabs. So far, Israel has completed its army withdrawal from Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Peres and 'Arafat had agreed in Oslo on the principles on widening authority of autonomy to the other parts of the West Bank.
