Chinese sources said that, while it was unlikely Mr Zhao would return to the political scene in an official capacity, his role as a potential kingmaker had become apparent as the health of patriarch Deng Xiaoping remained precarious. The sources said Mr Zhao arrived in the provincial capital of Chengdu before the Lunar New Year, and that he would be returning to Beijing later this month. They said while the former party general secretary enjoyed "generally good health", he suffered from an unspecified lung ailment and had spent some time at a sanatorium in Chengdu. Mr Zhao's wife, Liang Boqi, who had treatment in a Beijing hospital late last year for a heart problem, is also believed to be resting in the same sanatorium. An informed source in Sichuan said Mr Zhao continued to pay attention to economic and political reform in the country, but he was not in a good mood. "Mr Zhao is worried about the pervasiveness of corruption, and the fear that it may get worse," the source said. "He hinted the present leadership had not acquitted itself well in curtailing graft saying he had done more to stop corruption during his tenure as premier and party chief." Moreover, the source added, almost five years after his fall from grace, Mr Zhao was still complaining about mistreatment. "I was accused of liberalisation on the economic front, but the leadership has been doing things that I would not have dared do," he reportedly said. China analysts said it was significant that Mr Zhao, who had been under virtual house arrest, had been allowed to go to Sichuan where he was party boss from 1975 to 1980. Last year, the leader of the party's liberal wing was permitted to pay visits to Guangxi, Hunan and Jilin provinces but not to Guangdong, where he had also been party secretary. It is understood the administration is nervous about Mr Zhao travelling out of Beijing particularly in light of the enthusiastic reception accorded the former leader last year. Although Mr Zhao's status was that of an ordinary party member, he was met in each of the three provinces by the top party leaders. Western diplomats said Mr Zhao's former associates had become more active since news about Mr Deng's failing health filtered out late last year. These associates included former state president Yang Shangkun and former head of the National People's Congress, Wan Li. Mr Wan, who together with Mr Zhao spearheaded agrarian reform in the late 1970s, was considered particularly close to the former party chief. In the past few months Mr Deng has told his intimates that Mr Wan should play a major role in ensuring a smooth political transition after his death. Sources in Beijing said Mr Zhao, who lives in a guarded compound in the heart of the capital, had been allowed to see more visitors since late last year. The latter included his former associates as well as many influential children of senior cadres.
