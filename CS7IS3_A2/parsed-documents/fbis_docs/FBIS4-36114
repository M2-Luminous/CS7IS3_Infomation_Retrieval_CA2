Others said this will happen after a month. What is your opinion? [Salih] The Security Council resolutions do not close Iraq's borders with neighboring states. The embargo targets our oil exports. Iraqi merchants import foodstuffs from Turkey with hard currency. As for barter, it is currently not allowed. ['Abd-al-Majid] Iraq depends heavily on the Jordanian outlet in providing some of its food requirements. What is your assessment of the relationship between the two countries? [Salih] The relationship between Jordan and Iraq is firm and is advancing steadily in the interest of the two peoples. I think there are huge prospects for expanding this relationship once the economic blockade is lifted. This is because the links and integration are there between the two economies. Lifting the blockade will allow for further expansion of ties. ['Abd-al-Majid] Jordan has expressed dissatisfaction with the inspection of al-'Aqabah-bound commercial vessels and said this is doing great economic harm to the country. Does this inspection have any negative impact on the Iraq's food imports? [Salih] We have paid extra charges. Also, the high insurance rates imposed on some vessels and the smaller load they carry are additional obstacles. ['Abd-al-Majid] What is the effect of activating Iraqi ports in the south on trade activity? [Salih] First of all, there are no restrictions on exports to Iraq via the ports of Umm Qasr, Khawr al-Zubayr, and al-Basrah. Our ports are open to receive vessels if they wish to come. Also, we have other ships laden with food supplies from Europe, Australia, and southeast Asia. These use the waterway from and to al-Basrah because there are no international restrictions on it. ['Abd-al-Majid] What about the Iraqi assets frozen in foreign banks? [Salih] The United States and its allies are still practicing piracy against Iraqi assets and preventing us from using these assets to buy food and medical supplies, contrary to what the Security Council has allowed under Resolution 687. This behavior has denied Iraq a chance to provide some of the needs of the population. Iraq had managed, under the instructions of the Security Council Embargo Committee, to purchase $250,000 worth of supplies before its assets were frozen again in September 1992. These food supplies were distributed by the ration card. We denounce the decision to prevent us from using our own frozen assets abroad and deem it an evil decision that reflects the disregard of the nations that control the Security Council for the norms and charters and previous resolutions issued by the Council. [ 'Abd-al-Majid] There are some Arab states that have not released the assets they have. [Salih] There is an Arab siege imposed by the rulers who are linked with the U.S. anti-Iraq policy. I am sure that Iraq enjoys very wide popular support in the Arab world. We find it strange for foreign countries to release our assets when some Arab governments impose a siege on us. Switzerland released all of our assets in 1991-1992, which amount to almost $125 million; Italy also released a limited part of our assets amounting to $6 million; Austria did the same thing and released around $30 million; Canada, $3 million; Spain, around $20 million; Greece, $13 million. So why don't the Arab countries release our assets to enable us to buy food and medicine? ['Abd-al-Majid] What effect will President Saddam Husayn's chairmanship of the Cabinet -- after the recent Cabinet reshuffle -- have on the activity of the Trade Ministry? [Salih] President Saddam Husayn's contacts with our Ministry have never stopped. He has always supervised its activities, especially with regard to providing food. He has given this question great importance. The state has been used to his strong, decisive administration, which was a direct reason for the progress and development achieved by the country. His excellency's supervision of the Cabinet will energize the ministries and give them momentum to expand their activities. The Cabinet is in dire need of such administration under the circumstances of the blockade, which has lasted for four years. ['Abd-al-Majid] The Iraqi family depends on the ration card to get its basic needs. Are you planning to increase the items listed in this card to alleviate the citizens' suffering under the embargo? [Salih] On 1 June this year, President Saddam Husayn decided to increase the vegetable oil quota for ration card holders and civil servants shopping at the Trade Ministry markets. Every family of six members will accordingly get 300-500 dinars in aid. ['Abd-al-Majid] Have other states asked to be acquainted with the ration card system, which was previously considered by several organizations an effective system to prevent famine? I mean have they tried to benefit from your experience in applying this system? [Salih] This system has been assessed on the international level. The ration card was considered the best method to distribute food in the world. There is no doubt that every country has its own experience in encountering states of emergency. President Saddam Husayn ordered that this system be adopted during the first week of the economic blockade on our country. We prepared the card within two weeks and it was applied on 1 September 1990, that is, 28 days after the start of the embargo. ['Abd-al-Majid] What is your assessment of the Iraqi market following the recent cabinet reshuffle? [Salih] It led to a noticeable decline in the price of the dollar and foodstuffs. There is optimism that the market situation will improve. ['Abd-al-Majid] Will the prices of foodstuffs drop in the future? [Salih] What is important is that we have reaped excellent results from leader Saddam Husayn's management of the executive authority. This has positively reflected on the market by reducing the prices of foodstuffs and the dollar exchange rate. Measures have been taken to improve the situation. I think that the Revolution Command Council decree to grant the party organization and people's assemblies executive jurisdictions to monitor the market was a very important new step toward expanding the base of popular control of the economic activities and promoting local control of market activities. ['Abd-al-Majid] How many ships dock at al-Basrah ports with food consignments every month? [Salih] We usually announce the arrival of ships. However, I think an average of four arrive every month. The importance of this maritime activity is that Iraq has been directly linked to the world. This has also reduced the cost of transportation, especially with regard to our imports from southeast Asia. ['Abd-al-Majid] In the light of some signals, can you tell us when the economic embargo will be lifted? [Salih] As President Saddam Husayn has said, the embargo will be lifted when the wicked ones feel they are unable to undermine the people's steadfastness and their national independent will. Through our steadfastness and willpower, we proved that the embargo will certainly be lifted and that its continuation is not in the interest of the United States or others. Their aims will not be achieved under the embargo and great harm has been inflicted on their companies and products. During the past four years, Iraq could have bought all sorts of commodities and paid foreign firms not less than $60 billion. Iraq's annual oil revenues of $16 billion used to be spent. This means the world economy has lost opportunities to invest $60 billion to expand the volume of exports and production and reduce unemployment. The big powers also lost the Iraqi market. The world realizes that the tighter the embargo gets, the firmer the Iraqis become. As much as $100 billion could have gone to foreign firms in the reconstruction drive after the military aggression. Iraq has embarked on an effective effort to expand its reliance on itself in the fields of agriculture and industry in order to achieve self-satisfaction. This explains its ability to confront the economic embargo.
