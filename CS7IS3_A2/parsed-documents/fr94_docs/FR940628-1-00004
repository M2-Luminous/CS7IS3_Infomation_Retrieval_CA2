FR940628-1-00004 FR940628-1-00001 The only references to task forces in the current regulations are in §§82.1 and 82.3 (a) and (b). Current §82.1 contains definitions of Director of the Task Force and Task Force . Current §82.1 also contains, in the definition of infected group , a requirement that the Director of the Task Force determine whether a flock or group of birds or poultry is infected with END. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of current §82.3 provide that the Director of the Task Force may determine: (1) Whether birds, poultry, and premises are infected with END; and (2) whether diagnostic tests are necessary to determine if the birds or poultry are infected. We propose to delete the definition of infected group from current §82.1 and, because APHIS conducts its END program under a memorandum of understanding with the States, to provide in proposed §82.2 that whether birds or poultry are infected with or exposed to END must be determined by either a Federal or a State veterinarian, rather than by the Director of the Task Force. Basis for Determining Infection With END In §82.1 of the current regulations, the definition of infected group describes the methods that may be used to determine whether a flock or group of birds or poultry is infected with END. Footnotes to that definition describe these methods of determination in greater detail. In this document, we are proposing to delete the definition of infected group , to include the basis for determining whether birds or poultry are infected with END in proposed §82.2, and to describe more specifically the factors that will be considered in making that determination. We are proposing that the determination whether birds or poultry are infected with END would be based on one or more of the following factors: clinical evidence (signs, post-mortem lesions, and history of the occurrence of END); diagnostic tests; or epidemiological evidence (evaluation of clinical evidence and the degree of risk posed by the potential spread of END based on population and exposure factors, including evaluation of whether the birds and poultry have had the opportunity to be in contact with birds or poultry infected with END or with excrement from birds or poultry infected with END, or if they have shared feed or water with birds or poultry infected with END). Basis for Determining Exposure to END Under the current and the proposed regulations, birds and poultry determined to be exposed to END, and certain articles related to those birds and poultry, are subject to certain prohibitions and restrictions regarding their interstate movement. We are proposing to set forth in proposed §82.2 more specific factors for determining exposure to END than those set forth in the definition of exposed group in §82.1 of the current regulations. The determination of whether birds and poultry are exposed to END would be made by either a Federal or a State veterinarian and would be based on an evaluation of all related circumstances, including: the proximity of the birds or poultry to birds or poultry infected with END, to excrement from birds or poultry infected with END, and to other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END; the number of birds or poultry infected with END to which the birds or poultry were exposed; the species involved; the virulence of the END to which the birds and poultry were exposed; and the length of time the birds or poultry were in contact with birds or poultry infected with END, and to material touched by birds and poultry infected with END. Birds or poultry determined to be exposed to END would continue to be treated as exposed unless they are subsequently determined to be infected with END or until either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian finds them to be free of END, based on the factors used to determine that birds or poultry are infected with END. We are also proposing to include in §82.1 a definition of exposed that would read as follows: At risk of developing END because of association with birds or poultry infected with END, excrement from birds or poultry infected with END, or other material touched by birds or poultry infected with END, or because there is reason to believe that association has occurred with END or with vectors of END, as determined by either a Federal veterinarian or a State veterinarian. Quarantines In current §82.3, we refer to the quarantining of ``premises'' containing birds and poultry that are infected with or have been exposed to END. However, elsewhere in the regulations, we refer to quarantined ``areas'' rather than premises. We believe this discrepancy in terms is confusing. The intent of the quarantine provisions in the current regulations is that areas to be quarantined may include premises, but are not limited to specific premises. In this proposed rule, we would clarify our intent by referring to quarantined areas, rather than quarantined premises. Also, rather than providing that premises where either infected or exposed birds or poultry exist will be quarantined, as in the current regulations, we are proposing to provide that any area where birds or poultry infected with END are located will be quarantined. We would delineate these areas in such a way that they would be sufficient, as determined by epidemiological evaluation, to include all known infected and exposed birds. Under §82.3 (a)(2) and (b)(3) of the current regulations, there are certain requirements that must be met before we will remove a quarantine. If we have quarantined premises because of infected birds and poultry, one of the requirements for removal of the quarantine is the destruction of all the birds and poultry on the premises where the infected birds or poultry are located. However, if we have quarantined premises because of the presence of exposed birds and poultry, the exposed birds and poultry do not have to be destroyed. Under §82.14 of the proposed regulations, all birds and poultry in an area quarantined because of the presence of birds or poultry infected with END would not have to be destroyed_rather, only those birds and poultry determined to be infected with END. Improved testing technology now makes it easier to determine which birds or poultry in a quarantined area are actually infected with END. Therefore, the total number of birds and poultry that would have to be destroyed could be lower than under the current regulations. Interstate Movement of Various Articles Both the current regulations (§82.4) and the proposed regulations (§§82.4 through 82.10) restrict the interstate movement of various articles, including birds and poultry, that could carry and spread the END virus. We are proposing not only to reorganize and rewrite this material to make it clearer and easier to follow, but we are also proposing to make substantive changes in the restrictions.
