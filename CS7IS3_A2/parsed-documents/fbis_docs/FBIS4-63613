I would like to thank you for appearing on our interview program. In general elections held last December, the Liberal Democracy Party [LDP] led by you won many seats, triggering a big sensation around the world. How has Russia changed since the LDP was formed? [Zhirinovskiy] Russia has not changed at all since our party has not been in control of the government. The LDP's advances in the Duma at the end of the general elections means the emergence of a patriotic party there. Our party has worked to release all political prisoners by seeking amnesty for them. Our party is working to improve the economy. At present, our party is working to overcome difficulties facing our nation's economy by helping the government. At the same time, our party is demanding the replacement of some cabinet members. Specifically, our party is demanding the replacement of six cabinet members. Mr. Shakhray, one of the six cabinet members, has already quit the cabinet. Mr. Kozyrev, whom the Japanese like, will soon resign as foreign minister. I believe that a new government will be inaugurated in the fall. In this way, our party has been influencing Russia's domestic and foreign policies. Needless to say, our party is directly influencing the president. [Tahara] In search of a political truce, President Yeltsin concluded a national consensus accord with other political parties on 28 April. We at first thought that the LDP would reject the president's offer. At present, the Russian Communist Party and other parties rejected the president's offer. But your party signed the accord. Why did your party sign that accord? [Zhirinovskiy] The truth is just the opposite. Our party will continue to fight President Yeltsin. Our party has never stopped the fight even one day. If our party takes a hard-line stance on the president, the president would challenge our party. Our party intends to seize power by merely exposing the president's faults. Our party plans to become the largest party after giving the president a chance to step down. [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you are making very soft comments today. According to the results of recent polls conducted by Russian newspapers, the popularity rating of you and your party is falling. What is your opinion? [Zhirinovskiy] Poll results are faked. The influence of me and my party is growing across the nation. If a correspondent from your TV station visits a Russian town with me, he would instantly see this. I plan to visit a town in Moscow next Sunday. If the correspondent from your station visits the town with me, he would find how much influence I have. Russian TV and newspaper reports are 90 percent false. You would see this if you recall what the Russian media reported before and after the 12 December general elections. I know that the best party is mine. You are speaking based on false figures and information. To be honest, the most powerful party in Russia is the LDP. As a politician, I am in a leading position. In Russia, no politician can stand shoulder to shoulder with me. Therefore, Russian politicians fear and slander the LDP. Japan also is slandering our party. [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you visited such European nations as France and Poland. During your stay in those nations, you made radical and nationalistic statements. You were expelled from Bulgaria and Slovenia for such statements. Why did you make such radical statements? [Zhirinovskiy] I have never intended to worsen Russia's relations with other nations. The Bulgarian Government probably did not like me, but thousands of Bulgarians welcomed me, throwing flowers at me and kissing my hands. What is important to me was the Bulgarian people. To speak of Poland, I had no problem in Poland. The Polish people warmly greeted me. Many nations have invited me to visit. It is true that I have caused troubles. The LDP is a new party. I think that some nations still do not understand what sort of policies the LDP pursues and what sort of party it is. It is true that an international organization is moving to block the LDP from expanding its influence at home and abroad. I do not like to cause trouble. [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you satisfied with Russia's current borderlines with other nations? Or are you thinking of further expanding Russia's current borders? [Zhirinovskiy] The Soviet Union's former borderlines must be Russia's borderlines. Our party holds this idea. I think that Russia needs to change its borderlines to strengthen its security. There is no problem with Russia's borderlines in the Far East. There also is no problem with Russia's borderlines to the north, but there is a problem with Russia's borderlines to the west. The problem with Russia's borders in the west can be resolved in an economic way. The three Baltic nations, Byelarus, and Ukraine will return to Russia sometime in the future. To the south, however, war is raging in the Caucasus and Central Asia. Islamic forces cannot be taken lightly and the interests of major nations are intertwined in the region. We need to draw new borderlines in this region to keep the region from posing any threat to Russia. [Tahara] Looking at President Yeltsin's foreign policy, it is said that he has usurped Zhirinovskiy's policy of pursuing a superpower. What is your opinion? [Zhirinovskiy] I and President Yeltsin have many areas of agreement. I am now on good terms with him. I believe that the time will come when the president will dismiss cabinet members our party opposes and our party's platform will become Russia's platform. [Tahara] Are you joking? [Zhirinovskiy] No, I am not joking because the Russian Government has been changing its domestic and foreign policies little by little. [Tahara] Who do you think you will succeed President Yeltsin? [Zhirinovskiy] I intend to run in the presidential election if and when it is held. There is no other candidate to compete with President Yeltsin in the election. All other Russian politicians are weak and cowardly. The presidential election can be sooner if Mr. Yeltsin wants to hold it sooner. If Mr. Yeltsin does not hope to advance the presidential election, it will be held 12 June 1996. A new president will be chosen in the election. I assume that the presidential elections could be held earlier. [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, how are you going to deal with Japan? What do you think of Japan? [Zhirinovskiy] I think we can build up a special relationship with Japan. Although Japan is an advanced nation, it is in need of raw materials. Russia has abundant raw materials. Also, Japan is seeking a positive solution to the northern territorial dispute between the two countries. But you cannot expect the settlement of this dispute if Japan negotiates with the Communist Party or reformists. [Tahara] What do you think of the northern territorial issue? [Zhirinovskiy] Whomever we negotiate with, we will give nothing. But there is an option that will satisfy Japan. I myself have explained this option several times to Japanese people, including the Japanese news media. We will never give away the islands for nothing. But if Japan shows its understanding about Russia's plan to draw new boundaries in the Mediterranean and the Indian Sea, where war is currently being waged, I think we can offer a reasonable and well-balanced solution that will satisfy Japan. We have a problem in the south. We need new boundaries in areas south of Russia, including the Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. If Japan takes sides with us or adopts a neutral position on this issue, we will be able to pay more attention to the northern territorial dispute. If Russia acquires new territories in the south with Japan's help, no one in Russia will oppose the Kremlin's proposal that the northern territorial issue be settled on favorable terms to Japan. In this case, we can protect the two nations' interests. Russia can protect its interests in the Mediterranean, while Japan can protect its interests in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Pacific Ocean. [Tahara] Do you mean that depending on terms, Russia might possibly return the northern territories to Japan? [Zhirinovskiy] I cannot answer your question because what we discuss here will be heard by millions of people and people in other countries. Negotiations on this matter should be made in a place where secrecy can be maintained. This is not a matter to be discussed on a TV program. We should discuss this issue in a place where secrecy can be maintained and while looking at maps. Reviewing historical facts, each side should submit their options for the solution. We will then discuss the options' good points. This should satisfy Japan. By the way, I am planning to visit Pyongyang in August this year. It is not far from Pyongyang to Japan. So, how about my visiting Tokyo at that time and discussing in detail this issue? I do not want to fly to the Far East twice. As you know, it takes nine hours by plane. Let us discuss it at a different place. I do not mind discussing it at the Defense Agency or the Foreign Ministry or at a government special service agency. [Tahara] Let me confirm what you have just said. You want to visit Japan and you are asking me to make arrangements for the visit. Am I right? [Zhirinovskiy] I can visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 10 August to show that I am pro-Japanese. I think the United States' atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a cruel criminal act. I think it is not so bad for the Japanese to hear the leader of the largest party in Russia calling for solidarity between the two nations.
