"I have already answered (on the loan problem) wholeheartedly. (but) if the House of Representatives Budget Committee is held, (I) will speak about what I can tell," Hosokawa said. The LDP has refused to open budget deliberations unless Hosokawa produces proof to support his claim that he returned the 100 million yen he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co. Hosokawa, who spoke to reporters at his official residence, however, rejected an opposition demand to submit further documents related to his loan from Sagawa in 1982. The premier also turned down another opposition demand that the Diet summon his former secretaries to clear up the loan problem. "We must be careful not to set a precedent for calling up private (sector) people (to the Diet)," he said. Hosokawa has insisted that he borrowed the money to repair his home in Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in Tokyo, and that he fully repaid the money nine years later. The parcel delivery firm was involved in a money-and-mob scandal which forced former LDP kingpin Shin Kanemaru to resign in disgrace in 1992. Hosokawa also brushed aside the LDP's reported intensifying attempt to bring down the government, saying it is a matter of the LDP's interparty affairs.
