FR941216-0-00002 FR941216-0-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Parts 213 and 338 RIN 3206&hyph;AG00 Student Educational Employment Program AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is revising its regulations and consolidating existing Federal student employment programs into a new Student Educational Employment Program, a streamlined, flexible program that provides students with exposure to public service and enhances their educational experience, provides financial assistance to students to encourage and support their educational goals, encourages partnerships between Federal agencies and educational institutions in developing effective school to work programs, and assists agencies to attract and recruit well educated graduates into their workforce. The Student Educational Employment Program will replace complex regulatory guidance and 13 different appointing authorities with two appointing authorities and two simple, flexible programs. This reduction in the number of appointing authorities and the simplifying of program requirements is in full accord with the National Performance Review. DATES: Effective date : December 16, 1994. Compliance date: For all new appointments, compliance date is December 16, 1994. All students on any of the appointments being canceled by this regulation, must be converted to the new, appropriate appointment by February 14, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ellie Miller, Staffing Reinvention Office, (202) 606&hyph;0830, or FAX (202) 606&hyph;2329. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On May 13, 1994 (59 FR 24966), OPM published proposed regulations to consolidate the existing student employment programs into one streamlined program, entitled the Student Educational Employment Program. The two components of the Student Educational Employment Program recognize two distinct needs of students: a need for flexible, temporary employment to enable them to earn a salary while continuing their studies (Student Temporary Employment Program) and a need for career related employment which enriches students' academic experience and offers them valuable work experience in their career field. (Student Career Experience Program). This new program would replace the following: •Schedule A authority §213.3102(p), graduate students in scientific, professional or analytical positions; •Schedule A authority §213.3102(q), students in scientific, professional and technical positions, GS&hyph;9 and below; •Schedule A authority §213.3102(v), temporary summer aid; •Schedule A authority §213.3102(w), stay-in-school program; •Schedule A authority §213.3102(y), summer employment; •Schedule A authority §213.3102(jj), legal intern positions; •Schedule B authority §213.3202 (a) through (c), (e) and (g), cooperative education program; •Schedule B authority §213.3202(d), Harry S. Truman Foundation Scholarship Program; and •Schedule B authority §213.3202(f), Federal Junior Fellowship Program. Two new Schedule B appointing authorities were proposed which would replace all of the above listed appointing authorities. In addition to publication in the Federal Register, the proposed regulations were also mailed to all Federal agencies, constituency groups involved in student employment, and colleges that requested them. The proposed changes were also announced at the Federal Cooperative Education Conference and made available to all subscribers to OPM's Electronic Bulletin Board, Mainstreet. OPM received written comments from 10 executive level Federal agencies, and 11 independent agencies. We also received comments from two constituency groups, six colleges and one anonymous letter. A discussion of the comments follows: Title of Program and Use of Term ``Work Study'' The proposed regulations referred to the career related component of the program as the ``work study'' component. Commenters reminded OPM that an existing and well established financial aid program already exists under that name and that using ``work study'' in this context would create confusion. OPM agrees and the term ``work study'' will not be used. In the final regulations we use the term ``Student Career Experience Program' in lieu of ``work study.'' Change in Definition of Student
