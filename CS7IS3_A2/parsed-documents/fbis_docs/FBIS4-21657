Kuntsevich found out about this edict, or rather his staff did, through an NTV television report. You will recall that Kuntsevich led the committee for destroying chemical weapons [CW] and his name was mentioned in connection with the Vil Mirzoyanov case. The recently freed scientist himself, and his colleague Lev Fedorov -- who had revealed departmental secrets of the military-chemical lobby -- talk of Kuntsevich as being one of their main opponents.
