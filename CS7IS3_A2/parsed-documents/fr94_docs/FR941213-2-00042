Review Criteria The HRSA will review applications based on an analysis of the following factors: (1) The degree to which the proposed project provides for the project requirements; (2) The administrative and management capability of the applicant to carry out the proposed project in a cost effective manner; (3) The degree to which the proposed training program emphasizes training in podiatric primary care settings; and (4) The potential of the project to continue on a self sustaining basis. Other Considerations In addition, the following funding factors may be applied in determining funding of approved applications. A funding preference is defined as the funding of a specific category or group of approved applications ahead of other categories or groups of approved applications. It is not required that applicants request consideration for a funding factor. Applications which do not request consideration for funding factors will be reviewed and given full consideration for funding. General Statutory Funding Preference As provided in section 791(a) of the PHS Act, preference will be given to qualified applicants that: (1) have a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or (2) have achieved, during the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile of proposals recommended for approval by the peer review group. ``High rate'' is defined as a minimum of 25 percent of the combined Podiatric Primary Care Residency graduates in academic years 1991&hyph;92, 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, who spend at least 50 percent of their worktime in clinical practice in medically underserved communities. ``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1992&hyph;93 and 1993&hyph;94, the rate of placing graduates in medically underserved communities has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of graduates from the most recent year are working in medically underserved communities. Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the Federal Register at 59 FR 15743, dated April 4, 1994. Program Specific Statutory Funding Preference Under section 751(b) of title VII, preference will be given to qualified applicants that ``provide clinical training in podiatric medicine in a variety of medically underserved communities.'' Information Requirements Provision Under section 791(b) of the Act, the Secretary may make an award under the Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Programs only if the applicant for the award submits to the Secretary the following information: 1. A description of rotations of preceptorships for students, or clinical training programs for residents, that have the principal focus of providing health care to medically underserved communities. 2. The number of faculty on admissions committees who have a clinical practice in community-based ambulatory settings in medically underserved communities. 3. With respect to individuals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds or from medically underserved communities, the number of such individuals who are recruited for academic programs of the applicant, the number of such individuals who are admitted to such programs, and the number of such individuals who graduate from such programs. 4. If applicable, the number of recent graduates who have chosen careers in primary health care.
