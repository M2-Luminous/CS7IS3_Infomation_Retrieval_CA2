We have not had that before. So what does it mean? [Plawnicki] I have always believed that GAZETA ROBOTNICZA is a trustworthy and credible newspaper that does not yield easily to fashion or public mood shifts. But you seem to want to make me change this opinion. [Marnic] Not at all. [Plawnicki] So why do you use terms that are surely closer to the outlook taken by GAZETA POLSKA rather than GAZETA ROBOTNICZA? After all, to define the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] as postcommunist is to engage in a blatant falsehood. In addition, our alliance involves mostly Social Democracy of the Polish Republic [SdRP]. Let us then move away from using derogatory terms--although there are some who will not like the idea of an accord between Christians and Social Democrats--and toward specific facts. On 7 March, we signed an interparty agreement between the Wroclaw SdRP office and our division of the Christian Social Union [UChS] here. Similar agreements were also signed in Lodz and Bialystok. [Marnic] What are the provisions of these agreements? [Plawnicki] As regards organizational issues, they will involve mutual contacts, exchange of information, and support. As far as practical operations are concerned, we intend to give support to each other's candidates in the forthcoming local self-government elections. [Marnic] Does this mean that the UChS will enter the structure of the Democratic Left Alliance? [Plawnicki] It does. The present left-wing group is different from the previous one in that it is not oriented toward orthodoxy. This change in its nature enables us to find a place for ourselves within the SLD. This is because, fortunately, the left-wing camp is made up of people with a fairly wide spectrum of political outlooks who are brought together by their propublic interest orientation. [Marnic] I understand that the UChS will take advantage of relying on the highly organized SLD structures, but how will the Left benefit in its turn? [Plawnicki] It will expand its sphere of influence to include a whole range of people associated with the UChS. You cannot fail to notice that even Pope John Paul II spoke of the grain of good present in the system of real socialism. We do not engage in wholesale condemnations of everything and anything whose roots reach back to the Polish People's Republic. We also have a group of people who enjoy a high degree of authority in the eyes of the public. They can turn out to meet the needs of our society. [Marnic] I understand that you are referring to the forthcoming local self-government elections? [Plawnicki] We will run in them within the SLD bloc. We intend to nominate four candidates in Wroclaw and one each in Trzebnica, Olesnica, and Olawa. Our candidates will be such people as Jerzy Janoszka, chairman of the Well-Wishers' Club, and Tadeusz Pluzinski, director of the Value Energy Fund. [Marnic] Under what election slogans will they fight for their nominations? [Plawnicki] Tolerance, respect for differences, and antinationalism. We want to fashion a climate of tolerance and acceptance of people who have different views, backgrounds, or traditions. Our fundamental motto is respect for every human person. [Marnic] And what will your candidates oppose? [Plawnicki] They will stand against the misuse of Christian ideas for the purpose of sowing hatred and xenophobia, and against selective interpretation of the Holy Father's words. Christianity entails the concept of serving others, not fighting them. Our candidates want to make use of their talents to serve society, and the choice of the SLD as allies is a natural consequence of the fact that, of all political groups, it was the SLD whose program is most society-oriented. [Marnic] Thank you for talking with us.
