Located on the Bohai Sea, Tianjin is effectively cooperating with Beijing city, Shanxi, Hebei, Heilongjiang and Shandong Provinces as well as with Yunnan, Guangxi and Xinjiang in the remote areas. Statistics show that a total of 11,420 cooperative projects were signed last year, attracting capital of 967 million yuan from other areas. Officials said that regional cooperation, which began in recent years, has effectively helped local economic growth. Various organizations to promote regional cooperation were established and expanded. The association of mayors of cities around the Bohai Sea, for instance, now has 17 member cities. The Tianjin Municipal Government has set up representative offices in a number of other provinces. At present, the city is cooperating with the coal-rich Shanxi Province in the development of coal, transportation and raw materials industries. The cooperation projects with Qinghuangdao city in Hebei Province not far from Tianjin have come to some 50, involving a total investment of 38.70 million yuan. Local products including cloth shoes, carpets and tableware are exported via Tianjin port. The city has also opened many specialized markets for such products as petrochemical materials, textile raw materials and automobile industrial products. In addition, a major market network is taking shape, covering capital, technology, labor and information services. By the end of 1993, the number of capital goods markets totalled 28, attracting many large industrial and commercial ventures all over China. The transaction volume topped 20 billion yuan last year, according to figures from the Tianjin Municipal Government. A few large trans-regional joint ventures were also established. Some Tianjin factories with quite advanced technical levels, especially in such fields as chemicals, electronics, machinery, textiles and automobiles, have begun offering machinery for processing strawberries, wild apples and other local produce to North-west China. The Tianjin Welding Electrode Company, for instance, has set up 25 joint ventures in eight provinces and autonomous regions. In Xinjiang alone the joint ventures achieved a net profit of 7 million yuan last year. Officials said that Tianjin has now established many raw materials bases in other parts of China. Tianjin also offered technical and other forms of help to many poor areas. It has arranged 33 projects of technology transfer, personnel training and commodity exchange with localities around the Three Gorges areas in Central China. In addition, it has signed more than 600 technical and economic cooperation projects with North-west China's Gansu Province, benefiting both parties.
