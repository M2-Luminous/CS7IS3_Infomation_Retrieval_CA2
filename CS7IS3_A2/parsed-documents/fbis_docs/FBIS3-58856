"A lot must still be done" in that area, he said. On Monday Qian is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next June. Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks "a new departure" in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of a year-long rift over French arms sales to Taiwan. He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which Beijing is a permanent member. Qian's three-day official visit was scheduled after Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan.
