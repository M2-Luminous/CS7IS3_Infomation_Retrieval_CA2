FR941213-2-00022 FR941213-2-00014 Bonneville Power Administration Notice of Wetlands Involvement for the Amazon/Willow Creek Project AGENCY: Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice of wetlands involvement. SUMMARY: This notice announces BPA's proposal to develop a management plan for the Willow Creek Wildlife Mitigation Project that would include wetland habitat enhancement. The project is located in Lane County, Oregon. In accordance with DOE regulations for compliance with floodplain and wetlands environmental review requirements (10 CFR Part 1022), BPA will prepare a wetland assessment and will perform this proposed action in a manner that will avoid or minimize adverse impacts to the wetland. The assessment will be included in the environmental assessment being prepared for the proposed project in accordance with the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. DATES: Comments are due to the address below no later than January 16, 1995. ADDRESSES: Submit comments to the Public Involvement Manager, Bonneville Power Administration_CKP, P.O. Box 12999, Portland, Oregon 97212. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nancy Weintraub_ECN&hyph;6, Bonneville Power Administration, P.O. Box 3621, Portland, Oregon 97208&hyph;3621, phone number 503&hyph;230&hyph;5373, fax number 503&hyph;230&hyph;5211. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: As part of the Willow Creek Wildlife Mitigation Project, BPA proposes to revegetate an emergent wetland with native wet meadow grasses and herbs. The proposal is to plow a wetland site in order to disrupt the seed bank of non-native grasses and re-plant the area with native wet meadow grasses and herbs. The project is expected to expand native habitat in the Willow Creek Natural Area by providing native wetlands, improve storm water runoff quality, and providing additional flood protection. The proposed project would occur in sections 4 and 9 of T18S&hyph;R4W. The wetlands occur on land that would be acquired by BPA and are adjacent to the Willow Creek Natural Area. Maps and further information are available from BPA at the address above. Issued in Portland, Oregon, on December 5, 1994. John M. Taves, NEPA Compliance Officer, Environment, Fish, and Wildlife.
