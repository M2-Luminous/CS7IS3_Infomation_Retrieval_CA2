FR940628-2-00043 FR940628-2-00033 FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION [Docket No. 94&hyph;12] Spark International Trading, Inc. v. Danzas Corporation, Nordstar Line, S.A. and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc.; Filing of Complaint and Assignment Notice is given that a complaint filed by Spark International Trading, Inc. (``Complainant'') against Danzas Corporation (``Danzas''), Nordstar Line, S.A. (``Nordstar'') and Great Eastern Shipping, Inc. (``Great Eastern'') was served June 22, 1994. Complainant alleges that: (1) Respondents Danzas violated section 10(d)(1) of the Shipping Act 1984 (``the Act''), 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(d)(1), inter alia, by holding itself out as an ocean common carrier and an ocean freight forwarder for the transportation of Complainant's cargo from Baltimore to St. Petersburg, Russia, failing to provide such transportation, having no intention of ever providing such transportation, failing to use reasonable care in selecting Nordstar/Great Eastern, alleged non-vessel operating common carriers, to arrange such transportation, failing to verify that Nordstar/Great Eastern had filed the agreed upon rate, and failing to take necessary steps to arrange and supervise the transport and timely delivery of complainant's cargo; and (2) Respondents Nordstar and Great Eastern violated sections 10(b)(1) and (5) and 10(d)(1) of the Act, 46 U.S.C. app. 1709(b)(1) and (5) and (d)(1), by failing to take steps reasonably necessary to arranging and supervising the transport and timely delivery of Complainant's cargo, holding cargo pending payment of new, higher freight charges not shown in Nordstar's tariff, and retaliating Complainant by demanding a higher than agreed upon rate because Complainant sought the assistance of legal counsel. This proceeding has been assigned to the office of Administrative Law Judges. Hearing in this matter, if any is held, shall commence within the time limitations prescribed in 46 CFR 502.61, and only after consideration has been given by the parties and the presiding officer to the use of alternative forms of dispute resolution. The hearing shall include oral testimony and cross-examination in the discretion of the presiding officer only upon proper showing that there are genuine issues of material fact that cannot be resolved on the basis of sworn statements, affidavits, depositions, or other documents or that the nature of the matter in issue is such that an oral hearing and cross-examination are necessary for the development of an adequate record. Pursuant to the further terms of 46 CFR 502.61, the initial decision of the presiding officer in this proceeding shall be issued by June 22, 1995, and the final decision of the Commission shall be issued by October 20, 1995.
