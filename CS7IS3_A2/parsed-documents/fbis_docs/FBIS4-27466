The order indicated weak points in the implementation of the party and state policy on forestry resources as well as instances of violating this policy. According to this order, permissions for cutting timber over quota and for cutting timber for all building purposes which have not been approved by the ministry concerned and the government are no longer issued, and those issued previously are ordered cancelled immediately and absolutely. No province can allow private businsses and owners of saw mills and wood processing factories to send their people to cut timber in the forest by themselves. State authorities in cooperation with locals will organise the cutting of timber and then sell it to private businesses at log yards No. 1 or No. 2. Provinces have to stop exporting log and sawn wood, and if necessary, they need special permission from the government. Provinces having border cross points with foreign countries should help the government in inspections. Timber export without permission from the governments absolutely not allowed to pass bordr points. The government has allowed some companies only to do the export of sawn timber. Any companies with no authorization from the government are definitely not allowed to do so. The import of timber from other countries to Laos or in transit to a third country also requires a quota from the government. Installations of mobile saw mills and wood slicing machines are no longer allowed in the forest. Previous permissions on the matter, if any, will be officially cancelled. Exchanges of timber for cars, materials, equipment and other construction ventures are no longer permitted. Provinces have no right to allow local and foreign investors to set up wood processing industries and to undertake forestry concessions. This matter is to be decided by the government alone. The use by foreigners of labour, drawing equipment and trucks for cutting timber in the forest without permission from the government must be stopped. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft are asked to send their personnel to the provinces to collect data on the numbers of villages and people still living on slash-and-burn farming on upland and watershed areas and their annual demand for rice. Then the personnel have to discuss with provincial authorities a solution to the issue. In areas where conditions are favorable, people may have to move to fixed farming in the plainland, while those living in areas not favorable for rice farming will be advised to stop slash-and-burn farming and take up the planting of industrial trees or cattle raising on the spot. The state will provide them with rice, credit, money and animals. Slash-and-burn cultivation in lowland areas which cause forest destruction is also strictly banned.
