He claimed that members of the VMRO-DPMNE leadership frequently visited Bulgaria and obtained large amounts of money from there. In reply to the charges, Dosta Dimovska, deputy chairman of the VMRO-DPMNE, accused the Albanian party, asserting that its leaders often travel to Albania to receive instructions and that, in practice, they place themselves at the service of a foreign state. Stojan Andov, chairman of the Macedonian Parliament, offered his services as an arbitrator. He declared that Macedonia is a democratic state and everyone can travel anywhere he or she likes, but that people's deputies must conduct themselves in word and deed in their country's interests.
