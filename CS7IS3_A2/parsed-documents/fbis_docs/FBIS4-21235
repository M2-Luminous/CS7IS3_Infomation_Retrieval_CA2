Yesterday, newly elected Social Welfare Minister Yvonne Herlov Andersen (Democratic Center) proposed that the government spend approximately 20 million kroner on two pilot projects involving drug treatment according to the Italian model, in which both the family and the addict have considerable responsibility seeing that treatment is successful. The Danish drug-treatment providers would like to draw families into their work, but they warn against simply borrowing another country's treatment system. ``Italian and Danish culture differ significantly. Down there, there is a much stronger tradition of families that go in and assume responsibilities that are public responsibilities here in Denmark,'' said Peter Ege, social welfare physician in Copenhagen. However, he believes that, in general, it is a good idea to utilize the resources of the family. ``We must not believe that family therapy is our only salvation, but my experience is that even relatively weak families have something to offer,'' said Anders Gormsen, head of the Church Army's institution for the treatment of young drug addicts.
