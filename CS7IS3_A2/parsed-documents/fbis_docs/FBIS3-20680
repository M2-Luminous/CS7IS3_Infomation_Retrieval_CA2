"No plane that might land there would ever be able to take off" Manojlovic specified in a conversation with TANJUG correspondent Vladimir Elez. At the same time he noted that "nobody has made any official request to discuss the possibility of opening Dubrava airport near Tuzla; threats to do it by force were used instead." General Milovanovic recalled that the Serbian side had earlier granted the use of Sarajevo airport to the United Nations for humanitarian needs. "However, in order to achieve their own military objectives, the Muslims now want their own airport, and they want it in Tuzla." According to Milovanovic, this is fully consistent with the Muslim plans to establish territorial links between Tuzla, Zenica, and Sarajevo, and it reflects other military needs as well. As for Srebrenica, General Milovanovic stressed that "this is an imaginary problem. As far as the Serbian side is concerned, the replacement of the Canadian unit in Srebrenica was never a problem, nor is it now." He concluded that in essence the latest events involving Tuzla and Srebrenica represent "a new attempt to encourage the Muslim side to continue the war."
