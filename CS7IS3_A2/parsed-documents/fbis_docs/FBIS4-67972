The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA (Communist Youth's Truth) said it believed some scientists were assisting Pyongyang's nuclear development by computer mail from home since the Russian Government has barred them from traveling to North Korea, adding that controlling the scientists was impossible at present. North Korea signed a contract with the defunct Soviet Union in August 1990 to import 200 rocket experts, but it was nullified with Seoul and Moscow's normalization of diplomatic ties and Seoul's promise of a loan, it reported. Anatoly Rubtsov, a Russian solid state physicist and now a member of North Korea's Science Academy, told the paper that Pyongyang approached him at a Beijing seminar in April 1991 after its original plan failed. After accepting Pyongyang's offer, he bribed the Russian Foreign Ministry with U.S. dollars and obtained 200 blank passports. He was paid by the North Korean Embassy in Moscow. Rubtosov said he was able to lure 36 Russian engineers, many of them experts in the rocket field. They told security officers they ``wanted to use their knowledge anywhere regardless of politics'' when they and their families were detained at Moscow's Sheremetievo Airport in October 1992 while trying to get to Pyongyang. A reliable document shows that despite the government ban, more than 20 Russian scientists have made their way to North Korea via China, the paper said. Living under pseudonyms, they are reportedly paid 3,000-4,000 dollars per month. But some, preferring not to take the risk, instead provide information by computer mail from their homes in Russia, the paper said.
