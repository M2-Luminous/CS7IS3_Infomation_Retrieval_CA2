This was caused by Article 55 of the Draft Constitutional Act on the composition and appointment of the HCR-PCT Executive Committee. The councillors had very divergent views on this point, for which the stakes seem to be very high. Oscar Kambamba has a report on this session: [Begin Kambamba recording] Yesterday's plenary session was interspersed with moments of exasperation among the members of the two political forces at the People's Palace during the marathon session, which lasted from 1700 [1800 GMT] to 2300. The Political Forces of the Conclave [FPC] and the USORAS [expansion unknown] were completely at odds concerning Article 55 of the Draft Constitutional Act, which concerns the appointment and composition of the Executive Committee. Although the two parties agreed on the composition of the committee -- a chairman, two first vice chairmen, two second vice chairmen, two first secretaries-rapporteurs, and two second secretaries-rapporteurs -- the same cannot be said for who would fill the posts. What really divided the two sides was deciding on the procedure for appointing the HCR-PT chairman. The FPC feels that the HCR-PT already has a legitimate, [word indistinct] chairman. As Mr. Mutumbo said, to think otherwise would imply blackmail and, as parliamentary practice demands, only a vote could settle the differences. Mr. Kamanda, the co-chairman from USORAS, was apparently exasperated by a violation of the protocol agreement, in view of the fact that the HCR-PT chairman is appointed from this institution, and if this aspect is not taken into account, it could lead to a bothersome precedent and create unstable conditions for continuing the talks. In other words, the USORAS members, who rejected a vote on the issue, were calling for a consensus. Speeches upon speeches were made, but none of the proposals put forward were adopted. Thus, around 2300, the two opposing sides, without reaching an agreement, adjourned the session to sleep on the issue until today. Prior to this, it took two hours of discussion to amend and adopt Article 90 on the inviolability of the head of state's person, who shall not be penally responsible for acts undertaken in the exercise of his duties, except in case of high treason. The same article also provides for the responsibilities of the prime minister and the other members of government. In all, there are only three articles left for deliberation. Apart from Article 55, there is Article 76 -- which provides for the election of the prime minister by the CNS [expansion unknown] for USORAS and by the HCR-PT for the FPC -- and, finally Article 116, which covers the transitional and final provisions. Agreement on these three articles could divide the participants and possibly jeopardize everything if they do not relax their stands. [end recording]
