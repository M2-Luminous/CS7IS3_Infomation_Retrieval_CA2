This was announced by Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo in an address to some 60 businessmen during a meeting organized by Foro, an organization that is headed by Maria Tezanos Pinto and Eva de Soldati. The following are the highlights of Cavallo's address: - "I am going to continue at the head of the Economy Ministry for quite a long time. I do not feel that President Menem is going to ask me to resign in the near future, and I am not going to submit my resignation." - If the Radicals [Radical Civic Union -- UCR] win the elections and come to head the government, they will implement the same type of economic policy that we have implemented. - Up to the present time, we have had favorable international conditions. There was money and a willingness to invest in Argentina as there was a recession in the United States, Japan, and Europe. But this recession had an impact on the markets that receive our exportable products. Thus to attract a lot of capital to recover the level of investment and to advance in productive modernization was an intelligent move. - In the future we may not be able to obtain so much capital for investment. But at the same time there is a favorable phenomenon -- the recovery of the United States and the recovery that can be seen on the horizon in Japan and Europe -- and this will benefit our exports. - From now it will be difficult to obtain resources on the capital market, but it will be possible to obtain them on the stock market. The difficulty that could emerge from the international financial markets will be compensated for by the improved possibilities for placing our exports. - National consumerism will not be able to grow at the same rate it has grown for the past 3 years. We are going to have to reduce the growth of consumerism, and thus get the companies to sell more on the international market. - We are not going to provoke a recession. It would be silly to believe that the government is going to devalue in order to resolve the problem of the income of capital. - The government is going to invite families to control the increase in consumer outlays, and it is going to induce an increase in public and private savings but without affecting the increase in productive capability. - There will be innovations that will help in the use of the resources that will be used by the administrations of pension funds. Article No. 40 of the social welfare reform, which guarantees the funds that are deposited with the Bank of the Nation, "is causing problems, and we are going to resolve these." - Cavallo took a poke at Jorge Berardi, the president of the Stock Exchange, because he had stressed that if the pensioners waited until 1 August 1994 to sell their YPF [Government Oil Deposits] shares, the broker would have charged a lower commission.... "This is very silly, and a lack of professionalism." He also indicated that if the majority of the 96,000 pensioners that hold shares sold them on that day, then they would suffer a lot of harm. - Regarding brokers, "there are signs of a lack of maturity and too many individual gambits. It seems that they play the stock market in the same way one plays in the casino."
