In his second address to the nation on Thursday evening, Ntibantunganya repeatedly appealed to Burundian citizens to "preserve the existing calm". He commended the country's higher organs and security forces for their "positive role in the management of the crisis born from the sudden death of the head of state". Meanwhile, Radio Bujumbura reported that Ntibantunganya held talks in the presidential palace with ambassadors in Bujumbura, to "inform them of the situation prevailing in the country and ask for their support", the national radio reported. In case of vacancy of power, the Burundi Constitution says the speaker of parliament acts as the interim president for a maximum period of three months, pending the election of a new president.
