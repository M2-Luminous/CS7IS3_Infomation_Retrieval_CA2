What will be the next step taken by China then, and how will Hong Kong's prosperity and stability be maintained through "self-reliance"? These are not only questions for which people overseas are showing great concern, but also questions raised by many people in China. In Beijing, some democratic personages whom I know very well have raised the following questions in private talks as if by prior agreement: "Have violent changes taken place in Hong Kong?" "Has Chris Patten put Hong Kong in a wretched state?" "Has the Sino-British Joint Declaration been unilaterally abandoned by the British side?" "If we had known it would come to this, we would have acted differently. Since China and Britain are sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams, we should not have suggested cooperation in the transitional period long ago. Could we not see the `sequel' now?" These people did not pay much attention to the Hong Kong issue before, but how do they appear to be experts now? After making inquiries, I learned that, recently, the CPC has in various relevant units whipped up opinion about and made great efforts to expose Britain's "schemes and intrigues" on the Hong Kong issue. Apart from the need to speak along the same lines externally, the practice is also aimed at unifying people's thinking within the country. To the executors of the CPC's policies on Hong Kong and Macao, turning against the British is both a bad thing and a good thing. If Hong Kong's transition is smooth and anything unexpected happens in Hong Kong after 1997, the responsibility will rest on the Chinese side. Now that the British side has put forth Chris Patten's package and the Chinese side has thoroughly criticized it, once anything bad happens in Hong Kong in the future, the responsibility will rest on the side of the British colonialists. Lu Ping: Seeds of Trouble Buried by the British Side Will Be Intolerable On 15 December, on behalf of the State Council, Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and Jiang Enzhu, representative of the Chinese side in the Sino-British talks, held a special meeting in the Guangdong Hall of the Great Hall of the People to brief the leaders of various democratic parties and mass organizations on the situation of the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's political system. They also answered questions raised by the participants. Lu Ping spoke first. He said: The British authorities have made use of Hong Kong's transitional period and have intentionally raised a political challenge against the Chinese Government. Judging from its usual practice before withdrawing from its colonies, it is by no means a new strategy. Before the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese Government and relevant departments had already made certain ideological preparations. In the spring of 1990, we made several concrete preparations. Now, in our preparatory work, we must grasp the work firmly and substantively on the one hand and, on the other, pay close attention to violent changes in Hong Kong's political and economic fields created by the British side and the development of trends. We must be prepared to deal with such changes. Now, work concerning arrangements for this has already been completed. China will not allow and will not tolerate Britain willfully creating and burying seeds of political disturbance and economic collapse in Hong Kong during the transitional period. "Six Basic Factors Concerning Britain's Challenge Against the Chinese Government" What are the "seeds of political disturbance and economic collapse"? Lu Ping made a detailed analysis of this. He believes that Britain changed its China policy and presented a challenge to the Chinese Government for the following basic reasons: 1. Mistakes in analyzing and assessing China's political situation. 2. Mistakes in understanding China's resolution and timetable for taking back Hong Kong's sovereignty and administrative power. 3. An erroneous estimation of the ability of the Chinese Government and Chinese people, including patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, to administer Hong Kong. 4. An attempt to make use of the changes in the international political climate, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the changes in eastern Europe to change its policy and strategy on China. 5. A belief that since China and Hong Kong maintain close economic relations at present, China will not take over Hong Kong earlier even if Britain violates the three documents. 6. A belief that since Hong Kong's economy plays a positive role in the Chinese economy, and the United States, Japan, and other countries have investments in Hong Kong, China will tolerate Britain extending its colonialist rule under the economic card. Lu Ping Indirectly Admits That Sino-British Joint Declaration Has Become Ineffective Judging from the six factors summed up by Lu Ping, in the eyes of the Chinese side, Britain has attempted to "go its own way" in Hong Kong because it has made a wrong appraisal of the situation and has thus buried "seeds of trouble" there, which may lead to political disturbances and economic collapse. But many participants in the meeting asked for an explanation of these anti-British remarks. One of the questions raised by the participants, with which people were showing the greatest concerns for, was whether the Sino-British Joint Declaration, as an international agreement, would continue to be effective. Lu Ping gave the following answer to this delicate question: As the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been repeatedly damaged and undermined, its existence and binding force have lost their legitimate significance and it cannot play its due role. This is common knowledge in international relations. Britain has brazenly gone against to the written agreement and understandings between the two governments. This is a rare practice in international contacts. Therefore, we will make a resolute decision in light of the development of the trend. The timetable is in our hands. All independent countries put their sovereignty and overall interests of the state above everything else. These remarks show that Lu Ping has indirectly admitted that the Sino-British Joint Declaration has already become ineffective and the Chinese side, with sovereignty in its hands, may even take preemptive measures rather than striking only after the other side has struck. From this, people can see that the Chinese side has made certain tactical changes in its Hong Kong policy. It has emphasized that "the timetable is in our hands." This is not merely intimidation. With the breakdown of Sino-British talks and its hypocritical face unveiled, the Chinese side can do whatever it wants to do "with perfect assurance." "Correcting the Right Deviationist Policy Toward Britain" In this stage, while China is "calmly waiting for change," the military is still adopting a very active attitude. In mid-October, soon after the conclusion of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, eight generals, including Zhang Aiping, a former defense minister and currently a member of the Central Military Commission's consultative committee, Xiao Ke, Hong Xuezhi, Li Desheng, Wang Ping, Yang Dezhi, Qin Jiwei, and Zhao Nanqi stated their views to the Central Committee and the State Council, saying "it is time to end the colonialist rule now and to sum up and rectify the right deviationist policy of cherishing unrealistic illusions toward the British Government"! This is what the servicemen of the older generation are thinking, but they have just expressed their views with slogans. Top military officers in charge of concrete work have even more concrete ideas. At the beginning of December, Zhang Wannian, chief of the general staff, Yu Yongbo, director of the General Political Department, and Fu Quanyou, director of the General Logistics Department, together with Defense Minister Chi Haotian, Air Force Commander Cao Shuangming, and Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong, submitted a statement of their views to the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, entitled "We must safeguard national sovereignty and end colonialist rule." In the statement, they put forth the following five proposals: Five Proposals Made by the Military Have Strong Smell of Gunpowder 1. The so-called dispute over the political system at present is a favorite trick of the British colonialists before withdrawing from their colonies and is a deliberate political challenge after the British authorities changed their strategy toward China. It is necessary to expose it and fight back. 2. It is necessary to make preparations for taking resolute measures against Britain if it brings disasters in economic affairs, supports pro-British and anti-China hostile forces in the political field, and, internationally, creates an international political city. 3. Since the British authorities have abandoned the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the agreements reached between the Chinese and British governments and have caused the situation to deteriorate further, it is necessary to adopt measures immediately and make a resolute decision: Take back Hong Kong immediately and implement the policy of one country, two systems under the leadership of the government of the PRC. 4. The Chinese Government should warn the British authorities sternly once again through diplomatic channels that it should immediately stop playing political tricks, rein in from the brink of the precipice, return to the basis of carrying out the Sino-British Joint Declaration and agreements reached between the two governments, and stop interfering with China's sovereignty and internal affairs, otherwise colonialist rule will be ended immediately without hesitation and further tolerance. 5. At the current stage, China should recall its ambassador to Britain and terminate ministerial contacts and intercourse with Britain. Liu Huaqing Predicts British Colonialism Will Be Eradicated Very Soon Judging from this written statement, which has a strong smell of gunpowder, the military has not only been well prepared all the time to take "resolute measures," but has also asked for the downgrading of Sino-British diplomatic relations. Such "over reactive" remarks have never been seen before. People are speculating that this may have something to do with encouragement by Liu Huaqing, a member of the CPC's Political Bureau and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. Talking about Hong Kong's situation during a recent meeting with the officers in charge of military regions, Liu Huaqing said: To resolve the Hong Kong issue is nothing complicated and difficult. The central authorities have policies and principles ready. We just want to see what antics the British authorities will go on to play. How can Hong Kong's future and Hong Kong's destiny be decided by British colonialists? We have no right to oppose the antics they are playing, but we absolutely have the right to end British colonialist rule and eradicate British-style colonialism early. Judging from current developments, this day will come very soon. "This day will come very soon." This is an important view. However, at present, there are no signs of disturbances in Hong Kong's society and people are seizing the current opportunities and making use of the limited time to make money. Just as people are saying: "When you have money, you can do anything, but if you have no money, you can just follow the Basic Law." Under such a situation, how can man-made "political disturbances" and "economic collapse" be created so that guns can be used to take over Hong Kong ahead of time? It seems that it will be difficult for the CPC to make its next move. "Moving the wrong piece on the chess board may lose the whole game...."
