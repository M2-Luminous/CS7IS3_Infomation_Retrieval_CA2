Korovkin under the rubric "Flight Safety: Investigation of Flights Accidents": "A Failure `Leaves Tracks'"] [Text] Materials will be published under this rubric on the methodological techniques employed when investigating a flight accident [LP]. It is necessary to determine in any flight accident whether it was a failure of the hardware in flight; if so, then why? It is exceedingly difficult, however, to ascertain the causes for the appearance and development of a failure from the misshapen and charred fragments of an accident or crash, since they are subject to additional influences. The kinetic energy that an airframe possesses when encountering an obstacle is realized over a very short time interval, analogous to an explosion, which smashes structural elements into small fragments and scatters them across a considerable distance. This effect is magnified by the destruction of systems and units operating under high pressures using gases and liquids, the actuation of pyrotechnic materials and ammunition, the escape of liquid or gaseous oxygen and the like. The fire that arises after the ignition of the fuel, the mass of which is 30--50 percent of the takeoff mass of a contemporary aircraft, also causes considerable damage. Establishing the true causes for an LP is moreover an exceedingly responsible matter, since decisions are made according to the results of the study that entail millions in spending, for example to improve production or structural elements of the airframe, refine operational processes, make changes in the organization and techniques for personnel training and perform preventive measures. A system of methods and means of researching objects from accidents (hereinafter the system)--for the development of which the originators were awarded a USSR State Prize--was created at the NII [Scientific-Research Institute] for the Operation and Repair of Aviation Hardware [AT] in order to ascertain the causes of failures in an operative manner. The merits of this system are that it makes it possible to conduct research under conditions where: --the parts and assemblies of the aircraft, on-board recording devices etc. used as sources of information to establish the causes of the failure have sustained significant damage or destruction; --the information remaining at the disposal of specialists is in many cases preserved only in the form of microscopic traces; --the functional ties between individual elements of the aircraft system have been destroyed, and often some of them cannot be found at the scene of the accident (owing to complete destruction, burning, landing in a body of water etc.); --the failed unit that led to the accident exists in a single copy; --the aircraft systems have differing functional principles (from mechanical to electronic); --the resolution of issues pertaining to various fields of science (from mathematics to criminology) is required in the course of the research, and a considerable portion of the research is being conducted under field conditions right at the scene of the LP; --all of the work is performed within a certain time frame. The system is based on certain common and frequent scientific principles that take into account the specific nature of studying aircraft accident sites. The most important of those--ensuring the trustworthiness of the results--is achieved through the use of a host of traits and methods founded on various principles of physics for the accomplishment of a single task, the most complete possible reconstruction of information that was distorted as a result of the effects of destructive factors, the documentation of all of the results obtained in the process of research, the strict determination of the sequence of events, ruling out mistakes that could lead to the loss of information about a failure, and a combination of methods of analysis and synthesis when studying the phenomena. Chief among the methods of obtaining and employing information on the process of development of an accident situation are those that provide for the use of the flight data-recording equipment (SOK), and especially on-board recording devices (BUR). The effective utilization of flight information when investigating a flight accident is made more difficult (in roughly 30 percent of LPs), however, by its partial or complete loss. Methods of reconstructing and obtaining information from damaged media (both optical and magnetic) have thus been developed, and are widely utilized, in connection with this. It should be noted that the BUR (even in cases where they are physically intact in an LP) carry information about changes in a limited number of parameters of the flight and operation of the hardware. Research on the state of the aircraft must therefore be performed and the place where it came down studied in order to evaluate the operability of aircraft systems, localize the failure and establish its causes. A whole set of methods, founded on various principles of physics and engineering and taking into account the "materiality" of traces in parts and the terrain in aviation hardware failures, is used for that purpose. The general laws for the formation of these "informative" traces in the downed aircraft have been determined and methods and techniques have been developed that make it possible to ascertain them in the fragments of an airframe and "force" them to "talk." It is possible to determine from the traces on the parts the conditions of their destruction (in flight or upon impact with an obstacle). It has been established, for example, that the following characteristics of the state of the AT can be reflected in those traces in an impact with an obstacle: --the kinetic energy of spinning rotors (aviation engines, generators, pumps and the like); --the pressure of working media (liquids, gases) and their mass and volume in aircraft systems; --the position of controls, elements of automatic equipment, instruments and indicators; --the presence (or absence) of residual magnetization of a certain level; --the degree of heating of the parts. Mathematical and physical modeling (part-scale and full-scale) of the dynamics of flight and the trajectory of movement of the airframe are widely used in the course of investigating an LP on the basis of information from the flight data-recording equipment. Modeling is employed in those cases where the information from the BUR and the data obtained on the state of the aircraft wreckage are insufficient to determine the causes of hardware failure. It is performed with the aim of establishing: --the possibility and duration of the development of the damage ascertained in a part in the failure of a unit or assembly; --the types of flaws that led to a failure recorded in flight; --the actual conditions of the operation of the part, as well as the boundary conditions at which the ascertained flaw arises; --the correspondence of the damage existing on the parts to a certain (operable or inoperable) state of the assembly; --the sequence of the destruction of parts; --the possibility of the practical realization of the stated hypotheses on the causes for the appearance of the failure. In order to formulate a conclusion, we turn to methods that provide for the logical processing of the primary information, as well as analysis and synthesis of the data gathered at all stages of the investigation of the LP. I would like to single out among those the method of structuring a diagram of the cause-and-effect links. Standard flowcharts are used as the foundation, and are then clarified and supplemented in the course of the investigation of a specific LP. The structuring is performed by stages--from a known final consequence, obtained from an analysis of the circumstances of the LP and information from the SOK, to its primary cause. Technical gear, both special gear and some used in other areas of science and technology, has been developed and is employed to investigate aircraft wreckage. Flying laboratories equipped with all of the necessary equipment for working under field conditions are of especially great significance. This system provides for the quite complete performance of the tasks that arise at all stages of the investigation of an LP. Its effectiveness is characterized by the fact that the concrete cause of the failure is found in 50 percent of the cases, it is established that there was no failure in 40 percent of the cases, and only in 10 percent of the cases is a cause not found (likely or possible causes are indicated). It must be noted in conclusion that one feature of improving the system of methods for investigating crashed aircraft is its ever greater algorithmization, thanks to which the necessary preconditions are created for a fundamentally new stage--the adoption of expert systems (ES) into the practice of investigating flight accidents. These are distinguished by the fact that they are oriented toward resolving a broad range of tasks in areas that were not formalized before, which were felt to be little accessible to the use of computers. The specialists using ESs in the course of investigating an LP can surpass the capabilities of experts in that realm. This would make it possible to expand the circle of issues they resolve by accumulating the knowledge of highly qualified experts in the ESs. All of the agencies concerned must be brought into the creation of ESs (coordination of the algorithms for identifying a priori information, entered into the system and used in the future to determine the causes of failures in automated mode). This will facilitate a rise in the objectivity of the evaluations, and will make it possible to come to a unified opinion in the course of a specific LP investigation on questions of the traits and nature of the development of AT failures and, consequently, its causes as well, and to take effective and coordinated steps to prevent LPs and increase the safety of flights.
