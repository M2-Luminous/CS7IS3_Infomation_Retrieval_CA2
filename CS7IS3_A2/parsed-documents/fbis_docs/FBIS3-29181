The following is a summary of his remarks. A more detailed report of the interview will appear in the April issue of the monthly THIS IS YOMIURI (on sale on 9 March). Future of Japan-U.S. Relations [Oikawa] Japan and the United States failed to reach an agreement at the latest summit talks due to a dispute over the issue of numerical targets. For the first time, Japan clearly said "no." How do you assess this unprecedented development? [Ozawa] Changes in Japanese-U.S. relations are inevitable amid the historical trend of searching for a new world order after the collapse of the Cold War structure. As a nation which has grown more independent, Japan finds itself in a difficult position. From a position where it once enjoyed the safety and comforts of the cradle, Japan must now act with responsibility as a mature nation. I believe it was proper, in that sense, for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to say that this cannot be done, this is wrong, or that things are not yet ready. However, this does not mean that saying "no" is all that matters, although the popular sentiment seems to be that it feels good to do so. I am most concerned not about what happens to the economic framework talks, but that it will be terrible if the relationship of trust between Japan and the United States disintegrates. If we are asked whether Japan, as a member of the international community, is handling various issues, including the domestic market and security, competently, the truth is, we still cannot say with confidence that "Everything is under control; we do not have to be told." If the Americans think of us as saying "no" only when it suits our purpose, and relying on others when we want to, then the relationship of trust between the two countries will be bankrupt. [Sasaki] I think we have come to take on very heavy responsibilities. Particularly economic issues. On the surface, current issues resemble those during the bubble economic boom in the 1980's, but actually, the position of both countries and the environment have changed. I believe we were able to negotiate in such a manner because the political regime has changed. [Ozawa] Although the coalition government has been termed a precarious mosaic or glass work, it has more breadth than the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] administrations. The most effective means to revitalize the economy is deregulation. It is not good that we should be told by the United States to open up our market. (This is) Japan's own problem. While there is a need for regulations to protect the weak, too many regulations dampen the sense of self-reliance on the part of both enterprises and individuals, and there can be no notion of taking responsibility for one's own actions. [Oikawa] When it comes to deregulation, there is the problem of the bureaucratic system. The bureaucrats were also an obstacle during the time of (former) Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. How will the exercise of political power change this? [Ozawa] It is only natural for people to resist when what they are used to doing is going to be changed. So my point is, the resistance of bureaucrats is not a problem. If there is a problem, this has to do with the people who live by the regulations we have just mentioned. In the past, the bureaucrats, and even the politicians, did not have to make political decisions in the real sense under the Cold War structure. Their only job was to draw up the budget, and distribute the revenues equally. On the whole, we followed the decision of the United States, and it was enough just to agree. In that sense, it was not true politics. The same was true for the bureaucrats, they concentrated on trivial things like regulations and subsidies. We would like the bureaucrats to use their heads for greater political issues, such as Japan's role in the international community. [Sasaki] How do you look at the issue of the DPRK's suspected development of nuclear arms taken up during the Japan-U.S. summit talks? [Ozawa] It is very significant that the leaders of Japan and the United States reached basic agreement on the North Korean issue. This might be the first time a Japanese prime minister has made a clear statement. So far, we had remained ambiguous. Japan should act properly in line with the agreement reached at the summit meeting. Pictures of Political Reorganization [Oikawa] How would you reorganize the political world? Prime Minister Hosokawa has pointed out the possibility of reorganizing the political world during the current Diet session. [Ozawa] I have the same view as the prime minister. I somehow understand it because the plan to introduce 300 (single-seat constituencies) was proposed by the government before. In this sense, I think (political reorganization) will be made at considerably faster speed than what the mass media are saying. I do not mean to say it is going to be a merger only among the coalition parties or a course of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] alone. I have a feeling that the coalition parties and the LDP will be involved in the realignment. [Sasaki] To some degree, the 1955 regime of Japanese politics and the economic structure were inseparable. I would like to ask you how we should change Japan's economic structure and what kind of impact will the difference between those, who are trying to keep the existing system, and others, who are trying to make major changes to the existing system and thereby allowing political power to take leadership, have on realignment of the political world. [Ozawa] I think the difference between those, who think the current system should not be changed, and others, who think changes are needed, boils down to the differences of opinions regarding periodic recognition and historical views. We should actively buckle down to technological development. Another thing the government has to deal with is wide-ranging environmental issues. The government should not introduce measures for maintaining total demand or opening up a new industrial field. Instead, the government should launch visions or guidance. The government should do these two things. At the same time, the government should also study an ideal form of welfare state or welfare system and deal with the issue of how much burden the people should bear. I think these three points will be major pillars of political realignment. [Oikawa] How will the things you have just said be related to images of the parties? Can you explain it in concrete terms? [Ozawa] The LDP and opposition parties feel at peace in a society with many regulations. Originally, the regulations were made to ensure the people would get fair and equal chances. But, regulations have negative aspects. Regulations can be easily linked to corruption when abused by people in power. Political reform can correct this point. [Oikawa] Can you explain how the progress or process of political realignment is being promoted? [Ozawa] I still cannot foresee visible phenomenons. However, the revised political reform bills will be approved in mid-February. I think people's attention will shift to political reform as soon as the bills are passed. [Oikawa] Do you think that such a thing as the course of government, or the government's role in international society will be one of the issues of political realignment? [Ozawa] Yes, I do. I think differences of opinions regarding policies, what a nation should be or what politics should be like will become major factors. We should introduce a fundamental security act and thereby clearly spell out the ideals of a peaceloving and UN-centered nation. [Oikawa] Can you comment on elections, including the issue of nominating joint candidates, under the new electoral system? [Ozawa] Many lawmakers do not have a thorough understanding of the new electoral system, and neither does the general public. Parties will nominate candidates. The proportional representation also applies to single-seat constituencies too. Because of these, they still understand that the words "cooperation in elections" and "joint candidate" apply to organizations which confirmed things during elections in the past. However, (under the new electoral system) political parties and groups are not required to be confirmed as organizations that are allowed to conduct election campaigns. I think the coalition parties will have to compete in the next election as a single party. [Oikawa] How will coalition parties handle their policy differences? [Ozawa] It is absolutely unnecessary to think which party is good and which party is not, or who is good and who is not. For example, I think Mr. Hosokawa should remain as prime minister. Those who have the same opinion should gather together. I do not know how other politicians (think), but I think that when the coalition parties merge into a new party, they will do so without confrontation over basic policies. [Sasaki] Political reform will necessitate a personnel reshuffle at the final stage. What are your opinions? [Ozawa] (Shinseito) would invite those who seek candidacy and select candidates from them. I am a second-generation politician. Second-generation politicians tend to be criticized because of their advantageous positions to win candidacy. Such criticism will disappear if candidates are selected through a strict test. But I sincerely hope that incumbent Diet members will be exempted from the test because if they all fail the test, that would be very embarrassing (laughter). Future Policy Tasks [Sasaki] Following the legislation of the bills connected with political reform, there will arise many problems on the mechanism of making political decisions. One of them concerns reform at the Diet, and I would like to hear your views on this issue. [Ozawa] Under the current situation, you can still see the influence of the 1955 system. For example, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is undergoing a very serious agony. In handling the issues on the new multilateral trade negotiations (at the Uruguay Round), on bills connected with political reform, and on the tax cut, they would have voiced their opposition without giving any thought if it were still an opposition party. However, they have now come to feel that they must fulfill their political responsibilities. On the other hand, if the 1955 system had continued, all these three issues would never have been settled. As for the issue on how deliberations should be actually carried out at the Diet, I think opposition parties should be mainly held responsible for checking the government. Therefore, the Diet's functions should be strengthened. For example, the Diet should be more sufficiently staffed. And the system of appointing government delegates [to assist cabinet members in Diet deliberations] should be abolished. Deliberations at the Diet should be conducted among politicians. These plans must be put into effect. Then, the people will think that a new Diet has started, and politicians will be able to carry out more intensive study. When politicians come to have accurate knowledge, bureaucrats will listen to them. Bureaucrats may have a low opinion of politicians when they talk incoherently. In the past, politicians have spent an overwhelming part of their energy on election campaigning. In the future, we should make political parties take responsibility for 20 to 30 percent of campaigning so politicians will have enough energy to study issues and debate with bureaucrats, and so deliberations can be conducted among the ruling and opposition parties at the Diet. [Oikawa] You have advocated the system of assigning Dietmen from ruling parties to the government by creating posts for two to three deputy ministers [fuku daijin] and four to six political councillors [seimu shingi-kan] at each individual agency and ministry. How would you explain this point? [Ozawa] Politicians, particularly politicians from ruling parties, should be held responsible for administration. At the Diet sessions, those politicians from ruling parties who are assigned to official posts should be asked to engage in deliberations with Dietmen from opposition parties. [Oikawa] In concrete terms, when and how will this system be introduced? [Ozawa] Since this issue has been brought up for discussions at a meeting of senior leaders of ruling parties, I hope the system will be put into effect at the current Diet session. [Sasaki] It seems that opinions are divided among the ruling coalition parties on the issue of whether an organ for monitoring the development of political reform should be set up at the Diet or in the cabinet. What do you think of this? [Ozawa] If politicians have become genuinely mature, I think it will be desirable to set up this organ at the Diet. However, under the current atmosphere involving both ruling and opposition parties, it will be very difficult for the government to carry out its administration if such an organ should be set up at the Diet and entrusted with the task of administrative reform and supervision. It is because the organ is bound to concentrate on faultfinding. [Sasaki] Deliberations at the Japanese Diet are known for being extremely detailed. [Ozawa] Discussions are usually held on insignificant issues. Originally, the opposition should be responsible for monitoring ruling parties. However, the Japanese, including members of both ruling and opposition parties, have normally kept in mind that bureaucrats imply the government [o-kami]. At Diet sessions, even Dietmembers from ruling parties are asking bureaucrats questions. Dietmembers from both ruling and opposition parties prefer listening to answers given by bureaucrats. And I am arguing that it will not do to have such an awareness. [Sasaki] At what forums do you plan to bring up the issue on power decentralization for discussion? In my opinion, unless local governments make moves, there will be no changes in the overall political trend no matter how the central government tries to make moves. What do you say? [Ozawa] Many Japanese speak of "deregulation." However, there is hardly anyone who truly hopes for deregulation because it is comfortable to live in a regulated society, and this argument also holds true with localities. While complaining that "it is very troublesome to make petitions to the authorities," local government officials get scared when "they are given funds and authority and asked to carry out some policies by themselves." Speaking of power decentralization in the true sense of the words, however, there are cases where central government offices may refuse to surrender their authority but there are also cases where the other side is not keen on decentralization. [Oikawa] How would you actually implement Diet reform and decentralization of power? [Ozawa] When things are doing just fine, it is difficult to start something new. For instance, the national welfare tax has been termed abrupt. However, the aging society is gradually becoming visible, and the people are beginning to think seriously. From now on, many things will need political decisions. The political authorities should take the responsibility and make decisions on such issues as the problem of the Korean peninsula. Things will not turn out as planned even if you write a time schedule during peace time. Basically, the international community has become volatile. We need to build a system able to cope with this. In a sense, this constitutes political reform. This means the political authorities should take the responsibility to make and implement their decisions. At least, we need to create two groups capable of taking the reins of government. Three would also be alright. The international situation and domestic affairs may become explosive. The question is whether we will be able to respond promptly. As to what should be the priority and how decisions should be made, the regime in power can decide about that. [passage omitted on Ozawa's assessment of postwar politics] What Kind of Person Is "Ichiro Ozawa"? [Oikawa] Some people are accusing you of forming a dual power structure in the ruling coalition in the same way as Kakuei Tanaka and Noboru Takeshita of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] did in the past. What do you think of this? [Ozawa] The head of the administration needs leadership. He can fully exercise the leadership only when he is accepted by the people of the time. In this context, I think Mr. Hosokawa should remain as leader for the present. I do not think I am the right person to be leader. Besides that, I have no intention of obtaining that highest post. My position is different from those of Messrs. Tanaka and Takeshita. I am not a behind-the-scenes strong man. In LDP style, I am a secretary general. My title is the chief secretary of Shinseito. If a new party is formed and I am asked to assume an executive post, I will accept the offer as long as I am a member of the House of Representatives. I think it is not right to compare myself with Messrs. Tanaka and Takeshita. [Oikawa] Some criticize you by saying that you act "high-handedly" and have "fascistic ideas." [Ozawa] I am responsible for my remarks and behavior. In Japan's village-like society, people do not clearly state their opinions. Also, responsible leaders do not make clear their views and behavior. So far, Japanese politicians have tried to form consensus and do what others agree to. In this regard, my remarks and behavior are different from those of other politicians. I have not chosen to become the target of criticism. But I am responsible for what I have to say so long as I am elected as a politician. [Oikawa] While you sometimes disappear from the public eye, you are calling for "pursuing open-door politics." Don't you think you contradict yourself? [Ozawa] That is what the mass media has said. I do not disappear like a mole. Since I got ill, I have tried to take a rest. That is all. I go shopping with my wife and go to the movies. I do not want (my private life) to be disturbed by the media. [Oikawa] When you were questioned about the political donations you received from major construction companies, you just said: "The donations were handled in accordance with law." You did not explain exactly how the donations were handled. [Ozawa] They were handled properly in accordance with the current judicial order. Other politicians also handle their political donations in the same way. Some people have said that "the political funds control law has many loopholes," and that "Ozawa has clearly evaded the law." I have heard the criticism of this kind. There are many special cases provided by the current tax law in which political donations are treated as legal. Also, the tax authorities may in their discretion decide whether they are legal or not. If you say this system is bad, that is tantamount to saying that those who handle political donations in accordance with this system are also bad.
