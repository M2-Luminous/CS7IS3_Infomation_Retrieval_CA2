"It is necessary to increase the number of security corps and to supply them with resources that this critical situation demands. I am talking about transportation units and all other requirements of the service." He explained that measures are being taken to control the possession of weapons. He noted that both legal and illegal weapons sales have increased at an alarming rate recently and said that the weapons go to the most densely populated, poorest areas; that is, to the neighborhoods. He described weapon control measures and noted that they must be part of an ongoing program, just like everything else involved in security. The president reported that the National Security and Defense Council will be installed this afternoon and that the Rural Security Council will meet tomorrow to discuss the border security problem. Velasquez said the meetings will be attended by governors from the border states, livestock owners associations, and officials from the various ministries and offices related to the livestock sector. The president stated: "Efforts to make life and work in that large area more secure are important and cannot be delayed." Velasquez said Colombia takes very much the same view, and that is why the Colombian Government has expressed through its highest authorities its interest in reaching an agreement on the matter. Velasquez appeared optimistic. He said that in the next few weeks Colombian authorities will make reinforcements on their side of the border a fact. Regarding life in the poor sectors, the president said he will hold talks this week to establish the nature of the social problem, which he is sure the next government will inherit. He noted: "When one sees a bus loaded with 80 young people arriving at a court so they can stand trial, one must realize that the state did not do a thing to help them when they were children." The president believes that the situation of poor children who live in heavily populated areas must be improved. He added: A program in this regard must be initiated because repression is useless. He added: The social sector of my government wants to set the basis for actions to modify public education. As an example the president mentioned private organizations, including religious ones, that do educational work in these zones and achieve very positive results. Their work is somewhat different from that of public education. The president said he wants to propose this reform. He noted that in Merida State an extraordinary project called integral education has been implemented. The project was set in motion by Antonio Luis Cardenas, former rector of the Libertador Pedagogic School. He said that this program takes into consideration economic limitations and the need to guide the young toward learning some trade capable of furnishing them with a practical tool with which to face life. According to the president, the fundamental idea is to start this program with children and to have morning and afternoon classes so they have food assistance throughout the day. Regarding pardons, President Velasquez said he is studying a new list and will release the names this week. He again asked those who are still outside the law to return to justice. In addition, Velasquez said he is working on Colonel Iginio Castro's return from Quito. Castro is seriously ill. The defense minister wants to transfer Castro to the Caracas Military Hospital and take other steps later. The president recalled that in his salute to the Armed Forces and in several statements, he has always asked the leaders and other persons involved in the coup attempts to legalize their status. Velasquez said: I did so in Los Proceres Avenue during the ceremony to salute the National Armed Forces. I asked the officers who are in Lima to return and to do so with the assurance that there is a complete legal state. Velasquez believes that the time is right because the grounds for an agreement have been set with the elected government. He said: Of course it is the right time, under the country's current state of law and with the guarantees granted by the Constitution. Regarding the situation of some officials under arrest due to the notorious El Amparo case [border massacre], he admitted that pardons are being reviewed and that 12 persons are involved. In his statements, Ramon J. Velasquez referred to relations between his government and President-elect Caldera, describing them as cordial as there has been a flow of information on all public administration aspects through Julio Sosa Rodriguez, the liaison. "He, in turn, has a group of individuals who help coordinate the transfer of power. For example, there is Nepomuceno Garrido in the Labor Ministry, Maria de Guzmas in Family, Elba Ruiz in Education, Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon in Privatization, Roberto Centeno in Transportation, and Gustavo Rodriguez Amengual in Environment, to name a few. In the office of the Secretariat of the Presidency Ministry, we have Andres Caldera, Fernando Egana, and Fernando Febres Cordero," Velasquez said. Asked about his meeting with President Caldera, Velasquez replied that he went to speak about the IVA [value-added tax] and that the situation has been clarified. Velasquez stressed that Sosa Rodriguez is satisfied because modifications made to the first report by Caldera's economic team were taken into account. "Thus, as Sosa Rodriguez says, the text that was published fulfills the suggestions made. There is a 15-percent increase for luxury items and greater exemptions for basic food basket items, medical products -- pacemakers, prosthesis and other items, plus land, maritime, and air transportation," said Velasquez. In his first meeting of 1994 with media representatives, Velasquez sent Venezuelans and all others living in the country his cordial greetings for the New Year, his good wishes, and his wish that the country consolidate its march, mainly for social and political peace, for economic development, for cultural and scientific advancement, and for the affirmation of traditional positive Venezuelan values.
