[passage omitted] [Unidentified correspondent] In response to a Croatian request that the Muslim offensive in central Bosnia be halted, an urgent cease-fire in central Bosnia was agreed. Generals Roso [Croat commander], Delic [Bosnian Muslim commander], and Briquemont are due to meet shortly. The Croatian side says this is a test for the overall solution of Croat-Muslim relations. President Izetbegovic said after the two-hour latest round of the talks that he will order General Delic to implement an urgent cease-fire on all fronts in central Bosnia. The two presidents may still continue their talks this evening in Petersberg castle in Bonn. The departure of the two delegations is scheduled for tomorrow. The Muslim side undertook the obligation to reply to President Tudjman as to whether it accepts the draft agreement, which would have the binding character of a contract. The proposal, consisting of two parts, was made by Croatia. The signatories would be obligated to secure an urgent cease-fire, without any conditions, and the cessation of all hostilities. President Tudjman proposed in the agreement that by 2400 on 15 January all hostilities must end between the Croat and Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The signatories would also take the obligation that all units observe humanitarian rules and the laws of war. Disbanding of disobedient units is also envisaged. War criminals would be handed over to courts. The agreement envisages closing detention centers and releasing prisoners by 31 January. Muslim acceptance of the agreement would guarantee free passage of humanitarian convoys and humanitarian aid. The equality of Bosnian Muslim and Croat people in all areas is envisaged, as are respect for all human rights and civil freedoms without any discrimination and under international control. The agreement, which the Muslim side has to accept or refuse by 15 January, and which President Izetbegovic -- as he said -- will personally support at the Sarajevo Presidency, also envisages how mutual relations within the Union of Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina will be organized, with Croat and Muslim people exercising respect for each other. The agreement demands 17.5 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina for the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and 33.33 percent for the Bosnian Muslim republic. All contentious issues are to be resolved only in a peaceful, political way, without resorting to the use of force. The town of Mostar will be administered by the European Union for up to two years, the agreement envisages. Mostar will be the capital of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna. A separate agreement will secure the return of its citizens to the town. An agreement on which the Muslims are to voice their opinion by 15 January envisages that if the Union of Bosnia-Herzegovina disintegrates, there will be no changes to the borders between the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnian Muslim republic. These two republics could have special relations with Croatia if the Serbs break up the union of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Bosnian Muslim republic would in that case have the right to join the Croatian state. I will read out several articles: Article 8 says: Signatories to this document are agreed that they will secure for the Bosnian Muslim republic access to the sea in a way not threatening the sovereignty and integrity of the Republic of Croatia and interests of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, taking into consideration the needs and the justified interests of the Bosnian Muslim republic in a way that will ensure permanent cooperation. The Republic of Croatia and the Union of the Republics of Bosnia- Herzegovina are to conclude -- after an agreement on the set-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina within the international conference on former Yugoslavia has come into effect -- agreements on the use of free port zones in the ports of Ploce and Rijeka, in accordance with principles and provisions of the UN convention on transit trade of land-locked countries, i.e. on the principles agreed upon in a draft agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina on board the Invincible. In case the Union of the Republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina ceases to exist, the Republic of Croatia pledges that it will consider the Bosnian Muslim republic a successor to all rights and obligations stemming from the agreement on the use of free port zones. Article 10 says: Signatories to this agreement guarantee that on the territory of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and the Bosnian Muslim republic voluntary and safe return of all refugees to the place of their previous residence will be secured. They accept control and supervision by international bodies in the implementation of this obligation. Article 15 says: The Republic of Croatia believes that in case the Serbs break up the Bosnia-Herzegovina union, it is possible and necessary in the view of protecting and realizing the interests of the Croat and the Bosnian Muslim nations to set up an alliance between the Republic of Croatia and the Bosnian Muslim republic that will be of an economic and defensive nature. In that case, the Republic of Croatia is ready to set up an alliance of states that will have the following goals: -- securing permanent friendship and cooperation; -- securing economic and social development in the common economic area with the gradual creation of a common market, customs union, and coordination of monetary and financial policy with the final goal of creating a monetary union; and -- securing cooperation in the areas of jurisdiction and internal affairs, coordination of their common foreign policy, creation of a joint defense policy, and conclusion of an agreement on cooperation in the spheres of defense and security. I have read out only a few important articles of the agreement. This would not be just an ordinary agreement. Alija Izetbegovic did not accept it straight away, because he linked it with the realization of some issues relating to the territorial settlement in central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to the sea. We shall see 15 January whether the Muslims will accept President Tudjman's proposal. Let us just repeat at the end of this dispatch that the Croatian demand for the Muslim offensive to stop was replied to by an agreement on an immediate cease-fire in central Bosnia, while Generals Roso, Delic, and Briquemont are to meet immediately and issue adequate orders.
