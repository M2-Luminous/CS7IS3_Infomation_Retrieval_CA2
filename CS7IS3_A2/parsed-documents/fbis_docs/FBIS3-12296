This should have been an eye opener for the heedless and fools who are bargaining Palestine away, giving it up chunk by chunk, city by city, and facility by facility. The Bayt al-Maqdis Movement concluded its statement by saying: Relief is not far off and the outlines of victory are apparent on the horizon and God is great.
