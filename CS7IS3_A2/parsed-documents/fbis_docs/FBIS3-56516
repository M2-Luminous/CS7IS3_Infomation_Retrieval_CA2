He had also stressed the political aspect in his work as the defence minister, Luik added. Luik commended the intellectual potential of the Foreign Ministry and hoped that he could exploit it efficiently. He also expressed his confidence that the new Defence Minister Indrek Kannik will manage well. The main guarantee of Estonia's statehood is its impeccable reputation and other countries' awareness of Estonia, Luik went on. It is extremely difficult to interfere in the politics of a peaceful and stable country and there are few states ready for an outright aggression, he stressed. [passage omitted]
