In the report, the EPA said the recent trade policies, which provide for ample funds for research and development in the high-tech area, are effective in giving a competitive edge to U.S. industries and in boosting the economy. It is necessary for world trade partners, however, to establish international rules on government subsidies for high-tech projects in order to head off "subsidy competition," the agency said. The EPA acknowledged that the U.S. trade policies are generally based on free trade principles and promoting market opening by its world trade partners. But U.S. antidumping legislation is protectionist and blocks the rational pricing of goods by foreign companies that mass produce their goods and sell in bulk, the EPA said. The U.S. antidumping policy should be discussed at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it added. The EPA report was compiled by private-sector experts and academics on trade.
