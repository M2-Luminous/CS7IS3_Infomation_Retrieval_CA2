This gang is arresting and torturing these nationals, and forcing them to make false confessions that they are engaged in alleged military actions. They are being portrayed as prisoners of war captured in the battlefield. These criminal acts are manifestations of cheap blackmail. Similarly, they are lowly attempts to delude the world into believing that the countries of these innocent victims are involved in the Yemeni crisis. These cheap acts, and similar other criminal and inhuman acts, such as using the elderly, women, and children as human shields; dropping booby-trapped pens, toys, and sweets to kill innocent children; and using banned missiles of mass destruction run counter to all universal conventions. Likewise, they violate the Geneva conventions and their two supplementary protocols. While denouncing these criminal acts, the Yemeni Peace and Solidarity Council urges all international organizations, and the International Committee of the Red Cross to condemn these violations of human values and principles, and international norms and conventions, as well. It also urges them to vindicate the Yemeni people and support them against the enemies of their unity, constitutional legitimacy, and democratic experiment.
