Let me draw your attention to a detailed report about the president's remarks in this ceremony. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani stressed that the issue of a dynamic theology [ejtehad-e zendeh] and a correspondence [entebaq] between Islam and the demands of the day, an issue which was first raised by martyr Motahhari, is one of the most fundamental bases and most important jurisprudential criteria required in today's society. According to our correspondent, the president explained: The danger of ossification still threatens the Islamic revolution. Thinkers and knowledgeable people have the duty to clarify further for today's humanity the question of the balance [tavazon] between rationality and the divine Shari'ah as the basis of the reasoning underlying our revolution's progress. This task requires courageous and strong thinkers who can present pure Islam without fear. The president added: Fatwas [religious edicts] and strong jurisprudential [feqhi] principles based on the requirements of the day are the object of concern of Islamic law-making. The fact that the Islamic revolution has remained upright and strong in the face of the most powerful enemies and is continuing its eternal life is due to the firmness of its ideological pillars and the correctness of its foundations and, consequently, to the correspondence of its principles to the requirements of the time. He said: The Islamic government has now given a good form to our society and it has proven, by denying the idea of the incompatability between the principles of Islamic jurisprudence and the circumstances of the time and the advances made by today's civilization, that it is one of the most successful revolutions of the world. In his remarks about the issue of the corresspondence between Islam and the requirements of the day, Mr. Rafsanjani stressed the importance of distinguishing these requirements on the basis of Islamic expertise and by qualified and knowledgeable people.
