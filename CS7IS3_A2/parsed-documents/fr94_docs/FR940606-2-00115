This hearing is being held pursuant to section 101 of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (Mine Act). The hearing will be held in Morgantown, West Virginia. This notice should be read in conjunction with the joint notice published elsewhere in today's Federal Register by the Department of Labor and the Department of Health and Human Services.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Silvey, Director, Office of Standards, Regulations and Variances, MSHA, (703) 235&hyph;1910. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 18, 1994, MSHA published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8356) announcing its intention to use both single, full-shift respirable dust measurements and the average of multiple, full-shift respirable dust samples to determine noncompliance and issue citations for violations of the respirable dust standard under the MSHA coal mine respirable dust program. Concurrently, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services jointly published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 8357) announcing a new finding that the average concentration of respirable dust to which each miner in the active workings of a coal mine is exposed can be accurately measured over a single shift in accordance with section 202(f)(2) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Based on this finding, the Secretaries are proposing to rescind the finding issued on July 17, 1971, and affirmed on February 23, 1972, described in the accompanying notice elsewhere in today's Federal Register . The comment periods for these notices were scheduled to close on April 19, 1994, but, in response to requests from the mining community for additional time in which to prepare their comments, MSHA extended the comment period to May 20, 1994 (59 FR 16958). The purpose of the public hearing is to receive relevant comments and to answer questions concerning the notices. This hearing will be conducted in an informal manner by a panel of MSHA officials. Although formal rules of evidence or cross examination will not apply, the presiding official may exercise discretion to ensure the orderly progress of the hearing and may exclude irrelevant or unduly repetitious material and questions. The hearing will begin with an opening statement from MSHA, followed by an opportunity for members of the public to make oral presentations. The hearing panel will be available to address relevant questions. At the discretion of the presiding official, speakers may be limited to a maximum of 20 minutes for their presentations. In the interests of conducting a productive hearing, MSHA will schedule speakers in a manner that allows all points of view to be heard as effectively as possible. Verbatim transcripts of the proceedings will be prepared and made a part of the rulemaking record. Copies of the hearing transcripts will be made available to the public for review.
