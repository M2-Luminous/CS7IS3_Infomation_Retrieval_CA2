Compared with the "good old days" of the leading Antioquian textile mills in early 1993, profits reported for the third quarter of last year indicate that it was not a good year, nor is the situation expected to improve in 1994. Even though factories have not announced the results of operations leading into 1993, smuggling, underbilling, and money laundering combine to indicate that it is highly unlikely that losses built up during the year will be recovered during the final four months. Another reflection of the situation appeared in December when Fabricato, COLTEJER [Colombian Textile Company], and Tejicondor shares were among the five companies whose quotes suffered the steepest drops. COLTEJER, which in 1992 earned profits of 10 billion pesos, ended the third quarter of 1993 with losses totaling 7.336 billion pesos. Fabricato began 1993 with profits of 9.499 billion, but by the third quarter, results totaled scarcely 504 million. In 1992, Tejicondor earned net profits of 3.565 billion pesos. However, by the close of the third quarter, it had earned only 526 million. More Smuggling "We did lose money, but we still do not know how much," said Tejicondor President Abel Perez Gil in summing up 1993, a year that saw 3,000 workers laid off by the country's 500 textile companies. Perez reported that the company's sales were 18 percent lower than anticipated at the start of 1993. Last year, only 41 billion pesos worth of goods were sold, compared with a goal of 50 billion. The president of Tejicondor believes that smuggling and the government's inability to control it, despite its intention of imposing port restrictions once again, are the basic causes of the crisis we are facing, a crisis that in 1993 was merely circumstantial, but that now threatens to become structural. "How can we not need restrictions when we are drowning in textiles as a result of underbilling and money laundering?" the business executive asked. In early 1993, the lack of minimum reference prices, combined with subsidized imports and smuggling, resulted in a loss of 30 percent of the domestic market. According to Perez, "fabrics ranging from $.10 to $5.00 are entering the country and, except for Medellin, Customs is not going its job. Furthermore, any estimates of what comes in is false. In addition, the only country with money laundering is Colombia. A laundered dollar is worth only a fourth as much as an official dollar." The businessman said that while it is practically impossible to ascertain the volume of textiles smuggled in or resulting from money from drug trafficking, if Customs seized some 9 million meters of fabric in 1993 (equivalent to Tejicondor's production for three months), much more has come in through undetected operations. According to these estimates, imported textiles have garnered some 30 percent of the market, and 70 percent of all imports comprise unfair competition. Textile workers claim that such measures as minimum import prices for 31 types of textiles have not been as effective as hoped either. They say that, under the circumstances, despite the government's encouraging predictions, the sector's problems will be reflected in the coming annual balance sheets. For the time being, the textile industry knows that the new year has begun, accompanied by adjustments in investment programs, possibly more layoffs of workers, and the discussion of petitions in a number of companies. All signs indicate that any hope of recovering first semester losses during the latter half of 1993 has been thwarted or, more appropriately, unraveled. Consequently, the nation's textile plants are reportedly on the brink of a crisis as serious as the one experienced in the early 1980's.
