The statement says the courageous turnout of the peasants and other people in a struggle for defence of the nation's foundation for existence is an entirely righteous patriotic action. It strongly demands that the Kim Yong-sam group of traitors admit and apologize for its anti-popular criminal act, immediately release the arrested peasants and students and promptly stop the desperate search. Such a thorough-paced pro-American flunkeyist traitor and fascist maniac as Kim Yong-sam can find no shelter in this land, the statement says. The only way out for the peasants and people of other strata is to overthrow the fascist "civilian" regime and establish an independent democratic government, stresses the statement.
