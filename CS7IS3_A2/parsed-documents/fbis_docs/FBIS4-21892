He is 77-year-old Sheykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a former mosque manager and professional Islamic proselytiser. Over the years he has worked in Iran, Kuwait and Algeria spreading the message of Islam. He received Saudi Arabia's FaIsal Prize for Services to Islam in 1989 and a state award from Pakistan in 1990. Sheykh al-Ghazali achieved international notoriety last June when he appeared for the defence in the case of the two alleged assassins of the author Dr Faraj Foudah. Dr Foudah had been murdered by Islamic extremists after his work had been branded apostate. At the trial, al-Ghazali had declared that it was the duty of the government to carry out the death penalty on apostates; if it failed to do so, he made plain, he understood why others should feel entitled to carry out the sentence. In his first interview with the foreign press in many years, al- Ghazali raised the stakes an unhealthy notch by declaring it might become his duty to "mobilise the people and overthrow the government." [passage omitted] Al-Ghazali was accompanied by two watchful sons who monitored the translation. He is small of stature, with a rather cross expression but very courteous and candid. There is a certain heated intensity of manner when defending his faith and castigating the corruption of the West. He claimed to have been able to muster 300,000 faithful for his last oration. Even a third of this figure would be an intimidating congregation to make any president think. [passage omitted] He had made it known through my interpreter that he would answer any question, so I brought up his public defence of the alleged assassins of Dr Foudah. "We find it very hard to understand," I said, "how a scholarly and cultivated person could be seen to be inciting ignorant people to take the law into their own hands." Al-Ghazali denied he had incited anyone to kill. Indeed, he had declared in court that "if everyone did that there would be chaos." But in decribing what had happened in court he made his attitude towards apostates very clear. "I was not in court to issue fatwas," he said, "but as a witness. Faraj Foudah had denied the Rule of Islam to me personally in open debate at the Cairo book fair two years ago. Now a man is free to believe that if he wants to; he can go and sit at home and say it. But this man went out into the streets and worked against the Rule of Islam. This is unacceptable because it strengthens Zionism and colonialism and I am against anything that strengthens these." [passage omitted] What, I asked, would be his attitude to an Egyptian government which failed to carry out its duties towards Islam? "If it does not do so it is up to me to mobilise people to overthrow the government." Was this an eventuality which he felt might arrive in the near future? al-Ghazali laughed and said: "Why overthrow a government when you can organise elections and do it through the ballot box?" But were there free elections in Egypt? "You should be asking that question of the people who rig the ballot boxes." Al-Ghazali is technically an employee of the government in his role of member of the influential Islamic Research Council. [passage omitted] The government would have particular reason to be wary of al- Ghazali. A few months ago the Algerian government accused him of having been instrumental in setting up the resistance movement FIS (Islamic Salvation Front) during the years he spent in Algeria. al- Ghazali had said that in Egypt the state feared the label "Islam" because it was afraid of alienating the West. [passage omitted] "I want my religion to be strong, Because I want my nation to be strong, to be able to defend itself. We are militarily defeated, we are a defeated nation and the only way we can regain our strength and self-respect is through religion." [passage omitted]
