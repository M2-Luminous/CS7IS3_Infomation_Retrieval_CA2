The aid will be handled through the Foreign Ministry's Development Aid Section. "Planning for distribution of the aid will start in January. The aid will partly consist of goods, partly personnel, and partly as direct support," said Humanitarian Aid Section Chief Ritva Jolkkonen. Needs for the aid will be discussed with international relief agencies. This year aid has gone through the UNHCR (United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees), the International Red Cross, and the World Health Organization (WHO). Partly Goods, Partly Money Part of the aid will go as goods, part as money, since at its destination money is needed for purchasing fuel, etc. The aid sent through WHO will be in the form of medical equipment and such items as artificial limbs. Finnish experts can also be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina with the aid money. "The intention is to act now in anticipation of winter needs," Jolkkonen stated.
