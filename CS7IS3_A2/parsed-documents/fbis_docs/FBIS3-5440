As an effort to revitalize the PAKEM [Oversight of Faiths Among the People] Team, Attorney General Singgih, S.H. [Master of Laws], installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team at the Attorney General's Office Building in Jakarta. From the time it was formed in 1949 until 1993, the PAKEM banned 523 faiths. The team's job is to receive and analyze reports and/or information about faiths among the people. The PAKEM Team also has the job of carefully researching and evaluating developments in particular faiths to ascertain their impact on public order and security. At the central level, the team is chaired by the attorney general, with the deputy attorney general for intelligence as deputy chairman. Other members of the PAKEM Team include the director general of sociopolitical affairs of the Department of Home Affairs, the director general of culture at the Department of Education and Culture, the assistant for territorial affairs to the ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] chief of General Staff, the second deputy to the chief of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency, and the director of intelligence and security for the Indonesian Police. As he installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team, Attorney General Singgih said that the heterogeneity of the Indonesian people with respect to ethnic groups, religions, races, classes, cultures, and languages provides potential for the emergence of interference with national unity and integrity. "The Central PAKEM Team has been formed to oversee the activities of faiths to ensure that they will not plunge into endeavors that could threaten the order of society and state under applicable laws," he stated. According to Singgih, the PAKEM Team will also face challenges and obstacles that must be resolved collectively with regard to legal materials, coordination among involved agencies, facilities, and infrastructure. Nevertheless, the attorney general said he was confident that by looking sharply at the problems being faced and by carefully formulating efforts to deal with them--and equipped with the experience of its members--the team will be able to take integrated action to handle the various issues involved in overseeing faiths among the people. Meanwhile, Soeparman, S.H., chief of public relations for the Attorney General's Office, said that the background of the revitalization of the PAKEM Team is the flow of globalization, which makes possible the entrance of foreign or existing faiths that could influence faiths already present in Indonesia. In principle, the government will ban faiths that deviate from GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] provisions on the subject, namely that the promotion of faith in One God must not be oriented to the formation of new religions and that such promotion must be in accordance with the first and second principles of Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state]. Faiths that deviate and are banned are those that are not consistent with Indonesia's national political, economic, social, and cultural conditions, he explained.
