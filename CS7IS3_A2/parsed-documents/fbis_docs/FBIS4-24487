As a first step, Qinghai will begin 28 projects exploiting natural resources this year, according to Governor Tian Chengping. One of them is the second expansion stage of Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Corporation, a key state project. It is expected to get technical help from Israel. The inland province has been trying hard to lure outside investment. Although the efforts have been deterred by the province's arid weather and craggy terrain, Qinghai had acquired $430 million from 14 countries and regions by the end of 1993. Funding has come from the United States, Japan, Australia, and Hong Kong. The local authorities expect that foreign investments and overseas preferential loans to the province will total $200 million this year. The provincial government plans to build hydropower stations on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, opening up oil fields and developing its abundant salt reserves. The province has cooperated extensively with other parts of the nation. In building the huge Lijiaxia Hydropower Station, for example, the province and its neighbours--Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia--are working together. They are sharing 20 percent of the total investment of 3 billion yuan ($348 million) in the station, which is expected to go into operation in 1996. From 1988 through 1993, the province had signed 1,137 cooperative contracts with other parts of the nation, absorbing 384 million yuan ($45 million). The province has also established 384 factories or offices in other parts of China. Qinghai, a province almost as large as France and Britain combined, is lightly populated with 4.6 million people. But it contains 119 minerals of which 48, including salt, oil, gold and nonferrous metals, are among the nation's top 10 reserves. The province is the source of the country's great rivers: The Yangtze [Chiang Jiang], the Yellow, and the Lancang (Mekong), and has abundant hydropower.
