Kamberova: ``Treatment in Wrecked Premises''] [Text] Patients who must be treated in a sterile environment are being treated in humid areas. Health inspectors demand improvements in the overall condition of the clinic. For several months, the Hematology Clinic of the Skopje School of Medicine has existed in a situation bordering on the absurd. Patients who must be hospitalized and treated in sterile premises are being treated in hospital rooms that not only are not properly sterile, but are in ruins. They are perennially humid and quite frequently the sewage pipes leak. The Hematology Clinic of former Yugoslavia was one of the top clinics in terms of technology and personnel, says Docent Doctor Nikola Siljanovski, its director. Currently, it can boast only of its personnel who, he claims, meet all requirements of contemporary hematology and bone marrow transplants. This is the only Macedonian institution to treat blood and blood generating organs (erythrocytes, leucocytes, thrombocytes...). More than 60 percent of hematological diseases of the blood consist of malignant hemopathies. Patients suffering from such afflictions become immunodeficient, Doctor Siljanovski explains. They lack white blood cells, which protect the body. This means that the very methods for the treatment of such patients, at a specific phase in the development of the disease, requires specific conditions, such as treating them in separate wards, isolated and sterile, thus ensuring a high degree of protection from infections. In the past, in the good old times, the proper conditions were observed and the personnel treating such patients were thoroughly protected with special masks. Unfortunately, this is now part of the past. Today there is moisture everywhere, particularly along the walls, broken tiles, and water seeping, most probably from sewer pipes. The premises smell of moisture and rot and, in general, hygiene in the premises is exceptionally poor. The treatment standards are below all standards. Under such poor conditions for treating patients, the logical consequence is worsened health and increased cases of hospital infections. Most of the findings of the inspectors confirm that the sanitary and hygienic conditions of the Hematological Clinic are poor. The inspectors have repeatedly pointed out that the overall working conditions in the clinic, particularly in the test laboratories, must be improved. The inspectors issue their orders to the clinic, which is unable to resolve the problem for the simple reason that such improvements require funds. In addition to the ``communal'' problems, the work of the Hematology Clinic is also made more difficult because of the obsolete equipment, long years of failure to invest in equipment and in building repairs, and the frequent shortage of reagents, substrata, and markers required in genetic methodology. I believe, Doctor Siljanovski said, that hematology has been unfairly neglected. It must be considered part of internal medicine and developed the same as all other medical disciplines. The current inadequate handling of it compromises the exceptionally complex treatment of blood diseases.
