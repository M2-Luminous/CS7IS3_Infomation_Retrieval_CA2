Speaking in parliament, he commended Moscow's recent CIS summit. He said Russia and Kyrgyzstan had signed a cooperation agreement during it, under which Kyrgyzstan is to receive a credit of 50 billion rubles. Dzhumagulov said that, among the priority measures taken by his government since the beginning of the year, were tighter financial control, abolition of the practice of customs and tax concessions, and increasing local government's responsibility for the execution of the central government's decisions. Nevertheless, the economic situation remains "extremely grave," the prime minister said. "There are still no efficient economic ties, the mutual nonpayment crisis is continuing, the economy is out of control, and there is a gap between the production and marketing of output," he said. IF Note: President Askar Akayev is more optimistic. He said in parliament on April 13 that the republic's reforms had produced positive results, "pushing forward the ossified, totally state-run economy." There are "reassuring signs of normalization of the economic situation," Akayev said. He said free prices and the tight monetary policy had had a beneficial effect on Kyrgyzstan's social life. People had started taking interest in business enterprise, which had served to increase goods supplies, he said. "Unless the government in the immediate future raises funds to restructure industry, the latter will destroy itself," Dzhumagulov said. He expressed especial concern over the bankruptcy problem, complaining that not a single enterprise had yet been declared bankrupt, although a law on bankruptcy had come out. The economy would have no future unless unprofitable enterprises were liquidated, he said. Another serious problem is the visible trade deficit, which has topped 400 million soms, the premier said. He said the situation where the country is importing more than it is exporting is bringing to naught all the anti-inflationary measures taken by the government, because, in his view, it is the imported goods that are fueling inflation. For this reason, the government ought to concentrate on measures to stimulate domestic production, he said, vowing once again that all conditions would be provided for small-scale business. He said the government would temporarily reduce taxes to encourage production. Dzhumagulov also said that this year the government, in its economic policy, would give priority to social objectives. It is for this purpose that the government has set up a fund to support poorer population strata. He said it was essential to start the development of the Kumtor gold field as soon as possible, which "would not solve all the problems" but "would be a serious help for the economy of the republic." To the objections of parliament members who had repeatedly demanded that Kyrgyzstan break its agreement on Kumtor, a deposit estimated to contain 516 tonnes of gold, with the Canadian company Cameco and instead put up a tender for its development, Dzhumagulov responded that a tender "would mean nothing but extra expenses and a loss of time."
