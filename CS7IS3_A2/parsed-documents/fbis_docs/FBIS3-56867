The resignation of First Vice-Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and the protracted formation of a new government signify not only a new crisis of power but an entirely new balance of political forces around President Boris Yeltsin who remains the only guarantor of the continuation of reform in Russia. Other "guarantors" have slackened their support for the president. Immediately after his resignation earlier this week Gaydar distanced himself from the loss-making policy of Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, which, he believes, "is leading the country to a sharp financial destabilisation." Georgiy Satarov, a senior adviser to President Yeltsin, said that Gaydar's Russia's Choice bloc "is assuming, in the eyes of the electorate, a role of the defender of the interests of citizens from galloping inflation." Experts and businessmen are unanimous in their predictions of further growth of inflation in the country. Their predictions seem to be coming true as the rouble plunged sharply against the dollar in the last two days, entering a free fall for the first time in months. If Gaydar were concerned about the financial situation in the country, he would do everything possible to preserve the reformist wing of the government, of which, according to a high-ranking source in the Kremlin, he was repeatedly but obviously unsuccessfully persuaded. Therefore one cannot rule out the possibility that by distancing himself from the government Gaydar is starting his own election campaign for the post of Russian president. Numerous interviews by Gennadiy Burbulis in the last few days in which he for the first time criticised some presidential decisions may serve as indirect proof of this version. But so far none of Yeltsin's supporters has offered an alternative reform programme of the continuation of which the president said at his meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Moscow last week. This only goes to prove that what is involved is some secret goals which the Russian leaders prefer to keep to themselves for the time being, rather than key disagreements over basic approaches towards reform. Meanwhile, Chernomyrdin is gaining more political weight in Russian politics. In August 1993, Chernomyrdin stunned the world by his statements concerning the disputed four Kuril islands claimed by Japan. The statements strongly disagreed with the president's position. Now, too, the premier is trying to steer his own course in forming a new government. He is likely to give one of the two posts of first vice-prime ministers in the new cabinet to Oleg Soskovets backed by major industrialists. The other post is likely to go to Aleksandr Zaveryukha, a member of the Agrarian Party of Russia. Additionally, the president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Arkadiy Volskiy, has denied in his interview with ITAR-TASS reports that he had been offered a post in the new government but had rejected the offer. The list of candidates to the key posts in the new cabinet give grounds to speak about Chernomyrdin's orientation to people seeking to support the highly-ineffective state sector in the Russian economy. Considering the premier's reluctance to swap Minister of Finance Boris Fedorov and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, his attitude towards continuing a tough monetary policy becomes more than obvious. The premier's intentions will be welcomed by the agrarians, the communists and centrists in the Federal Assembly. With this in mind, one can easily foresee Chernomyrdin's intention to win support of the parliamentary majority and prepare for the 1996 presidential elections. Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's spectacular ultimatums declared from television screens in which he outlines the conditions of his participation in the new government make one question if he (Yavlinskiy) himself believes in the realisability of his demands. They also show that he is unwilling to take risks and will try to remain an independent "prophet" until the new presidential elections. The disagreements between Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and Russia's Choice and even the president also reflect the prime minister's ambitious aspirations in his bid to win over regional elites to ensure his success at the future elections. The activity of the four aforementioned political groupings show that President Yeltsin is losing his allies who seem to have admitted his "fatigue" and started working for their own political future. Considering the approaching presidential elections, their behaviour could look natural if it were not for the danger of a new vacuum of power from which no one is secured even by vast constitutional powers of the president. As Yeltsin's Spokesman Vycheslav Kostimov has rightfully said, the constitution is only a "big promise," which may or may not be fulfilled. In this situation the danger comes not so much from the threat of reform curtailment as from a new spiral of struggle for power which may seriously shake up Russia.
