FBIS4-24225 "drafr123_c_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Spending on Social Services Detailed Spending on Social Services Detailed MB2506083494 Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN in English 24-30 Jun 94 p 34 MB2506083494 Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN English BFN [Report by Reg Rumney] [Text] The money in the Budget for job creation demonstrates once again the difficulty of spending money allocated for certain socially desirable purposes -- and the spending constraints faced by Finance Minister Derek Keys and his team. R292-million [rand] is allocated for job creation, outside of any further money for this purpose that might come from the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP] R2.5-billion fund for this fiscal year. But around R247-million of that is rolled over from the last fiscal year, with only R45-million being added to the allocation. In general, while the RDP fund gathers steam, non-RDP spending in fields where apartheid left big backlogs is restrained. Spending on health dropped two percent in real terms at R14-billion, although the shift in spending is seen in the rise in the primary health care portion to 25 percent of the total health care budget at the expense of secondary and tertiary health care. Spending on social security and welfare rose 20.5 percent to R13,015-billion, yet this translates, according to the South African Council for the Aged, to a disappointing R13 a month increase in social pensions. Spending on housing is up 15.6 percent above the amount voted for 1993/94, but at R2.2-billion falls far short of some estimates of the kind of money needed to attack the housing backlog. Again, the money will have to come from the RDP. To be fair, spending on social services has to be looked at over a longer period to get perspective. Spending on protection, which includes defence, has declined as a percentage of total spending from 21.8 percent in the 1990/91 budget to 18.1 percent in the 1994/95 budget. Over the same period social spending has risen from 41.3 percent to 45.0 percent, or 19.1 percent a year to make up 14.3 percent of gross domestic product. Within social spending education has risen to 22.0 percent of the Budget, from an already high 20.9 percent -- education spending represents seven percent of gross domestic product for this fiscal year. Spending by most departments was cut back to find the R2.5-billion for the RDP. But transition costs associated with security during the election negated any "post-apartheid dividend". The disastrous National Peace-Keeping Force exercise alone swallowed up R384.5-million. While the defence budget was cut by R650-million, transition costs push it up again this fiscal year. So spending on protection services actually rises by R2,309-billion, or 10 percent, slightly above inflation. Within that defence spending, widely seen as a source of money for diversion to social spending, rose by 13.5 percent. And the South African National Defence Force has released a document arguing that the defence budget will have to increase in future, and cutbacks have harmed defence capabilities.
