FR940721-1-00053 FR940721-1-00013 Classification This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. This rule contains a collection-of-information requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). This requirement has been approved previously by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Control Number 0648&hyph;0230). The reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average approximately 80 hours for permit applications, 0.5 hours for certificate of inclusion applications and 0.5 hours for reports. These estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the National Marine Fisheries Service (F/PR), 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503 (Attn: Paperwork Reduction Act Project 0648&hyph;0230). The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, would not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the proposed rule establishes a discretionary permitting procedure that will, by itself, have no economic impact on fisherman. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. The AA prepared an EA for this proposed rule that concludes that the rule would have no significant impact on the human environment. A copy of the EA is available (see ADDRESSES ) and comments on it are requested.
