The reclassification of objects (or assets) constituting municipal property as the state property of members of the Russian Federation or federal property will be carried out with the consent of agencies of local self-government or by court order.

Other prerogatives of local self-government, as specified in the Law of the Russian Federation "On Local Self-Government in the Russian Federation," will be exercised by the local administration. 3. The decisions of agencies of local self-government may be rescinded only in judicial proceedings. When certain state prerogatives are transferred to agencies of local self-government, a procedure may be stipulated for the rescission of the decisions of the agencies of local self-government by the transferring government agency. 4. Local self-government leaders will be empowered to hold a local referendum on the draft statute on local self-government (or charter), preside over meetings of elected representative bodies of local self-government, and serve as the heads of the corresponding administrations. 5.
