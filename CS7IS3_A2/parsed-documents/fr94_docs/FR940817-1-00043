FR940817-1-00043 FR940817-1-00013 Part 66 Under the proposal, a new Part 66 prescribing the certification requirements solely for aviation maintenance personnel would be created. Part 66 would include Subpart A (General), Subpart B (Aviation Maintenance Technicians), and Subpart C (Aviation Repair Specialists). Subpart A (General) would be based on Part 65, Subpart A and modified to address regulatory concerns applicable to aviation maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists. The proposal would establish the new part under the title ``Certification: Aviation Maintenance Technicians and Aviation Repair Specialists.'' Section 66.1 The proposed §66.1 sets forth the applicability of Part 66. This proposed section is based upon §65.1 of the current FAR. This section would limit the applicability of this new part to aviation maintenance technicians and aviation repair specialists. Section 66.3 The proposed §66.3 prescribes the certification requirements for foreign aviation maintenance technicians. This proposed section is based on §65.3 of the current FAR. There are no substantive differences between the proposed section and the current §65.3. Section 66.11 The proposed §66.11 prescribes the application and issuance procedures for a certificate and ratings under this part. This proposed section is based on §65.11 of the current FAR. There are no substantive differences between paragraphs (a) through (c) of the proposed section and the current §65.11. Paragraph (d) of the proposed rule would not change the substantive provisions of §65.11 as it applies to aviation maintenance personnel; however, it differs from the current §65.11 in that it removes provisions that are only applicable to air traffic control operators, aircraft dispatchers, and parachute riggers. Sections 66.12, 66.13 The proposed §§66.12 and 66.13 are based on current §§65.12 and 65.13. These sections refer to offenses involving alcohol or drugs and temporary certificates. There are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65. Section 66.15 The proposed §66.15 is based upon the current §65.15 and establishes the duration of certificates issued under this part. The proposed rule corrects an earlier omission by including the aviation repair specialist certificate (experimental aircraft builder) among those certificates that are effective until surrendered, suspended, or revoked. Section 66.16 The proposal would revise current procedures by permitting an airman who has lost a certificate issued under Part 66 to request a facsimile of the certificate from the FAA as confirmation of the certificate's original issuance. The proposal also would allow any request to the FAA to be made by facsimile and would permit the FAA to send directly to the airman a facsimile that may be carried by the airman, for a period not to exceed 60 days, as proof of the original certificate's issuance. Sections 66.17, 66.18, 66.19, 66.20, 66.21, 66.23 The proposed §§66.17, 66.18, 66.19, 66.20, 66.21, and 66.23 are based on current §§65.17, 65.18, 65.19, 65.20, 65.21, and 65.23. These sections refer to written test general procedures, cheating or other unauthorized conduct on written tests, retesting after failure, falsification of documents, changes of address, and the refusal to submit to a drug test. There are no substantive differences between these proposed sections for Part 66 and current corresponding sections in Part 65. Part 66 Subpart B The structure of Part 66, Subpart B, is based upon the current structure of Part 65, Subpart D. Under the proposed rule, the title of Part 66, Subpart B, would become ``Aviation Maintenance Technicians.''
