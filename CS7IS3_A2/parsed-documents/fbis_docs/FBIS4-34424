Representatives and leaders of the transportation sector and 5 July Cooperative President Eudis Febres, 5 July Cooperative Treasurer Saul Verdones, and Jesus Aquiles Rondon, secretary general of the Bus Drivers Union, think it is suspicious that the protest began with the burning of tires at approximately 0730 and that the police did not arrive until after midday. Very few students participated in the incidents. The few that did are activists of the Democratic Action Party [AD] and were led by Eudis Marin. We have no idea how he is connected to these incidents. We have learned that Marin is not a student but an AD activist.
