Sathaphon Kawitanon, the secretary-general of the Board of Investment [BoI], said the ceremony will be held before the seminar on investment in Vietnam co-organised by the State Committee for Cooperation and Investment and the BoI. The four projects comprise: -- the joint investment to establish the Siam-Vina Bank between Thailand's Siam Commercial Bank, the Charoen Phokhaphan Group and the Vietnam Bank of Agriculture -- joint cooperation in developing an industrial estate between the Bang Pakong Industrial Park and Sonadezi Bien Hoa; -- a joint investment project worth 400 million baht involving mining by the U-Surint Industrial Group with Vietnamese state-run authority partners, and -- a contract between Thailand's Advance Paint and Chemical Co and Vietnam's Ngan Hua Economic and Engineering Consultants and Dong Tam. Mr Sathaphon, who led a group of 70 prominent Thai businessmen joining the Chuan delegation, said the visit would boost confidence in investment here and remind businessmen to take genuine action for investment on a long-term basis. He said the failure of previous visits by groups of businessmen several years ago was because of improper investment regulations on the Vietnamese side. The situation had now changed, especially Hanoi's investment rules and regulations, which would help induce more investment from overseas. "I don't think it is too late for Thai businessmen to invest in Vietnam. We are not a very rich country, so we have to be careful where we put our money. We have to take time surveying places where there is high potential. Mr Chuan yesterday witnessed two agreement signing ceremonies, on tourism cooperation between the two countries and a joint business council between the Federation of Thai Industries and Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry. PM's Office Minister Sawit Phothiwihok said cooperation in tourism would cover the liberalisation of air territories for Vietnamese airlines to fly over Thailand to other destinations worldwide. Cooperation on air traffic control between the two countries would be processed under the agreement. Consultation on further investment in tourism-related businesses including hotels and tourist companies, would take place later. Meanwhile, Vietnam's request for a loan of US$100 million from Thailand to develop its infrastructure has been agreed in principle by the Finance Ministry, according to Wichit Suphinit, the governor of the Bank of Thailand. Mr Wichit revealed after a meeting with Finance Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin yesterday that the Hanoi Government had submitted a letter asking for a $100-million loan from the Thai Government through the Bank of Thailand. The central bank approved the request and agreed to find the funds as soon as possible because the loan was indispensable for the development of the country, he said. The loan will be a syndicated one since Thailand does not have adequate funds allocated for the purpose. The Krung Thai Bank and the Export-Import Bank of Thailand were asked to coordinate with local and foreign banks to mobilise the funds. "The interest rate has not been discussed as Hanoi has yet to send a withdrawal plan to the central bank and terms and conditions must be agreed upon among syndicated banks. But the rate will be fixed as is the normal practice for syndicated loans," said Mr Wichit. A Thai working group is already present in Vietnam. It will negotiate at a certain level with the Hanoi Government prior to Mr Wichit's arrival. The negotiations will be finalised in Chiang Mai next Friday. Mr Wichit added that after discussing the issue with Krung Thai Bank president Sirin Nimmanhemin -- the coordinator of the loan -- that proceedings for implementing the loan would go ahead as soon as possible. Coordination among syndicated banks will be concluded by next Wednesday and the contract is expected to be signed by Friday. The loan marks one of the most important syndicated loans between Thailand and Vietnam. It would indirectly serve as an instrument to promote Thai investment in Vietnam, he added. Mr Wichit said the loan was quite similar to the Indochina Fund, except for certain terms and conditions. The funds would be injected into infrastructure projects or re-lent to the private sector for the same purpose. The Indochina Fund lends directly to each project, with the feasibility and validity of each project evaluated by a special unit. The Bank of Thailand is also considering setting up such a unit to support the continued and quickly expanding investments in the country, he said. Should Thailand ignore the opportunity, it will fail to benefit from the current favourable liquidity situation, part of which will come from foreign funds using Thailand as a base to distribute their capital to Indochina. Finance Minister Tharin said he had discussed with M.R. Pridiyathon Thewakun, the president of the Export-Import Bank, seeking banks to join the syndicated loan. He said the loan would be long-term and the rate would not be a major concern as Vietnam was mobilising funds to develop itself. The loan would serve as an index for Thai banks lending to Indochinese countries, including foreign banks operating in Thailand, said Mr Tharin. "The loan is endorsed by the credit of the Hanoi Government. Therefore, the types and specifications of projects will not be required. The Vietnam Government has full authority to decide which projects will get the money," said Mr Tharin.
