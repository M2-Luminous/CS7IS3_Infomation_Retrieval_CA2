Chiefs of banks, exchanges, and investment companies are sorry about this decision, and they are concerned about the upcoming changes. Other IZVESTIYA readers express a rather different point of view. We considered it possible to acquaint you with their stance too. Aleksandr Vladislavlev, vice president of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs: "Yegor Gaydar has theoretically made the right choice by leaving the government, but he gave the wrong reasons for his step. His problem is not a difference of opinion with other government members, but a difference of opinion with the people. It is a good thing if both he and his supporters understand this now. "The president, it seems to me, cannot fail to take into consideration the undoubted fact that today the `ruling party,' so to speak, associated with Gaydar's team is a source of public allergy. This team has made reforming the economy its own exclusive right. "Now it appears that this team is prepared to shed responsibility, transferring it to those who have tried to display common sense and avoid national disillusionment in the reforms. The departure of the `architect' who built the country's future on the sand of naive ideas gives us a chance to place the reforms on a more solid foundation." Viktor Gulov, chairman of the "Kuzminichi" joint stock company in Kaluga Oblast: "Any changes in the government are painful to those of us who are involved in agricultural production. Because amid the half-market economy we are nevertheless forced to be involved in finding our way, blazing a trail, and so on. The newly reformed farms (the former sovkhozes and kolkhozes) have their own specific development programs. But their implementation depends entirely on various government officials. Gaydar promised the agrarians a great deal at the end of last year. It will be disappointing if, with Yegor Timurovich's departure, his promises are forgotten. "In principle this is not even about Gaydar. Before and during his time, attention paid to the agricultural producer has always been all talk, and unfortunately it will be the same after his time. Exorbitant credits, debts which the state is not paying off, the daunting prices of industrial goods. Was Gaydar able to change this situation? No. "And anyway it is not Gaydar who is giving us a headache. He will not disappear... But the spring sowing is just around the corner. We need to have plenty of fuel and seed, we need equipment to be repaired... I am sorry, but `Gaydars' come and go, whereas the grain has to be sown every year. Under any government."
