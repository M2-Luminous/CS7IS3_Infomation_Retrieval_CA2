At the same time, another group of intruders robbed a money exchange office which was located next door. Party leader Aleksandr Krasnov is sure it was a mock robbery, since only 2,000 roubles (about one dollar) were stolen, while the real aim of the break-in was to scare party-members. Last fall, Krasnov, a scientist and former chairman of the Moscow Krasnopresnenskiy District Soviet, reportedly supported the dissolved parliament in its stand-off with President Boris Yeltsin.
