There is muttering, an abandoning of serious argument, and a lot of bad temper, with people saying that nothing good can come of this electoral campaign which, if one listens to the forecasts, sees the League-Forza Italia pole speeding like a freight train across the Lombard prairie. What does Professor Gianfranco Miglio think of this? Miglio was one of the first, months ago, to warn the League against the danger of so many former Christian Democrats and former Socialists jumping onto the Berlusconi bandwagon. "At the end of all this we will, as always, have our usual major success in Lombardy, and Silvio Berlusconi will also be discreetly successful. But I have observed that his team, in fact, has made slightly hurried choices. They have been precipitous and frivolous, and have chosen people who are visibly remote-controlled by the old Christian Democratic bosses. Although I have to recognize one thing." [LA REPUBBLICA] What, professor? [Miglio] In a country in which everyone was Christian Democrat, even the dogs and cats, it becomes very difficult indeed to find anyone who did not compromise with the DC [Christian Democratic Party]. I still feel that with a bit of patience they could have found other people and they recognize this. But they had very little time, with the obvious consequences. Right now that is the reaction among the League, which is ultimately a good thing. [LA REPUBBLICA] And why? [Miglio] Because it shows that the League is not like I slightly feared, given their largely Christian Democratic origin. They are not people disposed to compromise, they react very negatively to the prospect of having to set aside the League's program. In fact we are finding that the League is very stubborn. [LA REPUBBLICA] Professor, you are not one of those who believe that, ultimately, the League could end up weakened by the agreement with Silvio Berlusconi? [Miglio] No, because those who used to say: "I like the League's principles, but not the League's members, because they are coarse and churlish," are now voting for Berlusconi and in this way their votes are going to the alliance. [LA REPUBBLICA] In the meantime [Northern League Secretary] Bossi continues to prick his Forza Italia ally. [Miglio] Excuse me, is your conception of the alliance like the way people used to see marriage? A union for life, until death? This is rubbish. We are talking about something else. Both the progressive line-up and our own have made purely electoral agreements. And our alliance will last until the evening of 28 March. [LA REPUBBLICA] And then, Professor Miglio, what will happen? [Miglio] Then we shall see how many votes and what cards everyone holds and the game will begin. And we will see how the elected representatives will vote in parliament, whether the Popular Party people, [Pact for Italy leader] Mario Segni's people, and the DC people who have wormed their way into Berlusconi's party, will hear the same tune and vote together.
