FR940805-2-00084 FR940805-2-00049 MASTER MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING between the ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE and the BUREAU of LAND MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR This MASTER MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (MOU) is made and entered into by and between the UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, hereinafter referred to as the BLM, and UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, ANIMAL AND PLANT HEALTH INSPECTION SERVICE, hereinafter referred to as APHIS-ADC. I. Purpose The purpose of this MOU is to: (1) identify responsibilities in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of the respective agencies and foster a partnership in discharging the Federal obligation under the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931 (46 Stat. 1468, 7 U.S.C. 426&hyph;426b), as amended, for the management of wild vertebrates causing damage on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) 43 U.S.C. Section 1201 et seq.; (2) establish general guidelines to assist field personnel in carrying out their animal damage management (ADM) responsibilities consistent with the policies of BLM and APHIS-ADC; (3) strengthen the cooperative approach to ADM on BLM lands through exchange of information and mutual program support; and (4) reaffirm working relationships with State governments. II. Statement of Mutual Interest and Responsibilities The parties recognize the importance of effective ADM on lands under the administrative jurisdiction of the BLM, including control of predation by individual animals or local populations to achieve land and resource management objectives. Further, it is mutually recognized that the tools and procedures available for managing populations must be used in a professional manner according to a plan developed in compliance with NEPA, the Endangered Species Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and the Animal Damage Control Act. Both agencies have an interest in limiting damage caused by and to wildlife, so as to protect other multiple-use values. They also agree that in evaluating the need for, and in conducting ADM programs, multiple-use values must be considered. The parties also recognize that: A. The BLM administers public lands located primarily in the Western States and Alaska amounting to about 270 million acres. These lands and resources are managed under multiple-use principles providing for a variety of uses, including timber harvesting, recreation, livestock grazing, mining and mineral development and fish and wildlife habitat management under the laws of Congress and regulations of the Department of the Interior. B. The States are responsible for managing the resident wildlife within their respective borders on land owned by the United States, including lands within the jurisdiction of the BLM. For purposes of this agreement, the term ``wildlife'' shall not include wild horses or burros, as defined in Public Law 92&hyph;195 dated December 15, 1971. The State responsibilities include regulation of wildlife populations so the habitat on public lands will ensure productivity for future wildlife populations. C. The APHIS-ADC is the agency with the authority and expertise under the Animal Damage Control Act of March 2, 1931, as amended, and the Rural Development, Agriculture and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 1988 for providing ADM services. This includes maintaining technical expertise in the science of ADC, control tools and techniques; conducting ADM research and management programs, and ensuring NEPA compliance on activities related to predator control primarily for livestock protection on public lands. TO IMPLEMENT THE FOREGOING, the parties agree as follows where BLM lands are involved: III. The BLM Shall A. Cooperate with APHIS-ADC in the development and annual review of ADM plans affecting BLM lands and resources on those lands and ensure that they are consistent with FLPMA. B. Provide information to APHIS-ADC as to where control actions should be prohibited or restricted for public safety reasons relating to resource management plans conformance. C. When requested, provide information and assistance to APHIS-ADC during the NEPA process. D. Complete NEPA compliance for nonpredator ADM activities initiated by BLM to protect natural resources and facilities. IV. The APHIS-ADC Shall A. Evaluate ADM needs in cooperation with State agencies and permittees.
