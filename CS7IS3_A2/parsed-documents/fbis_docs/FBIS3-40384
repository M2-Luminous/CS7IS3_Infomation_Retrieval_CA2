Nevertheless, the company achieved a turnover of some 50 million German marks [DM] there in the 1991/92 fiscal year. Heinz Nixdorf, the dominant patriarch of the former Nixdorf Computer AG while he was alive, would not hear of contacts with the East. At an international Cebit press conference he called the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] a "shit country" [as published], and he thought just the same about other nations in eastern Europe. He therefore did no business with the East. The COCOM [Coordinating Committee for East-West Trade Policy] rules also obliged Siemens AG to exercise restraint in its IT business, and the only remarkable activities it developed before the eastern markets opened up were in the rail transport and telecommunications sectors in the former Czechoslovakia. But immediately after the reunification Siemens Nixdorf Eastern Europe GmbH (SNO) was set up in Dresden with the aim of "meeting the demands and requirements of industry and society in the reformed states of central and eastern Europe and central Asia in the best possible way." It currently employs about 300 people, coordinating the activities of the regional agencies it has had in Moscow, Prague and Warsaw since 1990 and in Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Kiev (Ukraine) since 1992. This year an office was also opened in Bratislava, Slovak Republic. Most of the staff of the regional establishments are nationals. SNO offers the entire range of SNI products and services. Investments in services and partnerships are to the fore in almost all new business. For example, SNO is cooperating with national companies in production, development, sales, service and training in order to meet the specific national IT requirements in the best possible way. According to SNO, the promotion of partnerships is also "intended to contribute to value creation in the country." With Russian partners SNO has developed the Polis police information system to national specifications, based on similar systems in Germany and other European countries. Polis is being introduced at central, regional and municipal levels in Russia. A follow-up order has already been received from Kazakhstan. A contract has been signed with the Ministry of the Interior under which police offices in Kazakhstan's 23 regions will be equipped with a total of 700 video terminals. In addition to the hardware and software, training and after-sales service will also be provided. Installation will begin before the end of 1993 and will be completed in three years. An SNI mainframe with the BS2000 operating system will handle data management and data security at police headquarters in Almaty. Middle-power range Sinix systems operate as communications servers in a country-wide network, while PC's or workstations are used as video terminals. Among other things, Polis includes a relational database and optical archiving and image processing components. The Kazakhstan police will use it as an information and investigation system and for processing cases. SNO is also cooperating with the NIZEVT Computer Technology Scientific Research Institute in Moscow. At an investment cost of DM3 million and with a significant input from NIZEVT staff, SNO has developed a migration concept from "Eser" (uniform system of electronic computer technology in the former CMEA [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance] area) to BS2000 and set up a demonstration computer center. Earlier Siemens Contacts Helpful In the Czech Republic SNO is benefiting from the comparatively favorable free-market conditions and earlier Siemens contacts in the telecommunications sector. Among others, a project has been carried out for the foreign insurance section of Czech Insurance with the VESYS program package, using an SNI H60 system. The Czech social insurance is also going for SNO/SNI, and has had 97 Sinix MX300-60 systems with a total of 1500 PC workstations installed in its branch offices. SNO is undertaking automatic passenger handling for the Czech State Railway CD; five years ago Siemens-Nixdorf technology was used to automate freight wagon circulation for the then Czechoslovak State Railway. SNO has supplied the Slovak Republic's largest bank, the General Credit Bank Bratislava, with 70 automatic teller machines, connected online to the authorization center in Bratislava. SNO is paying particular attention to basic and advanced training for its own and its clients' personnel. Besides imparting basic knowledge wherever SNI systems are installed, SNO says it is also offering courses in software development, data communications, marketing, management and work methods, basic business management, and foreign languages, among others. SNO is also setting up training centers where major potential customers are located, mainly to provide software training in the respective national languages. In some cases training is also given at its own training center in the West or in cooperation with foreign educational establishments. Over DM4 million have been invested in the Moscow training center. It now has four rooms available for a total of 80 trainees. Mostly, courses are given on the MS-DOS and Unix/Sinix system management, the BS2000 system administration, and network management. There are 60 types of courses in all. In addition, special courses for particular projects or clients are arranged when required. The range of services offered is also extensive. It consists of four complex units, within which clients can select modules to suit their requirements. The units are: system servicing, security systems, infrastructure, networks, and additional services which cover also other firms' hardware and software used in conjunction with SNI products. Whether in planning, execution, training or service, in all fields SNO cooperates with partners and potential clients to identify their specific requirements. They are explicitly seeking to avoid grafting on ready-made western solutions.
