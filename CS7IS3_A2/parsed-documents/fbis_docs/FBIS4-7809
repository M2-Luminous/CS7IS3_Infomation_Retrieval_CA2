The legal initiative of the Commission for Defense, Public Order, and National Security is part of the package of laws that will form the necessary legal framework for the organization and functioning of an important component in the structure of the intelligence system. The document, which is the first legal project that refers to the Foreign Intelligence Service, is notable through a number of distinctive features compared to the document referring to the Romanian Intelligence Service [SRI]. Thus, we asked Senator Radu Timofte, president of the Senate's Defense Commission, to comment briefly on this subject. [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, the commission that you are heading has submitted the draft law on the organization and functioning of the Foreign Intelligence Service to the Permanent Bureau of the Senate. There was no such law during the interwar period in Romania and there is no such law in many other countries because the activity of the respective services is carried out only in accordance with internal operational rules. Then why is such a law necessary now? [Timofte] The assistance of such a law is needed to enable us to oversee the organization and functioning of the SIE, because of the specific and complex nature of its activity, as well as because of the duty -- established by the Constitution and by the law on national security -- that an authorized body such as the SIE should operate in accordance with the law. Thus, we will coordinate our activity with the legislation currently effective in our country. According to the law on national security, the activity of the SIE will be organized and controlled by Romania's Supreme Defense Council and will also be supervised by the parliament. [Radulescu] In connection with this parliamentary supervision, Article 2 of the respective law stipulates that this control will be carried out "through the special commission of the two chambers of the Parliament." Will a new commission be established or will the current "Vacaru Commission" take over this task as well? [Timofte] Through this draft law, we are trying to enable the current commission that is in charge of supervising the SRI activity to expand its control over the SIE as well. This is the wish of those who initiated this document. However, I do not know to what extent the parliament will like this idea. I am already anticipating stormy debates on this subject, because many people will want the Parliament's Defense Commission to carry out this control of the SIE activity. The reason for choosing the "Vacaru Commission" for this job is linked to the wish and the need to limit the number of those who come into contact with and have access to information that the SIE is dealing with. [Radulescu] However, by limiting the number of those who have access to such information, more power is given to the control commission, which will have access both to the SRI and the SIE information. How will the Parliament react to such a situation? [Timofte] That is precisely why I said that there will be a heated discussion on this subject. My personal opinion is identical with the stipulation of the law. If the parliament rejects this idea, then the control over SIE will pass to the two defense commissions. [Radulescu] What other sensitive articles are included in the respective law? [Timofte] When the law was submitted to the Permanent Bureau of the Parliament, I requested that the Commission in charge of human rights should also be informed about it. Thus, I would like to stress the idea that in no way will the law on the organization and functioning of this service harm the citizen or his rights. Certainly, any of the articles of the respective law might become sensitive at one point and positive or negative examples from the legislation of other countries might be brought up at any time. I hope that no particular problem will be encountered before the law is endorsed, as long as this service carries out its activity in accordance with its own rules. We tried to avoid as many problems as possible. I could give you an example regarding the "way in which the service carries out covert activities." Had we not included such a stipulation in the draft law, useless and interminable discussions in the parliament on the issue would have followed. I would like to mention once again that it is not the law that has to include sensitive issues but the SRI regulations. [Radulescu] Mr. Senator, compared to the SRI, the SIE seems to have a preferential regime, although it is also under the parliament's control. I am talking about the way in which reports are submitted and the level at which they are submitted. Could the SRI react to this or could there be an unprofitable competition between the two services? [Timofte] According to the law, the opening of the SIE toward the parliament and the coordination of its activity by Romania's Supreme Defense Council is carried out annually or when the situation requires it. This is identical with the situation when the director submits a report on the way the service carries out its duty. The fact that the SRI submits reports to the parliament and the SIE to the Supreme Defense Council means precisely that access to information that cannot be made public is limited as much as possible. Debates on such a report in the parliament might have a negative effect on the activity of the service and even on national security. Theoretically, there is no reason why this "discrimination" should stir adverse reactions because the SIE and the SRI are in charge of completely different areas, which exclude competition. It is true that both services carry out their activity in the field of national security, but one carries out its activity inside, the other one outside, the country. No competition can arise in such circumstances. One might rather talk about cooperation because, in the activity carried out beyond the country's borders, one could encounter such situations that might affect the country's internal situation. And this is the area in which the two services, I mean all the structures of the intelligence services, have to cooperate.
