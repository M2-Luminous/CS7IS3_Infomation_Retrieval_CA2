Mosquera said the reports were "journalistic interpretations," stressing that "the PC will help the Grand Front to develop, working with others as a group." The press report saying that the PC would be dissolved and later reappear as a new force within the Grand Front provoked "surprise and indignation" among the party ranks. Mosquera admitted, however, that "an internal proposal was made before 10 April" which sought "to give new life to the party." The bitter infighting within the PC increased following the Grand Front's spectacular growth. The old guard that makes up the current PC leadership has suggested few, very few, figures for the alliance: One example is Attorney Eduardo Barcesat. The candidacy of Patricio Echegaray for the position of secretary general, for instance, was rejected by the other front members. "The key to the success of the front was to appeal to different political groups. The Grand Front ticket included Communist as well as other party leaders. This plurality was the key to the 10 April election success," Mosquera said. PC leader Horacio Lopez denied they ever considered dissolving the historic PC. He said: "We are witnessing a new maneuver to derail the left at a time the party is consolidating its position as a valid alternative to the social and economic model. The intention is to create uncertainty and confusion among authentic progressive forces, seeking to reduce their real electoral possibilities in 1995." Communist leaders Eduardo Barcesat and Maria Ines Brasesco were elected as constituent members in the recent election. Their importance within the alliance, however, is minimum.
