Mr. Selami acquainted the French guests with the composition and the activity of this commission, which aims at the consolidation and expansion of the relations of cooperation with other countries. The French parliamentarians took interest in the main directions of the foreign policy of Albania. Mr. Selami and other deputies stressed that the main direction of the foreign policy is Albania's integration in the European democratic structures and the guarantee of the peace and stability in the Balkan region. A special place in the meeting was devoted to the relations of Albania with Greece and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. Albanian parliamentarians pointed out that the Greek party continues to manifest archaic concepts and stands and to make groundless and absurd accusations for allegedly the abuse of the rights of the Greek minority in Albania. Participants in the meeting said that relations with The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are generally good and that Albania has been continuously tolerant and has created many facilitation to the Macedonian state, holding that this stand serves the peace and stability in the region. Nevertheless, Albania has reserves as far as the observation of the rights of the Albanians in that republic is concerned and it is for the solution of the existing problems through dialogue and understanding between parties. The Macedonian party lacks the necessary predisposition for the promotion of the relations between the two countries, participants in the meeting said. After highlighting the contribution of France to the democratic developments in Albania, the Democratic Party deputy, Petrika Minga, suggested to the French parliamentarians the reopening of the French Lyceum in Korce. It is a tradition that should be renewed and this is also a desire of the people of Korce. Meeting With the Albanian Foreign Minister In the meeting held on the same day with the French parliamentarians, Alfred Serreqi, Albanian foreign minister, stressed the importance that Albania attaches to the relations with France in the moments of transition and its integration into Europe. Minister Serreqi made a panorama of the situation in the country and concentrated on the situation in the region, mainly on the relations of Albania with its neighbours. Leader of the French parliamentary delegation, Mr. Denion [name as received], expressed the conviction that the relations of France with Albania will develop further. He expressed the opinion that Europe should play and active role to help the countries in the transition period and to make its contribution to the solution of their complex problems. Albania also merits the attention of Europe, he underlined. The French parliamentarians also took interest in the situation in Kosova and the perspective solution of the problem there.
