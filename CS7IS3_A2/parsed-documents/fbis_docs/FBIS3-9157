This was reported by Banja Luka radio this evening. Branislav Bozic reports: [Bozic] Before the Washington agreement is realized in practice, according to which the Bosnian Croats and the Muslims would first establish a federation and then form a confederation with Croatia, it is necessary to replace Alija Izetbegovic. This condition was set to the U.S. Administration by Croatian President Franjo Tudjman prior to the signing of the agreement. This was reported by Banja Luka radio tonight, citing well-informed Croatian sources. The report further states that the White House has taken a similar stand for some time. The additional argument was Franjo Tudjman's explanation that he had replaced Mate Boban who, according to him, is an extremist among the Croats. Not only was Tudjman promised that Alija Izetbegovic would be replaced, but, as Banja Luka radio reports, he was also told that Izetbegovic will be replaced by either Haris Silajdzic or Muhamed Sacirbey, ambassador of the Muslim government in the United Nations. All this, as claimed, will happen very quickly.
