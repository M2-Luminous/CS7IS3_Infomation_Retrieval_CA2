This measure, which has created one of the most severe fluctuations in the history of Iran's foreign trade, has not just affected the import of consumer goods, it has also created daily increasing problems for industrial units in meeting their import needs, and in some areas it even threatens to stop the production cycle. Economic experts in the Iranian capital say cutting exports alone will not solve Iran's foreign debt problems, and that hasty measures taken for public display in this area will only lead to greater disruption of Iran's productive ability. From $29 Billion to $12 Billion? Based on the predictions of some Iranian and foreign sources, the volume of Iran's imports will drop from $29 billion in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] to about $12 billion in the year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994]. If this occurs, Iran's imports will drop 58 percent in 12 months. It is said that this year only America was unable to increase its exports to Iran. Concerning the amount of Iran's imports in the year 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993], the figure of $29 billion is based on a statistic published late in the month of Azar [22 November-21 December] by the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Office of Statistics and Machine Services. In its report, the Customs Office emphasized that this volume of imports includes political exemptions, foreign goods in transit, goods accompanying travelers, and smuggled goods, and if these goods are counted, imports for the year 1371 will be more than $29 billion. The largest amount of goods in terms of value in the year 1371 came into the country from Germany, Japan, and Italy. Reports published recently by foreign sources show that there was a significant drop in the exports from the above three countries to Iran. Based on the latest statistics published by the Japanese Foreign Trade Organization, in the first nine months of the year 1993 (winter through summer of last year) Iran imported about $1.2 billion from Japan, while the value of Iran's imports from Japan in the first nine months of 1992 was $2.1 billion. The total volume of Germany's exports to Iran in 1993 decreased about 40 percent, but no reliable reports in this regard have yet been received. In Italy, hundreds of small- and medium-sized companies active in the Iranian market are on the verge of bankruptcy because of the sharp drop in exports to the Islamic Republic and hundreds of their workers are faced with unemployment. This situation has developed as the result of Iran's new import policy, and it has also caused insurance guaranteeing exports to Iran to be cut by the Italian Export Credit Insurance Agency, known as Sace. Sace, following the lead of its Western counterparts such as COFACE [Foreign Trade-Insurance Credit Company] in France and Hermes [export credit guaranteee agency] in Germany, is refusing to issue insurance coverage on exports by Italian companies to Iran. A group of Italian parliamentary deputies, in asking a question of the government of that country, warned of the unemployment of those hundreds of workers. They said: "What Sace did with exports to Iran has caused heavy losses for Italian companies, because those companies, after signing contracts with their counterparts in Iran, have stopped production because of Sace's failure to make a quick decision and they have stopped exports to Iran." The measure taken by Sace followed the intensification of the frightening financial conditions in the Islamic Republic of Iran and this country's inability to meet its foreign commitments. Highest Rate of Debt Growth Iran's financial crisis mainly came about in the wake of the disruption of its trade balance, meaning the dominance of imports over exports. The nation's trade deficit went from $7 billion in 1370 [21 March 1991-20 March 1992] to $10 billion in 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993]. The result was that Iran's foreign debt reached astronomical levels, rising to about $30 billion (or, according to some Iranian sources, including the newspaper SALAM, to about $40 billion). In its recent report on world debt published as World Debt Tables, the World Bank said Iran had the highest rate of debt growth among the Middle Eastern and North African nations. This report, which is published annually, shows the latest short-term and long-term debt situation for all nations. This report says Iran's foreign debt increased from $11.3 billion in 1991 to $14.2 billion at the end of 1992, amounting to about 13 percent of the value of Iran's gross domestic product [GDP]. This figure was about 10 percent at the end of the year 1991. The aforementioned report also says that in the year 1992, 78 percent of Iran's foreign debt was short-term debt. The World Bank concludes that Iran's rate of acquiring debt is the highest among the nations of the Middle East and North Africa. Can the policy of sharply reducing imports put an end to Iran's foreign debt crisis? Apparently the repayment of debt, which is mostly short term and at high interest rates, is a priority for Iran's economic policymakers. However, there is much evidence that this crisis cannot be solved by reducing imports alone. First of all, even if the Islamic Republic could reduce imports to $13 billion by the end of 1372 [20 March 1994], it would only succeed in leveling the nation's trade balance, because the nation's exports, with a best-case assessment of the current state of the oil market, even including nonoil products, will not go higher than $14 billion. This amount of foreign exchange will barely suffice to meet the need for subsidized goods, the Ministry of Petroelum's equipment and services, military equipment and interest on loans, and then there will nothing left to pay the principal on loans. Moreover, foreign trade problems must not be assessed solely in light of the balance between imports and exports. Many of Iran's producing units are dependent on imported capital and intermediate goods, and suddenly depriving them of these goods could lead to their absolute destruction and the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of workers. In this same regard Dr. Akbar Karbasian wrote in the 5 Dey [26 December] issue of RESALAT that the decisions of the Foreign Exchange Market Regulating Commission have exposed private companies to "the long and wide bureaucracy of the Ministry of Commerce. While they have to register their orders with that ministry (and not at the Central Bank), they are wandering between the Ministry of Commerce, the Central Bank and Iran Customs. What is not clear is, if there is a foreign exchange shortage, what are the nation's many producers, their personnel and their families going to do?" Akbar Karbasian adds that even if the Foreign Exchange Regulating Committee's policymakers "can in the short term inject some calm into the nation's economic structure, which is now limping along, the long-term indicators such as the GDP, per-capita income, and new investment are on the decline." To solve Iran's financial crisis, short-term and long-term measures are without a doubt more constructive than quick fixes for public consumption. Some Iranian experts say that to get out of the deadlock, the country should pay off its short-term debt as quickly as possible by getting new sources of foreign exchange on the international financial market in the form of long-term lower-interest loans. The only way to achieve this goal, however, is to hold a series of international talks, especially with the IMF and the World Bank. This will get the country out of its economic constraints, and it has to do with the Islamic Republic's foreign policy and its relations with the world community. War Against `Economic Hypocrites' Despite the decisions by the Foreign Exchange Regulating Committee and the imposition of heavy pressure on imports, the future of the rial against the dollar remains quite uncertain. In this regard many rumors are circulating in the Islamic Republic's capital. Based on reports received from Tehran, some Central Bank experts are saying that based on the economic models they have that the price of the dollar will go to 280 tomans and will find relative stability at this level. The drop in value of Iran's national currency, which is caused by severe social disruption in the country, is currently one of the hottest economic debates in the Islamic Republic's press. In its 28 Azar [19 December] issue the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI writes: "the problem of foreign exchange is more than an economic reality. It has now become an all-out war between the economic hypocrites and the government." This newspaper adds that the "economic hypocrites" paraded in the playing field for several days by taking over the Islambul [a Tehran street] intersection, just as the "political hypocrites" tried to destroy the Islamic Republic by taking over Islamabad. With regard to the difference between "political hypocrites" and "economic hypocrites," the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI writes that the first group, "with its savage actions, showed more than before the oppressed condition of Islamic officials." Now the second group, "with its actions, is causing people to be disappointed with the government's officials, and with the rumors it is circulating among the people, it is saying that even the government's top officials are acting with it, and this is to disperse the people away from the Islamic government." The same newspaper adds: "More regrettable is the influence of those who have positioned themselves here and there in government organizations as specialists and are making the analysis that our national currency should fall even further to reach real parity." The experts the newspaper refers to are in the Central Bank. As was mentioned, they put the parity rate of the rial and the dollar at 280 tomans. `Ruinous' Policies On the other hand, in its 24 Azar [3 November] issue the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI published a very harshly worded editorial accusing Hashemi-Rafsanjani's government, without mentioning the president of the republic's name, of implementing "ruinous" economic policies. This newspaper wrote: The unjustifiable silence of the nation's economic officials has reached an intolerable point, and it is still unclear whether this silence is a specific policy or whether our economic officials really have nothing to say. In its editorial, the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI adds: Even those who defend the policy of unifying the foreign exchange rate, even those who consider it necessary at this time to implement the policies of economic adjustment, and even those who approve of simultaneous implementation of all these programs, fully acknowledge the truth that there is no economic justification of any kind for the instantaneous jump in the foreign exchange rate. This newspaper says "unbridled imports" are the main cause in the drop in the value of Iran's national currency. It wrote: Even if we did not have the self-sufficiency slogan, even if we did not think in revolutionary terms, even if we were not thinking about deprived people and the owners of this revolution, we should not tolerate such ruinous decisions and economic policies, which open the country's doors to imports of everything. Today we are like someone who has drained the water out of his pond and is wondering why the fish do not have any water. Today we are aligning our national currency with foreign currencies at a time when our national economic and banking system are not ready and do not have the capacity to make such a change. With the water drained out of the pool, we still want to see the fish living and in the water.
