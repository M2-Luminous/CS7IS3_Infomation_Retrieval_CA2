Mentese noted that the terrorists and their supporters were in a panic as a result of not being able to resist the security forces as well as from suffering great losses. Mentese further stated that the terrorists are trying to solve their difficulties, which result from failure and the lack of support they receive from the people, by undertaking efforts to cooperate with foreigners. Mentese indicated that these developments are clear proof that certain foreign circles are using the terrorists as their tools. Stating that it is unfortunate that there are parties and persons who boycott the regional elections in spite of the safety in the country established by the great sacrifices of the security forces, Mentese said that the political parties' duty of participating in the elections is a fundamental principle of democracy, adding that the people who avoid this duty will receive what they deserve from the people.
