[Zhirinovskiy] I can see the situation in Russia only in a positive light: Ahead of us are the end of the crisis and the renaissance of Russia. The reformers have declared their bankruptcy, which is unpleasant for the West. Our policy is based on the equality of all forms of ownership, state or private. We would change the tax system in favor of the producers. We will end state and criminal blackmailing. We will reconstruct economic relations with the regions and end the war in the south. Conversion will be stopped. The plants that now have to produce canteens for 2,000 rubles apiece, which nobody needs, instead of submarines will go back to producing submarines. Western aid is nothing but provocation and hypocrisy. Foreigners are only a nuisance and not helpful. We will chase them away. Foreign politicians are honest in the way they treat us. They all hate Russia. We will help ourselves. [Sajdik] How are your relations with the Russian president? [Zhirinovskiy] My relations with Yeltsin are good. Now and then we meet for a game of checkers or play volleyball. He is a good man, I like him. He is calm and quiet. I do not mind him at all. He was deceived by radical reformer Yegor Gaydar and his people. He thought that their plans were good -- but everything failed. Now he is trying to neutralize the consequences of the activities of Gaydar and reformer Gennadiy Burbulis. They are to blame for the destruction of the USSR and the creation of the CIS. Yeltsin is now embarrassed that he believed them. If I were him, I would have chased all of them out of the country or thrown them into prison. Yet, Yeltsin is a good man. However, I will not leave them alone but call them to account. They are afraid of me, which is why they call me "fascist" all the time. [Sajdik] What are your plans for the future? [Zhirinovskiy] I want to become president. The parliamentary group does not offer any possibility to implement my program. As president the constitution gives me maximum powers and I can fulfill my promises. Yeltsin will not run again, and the people that have so far forced themselves to the foreground -- Sobchak, Volskiy, Gaydar, Yavlinskiy, and Travkin received less than 10 percent in the election. So I cannot see any opponent. [Sajdik] What is your program? [Zhirinovskiy] I will concentrate on improving the living conditions of the Russians without getting rich myself. The others did nothing but steal: money was transferred to Western banks, children sent to school abroad, villas and limousines, everything achieved through fraud. Now they are leaving the sinking ship like rats. They cannot pay the price that I am asking -- the new Russia. [Sajdik] What will your new Russia look like? [Zhirinovskiy] Ukraine will always be a part of Russia, in the same way in which the Crimea is Russian. I would not stop western Ukraine from seceding and becoming a small republic. Then they can eat their dumplings in Lvov but (gets up and turns out the light) in the dark because they will not get any more electricity. That will then be the end of Ukrainian nationalism. Yet, we will not take them back; the Germans or Swedes can feed them through. (turns on the light again) [Sajdik] What does democracy mean for you? [Zhirinovskiy] Democracy means that the majority makes a decision but not without taking the interests of the minority into account. We Russians take the decision to make the former borders of the USSR the borders of Russia yet we do not ignore the minority. The Estonians do not want that, which means that the Estonians will live in Tallinn -- in a mini-republic like Monaco or Andorra -- but without Russian raw materials, light, energy, and cars. [Sajdik] You do not have a good press. Do you mind? [Zhirinovskiy] Nobody writes the truth about me. If you dare, write that Zhirinovskiy is a good, highly educated man, who got his diploma with distinction, knows four foreign languages, does not drink and does not smoke. Yet this is not what you are paid for. One has to write the opposite: Zhirinovskiy is a bad man, an anti-Semite, and a fascist.
