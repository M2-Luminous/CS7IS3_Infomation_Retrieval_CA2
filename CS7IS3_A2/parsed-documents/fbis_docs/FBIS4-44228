This was strongly stressed yesterday when Finance Minister Anne Wibble hosted a miniseminar on Sweden's relations with the Third World and East Europe. "The EU is not a fortress and Sweden, together with other like-minded countries, will see to it that it does not become one." Anne Wibble even said that it is possible to strengthen global cooperation at the same time as Sweden is working for European integration. If Sweden and Norway join the EU they will be able -- together with Denmark and the Netherlands -- to work to improve the EU's aid policy, Anne Wibble said, at the same time as the EU's protectionism in the fields of agriculture and textiles must combated. Others present at the seminar were representatives of Latvia, Estonia, and Uganda, and Danish Development Aid Minister Helle Degn. Degn said that she has very positive experience of EU cooperation in the development aid field and said that Denmark has won a sympathetic hearing among the other countries of the Union for its strategy vis-a-vis the developing countries. And she said several times that Swedish membership would make this even easier. The critics of the EU's aid policy say among other things that the EU's former great powers give priority to aid to their former colonies. The northern African countries, for example, are said to be receiving a disproportionately high level of support compared with the poorer countries in southern Africa. But Edith Ssempala, Ugandan ambassador to Sweden, did not express any concern that EU membership would have a negative effect on Swedish aid. Instead she voiced hopes of a greater Nordic influence on the EU's aid policy.
