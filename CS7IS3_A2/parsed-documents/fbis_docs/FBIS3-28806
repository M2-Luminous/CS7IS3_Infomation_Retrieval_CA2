FBIS3-28806 "dreas028_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-028 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Feb 1994 South Korea * Heightened Propaganda for Kim Chong-il Viewed 942C0057A Seoul NAEOE TONSIN in Korean No 876, 2 Dec 93 pp E2-E4 942C0057A Seoul NAEOE TONSIN Language: Korean Article Type:CSO [Excerpt] [passage omitted] North Korean [NK] propaganda claiming that Kim Chong-il is inspecting front-line units, pushing for more military training, and carrying out other vigorous leadership activities is greatly increasing. Through his "outstanding, military leadership skills," Kim Chong-il directly managed - the April, 1964 hostile action at the Military Demarcation Line, - the January, 1968 taking of the U.S. naval vessel Pueblo, and - the April, 1969 downing of an EC-121 aircraft, reported the official North Korean Central News Agency [KCNA] through its broadcast (on November 10th) of the "Kim Chong-il Revolutionary History, Lecture Number 78." Before this, through a commentary program (April 17th) called, "With the Wisdom and Courage of a Supreme Commander," the KCNA claimed that Kim Chong-il "made brilliant contributions in strengthening the nations defense in every way": - by visiting North Korean Army [NKA] front-line guard posts in February, 1963, encouraging "one-is-worth-a-hundred fighting power"; - by visiting naval units in mid-October, 1975, inspecting fleet maneuver training and marine training amid the inclement weather of a driving storm; and - understanding the pattern, order of battle and organization of the tactical preparations of units above division level, by making concrete suggestions on capability and material augmentation and on combat usage of such units, to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the NKA on April 25, 1984. Thus highlighting Kim Chong-il's leadership activities concerning the NKA, to further accentuate his military leadership ability, in November NK created a new KCNA discussion program called, "The Great Presence of the Supreme Commander" (presently on third broadcast), and the Ministry of People's Armed Forces [MPAF] held (November 11th) a "Forum for the Study and Discussion of the Greatness of Comrade Kim Chong-il." In the program (KCNA November 14), "The Great Presence of the Supreme Commander," Kim Chong-il was held up as, "An extraordinarily brilliant supreme commander with complete mastery of Kim Il-song's autonomous military thought and tactics," and as, "an extraordinarily brilliant supreme commander who knows not even an instant of worry or agitation, though the most powerful enemy in the world attacks, who lays out bold operational plans with great ease, before which his frightened enemies fall, who has courage and will power as yet not possessed by any other in the world." In a forum in which senior military officials, Chief of General Staff Choe Kwang, General Political Bureau Deputy Director Yi Pong-won, and MPAF Deputy Minister Kim Kwang-chin participated, Kim Chong-il was proclaimed to be the "great leader of the people, who set up an autonomous military command system and unceasingly increases its fighting power and armaments." NK's recent concentration on propaganda concerning Kim Chong-il's military leadership activities, even presenting concrete examples, is understood to be an attempt to placate the military, to eliminate the debate seething within it on Kim Chong-il's lack of experience in NK military affairs and his resulting suitability as supreme commander of the military and Chief of State, and to elicit loyalty from the military. According to the testimony of recent defectors, since Kim Chong-il was made Supreme Commander (December 24, 1991) and Chief of State (April 20, 1992), dissatisfaction and complaints are gradually growing within the military: "Following the political and economic sectors, Kim Chong-il is now going to ruin even the military." Accordingly, the MPAF is even reported to have carried out a "Military-wide Ideological Questionnaire-Survey" to determine trends within the military. [passage omitted]
