Sha'th told MBC in Washington today that he discussed the Palestinian demands in this regard with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. [Begin recording] [MBC correspondent in Washington 'Aziz Fahmi] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher received Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, in Washington this morning in an attempt to settle the current differences between the two sides over the Palestinians' return to the negotiating table. The Americans want the negotiations to resume now and then discuss during the negotiations securing protection for the Palestinians and disarming the settlers. But the Palestinians want to settle this before they return to the negotiating table as a condition for the resumption of the negotiations. The MBC met Dr. Sha'th before he left for the State Department to meet Warren Christopher. [Sha'th] We are here for negotiations with the U.S. side to secure all means of international protection, disarming the settlers, and the necessary security measures to guarantee security for the Palestinian people. These are the requirements for restoring momentum to the peace process to complete our achievements. Hence, I believe the U.S. side understands that there is need for Palestinian security but it should understand that this requires measures, not just an expression of principles. [Fahmi] What if they refuse? [Sha'th] We do not jump to conclusions. We have come here to meet Secretary Christopher to get what we want. So I cannot begin the talks by expecting a rejection. [Fahmi] Meanwhile, press sources cited the PLO representative at the United Nations as saying that Dr. Nabil Sha'th must discuss with Warren Christopher the deadlocked UN discussions. It is known that the United States suspended these discussions until it reaches agreement with the Palestinians on drafting the resolution due to be passed by the Security Council. The Palestinians' main aim now is to secure Israel's and United States' consent to the principle of the presence of international observers to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Israel has rejected this demand since it occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. [end recording]
