Leaders of CIS coordinating bodies -- Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Interparliamentary Assembly, Defense Council Chairman Pavel Grachev, Andrey Kozyrev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Council, and Andrey Nikolayev, chairman of the Council of Commanders of CIS Countries' Border Troops -- took part in its work for the first time. A one-year term was set today for the rotation of the leaders of the statutory bodies of the CIS. This means that Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin will continue to carry out the functions of chairman of the Council of Heads of State and chairman of the Council of Heads of Government until 31 December 1994. The CIS heads of state also approved the symbols -- the flag and emblem -- of the Commonwealth of Independent States, viewing this graphic image as a powerful and developing tree, a chalice bringing people light and warmth, and wings of birds in a single formation. The next meeting will, therefore, be held under the sky blue flag of the CIS. That meeting is scheduled to take place on 9 September.
