Meanwhile, three other editors of the magazine on the mainland had been harassed by the authorities to a varying extent; and the residence of Bei Ling's parents in Beijing was searched by public security personnel. Bei Ling has already written to the U.S. PEN and the International PEN to raise the case and draw their concern to the issue of personal freedom of mainland Chinese writers. Bei Ling said: Except for Meng Lang, a well-known vanguard poet, who has gone south to avoid trouble early this year, all the other four CHING HSIANG editors in Shanghai, namely, Chen Dongdong, Chen Zishan, Zhu Dake, and Sun Ganlu, have been frequently summoned by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for "interrogation" since early April. They were mainly questioned about the participation of any "reactionary elements" abroad in the editorial work of CHING HSIANG, any financial contributions by such people to the magazine, and Bei Ling's activities during his tour of the mainland from late last year to early this year. The police also asked Bei Ling's younger brother, who is working in Shanghai, to give an detailed account of Bei Ling's social contacts in Shanghai.
