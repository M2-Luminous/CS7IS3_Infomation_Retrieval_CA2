The on-going attacks of foreigners by Islamic groups are the reason for this warning. The Spanish colony in Algeria numbers 327. The advice also covers diplomatic personnel whose protection has been increased over the last months. The French authorities have also made a similar appeal to their community in Algeria. Yesterday's stabbing of a French businessman and his son in Algiers means that 31 foreigners have been murdered in Algeria over the last six months.
