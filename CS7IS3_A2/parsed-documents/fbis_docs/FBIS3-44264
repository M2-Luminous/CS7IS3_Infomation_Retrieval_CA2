Ciskei Attorney General Willem Jurgens said he has decided to postpone any decision on whether to prosecute until Ciskei was reincorporated into South Africa, after the April general election. Mr. Jurgens' statement follows the Bisho Supreme Court's recent decision to overturn the ruling Military Council's decree indemnifying all the soldiers involved in the shooting of African National Congress protest marchers.
