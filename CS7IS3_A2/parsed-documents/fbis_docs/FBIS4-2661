FBIS4-2661 "drchi071_w_94002" FBIS-CHI-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 HONG KONG & MACAO Hong Kong Cooperation With British on SAR Passports `Rejected' Cooperation With British on SAR Passports `Rejected' HK1104022994 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 11 Apr 94 p 1 HK1104022994 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Rain Ren] [Text] A British demand to be involved in the new Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] passports has been rejected by China. A Hong Kong-based senior Chinese official told EASTERN EXPRESS that all matters relating to SAR travel documents were within China's, "sovereign right" and were "none of Britain's business", adding that London's demand was "ridiculous". News of the rejection is a serious blow to the British Joint Liaison Group team which has tried repeatedly since last July to discuss the issue with Beijing. All approaches have been met with silence from China. A British official said London needed to be involved in the process because Hong Kong was still under British rule. "In practical terms, the passport will have to be issued in Hong Kong," he said. "They are not going to be issued in Beijing, "So we need to be fully involved in that activity since Hong Kong is still under British administration." The Chinese official said the Hong Kong Immigration Department must "co-operate" with China in working out the technical details of SAR passports. Matters to be sorted out include how Hong Kong residents who qualify as permanent residents of the SAR should apply for and take delivery of the document. The Immigration Department will also need to develop new technology to register passport holders and monitor the document's use. Beijing is still considering a design for the passport and three options have been submitted to the Chinese government so far. China's Foreign Ministry will lobby other countries for official recognition of the passport and, where applicable, exemptions from visa requirements for passport holders. The Chinese official said negotiations with countries over the use of the SAR travel document would be conducted through Chinese embassies. The British official maintained that such matters would be best handled on a joint basis, but he would not disclose what role Britain wanted to play in the process saying: "We need to reach consensus with the Chinese on who does what and when." Hong Kong passport holders, he said, already enjoyed freedom of travel to many countries because of previous arrangements made by Britain. "Therefore we need to be involved in discussions with other countries as well," he said. The British official believed there were other complications that needed to be resolved, including the definition of who qualifies for Hong Kong SAR citizenship and right of abode after 1997. A meeting of the Joint Liaison Group will be held tomorrow to discuss the right of abode issue. The British official said he did not expect a breakthrough. "Other complications are that from China's point of view, it is not easy for them to give up their sovereign right on this issue," he said. "Having the British or Hong Kong government involved is seen as a delegation of their sovereignty. Our objective is to ensure ordinary travellers in Hong Kong have the necessary documents for them to continue to travel freely after 1997." The European Union has said it will recognise the new SAR passport because provisions for it were included in the Joint Declaration.
