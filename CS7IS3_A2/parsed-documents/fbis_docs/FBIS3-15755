Konstantin Zatulin told a news conference in Almaty, where he had been monitoring the parliamentary elections as an international observer, that Russia and Kazakhstan were going to enter into a treaty on the further use of Baykonur. The document was due to be signed by the two countries' presidents in Moscow on March 30, he said. Commenting on a meeting he had with Kazakh Deputy Prime Minister Yerik Asanbayev, Zatulin said Kazakhstan's leadership preferred not to bring up the dual citizenship issue, but that the next parliament might consider giving Russian the status of an official language.
