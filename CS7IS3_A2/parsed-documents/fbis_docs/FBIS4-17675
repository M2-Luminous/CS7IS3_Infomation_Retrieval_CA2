The new five-star hotel, a whole convoy of red Volvos for the guests, lavish feasts -- all this was to serve as graphic illustration of the fact that the "10 years of prosperity" economic program proclaimed by Turkmenbashi has begun to operate. In their official, but sufficiently frank talk with President S. Niyazov, the Moscow journalists learned that: - Turkmenia could soon become Kuwait if it sells its energy carriers to states with the real ability to pay (at present the debts of Ukraine, Georgia, and several other CIS members for Turkmen gas and oil are $1.3 billion). The president pins great hopes on the construction of gas pipelines to the West -- to Iran, Turkey, and Europe -- and to the East -- to China and Japan; - The idea of a Eurasian Union voiced by Nursultan Nazarbayev to the recent Moscow summit is unfounded and that countries which recently had a taste of independence will scarcely agree to some "coordinating and guiding center;" - Turkmenbashi himself is not against criticism leveled at him but would prefer to meet it face to face in personal talks with his fellow fighters and not in the press. The president was disapproving about the Russian press, which allows itself keen attacks on Boris Yeltsin -- because in Niyazov's opinion these attacks contain more destructive than creative force; - The national assembly has already approved agreements whereby the 400,000 Russians living in Turkmenia will be able to acquire second -- Russian -- citizenship. That, incidentally, is so far the only instance of the solution of the problem of dual citizenship -- such difficult and delicate one for the entire CIS; - The Turkmen leader does not greatly like the abundance of portraits and sculptures of himself but believes this is a temporary enthusiasm -- until the completion of the economic reforms and the appearance of property owners who will become far more independent of all kinds of ideological epidemics. Nonetheless it is better to decorate the bank notes with a portrait of the first president in Turkmenia's history than to put pictures of animals on them.... Apart from its familiarization aspect, the Moscow journalists' meeting with Saparmurat Niyazov had a diplomatic nature: The president did everything to emphasize his right to an independent view, differing greatly from others, of the strategy and tactics of reforms and insisted on the correct coverage of Turkmen problems from Moscow and the newspapermen of course promised to be objective and assured him that Russian newspapers will not harm the Turkmen people's political stability or moral health. As a result of this dialogue the guests hoped that the Turkmen Government will find the opportunity to subscribe to Russian publications in the second half of 1994, earmarking funds for the conversion of the manat, with which subscribers now settle acocunts for Russian publications. It was with this hope that the guest left.
