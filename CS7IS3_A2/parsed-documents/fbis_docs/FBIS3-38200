Aho met Kohl in the ski resort of Davos in Switzerland, where they are taking part in the World Economic Forum, an informal meeting of world leaders. Aho explained the negotiating situation from Finland's point of view and emphasized the two central demands: Getting a permanent subsidy for northern agriculture and financing this subsidy from EU funds, not from Finland's state funds. Kohl did not comment in detail on Finland's goals but gave the assurance that Germany is very much aware of them. Earlier today Kohl said that it is important that Finland, Norway, Sweden and Austria join the EU from the beginning of next year. Aho will remain in Davos until Sunday [30 January] and will meet several European leaders, among others Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
