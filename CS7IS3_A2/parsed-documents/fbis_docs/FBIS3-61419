D. Kozhukhovskiy, A. I. Litvin, Cherkassy Engineering-Technology University, Ukraine; UDC 681.5:512.643. 8] [Abstract] This article examines means of solving the Dirichlet problem for the Helmholtz equation in singly-connected nearly rectangular regions using Walsh-Pally transforms. The use of fast Walsh transforms increases the solution speed (by a factor of 1.5-2 over the fast Fourier transform) and reduces the amount of computer memory needed. It is found that solving the two-dimensional Helmholtz equation may be reduced to solving the one-dimensional problem. Figures 2; references 12: 11 Russian, 1 Western.
