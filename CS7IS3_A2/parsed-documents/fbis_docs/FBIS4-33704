They knew it would be high. Domingo Cavallo anticipated that this year's deficit would be bigger than the 1993 deficit, but when the figure -- $2.405 billion -- was announced it caused concern because it shows the deficit for the year will not just be "somewhat bigger" than last year; it will much bigger than last year. The trade deficit for the whole of last year totaled $3.7 billion, which is only a little more than the deficit for the first four months of this year. The most "optimistic" projection based on this figure is a year-end deficit of around $5 billion -- the Economy Ministry calculated it at $4.7 billion -- while "pessimistic projections" estimate it at $8 billion, or even $10 billion if the current feverish import drive continues while exports increase at a much slower pace. Very few people think the figures will reach those levels because the Economy Ministry will probably do something to slow the process. Cavallo's team is actively preparing a way to achieve the effects of a currency devaluation without a devaluation, or to improve the real foreign exchange situation without changing the nominal exchange rate in an attempt to rapidly enhance exports. It is clear that the most reasonable path, within the series of alternatives that the Economy Ministry is studying, is to increase our exports, not to try to reduce imports. The economic opening is conceptually based on the principle of encouraging imports as well as exports in order to insert the economy in the competitive international world market where each country tries to produce only those consumer goods it can produce in the most competitive way and import the rest from other countries. The classic idea of specialization continues to be amazingly logical, particularly now that transport and communications are cheaper and more efficient. Thus, it seems improbable that the Economy Ministry will do much to slow the import drive unless it becomes absolutely necessary to prevent problems worsening in the productive structure or to slow down a potentially explosive trade deficit. We can see that an increasingly large slice of our imports are in capital goods, which clearly shows that the country is allotting more and more resources to improving production and growth. The latest figures on the import of capital goods are those of the first quarter. They confirm that more than 30 percent of our imports consist of equipment, machinery, and other capital goods used to reequip productive activities in agriculture, industry, and services -- principally communications. This is consistent with data on internal savings and investments, which is around 18 or 19 percent of the GDP, compared to 14 percent at the end of the 1980's when hyperinflation and stagnation pushed investment levels to its lowest level in decades. The trend confirms that Cavallo is not thinking of severely restricting imports, unless the situation becomes intolerable. He needs imports to sustain the economy's future growth. Thus, the most logical path is to continue creating ways to increase exports. Some mechanisms are already in place, besides tax returns, among them reimbursements for exporting manufactured products. The result is clear: During 1993, industries exported 28 percent more than in 1992. The economic team is currently working on ways to reimburse producers of agriculture products. We will have news in this area shortly. In the proposal, products with higher added value will benefit the most. The logic is simple. We must export products that use relatively cheap and abundant national raw materials with the highest possible level of industrialization. One objective is to industrialize agriculture activities, a goal that was many times proposed but never adequately instrumented, partly due to prejudices over the "irrelevant" idea of exporting food in a world where "the fashion" is to export sophisticated manufactured goods. If Cavallo can encourage agriculture industrialization the same way he has done with industries, we will be able to say that the two-way opening, the only possible path, has begun to work.
