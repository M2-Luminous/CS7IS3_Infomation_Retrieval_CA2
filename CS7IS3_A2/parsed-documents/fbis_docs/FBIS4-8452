FBIS4-8452 "dreeu072__a94024" FBIS-EEU-94-072-A Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Parliament Approves Moravcik Program Parliament Approves Moravcik Program AU1304203894 Prague CTK in English 1756 GMT 13 Apr 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1304203894 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament today approved the programme of Premier Jozef Moravcik's government, with 80 out of the 119 deputies present voting in favour. "For the government such discussions are a test of how various groups of the population react to its proposals," Moravcik said, commenting on the parliamentary debate. "However I must say that the objective criticisms to the government program, although there were not many of them, will help us further improve it," he added. Regarding the accusations voiced during the debate that the new cabinet had simply rewritten the program of the previous government, Moravcik said that the fundamental macro-economic goals stemmed from the approved law on the state budget and that his cabinet did not want to interfere with the law. "However, analysis of developments did not testify to the possibility that all the goals put up by the former cabinet could have been fulfilled. We will therefore seek implementation of the basic macro-economic goals," Moravcik added. Moravcik was reacting to an accusation by Tibor Cabaj, chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) deputies' group, who called on Moravcik to resign from his office. The reason Cabaj gave was a report submitted by the Foreign Ministry headed by Moravcik in May 1993 before Slovak President Michal Kovac's visit to the Vatican. There were passages in the report reminiscent of assessments of the Vatican common before the November 1989 revolution. Moravcik said that Cabaj had merely quoted working material. The part which he criticized was an archive document which appeared in the report by mistake. "As soon as the mistake was discovered we put it right and the people responsible were taken to task. What was read out by Cabaj had never been an official document of the Foreign Ministry," Moravcik said. In his closing speech before the vote of confidence in the government was taken Moravcik said that his cabinet would aim at speeding up the process of transformation in the economic and social spheres, creating favorable conditions for investors and stopping the collapse of health care and education. The government intended to restore citizens' trust in the state, improve their security and prepare early parliamentary elections, Moravcik said.
