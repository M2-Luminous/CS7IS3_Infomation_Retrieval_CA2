FR941110-0-00295 FR941110-0-00018 Currently, a total of fewer than 100 individuals of Vigna o-wahuensis is known from 7 populations on the islands of Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe, and Hawaii (HHP 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m21 to 1992m23; HPCC 1991o; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Molokai, there are two populations separated by a distance of 4 km (2.5 mi). One population, south of Onini Gulch at about 850 m (2,800 ft) elevation on privately owned land, covers an area of 18 sq m (200 sq ft) in a forestry planting of Fraxinus uhdei (tropical ash) and Pinus (pine) (HHP 1992m11). The other Molokai population of about 10 individuals is on privately owned land at Makolelau (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). On Lanai, at least one individual of Vigna o-wahuensis is known from the arid windward slopes northeast of Kanepuu above Lapaiki at about 370 m (1,200 ft) elevation on privately owned land (HHP 1992m7, 1992m23). On the State-owned island of Kahoolawe, Vigna o-wahuensis grows between Makaalae and Lua Kealialalo at 140 m (460 ft) elevation, near the summit at about 400 m (1,300 ft) elevation, and about 0.8 km (0.5 mi) south of Hanakanaea near ``Sailor's Hat'' (HHP 1992m21, 1992m23; J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Only one individual is known from the population between Makaalae and Lua Kealialalo in pili grassland (J. Lau, pers. comm., 1992). Near the summit, about 20 plants grow in a 9 sq m (100 sq ft) area with a few more plants scattered nearby (HHP 1992m22). The size of the population south of Hanakanaea has not been determined, but at least one collection has been made recently (HHP 1992m21). On the island of Hawaii, Vigna o-wahuensis is known only from Nohonaohae Cinder Cone on privately owned land. Ten plants are known from 'A'ali'i Lowland Dry Shrubland within an exclosure containing pasture grass (HHP 1992m12, HPCC 1991o). Vigna o-wahuensis occurs in dry to mesic grassland and shrubland from 10 to 1,370 m (30 to 4,500 ft) in elevation (Geesink et al. 1990; HHP 1992m1 to 1992m3, 1992m5, 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m15, 1992m22, 1992m24). Other associated plant species include 'ilima, Chenopodium ('aheahea), Dubautia menziesii , and Osteomeles anthyllidifolia (ulei) (HHP 1992m11, 1992m12, 1992m23; HPCC 1991o). The primary threats to Vigna o-wahuensis are habitat degradation by ungulates (pigs and axis deer), competition with various alien plant species, fire, and stochastic extinction and/or reduced reproductive vigor due to the small number of existing populations and individuals. Previous Federal Action Federal action on these plants began as a result of section 12 of the Act, which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution to prepare a report on plants considered to be endangered, threatened, or extinct in the United States. This report, designated as House Document No. 94&hyph;51, was presented to Congress on January 9, 1975. In that document, Adenophorus periens, Bonamia menziesii, Flueggea neowawraea (as Drypetes phyllanthoides ), Hibiscus brackenridgei (as H. b. var. brackenridgei , var. mokuleianus , and var. ``from Hawaii''), Neraudia sericea, Plantago princeps (as P. p. var. elata , var. laxifolia , and var. princeps ), Sesbania tomentosa (as S. t. var. tomentosa ), Solanum incompletum (as S. i. var. glabratum , var. incompletum , and var. mauiensis ), Vigna o-wahuensis (also as V. sandwicensis var. heterophylla and V. s. var. sandwicensis ) were considered to be endangered. Diellia erecta and Plantago princeps (as P. p. var. acaulis , var. denticulata , and var. queleniana ) were considered to be threatened, and Neraudia sericea (as N. kahoolawensis ) and Solanum incompletum (as S. haleakalense ) were considered to be extinct.
