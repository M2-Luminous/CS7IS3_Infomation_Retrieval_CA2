The ministry's quarterly index of current business sentiment at major firms improved to minus 13.1 in the survey conducted in February from minus 22.1 in the previous survey taken in November. The earlier figure was the worst recorded in the current economic downturn. The survey for the first quarter, like the Bank of Japan's most recent "tankan" survey also taken in February, "seems to show a halt to the declines" in business sentiment, a ministry official said. "From these numbers alone it would seem that the economy has hit bottom, but we must see if the trend continues" in subsequent data, he said. The minus readings, which show the difference between the percentages of respondents seeing improvement and those seeing decline, also declined in the medium and small business sectors, according to the survey of 9,310 companies, of which 85 percent responded. Overall, sentiment is improving, the official said, citing corporate restructuring and downsizing efforts. But he acknowledged a similar improvement in the survey figures a year ago. At that time, signs of a turnaround were dashed by such factors as a surge in the yen's value, unseasonably bad summer weather and a series of construction scandals. The official said some of the February figures were collected before and some after a failed Japan-U.S. summit that saw trade tensions prompt another yen surge. Major firms predicted the sentiment index will improve to minus 4.6 next quarter and to a plus 5.3 in the July-September period. Sentiment at large manufacturers improved to minus 15.5 in the first quarter from minus 27.3, with predictions of improvement to minus 5.5 in the quarter starting next month and to plus 5.7 in the subsequent period. Large nonmanufacturers reported an improvement to minus 10.8 in the current quarter from minus 17.8 and predicted improvements to minus 3.9 and plus 4.9. Nonmanufacturers, especially the service sector, led the way in improving sales and profits, the ministry survey found. All respondents, which also included medium-sized and smaller firms, expect pretax profits to fall 13.9 percent in the fiscal year ending this month, with sales slipping 2.8 percent. But they see profits rising 12.5 percent in the first half of the coming fiscal year and sales edging up 0.3 percent. Manufacturers predicted fiscal 1993 pretax profit falls of 25.2 percent with sales dropping 4.4 percent and a first-half profit pickup of 10.1 percent with sales curbing their declines to 1.2 percent. Among all nonmanufacturers, profits are expected to decline in this fiscal year, with sales slipping 2.2 percent, but climb 13.7 percent in the first half of fiscal 1994, with sales rising 0.9 percent. Service companies see pretax profits rising 0.2 percent this fiscal year, with sales up 1.6 percent, and jumping 22.2 percent in the first half of fiscal 1994 as sales rise 2.4 percent. Labor conditions, however, continued to worsen, according to the survey index that gauges the difference between the percentage of companies reporting a labor surplus and those seeing a shortage. At major firms, the index weakened to minus 21.3, the worst since the ministry began conducting the survey in 1983, from 19.6 in the November survey. It was almost flat at medium-size companies, inching up to minus 13.6 from minus 13.7, and dipped to plus 0.5 at smaller firms from plus 1.5. "The sense of surplus increased slightly," the official said, but he added that labor conditions are a lagging indicator of the state of the economy. All groups in the survey forecast improved labor conditions in the coming two quarters.
