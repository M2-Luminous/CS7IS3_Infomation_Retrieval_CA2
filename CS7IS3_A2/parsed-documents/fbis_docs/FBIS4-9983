Sanchez will replace Jorge Bolanos. In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stressed that between 1977 and 1989 Sanchez occupied "one of the most relevant and sensitive posts for Cuban diplomacy" as head of the Cuban Interests Section in the United States. From 1989 to date, Sanchez, 55, has been a vice minister of foreign relations, a post to which Bolanos has now been promoted. Bolanos held the post of Cuban ambassador to Brazil for 7 years. Brazil resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1986 during Jose Sarney's government, after an interruption of more than two decades following the implementation of the one-party system on the island. Brazilian companies have shown increased interest in economic and financial relations with Cuba, especially following the recent economic opening process.
