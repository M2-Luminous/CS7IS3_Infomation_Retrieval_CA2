Of a total of 763 Diet members, 403 have already put their signatures to a petition to be sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the association said in a press release. Similar signature campaigns are being carried out in 108 countries around the world, it said. A copy of the letter said the legislators will urge the United Nations to do all in its power to see that Suu Kyi and all political leaders are unconditionally released. It also called for a "swift and complete implementation of a transition to civilian rule." The group hopes to receive 500 signatures of Diet members through the good offices of United Social Democratic Party leader Satsuki Eda by the time the letter is sent, said association president Win Naing. This is the second such letter to Butrus-Ghali. The first plea by 374 Diet members was delivered to the secretary general's office in March 1993 by Eda. Last April 422 Diet members urged the government to put pressure on Myanamr for Suu Kyi's release. A founder of the National League for Democracy (NLD) which won the 1990 election by a landslide, Suu Kyi has been under house arrest since July 1989. She was scheduled to be freed next July but the ruling military junta extended her detention period for another year.
