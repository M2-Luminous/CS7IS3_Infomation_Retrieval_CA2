Boris Yeltsin Dismisses Omsk Mayor Yuriy Shoykhet and Cancels 20 March Mayoral Elections"] [Text] On the eve of the dismissal, Omsk Oblast Governor L. Polezhayev announced at a routine press conference his decision to hold the Omsk mayoral elections 20 March. A week has passed and the decree on the elections, already signed by the governor, has not been published in the press. We have learned that the likely mayoral candidates -- Yu. Shoykhet and V. Obraztsov -- were persistently urged not to run, so as not to impede the candidate whom the governnor wanted to see as mayor of Omsk. Shoykhet and Obraztsov refused to accept these terms, and this sealed the fate of both the mayor of Omsk and the mayoral elections. Leonid Polezhayev flew to Moscow, met with President Yeltsin and, according to the governor himself, decided on the dismissal in the course of a conversation with the head of state. "A friend telephoned me round midnight and told me a piece of news that sounded like a practical joke," Yu. Shoykhet said. "`Mayak' was reporting that Yeltsin had dismissed me for 'destabilizing the situation' and 'exceeding my powers.'" The meticulous journalists at the press conference put some very specific questions to Governor L. Polezhayev. Just what constitutes a "destabilization of the situation," if there has not ben a single strike in Omsk and the city has heat and the cheapest food in Siberia? What exactly constitutes "exceeding one's powers" if, according to the mayor of Omsk, there has not been a single prosecutor's appeal against city administration decisions? And, finally, why did he seek redress against a mayor who had exceeded his powers not in the people's court but in the president's office? Polezhayev tried to get away with general phrases; he was nervous, and finally stated that the main reason for Shoykhet's dismissal was that the mayor of Omsk, who had run for the Federal Assembly representing "Russia's Choice," had failed in the election and had lost the voters' confidence. The answer can hardly be said to have been successful.... Now it turns out that it was not the governor who deprived Omsk people of their right to elect their mayor.... Polezhayev was merely implementing the edict from President B. Yeltsin, who deemed the election inexpedient. It was the president who took the extreme action [kraynim okazalsya prezident]. Here is one more theory. Governor Polezhayev, skillfully exploiting the political situation, has settled a personal score with the mayor. These men have long been rivals. Shoykhet was the first cooperative member in Omsk to set up a joint-stock company with private capital. Then L. Polezhayev, as chairman of the oblast soviet executive committee, set up the "Omskiy Torgovyy Dom" [Omsk Trading House] Joint-Stock Company founded by major monopoly state enterprises producing scarce goods such as television sets, washing machines, tires.... Without quitting as head of the oblast executive, Polezhayev became president of the trading house. Small businesses were shocked. In order to ship a tonne of condensed milk out of the oblast, it was necessary to go all over to get permission from Polezhayev's deputy. The trading house, naturally, had no problems. There was a scandal. There followed a presidential edict, under which Polezhayev was to have stood down as president of the commercial structure. A deputies' commission which exposed cases of the most basic kind of speculation in state goods was silenced. Last year the oblast inner soviet, on the initiative of Governor L. Polezhayev, decided to end payments to the federal budget. The next morning Mayor Shoykhet issued a radio statement to Omsk people to the effect that Polezhayev and the soviet were destroying Russia economically. On the basis of an appeal by the oblast prosecutor, who had ruled the soviet decision illegal, Shoykhet announced that the city would be meticulous about paying its taxes. A September-October session of the oblast administration collegium decided to support the president. Shoykhet asked bluntly whether that meant Rutskoy, who had taken the oath, or Yeltsin. They took a vote -- Yeltsin won by a margin of two. But in the Omsk newspapers the next day Yeltsin's name had been dropped from the oblast administration decision. And that is Polezhayev all over as a politician. The story of the mayor of Omsk's dismissal brings to mind some sad thoughts. The legal mechanisms for instituting proceedings or removing someone from his job are not working, but intrigues and telephone law are increasingly gaining ground.
