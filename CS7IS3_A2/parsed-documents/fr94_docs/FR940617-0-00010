FR940617-0-00010 FR940617-0-00003 An AD&hyph;1006 for a site that is located in urban areas need not be sent to SCS for evaluation. In addition, some agencies would like to use available mapped information to make their determinations without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006 to SCS. To facilitate the use of such information, ยง658.2(a) will be revised to clarify that farmland ``already in'' urban development or water storage may be identified by an area shown as ``urbanized area'' (UA) on the Census Bureau map, or shown as an urban tint outline or urban area map on U.S.G.S. topographical maps, or shown as urban-built-up on the USDA Important Farmland Maps. Areas shown as white on the USDA Important Farmland Maps are not farmland and, therefore, are not subject to the Act. In addition, ยง658.4(a) is being amended to clarify that federal agencies may determine whether or not a site contains farmland as defined in ยง658.2(a) without sending a Form AD&hyph;1006 to SCS. Where SCS is asked to complete the land evaluation portion of Form AD&hyph;1006 before the Federal agency completes the site assessment portion, and SCS determines that the site is subject to the FPPA, then when SCS returns the form to the agency for completion of the site assessment portion, SCS will at the same time provide the agency with the requested information and data necessary for the Federal agency to complete and score the site assessment factor questions, and where the agency chooses to complete the site assessment portion of the form first, SCS will cooperate in providing timely information and data to enable the Federal agency to score the site assessment factor questions. E. Amendment to Allow an Agency to Either Provide or Deny Assistance to a Project to Convert Farmland The existing regulations, at ยง658.3(c), interpret the extent to which an agency can use the FPPA as a basis for denying assistance to a project that would convert farmland. The paragraph reads as follows: The Act and these regulations do not authorize the Federal Government in any way to regulate the use of private or nonfederal land, or in any way affect the property rights of owners of such land. The Act and these regulations do not provide authority for the withholding of federal assistance to convert farmland to nonagricultural uses. In case where either a private party or a nonfederal unit of government applies for federal assistance to convert farmland to a nonagricultural use, the federal agency should use the criteria set forth in this part to identify and take into account any adverse effects on farmland of the assistance requested and develop alternative actions that could avoid or mitigate such adverse effects. If, after consideration of the adverse effects and suggested alternatives, the applicant wants to proceed with the conversion, the federal agency may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse to provide the requested assistance. The proposed rule contained an amendment that would change the Department's interpretation of the effect of the FPPA by revising this paragraph significantly. This amendment would drop the second sentence. In the closing sentence, instead of retaining the language that the federal agency ``may not, on the basis of the Act or these regulations, refuse to provide the requested assistance,'' the new language would state that the agency, after doing the required analysis and following its internal policies or procedures, would be free to deny as well as provide the assistance. See 52 FR 1467. The rationale for this proposed change, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule at 52 FR 1466, is that the FPPA leaves to the discretion of each agency ``the determination of whether the providing or the denial of Federal assistance for farmland conversion will, in a given situation, comply with the policy and purpose of the FPPA.'' It was further noted that the rule, as presently written, ``may be misread as a limitation on the previously described discretion provided by Congress to Federal agencies,'' and thus the amendment was needed ``to recognize that discretion and the general process through which it is exercised.'' Under the current regulation, when private landowners as well as state and local governments apply for assistance for a project involving the conversion of farmland subject to the FPPA, the federal agency is required to examine the effects of the project and alternatives but may not, based on the FPPA, refuse to provide the assistance. The amendment in the proposed rule would avoid making this analysis a pointless exercise by removing the rigid restriction on agency deliberations and allowing the agency to use the FPPA analysis as a basis for withholding assistance to the project in order to achieve the policies and objectives of the Act.
