He was met by the defense minister, Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah al-Salim. In a statement to the Kuwait News Agency after his arrival, Rifkind said that this was his second visit to the Kuwait as defense secretary and that he had previously met Shaykh 'Ali al-Sabah al-Salim in Britain. Rifkind added that the United Kingdom assessed its relations with the State of Kuwait highly and that it appreciated the way it had been able to reconstruct the country since its liberation from the Iraqi aggression by the international coalition forces. Rifkind added: In a region which is still very volatile, and where there is a lot of uncertainty and a great possibility for aggression by the Iraqi regime, it is important that the countries of the region and the United Kingdom should stand firmly together. He said: We have some good arrangements with Kuwait, which announced some time ago that it was interested in buying Warrior armored troop carriers from the United Kingdom, and we have welcomed that. He added: There is a lot of interest by the Sultanate of Oman and Bahrain to establish close cooperation with us. We are also cooperating with Kuwait in the military field. This includes joint exercises, and a large number of Kuwaiti military personnel are receiving training in the United Kingdom. The British minister went on to say: We believe that it is imperative that Iraq should release all the prisoners. We know that Kuwait is concerned about their fate and we share that concern. He said: It is important to inform the Iraqi regime of the need to comply with all UN demands if it wishes to join the world community on an equal basis again. Rifkind concluded that the issue of prisoners was of paramount importance not only to Kuwait but to all those concerned on humanitarian grounds, and to those who were interested in the fate of any citizen held in Iraq. It is to be noted that the British defense secretary is on a tour in the Gulf region that has included Oman and Bahrain in addition to Kuwait. He will leave tomorrow for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at the end of his current tour.
