Cvetkovska: "Losses Amounting to 11.7 Billion Denars"] [Text] What businessmen constantly warned about last year, and what they constantly feared, became true in practice. Taking into account the latest indicators about the financial outcome of last year's business, expressed in the final economic assessment and summed up in the Balance of Payments Department, last year there was a real economic debacle. With the continuing fall in industrial production increasing to 13.9 percent last year, all other financial indicators deteriorated. Losses in the economy rapidly increased nine times over, compared to the slowed-down increase in gross profit of approximately 2.5 times. Total expenditures last year exceeded the total income realized by companies by 4.5 percent, because of the high interest rates paid to banks, and the high costs involved in maintaining normal production. Moreover, the liquidity problem greatly deteriorated, because it was unable to obtain payment for one-third of what it produced and sold. Under such working circumstances, burdened by the present blockades to the north and south, increased transport costs for alternative transit, lost markets, and the minimum use of capacities, the economy in 1993 succeeded in realizing a total income of 185.8 billion denars. Nevertheless, expenditures were higher than income, amounting to 194.1 billion denars. Of that, the minimum gross profit was 2.5 billion denars, just 1 percent of the total income. That is why last year's loss beat the record, and at 11.7 billion denars, it also exceeded gross profit by some 9 billion denars. The Debts Rise Negative tendencies are also evident in the income share, in that the economy provides less money for economic needs, for what could revive production, particularly for investment. Nevertheless, money for salaries is given away in abundance. The state economy is more pressed by the short-term and long-term loans, its debts are constantly rising, and according to some Chamber of Commerce assessments the economy's debts reached 1.75 billion denars at the end of last year, with a rising trend, thus they reached 2.2 billion denars in January and February this year. Although the companies' final accounts indicated that last year, compared to the year before, they succeeded in increasing total income to 4.4 percent, their expenditures also rose 4.6 percent, which was more than the realized income. Regarding the structure of total income in the economy, it came mainly from the sale of products, goods, and services (on that basis in 14 percent of cases income was less than in 1992), and what they succeeded in "getting" was mainly from financing, that is, interest rates and positive exchange rates. However, not even that income was sufficient to cover expenses, and one-third of the companies had greater expenses of 11.6 billion denars, while the other two-thirds had only 3.3 billion denars greater income. Thus, the overall account of the economy is for 8.3 billion denars deficit. Several vital economic branches had greater expenses than income, for instance metallurgy, the iron industry, and the textile industry, as well as trade. There are very symptomatic indications in the expenditure structures, that is, the least is spent on materials, energy, spare parts, and small accessories that relate directly to the production process, thus the previous expenses of one-fifth were reduced to only 19 percent. Moreover, the private and social sectors in industry have greater orientation to trade, as something that pays more at this moment. While production expenses decrease, the non- material expenses rise, for instance salaries and interest rates, as well as extraordinary expenses. The bank interest rates are high, and along with the negative exchange rates, they were responsible for removing 21.5 percent of the total income, which exceeds costs for materials. Interest rates have consumed 8 percent of the total income of private, and 25 percent of the state and mixed companies, which is a burden that even the best companies cannot sustain. Each Third -- a Loser The gross profit in the economy last year, compared to the year before, has literally been halved and has almost disappeared, and loss is more dominant. Gross profit has been calculated as being almost the same in private and state companies, the reason being that the private ones are more efficient, have lower interest rates, but they also give smaller salaries to their workers. The financial experts have calculated that if private owners gave the same salaries as the state ones, they would have no profit at all. To illustrate, if the average salary last year was 3,274 denars, a smaller than average salary was given to 84.2 percent of the employees in the private sector, and 54.8 percent in the state sector. On the other hand, the economy paid out 20 percent more income than it earned last year, and this uncovered expenditure is due to salaries and the financing of public consumption. That is, last year the money for salaries was 5 percent greater, 2 percent greater for public consumption, and 4 percent greater for taxes. Half of the money in state companies went on salaries last year, while the private owners spent more money on investment. Losses reached 11.7 billion denars, with every third company in the state sustaining a loss (over 8,000 companies). Although over 90 percent of the loss-making companies are private, 91 percent of the loss is in the state sector, and the total sum of the loss indicates a more difficult situation than ever in the economy.
