Galina Sidrova stressed that the ITAR-TASS news agency has distorted the meaning of what the minister said. According to the ITAR-TASS news agency, Andrey Kozyrev objected to the withdrawal of Russia's troops from those regions. America's Department of State has pointed out that what minister said, as was quoted by the news media, runs counter to the statements made at the Russian-American summit. A spokesman of the State Department, Michael McKerry, noted that the joint declaration of the Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin speaks about the speedy withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic countries.
