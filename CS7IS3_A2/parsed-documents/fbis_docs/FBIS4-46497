It's Harder To Observe the Interests of the Sides"] [Text] An abundance of the most acute problems--political, economic, diplomatic, purely military, and even moral--have come together in the Black Sea Fleet like a tight sailor's knot. Unless we solve them, we could hardly hope to emerge from the `Black Sea dead-end' and relieve the tension under which Black Sea seamen are living and serving today," stated General of the Army Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense minister, at a Ministry of Defense press conference. Therefore, even despite the considerable concessions by the Russian delegation, and its patience with the excessive demands of the Ukrainian side, which sometimes went contrary to agreements reached previously, the first round of talks on dividing the Black Sea Fleet was unable to put an end to the protracted litigation: The military were unable to draft and initial a treaty that the presidents have already agreed upon. They weren't even able to sign a protocol on nonagreement of the parties, which naturally follows in such a case. Still, it cannot be said that the negotiations have broken down, or have reached an insurmountable impasse. The Russian Federation defense minister gave a large number of examples leading to the conclusion that the position of the Ukrainian side at the talks in Sevastopol was in diametric opposition to statements and announcements of the Ukrainian president. In particular, an item concerning joint basing of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy in Sevastopol, an item concerning "corridors" for the passage of Russian Black Sea ships to their bases that is discriminatory from the standpoint of international law of the sea, and a demand that the ships and vessels of the fleet be "transferred to the sides" fully manned (as if some third party is giving the Black Sea Fleet to Russia and Ukraine) were introduced into the document drafted by the Ukrainian side. Where all of this comes from, emphasized General of the Army Pavel Grachev, is from the fact that first of all the Ukrainian side does not wish to operate with universally recognized legal terms, and secondly, local executors are trying to interpret the Agreement on Stage-by-Stage Settlement of the Problems of the Black Sea Fleet, signed on 15 April in Moscow, to their own advantage. The act of dividing the ships, regarding which the negotiators did manage to reach agreement, having included all watercraft on the lists with accuracy "down to the sloop," was termed by Pavel Grachev as only the first stage of division. Division of the Black Sea Fleet is a lengthy process that will not fit within the framework of the current year, nor possibly even the next, 1995. But the main thing is this: We first need to resolve the matter of separate basing of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy. "We did not demand removal ships of the Ukrainian Navy from Crimea," Pavel Grachev stressed, "the ships could be based together, including at the five bases that we propose leaving for the Black Sea Fleet. But the headquarters must be separated. Where the headquarters of the Ukrainian Navy are to be located is a matter for Ukraine to resolve, but Sevastopol must remain the main base of the Black Sea Fleet." The search for consensus on this most important item of the 15 April agreement went on until the very last minute, emphasized special ambassador Yuriy Dubinin, who participated in the press conference. And while the fact that it was not reached is worthy of sympathy, it doesn't warrant a dramatic outburst. The documents signed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine were drafted in such a way that there is nothing in them left for interpretation at the level of the executors. They need to be fulfilled or not fulfilled. From all appearances, the Ukrainian delegation took the path of nonfulfillment, which predetermined the outcome of the meeting in Sevastopol. There simply cannot be a third party to the process of settling the Black Sea problems--this is a matter exclusively for Russia and Ukraine. This was categorically stated by participants of the press conference at the Russian Ministry of Defense. There is a way out of the "Black Sea dead-end" even in the absence of interference from without. We need to continue the negotiation process. However, we need to begin the second round not with debates but with an effort to agree on terms and on the subject of discussion. In the words of Pavel Grachev, it would be suitable to create state commissions under the leadership of the prime ministers or their first deputies in preparation for the next such meeting, and include representatives of all interested ministries and departments in their membership so as to determine exactly how much is owed to whom. Otherwise, the discussion would simply continue "with raised voices." However, Yuriy Dubinin stated during the press conference that there are grounds for believing that the problems of the Black Sea Fleet will be resolved peacefully, and in the interests of the peoples of Russia and Ukraine. As the special ambassador explained, it was agreed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will make a visit to Ukraine, during which a major treaty between the two states is to be signed. This could bring the process of unraveling the Black Sea knot to its conclusion, so long as the aides to President Leonid Kravchuk do not let down their leader, as they have done before, in fulfilling Ukraine's international obligations.
