The family of 17-year-old Shiu Chi-ho, who was found guilty of four charges of spray-painting cars with American Michael Fay and others, will be consulted by the Hong Kong Government before any decision is made. "We will wait until we have a formal report and have taken advice before we react," a spokesman for Mr Patten said last night. Legislator Emily Lau Wai-hing urged supportive and sympathetic action by the Government on what she described as a cruel punishment. "When Hong Kong people get into trouble overseas, of course they look to the Government for help, but it is doubtful whether anything can be achieved because the American protests [over Fay's sentence] have had absolutely no effect," she said.
