Yesterday he met the Norwegian prime minister, foreign minister, trade minister, and fisheries minister in separate meetings. At a subsequent news conference, he used up so much time in speaking in general terms about France's desire to bring Norway into the EU, and there was no time to discuss in detail the problems in the negotiations. It would not be right to say anything about France's position on Norway's fisheries demands before the EU countries have reached a common position, he said. However, Lamassoure stressed it was of crucial importance for the EU to arrive at a common fisheries policy. "We have to arrive at a single Europe on fisheries, not two. Nevertheless, for a certain period we will have to look at what sort of transitional arrangements are needed," he said. In the section of the negotiations on agriculture, the EU has agreed to reject the Norwegian demand for a gradual adjustment to the EU's agricultural policy. This runs contrary to the signals that Gro Harlem Brundtland and Gunhild Oyangen received during their visits to Paris a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, Lamassoure did not think that Harlem Brundtland had misunderstood the situation in Paris: "There are some purely technical problems in these negotiations, but I do not think that we will have major difficulties reaching agreement on agriculture," he said. If we are to be bold enough to interpret the French minister's words, this must mean that France could, when all is said and done, envisage supporting Norway on transitional arrangements for agriculture. However, an interpretation of his general remarks on fish is less optimistic. The most probable interpretation is that France will go against Norway's demand that it retain control over fishing north of the 62d parallel -- in addition to demanding transitional arrangements on market access -- according to information received by AFTENPOSTEN in Brussels. According to Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen, Lamassoure did not touch on the question of French transitional arrangements for Norwegian market access during the two ministers' meeting yesterday. Lamassoure largely used his half-hour with the fisheries minister to listen to the fisheries demands Norway is making in the negotiations with the EU -- with full market access from day one of membership and not a single fish to be given away in quota arrangements as the main points. The EU Commission will not make known its response to the Norwegian demands until 17 February. Olsen is otherwise happy that France has again opened the door to fish imports from Norway, but wants to wait and see how the transport of fish will pass off in practice. "Lamassoure gave assurances that customs controls will become a lot easier and that veterinary tests on loads of Norwegian fish will take a maximum of 24 hours," the minister said.
