"Sending a Turkish military contingent to Bosnia would set a precedent which the Security Council should not accept, and should certainly not be the one to set it, because Turkey has failed to keep the necessary neutrality during the civil war in Bosnia, and it even openly sided with the Muslim side. In addition, Turkey is a country whose centuries-long occupation-style rule of this region is still alive in the memory of the Serb nation," the letter stresses. Deputies of the Srpska republic's people's assembly believe, it is stated, that this decision is morally and humanly impermissible, and that it would be counterproductive for the peace process. "The Srpska republic assembly charged me with warning you of fatal consequences of that action," Krajisnik stresses in his letter.
