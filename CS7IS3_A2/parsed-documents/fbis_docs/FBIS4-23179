Dr Dawie de Villiers, chairman of the NP's disbanded Cape Province structure and minister of environment affairs and tourism in the government of national unity, was elected leader of the NP's Western Cape region under the party's new federal structure. Agriculture Minister and Senator Dr Kraai van Niekerk was voted head of the Northern Cape region, and Dr Tertius Delport as Eastern Cape leader. The Cape National Party formally disbanded at its last congress on Saturday, when party delegates at the Strand Civic Centre unanimously adopted the NP's new federal constitution. Discussions on the draft provincial constitutions were postponed. The three Cape provincial regions were to be formally constituted at congresses later this year, possibly in October, an NP source said. The three new provincial leaders would constitute a committee to decide on the divisions of assets, liabilities and staff matters. In his address, Dr de Villiers said the three Cape provinces had contributed 41.9 percent of the NP's total national tally in the general elections. He said the system of proportional representation was good, but had also led to MPs being severed from their constituencies. In future, magisterial districts should replace the old Westminster-type constituencies as the only logical and practical way around the problem of representation. One or more party officers should be appointed in each magisterial district. The revamped structure of proportional representation should be verified when the country's final constitution was written over the coming two years. Dr de Villiers said the NP had done better than expected in the "liberation elections", but had to get down to work immediately to start preparing for the 1999 poll. "The NP will continue to grow in strength and exercise its influence... Our values and principles are greater than any challenges and problems," he said to a standing ovation. Western Cape Premier Mr Hernus Kriel was elected deputy chairman in the province, along with Mrs Maretha Badenhorst MP and Western Cape Housing Minister Mr Gerald Morkel. Dr Delport's Eastern Cape deputy is Mr Tobie Meyer, with Mr Manie Schoeman, Mr Donald Lee and Mrs Ann Nash elected as vice-chairmen. The Northern Cape vice-chairmen are Mr P W Saaiman, Mrs Peggie Hollander and Mr Jan Brazelle. Dr de Villiers said he had experienced some longing and nostalgia at the end of his five years as leader of the Cape NP -- and as one of only five leaders to have led the party in the former province in the past 79 years. The party faced big and difficult challenges. As a member of the government of national unity it would also serve as the oppositon, and would have to carry its supporters. It had to be more responsive to the communities it represented and be more than just a political party. Dr van Niekerk proposed that the three new provincial structures continue meeting every two or three years. "People should not be discouraged, or think we are doing a mopping-up operation; we are busy establishing South Africa on a new footing." Dr Delport said, "as Christians, we make room and welcome others, but the NP cannot move from the basic values which it built over so many years. We must make sure that it is the party which wins the 1999 elections."
