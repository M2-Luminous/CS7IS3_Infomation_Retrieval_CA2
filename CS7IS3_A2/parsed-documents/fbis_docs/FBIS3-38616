Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that even "our best friends" are saying it is high time for German foreign policy to be "fully capable of acting." After all, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], which has been blocking the necessary constitutional change, also speaks out for a permanent seat in the Security Council. But this cannot be achieved, if Germany wants to play a special role. The Social Democrats, on the other hand, are warning Kinkel not to pay too high a price. The foreign minister "wants to get into boots that are too big for him by all means," SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen said. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping wants to comment on the matter at the Military Defense Meeting in Munich on Saturday [5 February]. Kinkel told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG that the resolutions of the U.S. Senate are in accord with what he hears from the administration in Washington. A talk he had with UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright has confirmed his impression that the Clinton administration is in favor of Germany holding a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, but that it expects Germany to be fully capable of acting. London and Paris have changed over to those in favor under similar conditions, he said. "We want to be in the Security Council," Kinkel said, but "not with foam at the mouth." This is, of course, only possible if there is an overall extension, which includes the Third World, he said. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, with whom he had just talked, does not see this any differently, he said. Germany only has a chance to get a permanent seat if "it fully stands by its duties." Kinkel said it is unfortunate that the SPD chairman, who realizes that the Bundeswehr has to take on a new role, was not able to get his way at the party conference. He said he is calling upon the SPD to end its "blockade." Otherwise, the only hope that remains is the Federal Constitutional Court. In resolutions that were obviously aiming at the German discussion, the U.S. Senate twice called on Germany recently to participate "fully" in UN military missions. Republican senators said that if Bonn and Tokyo wanted to get onto the Security Council, they must become aware of the link between global power and responsibility. Many Germans do not seem to have realized that rights are always linked to duties. In the opinion of SPD Manager Guenter Verheugen, Kinkel's "very brisk approach" meets with international criticism rather than serious support. He said he thinks that the envisaged reforms of the Security Council will get stuck "in the masses of unsolved problems." The fact that Washington links Bonn's application to expectations "that we cannot and do not want to fulfill," is an additional aggravating factor. If the ticket to the Security Council has to be paid for with the willingness to "take part in an un-German, selective practice of interventions" by military means, the price is too high. According to Verheugen, a "somewhat more cautious approach" is necessary.
