ACTION: Companies interested in bidding for contracts to supply inspection equipment for evaluation and use in training of inspectors to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Provisional Technical Secretariat in The Hague, The Netherlands. SUMMARY: The U.S. Government has been notified that the Provisional Technical Secretariat (PTS), predecessor to the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), a new international organization created by the Chemical Weapons Convention, is beginning the process of procuring inspection equipment for the evaluation and use in training of inspectors. The PTS has requested that by October 1, 1994, each Member State identify companies interested in bidding for contracts to provide such equipment. Upon receipt of names of interested companies, the PTS will compile an initial tender list for each type of equipment. Because this information could be considered commercially sensitive, all responses will be classified as confidential by the PTS and will be treated accordingly. Only the names and addresses of interested companies will be made available to Member States. Interested companies must answer a questionnaire providing company and production information and return it to the PTS in The Hague, The Netherlands, by October 1, 1994. Packages containing the questionnaire and specific information about equipment needed by the PTS can be obtained by contacting ACDA at the address below. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Interested companies should contact Mary Fannin (202) 647&hyph;8018 or Jennifer Inman (202) 647&hyph;6465, FAX: (202) 647&hyph;7663, at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 320 21st Street NW., Washington, DC 20451.
