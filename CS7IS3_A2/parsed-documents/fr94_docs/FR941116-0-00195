FR941116-0-00195 FR941116-0-00023 The Committee published the proposed rule in the Federal Register of July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38318). Eighteen commenters submitted comments on the proposed rule. Thirteen of these commenters supported the rule as proposed, and were particularly supportive of the proposed changes to §§51&hyph;2.4, 51&hyph;2.7, and 51&hyph;3.2 to make them consistent with the JWOD Act distinctions between suitability and fair market price determinations. One commenter suggested that §51&hyph;2.3 on notice of proposed Procurement List additions and deletions be amended to require actual notice to current contractors for the commodities or services being considered, and to require the Committee to publish notice of the proposal in the Commerce Business Daily as well as the Federal Register , in order to provide wider notice of the Committee's proposals. The Committee has considered this suggestion in the past. However, the Committee has concluded that the benefits which adopting this suggestion might provide are outweighed by the considerable administrative burden which would be imposed on the Committee's small staff. The Committee already writes to current contractors when it is unable to obtain sales data on them from a financial reporting service, and experience has shown that some contractors do not respond and those who do rarely provide persuasive comments with their responses. In many cases, Government contracting activities, trade associations, or other persons are already notifying current contractors and other affected parties of the Committee's intentions. Under these circumstances, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to extend its notice of proposed actions beyond that which is mandated by law. The same commenter also suggested that the employment potential requirement for a Committee determination that a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List, at newly redesignated §51&hyph;2.4(a)(1), be changed to require the addition to generate employment for a larger number of persons who are blind or have severe disabilities than is performed by such employees of the current contractor in connection with the commodity or service. The Committee does not believe this change is necessary because it is already required by law to consider and respond to all significant comments it receives when it makes a Procurement List addition decision. It should also be noted that the Committee's regulatory definition of persons with severe disabilities (41 CFR 51&hyph;1.3) requires them to be incapable of normal competitive employment over an extended period of time, a test which employees of a competitive contractor could not meet. This commenter also suggested that an additional factor be added to those listed in newly redesignated §§51&hyph;2.4(a)(4)(i)(A) through (C) concerning elements of impact on a current contractor to which the Committee gives particular attention in making a suitability determination, to require the consideration of whether the contractor has made an unrecovered capital or training investment in connection with the commodity or service, and whether losing the contract will cause idle productive capacity or unemployment in a labor surplus area. The Committee believes this change is not needed because it already considers any comments of this nature it receives as required by the rulemaking statute. The Committee is also required by §51&hyph;2.4(a)(4)(i)(C) to give particular attention to comments received on contractor impact as a result of its notice proposing addition of the commodity or service to the Procurement List. Another commenter objected to the proposed addition to §51&hyph;2.4(a)(4)(i)(A) of language indicating that the Committee looks at the impact on a current contractor's total sales, including sales of affiliated companies and parent corporations, in determining the suitability of an addition to the Procurement List. The commenter felt this position is unfair, as it can result in a heavy impact on a corporate division. As indicated in the proposed rule, the Committee believes that the new language is nothing more than a clarification of its existing policy in this area, which it recently reaffirmed. Given the ability of large corporations to shift assets between divisions, the Committee does not believe it would be fair to the nonprofit agencies participating in the Committee's program to assess impact on a part of a large corporation in the same manner as a small independent business. This same commenter objected to new language in §51&hyph;2.5 concerning the addition to the Procurement List of a commodity or service ``in whole or in part.'' The commenter felt that this language would permit the Committee to extend the reach of a Procurement List addition beyond a particular commodity into a larger line of commodities. The Committee believes that the commenter misunderstood the intent of the change, which was discussed in the proposed rule. The Committee's intent was to clarify an existing provision which permits the Committee, when it decides that a proposed addition to the Procurement List of the total Government requirement for a commodity or service is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, to add only a part of the requirement to lessen the impact on the contractor. There is no intent in this language to permit the expansion of the addition beyond what is specifically stated in the final rule making a Procurement List addition.
