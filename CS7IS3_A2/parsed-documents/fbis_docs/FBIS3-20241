Now we have to see how many seats we have, how many parliamentarians we have. I think we can say that we can govern with the Freedom Alliance, but bearing in mind that for years the League has guaranteed democracy in the country, and it will have to assess how to prevent the reactionary right from getting through, so we want to understand things well. [sentence as heard] First, see the programs, then undertstand with whom and how, in short, a government can be formed. [passage omitted] We have a general indication that the Freedom Alliance has won, together with the MSI [Italian Social Movement], i.e., the vote that comes from the south which will reopen the North's wallet, in short. So, you will understand we have to understand each other to assess whether there is space for an agreement for government. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Do you see a reactionary right wing? [Bossi] Yes, there it is with 12 percent given to the MSI. [passage omitted]
