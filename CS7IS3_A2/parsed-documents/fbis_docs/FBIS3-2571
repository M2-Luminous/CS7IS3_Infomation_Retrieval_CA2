In the past years, these enterprises have undertaken most of the important research programs in the province and developed many new products of national significance, the official said. These products include a microwave cancer killer, artificial bone, optic-fibre and natural carotene. The Department of Science and Technology of the provincial government last year made a survey of 72 products of 44 private high-tech enterprises. The survey showed that most of the 72 products are at or near advanced international levels. Many are best-selling or have great market potential. The province has so far registered more than 1,000 private high-tech enterprises, most of them being started and operated by scientific researchers or experts. The employees of all these enterprises have a sophisticated professional background. The officials said some 5,900 employees of the around-1,000 enterprises are of senior or medium professional level. The official said more than 90 percent of these enterprises maintain close co-operation with scientific bodies and universities in the interior, where most of the employees came from. This very close tie has enabled these enterprises to carry out a large part of the early-stage research and even manufacture at cheaper costs and formed a powerful backing to their development, the official said.
