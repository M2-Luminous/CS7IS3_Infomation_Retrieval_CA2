Conscious of the fact that he has been militarily defeated in this former Yugoslav republic, Franjo Tudjman is now offering the Muslim people a federation with the Croats and a confederation with the Republic of Croatia. Although he does not care much for Muslims, he is doing this because he is under pressure from the United States and is hoping to create a military counterbalance to Serbia. At the moment, for him, the alliance is the lesser of two evils. Moreover, he was the one who flatly refused all proposals for a Bosnian-Croatian union. This was stated yesterday by Rasim Ljajic, head of the Sandzak branch of the Party for Democratic Action [SDA], who said that Tudjman was still counting on good relations with Milosevic and the return of the lost territories in the Krajina. Ljajic advised his compatriots in Bosnia to think before entering into any kind of alliance with the Croats.
