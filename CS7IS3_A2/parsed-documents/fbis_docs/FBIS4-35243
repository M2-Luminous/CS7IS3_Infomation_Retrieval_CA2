The sources said the Cabinet decided to remove Dr. Zu'bi from his post during a session Saturday, but has not yet agreed on a replacement for him. Dr. al-Zu'bi who had earlier worked as an ambassador, took up his post at Parliament in 1990. Sources said among the candidates to replace Dr. Zu'bi are Helmi al-Sarabi, a legal advisor at the Prime Ministry and Hakam Khayr, who is the official spokesman of al-Watan Party. Mr. Khayr's affiliation with al-Watan, however, could weaken his chances to land the job as it is preferred that the general secretary of Parliament is an independent figure, the sources said. "We hope that the newcomer would be able to redress the deterioration in support services provided to deputies by the General Secretariat," one lawmaker told the JORDAN TIMES. The deputy said there has been a noticeable regression in the quality of administrative services awarded to lawmakers, which reflected on their ability to deal effectively with issues of concern to the public. Other parliamentary sources echoed the lawmaker in expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of the General Secretariat, saying they hoped the change would bring about an improvement in the services it is supposed to extend to lawmakers.
