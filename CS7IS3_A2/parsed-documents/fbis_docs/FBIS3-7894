Security Council on no-fly zone in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The statement, handed to CTK, says that after the recent NATO ultimatum which contributed to the removal of heavy weaponry from Sarajevo and its surroundings, the alliance has again shown a determination to create conditions necessary for political talks on resolving the crisis. The ministry holds the view that those forces who sent the combat aircraft, thus trying to expand the warfare from ground to air, are responsible for the use of military power in Bosnia and Herzegovina, says the statement. The ministry voiced the hope that the shooting down of the Galeb aircraft will not provoke attempts to retaliate against the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Froces] troops. Should this development occur, a previous decision of the U.N. Security Council on the protection of the UNPROFOR troops, including the possible use of the air force, should be implemented, the statement says.
