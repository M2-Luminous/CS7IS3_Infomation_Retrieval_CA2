"We did not tackle any territorial disputes during our negotiations, but merely fixed the borderline in keeping with earlier signed Russo-Chinese treaties," ITAR-TASS was told by Genrikh Kiriyev, roving ambassador and leader of the Russian delegation. "The adopted joint protocol reflects many problems linked with demarcation. We have studied very carefully the depth of border rivers. Not all the problems have been solved and the negotiations will be continued at the next session of the joint commission." Kiriyev noted during a press conference here that he did not deem it possible to revise separate articles of the agreement concluded with the People's Republic of China in 1991 on the eastern stretch of the Russo-Chinese border, because their revision was tantamount to the revision of all the agreement. A denunciation of the agreement is also out of the question," he stated. Asked about the future of the Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands near Khabarovsk, Kiriyev stressed: "We insist firmly and persistently that these islands belong to Russia. The population of the Amur region can rest assured that nobody wants to give up the islands." The Russian delegation included representatives from the Foreign Ministry, the chief command of the Federal Borderguard Service, the Defence Ministry, and heads of the governing bodies of the border territories and regions of the Russian Far East.
