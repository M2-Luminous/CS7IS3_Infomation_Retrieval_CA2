They have passed from cooperation and solidarity between a richer country -- Spain -- and another in a poorer economic condition -- Argentina -- to a trade relationship based on exchange between equals. This was made clear during the course of the visit that Argentine President Carlos Menem is paying to our country, at a time when our excellent bilateral relations are clouded by just one problem: Iberia's negotiations with Aerolineas Argentinas -- a report from Martin Meden. [Begin Meden recording] Felipe Gonzalez recalled that in 1989 he backed the future of Argentina by recommending investment there, and today he congratulated President Menem on what he considers the success of his country. Argentina and Spain, Menem and Gonzalez agreed, are now on the same political and economic level, thereby favoring the European Union's understanding of the process of Latin America's integration with the United States. Gonzalez said that Spain supports the diplomatic and peaceful claim of Argentine sovereignty over the Malvinas [Falkland] Islands. [end recording] [passage omitted]
