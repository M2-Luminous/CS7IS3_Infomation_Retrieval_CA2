After becoming acquainted with the supplied materials, the committee concluded that the draft did not allow for the real dynamics of socioeconomic indices of the current year. In particular, in January and February the volume of production dropped not by 9 percent, as planned, but by 24 percent. What is more, the draft did not adhere to the priorities of economic policy proclaimed in the presidential message. And finally, a number of documents, without which the Duma members did not think it possible to accept responsibility for adopting such a budget, had not been submitted. The committee will recommend to the Duma that it take into consideration the budget report of the Government of the Russian Federation and continue work only after the described deficiencies had been corrected. Regarding the defense budget, all factions without exception are talking about it today. And in particular the leader of the "Vybor Rossii" [Choice of Russia] faction Yegor Gaydar has his own opinion about military expenditures. Responding to a question from a KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent, he stressed that the faction will favor the adoption of that version of the defense budget which was submitted today by the government of the Russian Federation. As Gaydar stated, "Today in the defense budget there are no surface reserves" allowing it to be reduced solely at the expense of the Defense Ministry. However, the leader of "Vybor Rossii" believes that "a long-term program of military reform and long-term program of reductions in the Armed Forces is required." In the future, Gaydar sees a reduction in military expenditures through structuring of the Armed Forces and reduction in military units "which today are undermanned and therefore not combat ready." However, Yegor Gaydar's position is not fully shared by his colleagues in the faction or by the Chairman of the Defense Committee Sergey Yushenkov. He stated to the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent that he would try to obtain ratification of the defense budget "at least at the 1993 level." But the present proposed level of defense expenditures, as you know, is less than last year. The press has stated that a number of ministries are insisting on revision of the benefits list for service members. In the press service of the Government of the Russian Federation, it was reported that at the last session of the government, this question was not raised, and it is still not known whether the question will be considered next Thursday. However, the position of the departments which are forced to pay for a number of benefits granted to service members by the RF Law "On the Status of Service Members" partially from their own pockets has been and remains unchanged: Such benefits should be paid from the federal budget. This is understood by all, but the "damned question" of money (which apparently the state, it turns out, does not have for the adopted law) stirs up public opinion and heats up passions. The departments do not want to pay benefits to the army at their own expense. The Defense Ministry does not have a kopeck for this purpose. The federal budget, with which all agree, is not made of rubber either. What is the solution? They are searching for it, including in the State Duma. Sergey Yushenkov said that the question will be considered at a session of the Defense Committee. The Duma members have different approaches to the question. Yushenkov himself wants to continue seeking implementation of the "benefits" articles of the law and ensure their financing with a concrete line in the federal budget.
