Singapore aside, we are the richest country in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The amount exceeds the optimum [preceding word rendered in English] point. Under normal circumstances, the foreign reserve is maintained at a level just high enough for buying two or three months worth of imports. The present amount is sufficient for five or six months. This concerns us, because the money is just doing nothing at the national bank. For this reason, we want our business people to use this money to invest in other countries so that we can earn interest. We encourage our people to invest in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. [end recording] Meanwhile, Wichit Suphinit, governor of the Bank of Thailand, said that Thailand's foreign reserves are excessively high and enough to cover as much as seven months worth of imports. The Bank of Thailand will use the money to provide loans to its neighboring countries in line with the Finance Ministry policy.
