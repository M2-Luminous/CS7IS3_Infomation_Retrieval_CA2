FR940419-0-00061 FR940419-0-00019 10. Limitation of Disclosure One commenter recommended that EPA revise the rule to address disclosure of client information regarding the same subject matter as the instant solicitation, or directly relating to such subject matter as the instant solicitation. The commenter recommended either limiting disclosure to information connected to the solicitation or to work performed in the same state or region where the work for EPA will be performed. EPA requires disclosure of conflict of interest information related to the work performed or that will be performed for EPA. We do not require the submission of unrelated client or other information. All that is required is sufficient information for the EPA Contracting Officer to make an informed conflict of interest determination. 11. Disclosure of Client Information One comment raised the concern that contractors may be unable to divulge work performed for clients and the dollar value, since this information as well as client lists are routinely claimed to be confidential. The rule does not require the release of client lists or the reporting of the dollar value of work performed for clients. Rather, we require that a contractor disclose sufficient information to the Contracting Officer so that the Contracting Officer can make an informed decision. In most cases, this would involve the name of a client creating the potential conflict or the contractor, particularly if the client is a PRP on the site, and information regarding the nature of the work. Each case is different and there may be occasions where a client routinely claims confidentiality for the release of its name and other information concerning the conflict. If a disclosure waiver cannot be obtained from the client, the contractor should explore with the Contracting Officer suitable alternatives for providing information sufficient to permit the Contracting Officer to render an informed decision on the conflict. We urge contractors to identify confidential business information and stress that EPA is committed to protecting sensitive business and other information to the full extent permitted by law. 12. Availability of PRP Listings Commenters expressed the concern that contractors can not identify all conflicts of interest unless EPA informs contractors of all of the PRPs and of the possibility of future enforcement actions. They further stated that contractors are unable to sign the certifications accurately unless they know these facts. Several commenters also suggested that to avoid delays in contractor disclosure and certifications, EPA should furnish up-to-date listings of PRPs. EPA acknowledges the fact that PRPs are continually being identified and that contractors will not always have sufficient knowledge of all PRPs at the time certification is submitted. We require contractors to certify to the best of their knowledge and belief at the time of the certification. It is not EPA's intention to hold a contractor accountable for information which the contractor did not know or have reason to know at the time the certification was executed. We wish to stress, however, that disclosure of conflicts is a continuing obligation, and certification is a statement that should demonstrate a contractor has made a good faith effort to disclose all potential conflicts of interest. In order to alleviate contractors' concerns, the time period for the submission of the work assignment certification has been extended to permit a more reasonable time period for contractors to contact EPA and obtain the most current information concerning PRPs and future enforcement actions pertaining to sites identified in the work assignments or contract. The term ``work assignment'' in this rule includes other similar tasking documents such as a delivery order or a technical direction document. EPA is committed to providing contractors with the list of known PRPs for sites at the time of work assignment issuance. EPA is currently working to make available to all Contracting Officers the Superfund Enforcement Tracking System (SETS) report, which tracks PRPs by site. This report is available to the public through the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), Springfield, Virginia. 13. Period of Record for Conflict of Interest Checks One commenter requested clarification of the period to be searched for organizational and personal conflicts of interest. The commenter suggested that the organizational check include all prior work performed by the contractor but that the personal conflict of interest check be limited to the period of time that the individual is employed by the company or for a one year period, whichever is greater.
