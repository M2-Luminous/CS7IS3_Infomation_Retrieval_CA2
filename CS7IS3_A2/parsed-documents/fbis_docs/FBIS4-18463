A statement of the Main Executive Board on Tuesday [5 April] says that, according to the trade union's information, Schmidt investigated inroads of the Turkish military and intelligence service on the territory of northern Iraq. The 35-year-old photographer, member of the Media Trade Union, and her Kurdish companion had been shot in an ambush in the northern Iraqi part of Kurdistan on Sunday. The Media Trade Union appealed again to the Turkish Government to guarantee the protection of journalists who exercise their occupation in Kurdistan and their free and unhindered reporting. It called on the Foreign Ministry in Bonn to request the Turkish Government to observe the freedom of the press.
