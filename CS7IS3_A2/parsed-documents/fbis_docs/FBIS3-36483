This concerns a plan under which the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will inspect the DPRK nuclear facilities to confirm whether any attempt is made to produce atomic weapons in those facilities. DPRK and IAEA representatives have held several rounds of talks on inspections. However, the IAEA says it could not find a solution to this DPRK issue. Of course, [words indistinct] in connection with nuclear inspections aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula, and [words indistinct]. Washington warns that unless the DPRK resolves the issue concerning international nuclear inspections by 21 February, it will present this to the UN Security Council for deliberations. The United States says international economic sanctions [kyongje cheje chochi] can be imposed on the DPRK. Moscow has different views on resolving the nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. At a news conference, Mikhail Demurin, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman [as heard], said: [Begin Demurin, recording in Russian fading into Korean] The Russian Foreign Ministry thinks diplomatic means to resolve the nuclear issue have not been completely exhausted. Therefore, it is necessary to persistently and continuously try to find solutions to all the problems. [end recording] The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman also said: Russia is working in three directions. Russia supports dialogue between the DPRK and the United States, dialogue between the DPRK and the IAEA, and dialogue between the North and South of Korea. He stressed that it is fully possible to solve the problem of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula by working in these directions. Russian Ambassador to the ROK Georgiy Kunadze has the same view. He told the YONHAP News Agency that no tactics of pressure must be used against the DPRK and that the DPRK must not be driven to a difficult situation. We concur with these remarks. It is clear how Pyongyang will react if further pressure is brought on it. This may bring about an opposite result. Therefore, diplomatic efforts will be better than the tactics of ultimatum or pressure in resolving the nuclear issue on the peninsula.
