De Ronceray thinks if Article 149 is implemented, all conflicts and all threats will end. [Begin De Ronceray recording, in French] As long as the United States of America and the international community refuse to understand that the true enemies of democracy are illiteracy, hunger, unemployment, the lack of road and energy infrastructures, they will have no other alternative than the physical destruction of the Haitian people. As for those who deny us the right to resort to Article 149 of our fundamental charter to solve an internal political problem which is a matter of concern within our sovereign competence, we want to ask them: Since when have the Governors Island agreement and the New York pact taken the place of the 1987 Constitution? Facing this watershed, heavy with ordeals and humiliation for the black Haitian nation, the Mobilization for National Development [MDN] calls on all genuine sons and daughters of our country to keep cool and to serenely resist the new challenges of the international giants. [end recording] This was a statement by Prof. Hubert De Ronceray, leader of MDN.
