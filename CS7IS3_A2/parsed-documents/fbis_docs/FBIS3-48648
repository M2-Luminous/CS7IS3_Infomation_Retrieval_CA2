Korea had exports of 11.69 billion U.S. dollars and the lowest growth rate of the nine east Asian countries except for Hong Kong, which registered a 2.8-percent fall. Korean market share declined 0.1 percentage points to 4.9 percent. It was 4.2 percent in 1986 and since then had stayed above 5 percent. China's exports rose 21.3 percent, the highest rate of the nine countries, because of price competitiveness and increasing foreign investment. Beijing's share jumped from 7.3 percent to 8.5 percent. Singapore had 16.3 percent growth on the strength of electronic parts and Malaysia was at its elbow with 16.2 percent as Japanese companies are expanding their investments.
