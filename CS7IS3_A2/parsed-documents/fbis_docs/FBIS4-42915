Bill Clinton, whose trip to France will leave an unexpected mark and who surprised people with his determination, skill, and charisma, stressed his strength in a speech before the National Assembly to express his faith in Europe, to point the way to its future, and to offer it American support. Would it be an offense to the memory of Kennedy to speak of a new frontier regarding the grand European design evoked by Clinton? At the very least, the U.S. President had pledged he would give impetus to a cause which we wrongly felt had been relegated to secondary standing on the White House's list. Of course, allowances must be made. Clinton could not come to Europe without boosting Europe. The specific circumstances of his visit were doubly binding on him. Lastly, his commitment to Europe was not given free of charge. He is actually responding to American interests, and it will be no coincidence if the "Europe according to Clinton" closely follows these interests. Indeed, such a Europe will not be to the taste of all the various attitudes found in Europe. He has such a pragmatic vision that we will grant him the mental reservation of seeing Europe as the Trojan Horse of American interests [sentence as received]. Is he not actually preempting this suspicion by coming out in favor of a European defense identity and by hoping for a strong Europe alongside a strong America? It is up to us, Europeans, to assess the common aspects and overlapping between our interests and those of the United States. Who would contest Clinton's analysis of the necessary development of a market economy in the countries of East Europe, and who would contest that Europe has a dominating role to play in this strategy? In this respect, Clinton taught us a good lesson yesterday. Have we not wasted enough time? Similarly, who would deny that Europe and the United States have a joint responsibility to export democracy? Yesterday, Clinton set us back on the track of our European obligation. We should at least recall this lesson drawn from encouraging words which -- even if they have some underlying reservations -- should lead us to overcome our disillusion.
