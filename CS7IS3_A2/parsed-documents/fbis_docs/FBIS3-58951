Solutions regarding car component suppliers and the brandy monopoly are in the offing. Then the final spurt will begin. Up to four more chapters can be settled in a new round of negotiations at the level of ambassadors on 21 January. Thus 17 of 29 chapters would be checked off for Austria. Once agreement is achieved in the areas of competition, free trade in services, the customs union, and foreign trade, "we will have our hands free for the political finish," said Austria's EU Ambassador, Manfred Scheich. In the next round at ministerial level on 8 February, "the course must be set for solutions" to the important issues of transit traffic, second homes, and agriculture, said Scheich. A solution was found to the problem of Austrian supplies for the Japanese automobile sector, which are coupled to import quota. The EU Commission is ready to consider this traditional agreement between Vienna and Tokyo in the scope of its annual negotiations with Japan on import quotas for private cars for the whole of the European Union. In the area of competition, after the three-year transition period for the tobacco monopoly, a one-year transition period has now also been agreed upon for the brandy monopoly which must be abolished in the sales area. Agriculture is the largest hurdle in the final heated phase of the membership negotiations, which are to be concluded by March. Until recently, Vienna did not have a clear position on the EU proposal that as soon as Austria is a member, it will have to reduce farm prices, and that at the same time, compensation will be paid for the farmers through direct income subsidies. The new "single market model," which is now being discussed among EU member states, no longer envisages price adjustments of several years -- as was the case in the past when new members were admitted -- by "membership compensation payments" being collected for imports and exports of agricultural products at the borders. In Vienna, the option was examined to carry out this system of price adjustment levies (on imports) and refunds (on exports) without border checks, which is preferred by farmers' representatives, by way of using trade statistics at home. This would mean, however, that during a transition period of several years, Austria's consumers would have to continue to pay higher food prices than are paid in the other EU member states. The European Union wants to see the losses of Austrian farmers compensated for by direct income subsidies. It is not yet clear who is supposed to pay. Meanwhile, EU Council Chairman Theodoros Pangalos has said he does not rule out different membership dates for Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway. According to Pangalos, the European Union, who has also received membership applications from Cyprus and Malta, will presumably begin negotiations with Cyprus on 1 January 1995.
