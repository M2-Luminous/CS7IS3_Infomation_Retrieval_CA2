These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's central offices at Government House. The vice president is heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150 other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities. "What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups, cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy," Cardenas said. During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held short meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize winner. "The central issue of all dialogues with these important world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and improving relations with that nation," the vice president explained. "Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special mission in this country," Cardenas said, stressing the importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced by one of the African continent's more powerful nations. At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will have "an exclusive meeting" with President Nelson Mandela to discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic factor in both nations. Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change process in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, "but there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy, that this is no longer a dream." Cardenas said some South African countries "are interested in details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform. They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated." The vice president said that during his short meeting with Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de Lozada's inauguration last August. "Castro again thanked the Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his historic visit." Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness over his visit to Bolivia last March. "The wife of the U.S. president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the adjacent settlements." The vice president said: "Bolivia is remembered by these distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization project, education reform, and people's participation." "South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot. We must be grateful because the process of change has not left as many victims in Bolivia as in South Africa where the wounds are still fresh," the vice president said.
