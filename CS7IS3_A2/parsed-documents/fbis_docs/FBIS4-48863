Tubmanburg fell to Johnson's forces last week in the latest flare up of fighting, but Alhaji Koromah claims to be fighting back and there have been allegations that ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] troops are helping the Johnson faction. And, as Nii Nartey Allison reports in this fax from Monrovia, there have been more clashes in Tubmanburg today: UN officials said here today that the Mandingo and the Krahn factions were occupying the hills surrounding the city, and that no particular group appears to be in control of Tubmanburg center. According to one UN official, the situation changes every hour and it is quite desperate for the civilian population. The UN official said that at least 10,000 people have fled Tubmanburg and were now seeking refuge at the only government hospital and at the base camps of the African peacekeeping force. He added that there was no water and that food and medicine supplies were running out. He said that there was also a problem of shelter, with more people still flocking into the safe zone. A planned UN convoy carrying 21 metric tons of badly needed food and medicines, scheduled to have been escorted today into Tubmanburg by heavily armed African peacekeeping troops, is being delayed by the fighting.
