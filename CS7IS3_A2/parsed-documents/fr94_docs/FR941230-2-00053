FR941230-2-00053 FR941230-2-00043 The CGA has agreed to grant local and overhead trackage rights to NSR, over approximately 98.4 miles of rail line between Green, GA (milepost C&hyph;61.4), and Senoia, GA (milepost C&hyph;70.0) and between Wansley Junction, GA (milepost WA&hyph;.0) and Wansley, GA (milepost WA&hyph;7.0). The Wansley Junction-Wansley line originates from the Green-Senoia line at milepost C&hyph;302.0. The Green-Senoia line connects with NSR's Ooltewah-Atlanta line (over which CGA will receive the trackage rights indicated above) at Green (milepost 92.0&hyph; on the Ooltewah-Atlanta line, which is milepost C&hyph;361.4 on the Green-Senoia line). As previously stated, the trackage rights will expand existing trackage rights and are related to each other because they will allow two carriers within a corporate family, NSR and CGR, the ability to provide direct single-carrier local service over the same lines of railroad of these affiliated carriers in southeastern Tennessee and northwestern Georgia. The exemption became effective on December 19, 1994. Operations under the trackage rights are scheduled to begin on or after December 30, 1994. This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(3) and (7). If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: James R. Paschall, Norfolk Southern Corporation, Three Commercial Place, Norfolk, VA 23510&hyph;191. As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the trackage rights will be protected pursuant to Norfolk and Western Ry. Co._Trackage Rights_BN, 354 I.C.C. 605 (1978), as modified in Mendocino Coast Ry., Inc._Lease and Operate, 360 I.C.C. 653 (1980). Decided: December 22, 1994. By the Commission, David M.
