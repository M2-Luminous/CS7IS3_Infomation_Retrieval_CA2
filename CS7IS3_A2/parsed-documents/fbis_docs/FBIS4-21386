Money for the maritime processing of this waste and utilization has not been allocated. Russia has a shortage of money and some projects, including ecological, are scarcely not financed. In early March an official representative of the Finance Ministry said the problem will be solved in the near future, but there have been no results. The problem of utilization of water from Russian subs' nuclear reactors aggravated in mid-October. Some 900 cubic meters of liquid waste was dumped and some 700 cubic meters more were waiting for their turn. All this provoked a negative reaction of the international public, meanwhile the dumping was coordinated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the competent Russian ministries. Great Britain and France have the right to similar dumping till 2018, and Japan is also dumping its radioactive waste in the sea. The problem of Russian radioactive waste utilization can be solved only by the construction of special decontaminating installations. Russia has not received the promised Western assistance, and a special tanker for waste storage offered by Japan appeared to be useless.
