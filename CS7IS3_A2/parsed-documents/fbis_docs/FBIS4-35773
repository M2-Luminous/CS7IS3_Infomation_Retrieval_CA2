The fighting broke out when Hizballah guerrillas refused to have their vehicles searched for weapons at a Fijian checkpoint in the Tyre region near Israel's self-declared "security zone" in south Lebanon, Timor Goksel told reporters. Shooting broke out during which a Hizballah guerrilla was killed and a Fijian soldier wounded, he added. Sporadic gunfire also targeted three other Fijian positions in the Tyre region but there were no casualties, the spokesman said. Correspondents in south Lebanon also reported intense Israeli reconnaissance flights over the region overnight and until the early morning hours. Heightened tension has gripped south Lebanon after Thursday's devastating Israeli air raid on a Hizballah training base in the Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley, in eastern Lebanon, which prompted retaliatory rocketing of northern Israel. Israeli soldiers and their proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) was on red alert in the security zone and residents of northern Israel spent the night in bomb shelters. The Lebanese army and anti-Israeli guerrillas in south Lebanon were also on alert. The air raid on a tent camp near the Syrian border killed 26 guerrillas and wounded 40 others, according to Hizballah. Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bwwayz put the death toll at 45 and hospitals officials in the Syrian-controlled eastern al-Biqa' Valley town of Ba'labakk said they were treating as many as 85 injured.
