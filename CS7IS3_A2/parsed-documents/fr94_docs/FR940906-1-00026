FR940906-1-00026 FR940906-1-00010 Based on Region 6's Level III review, Texas has satisfied all of the EPA's requirements for purposes of providing a comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions in the ozone nonattainment areas. A summary of Region 6's Level III review is given below: 1. The IPP and QA plan were submitted and approved. The QA plan was implemented and documented in the submission. 2. The documentation was adequate for the reviewer to determine the estimation procedures and data sources used to develop the inventory for all emission types. 3. The point source inventory was found to be complete. 4. The point source emissions were estimated according to EPA guidance. 5. The area source inventory was found to be complete. 6. The area source emissions were estimated according to EPA guidance. 7. The biogenic emissions were calculated using the EPA PC&hyph;BEIS model. 8. The method used to develop VMT estimates was adequately described and documented. 9. The MOBILE model was used correctly. 10. The nonroad mobile emission estimates were correctly prepared according to current EPA guidance. Documentation of the Region 6 evaluation, including details of the review procedure, is contained in a memorandum (Attachment A) in the Technical Support Document (TSD). A general summary of the inventories is contained in Attachment B of the TSD. Proposed Action The EPA is proposing to fully approve the SIP 1990 base year ozone emission inventories submitted to the EPA for the Houston/Galveston, Beaumont/Port Arthur, El Paso, and Dallas/Fort Worth areas on November 17, 1993, as meeting the requirements of section 182(a)(1) of the Act. The State has submitted complete inventories containing point, area, biogenic, on-road, and non-road mobile source data, and accompanying documentation. Emissions from these sources are presented in the following tables: VOC [Ozone Seasonal Emissions in Tons Per Day] 1‚ê£ 1Point source emissions 1Area source emissions 1On-road mobile emissions 1Non-road mobile emissions 1Biogenic 1Total emissions HGA 480.34 229.01 251.72 195.11 335.47 1491.65 BPA 245.60 32.48 31.61 32.47 91.95 434.11 ELP 11.88 27.43 39.00 11.88 12.62 102.81 DFW 66.64 174.25 306.60 97.44 126.09 771.02
