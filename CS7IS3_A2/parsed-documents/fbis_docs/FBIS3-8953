He thus indirectly dismissed the claim by leaders of some right-wing parties that the new cabinet has already been completed to 80 percent. Asked whether he himself was to take over a government seat, Kanis said that the negotiating parties -- originally the opposition which brought about the fall of the preceding cabinet -- had agreed not to propose their top leaders to the new government. "I consider myself a top party leader," he added. However, he admitted that he had not attended the last negotiations on the issue, and therefore he had no exact information. Speculations emerged during the talks between the SDL and the Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), even before the fall of the government of Vladimir Meciar on March 11 that Kanis could be appointed the foreign minister in a possible HZDS-SDL coalition. According to some sources, all parties involved in the current talks on the composition of the new cabinet, are striving to fill the post of the foreign minister with their people. Kanis stressed that the SDL viewed the envisaged cabinet as "temporary." Its main task should be the preparation of the early elections, he added. He indicated that the SDL would insist on calling the early elections. [passage omitted] Kanis dismissed speculation of a rift within the SDL, as claimed recently by Meciar. The SDL has enough experienced members who "have mastered political practice" and know that only an appropriate compromise can guarantee the success in this field.
