Jurgen Knorr, head of the German group's semiconductor division, had recently announced that the company considered expanding one of its existing sites, on top of the planned investments in Dresden, in the former GDR. Siemens is planning to construct a new production unit in Ratisbonne, which will mainly develop logic circuits, thus creating around 200 jobs. Production at the new unit could start in mid-1995.
