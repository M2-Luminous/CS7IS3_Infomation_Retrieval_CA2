A preliminary list of 100 names included the managers (as of 15 April) of the largest commercial organizations--banks, exchanges, funds, joint-stock companies, trading houses, insurance companies, joint ventures, and so forth. The extent of these entrepreneurs' influence was determined by 50 experts--economics commentators of the leading mass media, economists and analysts from scientific and information centers, the managers of public economic organizations, and analysts from a number of commercial structures. A 10-point scale, where "10" is the maximum and "1" is the minimum evaluation of each businessman, was used, taking into account their contribution to the buildup of Russia's new market economy and economic power, and the amount of capital under each one's control. A list of 50 leading Russian businessmen was compiled, based on their average rating, in April 1994. In analyzing the published list of leading Russian businessmen, it should be taken into account that among the 100 "contenders" suggested for the experts' evaluation there were mainly managers of the so-called new economic subjects. In other words, in conformity with the intention of the survey, managers in the state sector were not included in the preliminary list; nevertheless, they continue to exert considerable influence in the formation of Russia's new economy and they have vast material and financial resources at their disposal. For this reason, primarily representatives of banking and financial circles, as well as trading and middleman capital, took part in the "economic Olympics." Managers of enterprises that could be included in the "production" category, such as S. Fedorov (9), N. Bekh (10), V. Kadannikov (11), and others, make up no more than 15 to 20 percent of the list. At the very top of the "pyramid"--the first four places--are financiers and bankers. But on the whole, representatives of financial capital make up more than half of the most successful businessmen. About one-third are stockbrokers and contemporary traders. Not all the experts were able to evaluate the economic role of each person. In this connection, it is interesting to note that V. Gusinskiy not only headed the list of leading Russian entrepreneurs, but he was the only one to receive an evaluation by the 50 experts--a unique case. The economic power of other businessmen was determined with difficulty by one to 18 persons: V. Vinogradov, M. Khodorkovskiy, V. Neverov, S. Fedorov, and K. Borovoy by one person and V. Guchnik by 18 persons. It follows from this that the role of those named above in building up the Russian market is quite well-known. [Turanov comment:] Rating Russian businessmen is a very difficult task because of the lack of reliable information on their incomes and the financial status of the firms they head. The opinion of experts obviously was based mainly on the image of the entrepreneurs and facts about the enterprises' activity reported in the mass media, as well as on "lobby" information. Nevertheless, the experts were equal to the task: in my opinion, the results of the survey accurately reflect the rating of the elite of Russian businessmen, both by personnel and by firms. The pattern of "elite" enterprises is completely in keeping with the boom in banking activity in Russia--over half of the leading businessmen are managers of major banks. Because of the lack of development of the commodity futures market and stock markets, just two commodity exchanges (the MTV of Yu. Milyukov and the RTSB [Russian Commodity and Raw Materials Exchange] of K. Borovoy and A. Vlasov) and two stock exchanges (the MMFB [Moscow International Stock Exchange] of A. Zakharov and the MTsFB [Moscow Central Stock Exchange] of B. Pankin) made the list. The number of stockbrokers in the next list may be even smaller--K. Borovoy is now engaged in the sale of commercial projects in the "Molniya" NPO [scientific production association]. Aside from banks, exchanges, and production, trading, and diversified enterprises, the list also includes an insurance company (ASKO, G. Duvanov), a telecommunications firm (RELKOM, A. Soldatov), and an investment fund (A. Fetisov), as well as firms engaged in the art business (the Dyagilev-Tsentr of Yu. Lyubashevskiy), firms working in the financial markets (Brokinvestservis, I Safaryan), and real estate (S.I. Realty, A. Vulfov). Managers of the major auditing and advertising firms did not make the list, although several candidates were suggested for the experts' attention. The three "whales" of Russian business were represented by several persons--"Menatep" (M. Khodorkovskiy, L. Nevzlin, and V. Surkov), "Germes" (V. Neverov and G. Keselman), and the RTSB. They and the overwhelming majority of leading entrepreneurs are in business in Moscow. Other cities are represented by six individuals (N. Bekh of"KamAZ," V. Kadannikov of "AvtoVAZ," I. Nakhmanovich of "AvtoVAZbank," O. Kantor of the "Yugorskiy" Bank, I. Baskin of "Garant," and R. Kadyrov of the "Vostok" Bank, although persons who were not Muscovites made up roughly 20 percent of those in the initial list. Such a low evaluation of regional business is evidently objective and traditionally associated with the concentration of financial and production capacities in the capital. It may be noted that the overwhelming majority of leading businessmen, including leaders in the list, are not investing large sums in building up their own image. It is acquired by the large advertising campaigns mounted by firms headed by them. The published list indicates the current rating. An analysis of its dynamics will be no less interesting. Evidently, there will be fewer average changes in the businessmen's rating than the politicians' rating. They may be linked with the startup of important projects and major advertising campaigns.
