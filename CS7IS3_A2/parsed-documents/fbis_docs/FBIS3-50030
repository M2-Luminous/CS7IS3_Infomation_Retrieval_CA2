FBIS3-50030 "dreeu014__a94036" FBIS-EEU-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia SDL's Weiss Responds to Coalition Offer AU1701093994 Prague CTK in English 1912 GMT 15 Jan 94 AU1701093994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 15 (CTK) -- Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman Peter Weiss said in an interview for CTK today that he appreciated the expression of trust in him expressed by the party's Executive Committee last night in voting not to remove him from office. Weiss had offered to resign as chairman after inadvertently voting for the government's 1994 budget proposal, which he had strongly opposed from the beginning. The Executive Committee decided last night not to accept his resignation. "I especially appreciate that the SDL bodies are able to discuss democratically, openly, and without raising of voices "such personally and politically complex problems such as I caused with my mistaken vote," he said. Weiss said that the conditions under which the SDL would agree to participate in the broader coalition government called for by President Michal Kovac were defined by the limits of the party's program. "The decisive thing for us would be the kind of support such a government would be able to muster in parliament, and how it would be composed," he said. The development of the political situation hangs primarily on that part of the deputies group of the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) which rejects confrontational and uncooperative policies and recognizes its joint responsibility for the deepening of the political crisis. "We can't make that decision for them," Weiss said. Weiss avoided answering directly the question whether or not he would accept the present premier and HZDS leader, Vladimir Meciar, as head of the broad coalition government. He mentioned Meciar's statement on Friday [14 January] that he (Meciar) had made serious offers to SDL regarding the creation of a coalition, but said it was impossible to consider the offer seriously, given Meciar's controversial statements after his return from the United States in 1993, that "SDL participation in the government was unacceptable abroad." On the other hand, Meciar said another day that the SDL had missed a historical chance when it passed up creating a coalition with the HZDS, Weiss noted. "The HZDS idea that the SDL will provide experts to push for HZDS policies without any possibility of criticism is simply naive. A coalition does not mean that the HZDS will be exclusively in power, while the SDL would exclusively bear the responsibility," Weiss stressed. The SDL has not yet received any signals that the HZDS wants to correct its policy, he added. In 1994, the SDL wants to contribute to overcoming the domestic political crisis, which the creation of the HZDS-SNS coalition government had failed to do. "We must be prepared for a situation when the ratio of forces in the parliament changes to an extent which makes power sharing possible. We are a party not indifferent to the fate of our homeland, but interested in building a prosperous state. We are aware of our share of responsibility for Slovakia's direction," Weiss added.
