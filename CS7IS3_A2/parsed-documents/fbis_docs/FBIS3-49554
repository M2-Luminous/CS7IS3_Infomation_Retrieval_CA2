Peter Juhasz reports. [Juhasz] Today it was decided that Sandor Nagy, chairman of the MSZOSZ [National Federation of Hungarian Trade Unions], will run in the parliamentary elections under the colors of the Socialist Party. This was announced by Imre Szekeres, deputy chairman of the party, in Miskolc after the HSP county organization's session, adding that the regional list will be led by Sandor Nagy. [Begin Szekeres recording] I presume that behind this decision lies the fact that in the past three and a half years a political cooperation developed between the Hungarian Socialist Party and the trade union organization in which both organizations preserved their independence. We, the leaders of the HSP and the Borsod county organization, believe that this should also be signalled when putting forward candidates. We appointed to the head of the list of a very important county like this a well-known and popular person who represents people's interests not only in the trade union movement but also in social insurance, Dr. Sandor Nagy.
