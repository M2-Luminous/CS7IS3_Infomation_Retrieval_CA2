Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on April 14, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'' or ``Board'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Board is filing herewith a proposed rule change to establish a method by which the Board may, from time to time, prescribe and amend procedures relating to the administration of Board rules. II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. The text of the proposed rule change is as follows (additions are italicized): 1 1 The Commission notes that the reference to ``publication'' in proposed rule A&hyph;8(c) refers to publication in the MSRB Reports. Telephone conversation between Diane Klinke, MSRB, and Elizabeth MacGregor, Branch Chief, Commission, on June 30, 1994. Rule A&hyph;8. Rulemaking Procedures (a) (no change.) (b) (no change.) (c) Procedures. The Board may from time to time prescribe and amend procedures relating to the administration of Board rules. Such procedures and amendments may be approved by the Board pursuant to rule A&hyph;4(d). Each broker, dealer and municipal securities dealer shall be subject to such procedures and amendments thereto in the same manner as the broker, dealer and municipal securities dealer is subject to the rules of the Board. Procedures and amendments thereto shall become effective no earlier than 10 business days after publication of such procedures and amendments. (d ) Access to Board Rules and Other Action. (No change.) A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1. Purpose The Board believes that the proposed rule change would increase the efficiency of both the implementation and operation of Board rules involving the submission of information to the Board. The ``procedures'' contemplated by the proposed rule change would concern only matters of a technical nature. The proposed rule change further provides that any procedures, or amendment thereto, may be approved by the Board without the necessity of a formal Board meeting, pursuant to existing rule A&hyph;4(d). Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides a mechanism by which action, ``other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendment to rules of the Board,'' may be taken by written consent of the Board or by telephone poll of all Board members. 2 Of course, the Board will continue to file any matters with the Commission, as required, pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act, and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 3 2 Rule A&hyph;4(d) provides that: Action by the Board, other than action on proposed rules or proposed amendments to rules of the Board, may be taken without a meeting by written consent of the Board setting forth the action so taken or by telephone poll of all members of the Board, provided that, in the case of action taken by telephone, the Board, at a meeting, or the Chairman of the Board authorizes the action to be taken by such means. The Executive Director shall transmit to each Board member, as soon as practicable after a telephone poll is taken, a written statement setting forth the questions or questions with respect to which the telephone poll was taken and the results of the telephone poll. Such statements shall also be entered in the minutes of the next Board meeting. In the case of action taken without a meeting by written consent or telephone poll, an affirmative vote of a majority of the whole Board is required. 3 The Commission notes that the present proposal is intended to expedite Board consideration of matters that are technical in nature, and is not intended to affect the types of proposals that the Board files with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act and Rule 19(b)(4) thereunder. Telephone conversation, supra note 1. On April 7, 1994, the Commission approved Board rule G&hyph;37, concerning political contributions and prohibitions on municipal securities business. 4 This rule, among other things, requires dealers to submit certain information ``to the Board on Form G&hyph;37, in accordance with Board rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures, quarterly with due dates determined by the Board. *␣*␣*'' 5 In its filing with the Commission, the Board noted that it ``is in the process of developing appropriate rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures to allow for public access to the information to be submitted on Form G&hyph;37, as well as indexing, record storage, etc. *␣*␣*'' 6 In the present filing, the Board discussed these rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures as an example of the types of procedures to which the instant proposed rule change would apply. The Board will submit to the Commission another proposed rule change relating to rule G&hyph;37 filing procedures. 7 4 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33868 (April 7, 1994), 59 FR 17621 (April 13, 1994). 5 Rule G&hyph;37(e)(ii). 6 File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;2, at page 16. 7 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34027 (May 9, 1994), 59 FR 25136 (notice of filing and order granting accelerated approval of File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;04). In addition, in order to assist dealer compliance with the filing requirements of rule G&hyph;37, the Board intends to develop an informal ``Procedures Manual'' for the relevant forms and procedures, and periodically to update or to amend the manual. The manual also would include forms and other filing information regarding rule G&hyph;36 on delivery of official statements and advance refunding documents to the Board. In the future, the Board also may adopt procedures regarding technical matters relating to the Board's Continuing Disclosure Information system, as well as any transaction reporting system the Board may develop. 2.
