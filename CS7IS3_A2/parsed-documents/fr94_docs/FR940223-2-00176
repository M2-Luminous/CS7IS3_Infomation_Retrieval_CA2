ACTION: Rules of Procedure for NAFTA Article 1904 Extraordinary Challenge Committees. SUMMARY: Canada, Mexico, and the United States have negotiated the rules of procedure for Article 1904 extraordinary challenge committee proceedings. These rules apply to extraordinary challenges conducted pursuant to Article 1904 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 1, 1994, the date of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement''). These Rules of Procedure shall apply to all extraordinary challenge committee proceedings under the Agreement commenced on or after the effective date. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lisa B. Koteen, Senior Attorney, Stacy J. Ettinger, Attorney-Advisor, or Terrence J. McCartin, Attorney-Advisor, Office of the Chief Counsel for Import Administration, room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;0836, (202) 482&hyph;4618, or (202) 482&hyph;5031, respectively. For procedural matters involving extraordinary challenge committee proceedings, contact James R. Holbein, United States Secretary, NAFTA Secretariat, room 2061, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;5438; fax: (202) 482&hyph;0148. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico, or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing country. In instances in which one of the Parties to the Agreement alleges, pursuant to Article 1904.13 of the Agreement, that (a)(i) a member of a panel materially violated the rules of conduct, (ii) the panel seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, or (iii) the panel manifestly exceeded its powers, authority or jurisdiction, and that (b) any of the actions set out in (a) has materially affected the panel's decision and threatens the integrity of the binational panel review process, that Party may request formation of an extraordinary challenge committee (``ECC''). Extraordinary challenge committee review is therefore not a routine appeal. Rather, as the name suggests, Canada, Mexico, or the United States may have recourse to an ECC only in extraordinary cases. Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103&hyph;182, 107 Stat. 2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement. The NAFTA Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules are intended to give effect to the ECC provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures for commencing, conducting, and completing extraordinary challenge proceedings. These rules are the result of negotiations among Canada, Mexico, and the United States in compliance with the terms of the Agreement, and are derived in large part from the Extraordinary Challenge Committee Rules under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
