The inspections on which an agreement was reached at this time are not regular and irregular inspections [chonggimit pichonggi sachal] under the safeguards accord, but inspections corresponding to our special status since we had temporarily suspended the effectuation of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. And, their basic mission is to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since the previous inspections.

This also complies with the spirit of the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact inic mission is to ensure the continuity of safeguards by confirming that the nuclear materials have not been used for other purposes since the previous inspections. This also complies with the spirit of the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York last 29 December. At the contact, the DPRK and the United States agreed that, as imminent measures to resolve the nuclear issue in a package deal, we would accept inspections necessary to ensure the continuity of safeguards and affirmatively examine working-level contact for the exchange of special envoys if the South Korean side so proposes, that the United States would declare the discontinuation of the Team Spirit joint military exercise for 1994, and that the DPRK and the United States would jointly announce the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. What had been stressed, in particular, in the agreement was that the inspections we would receive from the IAEA must be thoroughly [choltu cholmi] restricted to [kukhan] inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. However, no agreement had been reached on the scope of the inspections because the IAEA Secretariat, completely ignoring the DPRK-U.S. agreement, had pressured us to receive complete [wanjonhan] regular and irregular inspections and because the United States, in a breach of faith [sinuirul choborigo], had unjustly defended the agency's Secretariat. This had made us no longer entertain expectations from the DPRK- U.S. talks and express our official position that we had no alternative than to make a necessary choice. Then, the United States and the IAEA withdrew [cholhoe] their previous request for regular and irregular inspections on their own and stated that they would conduct inspections solely for ensuring the continuity of safeguards, and, as a result, the final decision on the scope of inspection could be made this time. We welcome the fact that the United States and the IAEA Secretariat assumed an attitude conforming to the resolution of the issue and consented to the final decision on the scope of inspections for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. What remains at present is to see what attitude the United States will assume on the practical stage of implementing the agreement between us and the agency. When agreements on future simultaneous actions are reached, as promised between the DPRK and the United States, a phase will be opened for the IAEA's early inspections to guarantee the continuity of safeguards and for the holding of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks to achieve a package solution to the nuclear problem. At a time when the world is welcoming the recent agreement, only the U.S. rightist conservative forces and the Japanese and South Korean authorities are loudly saying that regular and irregular inspections must completely be conducted because the inspection scope agreed upon between the IAEA and us is not enough to verify the transparency of our nuclear activities [haek hwaltong], and are openly insisting on conducting even special inspections. This is no ordinary matter. They are insisting this not because they are unaware of the reality of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This is regarded as nothing but a deliberate scheme [uidojogin chakkan] to prevent the resolution of the nuclear issue and to drive the situation to an extreme. As the special inspection issue is one of the primary reasons for the announcement of our withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the continuous insistence on the special inspection is the same as an act aimed at pushing us completely out of the treaty. The matter of regular and irregular inspections is an issue to be discussed within the scope of the method for a package solution to the nuclear problem when the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks are held, and it cannot be solved by loudly talking about it at present. The United States must prevent the positive [kungjongjok] development of the situation from reversing itself by fulfilling its responsibilities and duties at this decisive moment [kyolchongjogin taemoge waso], which has come after a lot of trouble, and should contribute to the ultimate solution to the nuclear problem. If the United States puts the brakes on the resolution of the nuclear issue again by setting unjustifiable conditions for agreeing on the simultaneous actions or sticking to applying pressure, the agreements reached between the IAEA and us cannot be implemented, nor another opportunity like the current one will come again. We have invariably taken an independent policy [chaju chongchaek], and we all together will cope with any situation. We will continue to carefully watch the development of the situation.
