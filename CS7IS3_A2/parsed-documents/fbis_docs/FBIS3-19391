The German move also comes amid controversy over whether Chancellor Helmut Kohl should have been invited to D-Day celebrations in France marking the 50th anniversary of the wartime Allied landing. Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts gave no reason for the summons, but the order for it was reported to have come directly from Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, said to have been extremely irritated by ambassador Francois Scheer's remarks. The office of Chancellor Helmut Kohl also indicated that the French ambassador's remarks were considered out of order and demanded an explanation. [passage omitted] Sources close to the French ambassador told AFP after the meeting that he felt his remarks had been reported selectively, but that he maintained that relations between the two governments needed to be improved. Scheer was said to want to remind the united Germany that it was anchored to West Europe. Bonn is suspected of wanting to push for expansion of the European Union toward East Europe. In his original remarks, Scheer reportedly also expressed the view that not so much France but other, smaller countries of the European Union distrusted the German attitude in Europe, and that D-Day was just one issue. Both German and French diplomatic sources said the present row would be dealt with further at ministerial level later Thursday. [passage omitted]
