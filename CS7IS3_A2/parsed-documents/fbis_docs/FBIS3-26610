Comrade Chen Yun happily received the Shanghai comrades and had cordial conversations with them. Wu Bangguo reported to Comrade Chen Yun on the work Shanghai did last year in launching reforms, opening up to the outside world, developing the economy, and maintaining social stability, as well as what Shanghai plans to do this year. Comrade Chen Yun was very satisfied with the report. He said: Shanghai has done a good job, not just good, but very good. Comrade Chen Yun said: Since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the nation's economy has developed very quickly and the people's living standards have improved greatly. This is a fact everybody can see. Of course, there are still many difficulties and problems. To solve these difficulties and problems, it is necessary to first safeguard and strengthen the authority of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Without the authority of the party Central Committee, there will be no major accomplishments, and social stability cannot be maintained. Comrade Chen Yun said: The party Central Committee has decided to implement the revenue-sharing system this year so that central authorities can gradually pool together the necessary financial resources. Shanghai and other localities have agreed to this. This shows that you have taken the interests of all into consideration. I am very pleased about this. Comrade Chen Yun said: The situation of the entire country shows that in current economic work, we should pay particular attention to one issue, namely the size of our construction projects must be compatible with the national strength. In addition, there should be some leeway to maneuver. Meanwhile, we should focus our attention on achieving higher economic efficiency. Comrade Chen Yun stressed: The current central leading body is a strong and capable one, and has done a good job. People throughout the country must work with one heart and one mind, unite as one, and fully implement the series of policies and measures adopted by the party Central Committee and the State Council for carrying out macroeconomic regulation and control. There is great hope for China to boost its economic development, and a bright future for socialist China.
