Tzou and Debbie Kuo] [Text] Marrakech, Morocco, April 13 (CNA) -- Economics ministers of the Republic of China [ROC] and Australia Tuesday [12 April] agreed to strengthen bilateral trade ties during informal tariff reduction talks here. ROC Economic Affairs Minister P.K. Chiang urged Australia to support Taiwan in its bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as trade, investment and tourism relations between Taiwan and Australia have been growing rapidly. Some 4.8 million Taiwan tourists have visited Australia, spending more than than US$8 billion while there, Chiang said. In addition, Taiwan-Australia trade has been growing at a rapid rate, Chiang said. Chiang's Australian counterpart, Bob McMullan, agreed that Taiwan is one of Australia's most important trading partners in the Asia-Pacific and he believes that Taiwan should be a member of the World Trade Organization, which will supersede GATT before the end of this year. McMullan added that he hopes Taiwan will gradually reduce import tariffs -- especially those on fruit, automobiles, and beef -- to meet the regulations set out in the GATT Uruguay Round accord. McMullan and Chiang are in Morocco for a GATT ministers meeting which opened Tuesday.
