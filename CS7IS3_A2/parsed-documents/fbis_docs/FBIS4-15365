The Russian Representative Assembly and the Russian Community are of the opinion that the application of the aliens law, which met with an otherwise "positive response," by the executive branch of power is a "juridical trap" which deprives most of the non-citizens of a number of their rights. The statement notes that at present only temporary residence and work permits for a one-year term are issued to persons who lived in Estonia before July 1990. The permits don't grant them social and economic rights promised upon adoption of the aliens law, the statement claims. In the opinion of the Russian organizations, the problem can be solved only legislatively. The Russian Representative Assembly and the Russian Community have made their proposals for this to the government through the minorities' round-table conference. The proposals include defining legally the status of persons who were born on the Estonian territory or arrived in the country before July 1, 1990, and were registered as Estonian residents by the authorities of the Estonian SSR; introducing a guarantee in the aliens law that permanent residents of Estonia will be issued permanent residence permits; and defining the exact meaning of "permanent residence and work permit," "temporary residence and work permit," "cadre personnel of foreign armed forces," and "sufficient legal income" in the aliens law. Both Russian organizations announce that, until such decisions have been passed, they cannot advise non-citizens to apply for residence and work permits.
