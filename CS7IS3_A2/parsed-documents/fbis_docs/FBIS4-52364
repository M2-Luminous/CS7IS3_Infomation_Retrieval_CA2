In a report submitted by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) to the DILG, it was noted that the multi-million project enrolled by DPWH under the Kabuhayan [Livelihood] 2000 program of President Ramos is designed to increase agricultural productivity in the region. Among those provinces which will benefit from the project are Abra, Kalinga-Apayao, Benguet, Ifugao and Mt. Province. Engineer Jose C. Guanzon, DPWH project manager, said the improvement of roads and water supply construction projects using labor-based/equipment-supported (LB/ES) methods will accelerate development in CAR areas specifically, in terms of generating more employment among the people here. In Abra, the Pigidian-Abra-Ilocos Sur road is being concreted while water supply structure will be constructed in Villaviciosa, Laplapog, and in Lagayan, Pang-ot and in other selected municipalities in Benguet. Improvement of drainage and road concreting will also be undertaken in Bokod, Benguet-Viscaya road, and in Mankayan, Abatan, and Mankayan-Cervantes in Benguet. Meanwhile, the DPWH has also identified municipalities in Kalinga-Apayao, Ifugao and Mt. Province that will be included in its infrastructure program under Kabuhayan 2000. DILG heads the steering committee of Kabuhayan 2000, a program of the government which aims to generate more job employment and opportunities in the countryside within three years.
