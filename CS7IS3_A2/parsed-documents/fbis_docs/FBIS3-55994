NATO Is Not Approaching Russia's Borders at the Moment"] [Text] The North Atlantic alliance summit has ended in Brussels. The main subjects discussed were questions of security in Europe and worldwide, which in practical terms took the form of the problem of expanding the alliance by including East European countries and certain former republics of the Soviet Union. On a U.S. initiative the NATO leadership adopted the "Partnership for Peace" program, within which framework Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia are invited to collaborate with the North Atlantic alliance in creating a collective security system, but not as full members. The question of nuclear weapons on Ukraine's territory was discussed equally intensively. According to news agency reports, U.S. President Bill Clinton called the approval of the "Partnership for Peace" plan and the fact that it proved possible to persuade Ukraine to adopt a treaty stipulating that Kiev should give up nuclear weapons "two gigantic steps in the direction of universal security." It was not easy for Bill Clinton to press for precisely those results in the summit. As we know, proceeding on the basis that "the Western defensive alliance is faced with the historic task of extending the existing security system to East Europe," NATO Secretary General M. Woerner expressed the opinion that NATO should open its doors to all the former Warsaw Pact countries "since they are culturally and historically closely linked with the West and should restore these ties with it." But Russia, as we know, objected to this pretty resolutely, and on the eve of the meeting, Russian Federation Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev proposed that NATO and Russia should jointly guarantee European security. The U.S. president managed to incline his partners to accommodate Moscow's wishes, although he had to take a fair amount of criticism for adopting this stance. Covering the results of the summit, the Western press was full of reproaches against him on the premise that, although Russia continues to be a great power despite its present economic weakness, the West should not adapt ad infinitum to its interests alone in security questions. The question of the talks with Ukraine proceeded equally dramatically. The Ukrainian president, unable to withstand the combined pressure of the U.S. and Russian presidents, agreed to sign a document on 14 January in Moscow on the complete transfer to Russia of the nuclear weapons located on Ukraine's territory. Beyond the shadow of a doubt, Leonid Kravchuk has decided to ignore the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet decision dated 18 November which de facto enshrined Ukraine's status as a nuclear power. In all likelihood, on his return home from doing his Moscow penance, he will come up against big problems in his relationship with the parliament. But those are ultimately Leonid Kravchuk's own problems. The main event is happening elsewhere. The U.S. President is arriving for a meeting with Boris Yeltsin today with big achievements in his foreign political activity, which will doubtless be very highly assessed in Moscow. In a word, the first meeting between the Russian and U.S. presidents promises to be very productive.
