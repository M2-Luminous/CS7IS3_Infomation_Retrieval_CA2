FR940428-0-00011 FR940428-0-00004 A. Rule 7(a): Companies Deemed Not To Be Electric or Gas Utility Companies Under rule 7(a), a company is deemed not to be an electric utility company or a gas utility company, within the meaning of sections 2(a)(3) and 2(a)(4) of the Act, respectively, if the company is primarily engaged in one or more nonutility businesses, and the company's gross sales of electricity, or of natural or manufactured gas distributed at retail, do not exceed a specified amount. 5 At present, the rule permits such companies to make annual utility sales of up to $100,000. The proposed amendment would allow average annual sales of up to $5 million. 6 5 17 CFR 250.7(a). 6 The rule employs a three-year test period. Use of a three-year average should eliminate the need for an application when sales in a given year unexpectedly exceed the dollar limitation. Columbia, CNG and Heritage support adoption of the amendment. Northeast suggests that the amendment, as it relates to sales of electricity, is unnecessary in view of the broad exemptions already provided under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (``PURPA'') [16 U.S.C. ยง824a-3(e)], 7 and the Energy Policy Act of 1992. 8 The exemption under rule 7(a), however, is not related to the exemptions under PURPA and the Energy Policy Act. The rule is intended to accommodate a small amount of energy sales by a company that is otherwise engaged in a nonutility business. In comparison, the exemptions under PURPA and the Energy Policy Act are intended to encourage the growth of a competitive energy market. The proposed amendment does not conflict with these statutes or the legislative policies that underlie them. 7 Pursuant to section 210 of PURPA, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has adopted rules generally exempting cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities from treatment as public-utility companies for purposes of the Act. See 18 CFR 292.602(b). 8 Pub. L. No. 102&hyph;486, 106 Stat. 2776. The Energy Policy Act amended the Act to create two new classes of exempt entities, exempt wholesale generators and foreign utility companies. See sections 32 and 33 of the Act, as amended. Columbia and Heritage ask the Commission to adopt a different test of revenues. Columbia suggests that the exemption should apply to a company with gas utility revenues no greater than 5% of its nonutility revenues. 9 Under the Heritage proposal, a company that is not a state-regulated utility could receive up to 20% of its gross revenues from the sale of manufactured gas at retail. The Commission is concerned that these approaches could vitiate the rationale for the exemption, which is the small absolute size of the utility operations, not the relative size of utility and nonutility operations, and so declines to adopt them. 9 Columbia cites the example of a company that is primarily engaged in the business of distribution of natural or manufactured gas in enclosed portable containers, but derives revenues of more than $5 million from the distribution of natural gas to a central storage tank and through underground pipeline systems. Such an arrangement may be found in real estate developments and small towns. Section 2(c) exempts municipalities from the scope of the Act. In addition, a company such as that described by Columbia can apply for an order declaring it not to be a public-utility company for purposes of the Act. See, e.g., AmeriGas Propane, Holding Co. Act Release No. 25434, 50 SEC Docket 918 (Dec. 20, 1991) (propane company declared not to be a public-utility company where underground pipeline sales were less than 5% of total revenues). The Commission believes that the increase in the dollar limit to $5 million is appropriate in view of the changes in the industry since rule 7(a) was adopted in 1941. 10 A company with annual utility revenues that exceed $5 million may request an order, upon application, declaring it not to be a utility company for purposes of the Act. 11 10 Holding Co. Act Release No. 2694 (Apr. 17, 1941) (adopting release). 11 See sections 2(a)(3) and 2(a)(4) of the Act. See, e.g., Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership, Holding Co. Act Release No. 25846, 54 SEC Docket 1389 (July 7, 1993) (distributor of propane in enclosed portable containers with distribution sales of approximately $16 million); AmeriGas Propane, Holding Co. Act Release No. 25434, 50 SEC Docket 918 (Dec. 20, 1991) (distributor of propane in enclosed portable containers with distribution sales of approximately $16 million); Cal Gas Corp., Holding Co. Act Release No. 24407, 38 SEC Docket 999 (June 10, 1987) (liquefied petroleum gas marketing company with distribution sales of approximately $11 million); Enron Corp., Holding Co. Act Release No. 24428, 38 SEC Docket 1535 (July 23, 1987) (gas transportation company with distribution sales of approximately $5 million); LTV Steel Mining Co., Holding Co. Act Release No. 25360, 49 SEC Docket 936 (Aug. 12, 1991) (iron ore mining company with electricity sales of approximately $2.2 million).
