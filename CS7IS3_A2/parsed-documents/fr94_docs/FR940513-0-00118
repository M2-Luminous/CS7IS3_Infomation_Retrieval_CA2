FR940513-0-00118 FR940513-0-00031 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Railroad Administration 49 CFR Part 229 [FRA Docket No. RSGC&hyph;2, Notice No. 6] RIN 2130&hyph;AA80 Locomotive Conspicuity; Minimum Standards for Auxiliary External Lights AGENCY: Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), DOT. ACTION: Interim rule with request for comments. SUMMARY: This interim rule (referred to as ``IR&hyph;2'') amends FRA's interim rule (referred to as ``IR&hyph;1'') published on February 3, 1993, by relaxing the standards IR&hyph;1 contained concerning auxiliary external lights on locomotives. IR&hyph;2 contains detailed and specific performance standards regarding color, intensity, operation, mounting location and flash rate for ditch lights, crossing lights, strobe lights and oscillating lights. This action is intended to increase the visibility of locomotives to motorists and thereby reduce the incidence of accidental collisions between motor vehicles and locomotives at highway-rail grade crossings. DATES: This interim rule is effective May 13, 1994; written comments must be received on or before July 12, 1994. Comments received after that date will be considered so far as possible without incurring additional expense or delay. ADDRESSES: Written Comments: Written comments and petitions for reconsideration should identify the docket number and the notice number and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Public hearing: Given the limited scope of this interim rule and the statutory exception under 45 U.S.C. 431(u)(2) from public proceedings, FRA does not believe that a public hearing is warranted at this time. However, FRA will consider any request for an opportunity to make an oral presentation that is filed by the deadline for written comments. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gordon Davids, Bridge Engineer, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;9186); Edward R. English, Director, Office of Safety Enforcement, Office of Safety, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;9252); or Marina C. Appleton, Trial Attorney, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (telephone: 202&hyph;366&hyph;0628). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On February 3, 1993, FRA published an interim rule (IR&hyph;1) (58 FR 6899, to be codified at 49 CFR 229.133), with request for comments, concerning measures to enhance the conspicuity of locomotives. IR&hyph;1 implemented requirements mandated by section 14 of the Amtrak Authorization and Development Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;533). This enabling legislation added new subsection (u) to section 202 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (Safety Act) (45 U.S.C. 431), which reads as follows: (u) Locomotive Conspicuity. (1) The Secretary shall conduct a review of the Department of Transportation's rules with respect to locomotive conspicuity and shall complete the Department's current locomotive conspicuity research no later than December 31, 1993. As part of this review, the Secretary shall collect relevant data from operational experience by railroads having enhanced conspicuity measures in service. (2) Not later than December 31, 1992, the Secretary shall issue interim regulations identifying ditch lights, crossing lights, strobe lights, and oscillating lights as interim locomotive conspicuity measures, and authorizing and encouraging installation and use of such measures. The interim regulations and any amendments thereto shall be adopted without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 of Title 5. Any locomotive equipped with such interim conspicuity measures on the date of issuance of final regulations under paragraph (3) shall be considered in full compliance with such final regulations until 4 years after issuance of such final regulations. (3) Not later than June 30, 1994, the Secretary shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding to issue final regulations requiring substantially enhanced locomotive conspicuity measures. In such rulemaking proceeding, the Secretary shall consider, at a minimum_ (A) Revisions to the existing locomotive headlight standard, including standards for placement and intensity; (B) Requiring use of reflective materials to enhance locomotive conspicuity; (C) Requiring use of additional alerting lights (including ditch, crossing, strobe, and oscillating lights); (D) Requiring use of auxiliary lights to enhance locomotive conspicuity when viewed from the side; (E) The effect of any enhanced conspicuity measures on the vision, health, and safety of train crew members;
