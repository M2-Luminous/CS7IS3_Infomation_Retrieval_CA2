Osiris got Fernando Henrique Cardoso to sign, on his final day as finance minister (Wednesday of Holy Week), the proposal to modernize the Federal Revenue Secretariat. A career civil servant, professor of tax law, and very familiar as few others are with the machinery by which taxes are collected, Osiris thinks the time has come to improve working conditions at a government agency that has proven its efficiency. That is why he conceived the idea of setting up a treasury intelligence service to uncover the more sophisticated kinds of tax crimes that cannot be reached by traditional audits. The proposal gives the revenue service a more dynamic operating structure and enables it to hire additional inspectors. A happy Osiris told the people at Revenue about the minister's signature and awaited publication in the OFFICIAL GAZETTE. He waited a week. He sent some of his staffers to make inquiries at the Ministry of Finance, to find out what happened. He learned then that the proposal had gotten stalled in the hands of the executive secretary, Clovis Carvalho. So Osiris phoned Clovis. The conversation began cordially but ended disastrously. Clovis confirmed that he was holding up the proposal because the text contained some details he did not agree with. A few words, he said, had to be changed. The situation was intriguing, to say the least. An executive secretary of a ministry holds up a document signed by his superior and virtually revokes it at the instant when the transition from one minister to another allows a decision-making vacuum to occur in the public administration. Extremely protective of his prerogatives and political clout, since in a span of few months he had emerged from the anonymity of the rank and file of the civil service to become a candidate for minister, Osiris, the real name of the "lion" of the Revenue Secretariat, told Clovis Carvalho on the phone that he would tell his staff and the press who was holding up the proposal to modernize the revenue service. Clovis reacted by saying that Osiris was blackmailing him. Osiris argued that he would simply be speaking the truth, as confirmed by Clovis himself. When Clovis said for the second time that he was being blackmailed, Osiris went into a rage and abruptly told him, in stentorian tones, where to go. Then he hung up. Osiris then warned his staff that if the proposal Clovis was holding up were not released, he would resign from the Revenue Secretariat. He did not convey this threat to either the minister of finance nor Planalto Palace, from which he had departed to take the helm of the tax-collecting machine. Minister Ricupero went into action, but the issue is still unresolved, almost three weeks later. Osiris is feeling resentful. Clovis has the proposal. One considers himself strong enough to take on any fight. The other has carried to an extreme the principal trait for which he is known within the economic team: that of being a tough guy, the man assigned to say "no" to anyone, no matter who, when necessary. This time, Clovis said "no" to Osiris but also to the previous minister, who had put him in the job and worked to keep him there under Ricupero. If he wants to fight with Osiris, Clovis, who is very close to the rest of the economic team, should not be all alone.
