Parallel to the decision to deliver 39 former warships from the NVA [National People's Army of the former GDR] to the highly indebted island-state, the Federal Security Council has also approved the export of a 209 class submarine. Bonn has also given the green light for the options for the construction of two further submarines. The article is based on Bonn's response to a question from SPD [Social Democratic Party] Bundestag deputies on arms deals with Indonesia, the paper writes (Friday edition). The submarines, each of which costs 665.1 million German marks, are covered by the Hermes government export credit guarantee. At the same time, the Federal Government has admitted that, contrary to previous statements, it has only partially demilitarized the former NVA ships or has supplied them as complete weapons systems to the Indonesian Navy, it is further reported. Sixteen ``Parchim'' ships have thus been handed over to the Indonesian Navy in a fully-equipped state. The delivery of the 39 NVA ships has also been guaranteed to the tune of 689.9 million German marks.
