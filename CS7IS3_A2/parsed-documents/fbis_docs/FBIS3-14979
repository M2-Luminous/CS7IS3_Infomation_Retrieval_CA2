"We are talking not about assistance for Ukraine but about the beginning of normal economic relations between the two states," Anton Buteyko said. He declined to name specific figures concerning U.S. financial participation in Ukrainian economic reforms but stressed that during the visit to the United States of the government delegation headed by Roman Shpek, this figure was adjusted three times. Anton Buteyko stated that relations between the United States and Ukraine became considerably warmer following the Ukrainian Supreme Council's definitive ratification of START I. He also did not exclude the possibility that ratification certificates with regard to this treaty will be exchanged during Leonid Kravchuk's visit to the United States. "Our government delegation left 24 specific projects with the Americans for them to consider possible investment in the Ukrainian economy. Above all these are investments in nuclear energy and conversion of the military industrial complex. Consultations are continuing with regard to the Ukrainian-U.S. charter on cooperation. Anton Buteyko told journalists that if all the formulations are finally agreed upon, it will be signed by the presidents of Ukraine and United States during Leonid Kravchuk's visit.
