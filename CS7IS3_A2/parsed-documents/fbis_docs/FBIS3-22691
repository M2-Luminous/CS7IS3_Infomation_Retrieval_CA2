Today, after a great many information campaigns, newspaper articles, and TV and radio programs, hardly anyone has escaped hearing about the HIV virus and the immune deficiency disease, AIDS. A new HIV-infected person is found in Sweden every day and the number of infected people is approaching 4,000. The likelihood that someone at a place of work may be infected is increasing all the time. In the beginning, business executives were at a loss when one of their employees turned out to be HIV-positive. Today things are different and more and more businesses are now drawing up action programs for these problems. One of the first businesses to produce an HIV policy was Volvo. Everyone Informed "We made a move very early. Back at the beginning of the 1980's Leif Wallin, who was the corporation physician at that time, advocated spreading information about HIV and AIDS," said Lennart Dimberg, company physician at Volvo Airplane Engines in Tollhattan and former corporation physician. Volvo issued easily understandable written information to all its employees. With the help of comic strips everyone was informed about what HIV and AIDS are, how the infection is spread and how it is not. It is at least as important to tell people about the latter as it is to describe the actual methods of infection. The Volvo corporation has decided that HIV should not be a reason to refuse to allow people to work for Volvo. "I have taken part in hiring HIV-positive people," Dimberg went on. However the company advises employees not to tell fellow workers and job supervisors that they have HIV. "They tell us in the company health care system, that is enough," said Dimberg. "People don't tell everybody if they have hepatitis, syphilis, or any other disease, so why talk about HIV?" There is a risk that complications will arise and rumors will spread and that the infected person will not get any of the support and security from the job group that he or she needs. "Anxiety is the big problem, not infection," Dimberg said. SCA [Swedish Cellulose Company] is another company that has a policy on this problem. It was produced after company executives received an inquiry from their employees abroad in the mid-1980's about what preparations they had for HIV/AIDS. "We had none at all, so we appointed a working group that included union people, corporate executives and members of the safety committee and assigned them the task of coming up with a policy," said Rolf Gatugard, chief safety adviser at SCA Ortviken, Inc. Test Not Required SCA does not require that employees be tested for HIV, whether this involves new job applicants or existing personnel. However the company does recommend that all employees who work abroad be tested both before and after their trip. "The group discussed whether or not an infected person should tell his or her fellow workers. We reached the conclusion that it should be a matter between the doctor and the infected person," Gatugard said. "If someone tells, there is a big risk that it will create a lot of anxiety among fellow workers and they may reject the infected person instead of providing support." SAS [Scandinavian Airlines] has no formal HIV policy. However the corporation has produced some internal guidelines that the company health care system follows. We were told this by Anders Huss, one of the company physicians at SAS. SAS employees are not tested, whether they are new employees or existing personnel. With one exception: pilot training applicants must be tested for HIV. It is an important goal not to give people with HIV infection special treatment. "I do not feel that it is of any importance from the company's point of view that an employee is a symptom-free carrier of the HIV virus." There is no reason to dismiss or reassign anyone because he or she represents a risk of infection to others, Huss said. "On the other hand there may be good reason to consider reassignment to protect infection-prone HIV-positive workers who have a lot of contact with customers in their work and are thus exposed to a risk of infection themselves. The goal is to move them to a less exposed job." SAS applies the same principles to HIV as it does to any other disease when it comes to reassignment and sick leave on a full-time or part-time basis. The deciding factor is the person's ability to work in relation to the job requirements. There is no single answer to the question of whether infected people should tell their fellow workers or not, Huss feels. They must decide this for themselves. "Personally I usually advise those who are unsure not to tell. The people around them may be frightened and the result can be that the HIV-infected person is rejected by the group instead of receiving support." Huss thinks that the "hysteria" surrounding HIV has largely disappeared. Like SCA, SAS recommends that its employees be tested before and after working abroad. In addition the company has placed "emergency kits" containing intravenous drip units, needles, and syringes in all the places around the world where SAS personnel are stationed.
