A. Konradov, N. V. Lyubimova, and I. I. Pelevina, Institute of Chemical Physics imeni N. N. Semenov, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, under the rubric ``Investigation of the Sequelae of the Chernobyl Disaster''; UDC [577.2+576]:539.1.04] [Abstract]Changes in radiosensitivity were studied in experiments onvarious lines of mice: (CBAxC57BL6)F[.sub]1[/], (DBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] and DBA2, kept in metal cages (wire mesh, sheltered from rain and direct UV light) in the village of Yanovo, on the border of the "brown forest" in the zone of the Chernobyl disaster. Feed and water were brought in from Chernobyl, with a control group of intact mice in clean zones. Exposure time ranged from 1 to 14 days, and dose rate was 100 mR/h, after which experimental and control animals were taken to Moscow and exposed to acute radiation in doses of 3.0, 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 Gy, at a dose rate of 2.32 Gy/min,after 2, 7 and 30 days. Effects were evaluated using the _k_[.sup]2[/]statistical criterion of reliability. Figures illustrate comparative survival rates of control and experimental animals as a function of time after acute irradiation. Radiosensitivity to subsequent acute exposure was modified in animals exposed to radiation in the disaster zone, the direction and intensity of this effect were a function of interval between exposure in this zone and acute irradiation. It is suggested that there are additional factors in the disaster zone that are involved in altering animal sensitivity to subsequent exposure to radiation. Figures 10, tables 1.
