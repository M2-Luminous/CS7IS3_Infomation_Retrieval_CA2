Nur Nigmatulin went on to say that before this happened more power stations would have to be built in order to make up the deficit. He said that Ukraine would have to commission a total of six VVER reactors at the Khmelnitsky, Rovno and Zaporozhye nuclear stations. This would require a total of $1.02 billion. On 21 April the third reactor at Chernobyl was brought on line again after the 18 April incident which registered one on the international scale. On 18 April, the safety system at the third reactor was activated while power was being increased after routine repairs. This occurred after the water level in the cooling system fell.
