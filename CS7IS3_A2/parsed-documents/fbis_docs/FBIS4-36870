In addition, he needed another $30 million per month for salaries and to cover other routine expenses. This sum is greater than the amount officials have been attempting to collect, and 'Arafat said that his arrival in Jericho was tied to receiving the aforementioned funds. Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari reports: Notables in the territories are pressuring 'Arafat to hasten his arrival after they received hints that the PLO leader may postpone his arrival until next month. Following 'Arafat's talks with Morocco's King Hassan II, the Moroccans also received the impression that the PLO leader may decide to take his time. [passage omitted] One of the reasons for the concern in the territories over any delay is the discernible trend toward the undeclared establishment of a quasi-military regime in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. 'Arafat considered declaring a state of emergency upon his arrival but was apparently persuaded to relent. Nevertheless, prominent officials in the territories fear a concentration of power, including the handling of civilian issues, in the hands of Palestinian army officers. There is no shortage of examples: a major was appointed head of the education bureau; a lieutenant colonel was placed in charge of the mayor of Jericho; the commander of the Gaza Strip ordered mayor-designate Mansur al-Shawwa to appoint technocrats to the municipal council while ignoring political and coalitional considerations. There was a large police presence at the matriculation exams. Anyone stealing electricity can find himself facing a military decree. So can squatters on state land, corrupt land registration clerks, and owners of heavy machinery. The notables fear that the officer cadres will seize all the real political power and many Palestinians are protesting this, both within the Fatah organization, which has begun distributing membership cards to its activists in several locations, and also among the candidates for positions in the Palestinian Authority, which 'Arafat this evening called the government. So far, there are only 18 such candidates after Hanan 'Ashrawi and Sari Nusaybah eschewed their appointments. On 'Arafat's instructions, the officers are doing their best to allay any concern and are personally participating in rallies in support of democracy and elections. They also promise to double the number of government employees to 40,000. There are complaints that the army is commandeering every vacant building, and even appointed ministers of the Palestinian Authority cannot find room for their offices. As far as Israel is concerned, cooperation on security affairs is satisfactory. There has been a drop in the number of terrorist attacks although there have been delays in implementing the new arrangements on the Allenby Bridge and at the checkpoints from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. The Palestinian army has also adopted a reasonably tough line against Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], which mocked it in public, claiming that its soldiers were scavenging for food instead of carrying out their duties. However, no weapons have been confiscated so far nor has the dissemination of propaganda in the mosques been prohibited. That is why despite the requests by Israeli officials, many Palestinian policemen are still walking around with loaded rifles, although they have yet to test their prowess.
