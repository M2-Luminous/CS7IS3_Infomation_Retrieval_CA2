The report was based on the group's recent visit to the state. The two senators and 11 deputies who make up this group under the leadership of Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi pointed out that the Chiapas conflict emerged because of the state's long history of backwardness and various forms of domination that have retarded its full development. The document says that in this state there are unacceptable examples of inequality and poverty. After reading the balance of the situation, Michoacan Senator Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi said violence in certain areas of Chiapas has become another element of destabilization. After reviewing the situation in Chiapas, the group of 13 legislators from the six congressional factions that make up the Congress drafted a 16-point proposal asking all sectors of society to contribute to the solution of the conflict. When reading the document, Victor Manuel Tinoco Rubi said the relations between the Federal Government and the state of Chiapas should be strengthened. A cease-fire must go into effect as a necessary condition for peace. The senator said criminal laws should be revised, especially criminal proceedings against Indians. Authorities must support the job being done by the National Human Rights Commission in the southeastern part of the country. There is also a need to review and speed up the processing of documents concerning the granting of lands, as well as other matters. Here are the statements made by Victor Manuel Tinoco: [Begin Tinoco recording] The Plural Group [Grupo Plural] hopes Congress will continue to contribute to the resolution of this conflict with the consensus of all political parties, and it should draft an agenda of legislative proposals to contribute to this end. The possibility of learning about its results in subsequent periods should be left open. We ask that the Permanent Commission authorize the Plural Group to give a follow-up to the fulfillment and application of all these recommendations and proposals and the other actions and proposals brought forth by other national authorities concerning these same problems. [end recording] Moreover, the board of directors of the Chamber of Deputies was installed a few minutes ago, following the Permanent Commission session. It will guide the work to be done during the special period of sessions to review and approve the bill for a general amnesty in Chiapas. Institutional Revolutionary Party Deputy (Juan Antonio Neme Dipp) was elected, and he will be the one to chair the board of directors at the Chamber of Deputies for this special period of sessions, which will begin today.
