The Russians -- three colonels and a naval captain -- gave Britain 48 hours notice of their intention to carry out an on-the- spot investigation of the exercise, taking place in the Western Isles. Although the connection is officially denied, the exercise covers the type of training that would be required if British troops had to be evacuated from war-torn Bosnia. It includes 1,500 Royal Marines supported by five frigates, a submarine, assault and landing ships and five minehunters, who have been making beach landings near Stornoway. For the first time in Britain, the marines have been joined by French and Dutch commandos. Both those countries have forces in the former Yugoslavia and France is the biggest contributor of troops there. An army spokesman in Edinburgh said the Russian inspection request was in line with a 34-nation treaty signed in Paris in 1990. Under the treaty, big exercises are notified in advance, and nations have the right to carry out inspections to "clarify any doubts about compliance with the agreed measures." The spokesman said the exercise, "Royal Dawn," was unconnected with the Bosnian situation, and was the annual winter exercise for the 3d Commando Brigade.
