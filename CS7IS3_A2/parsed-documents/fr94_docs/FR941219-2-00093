SUMMARY: This order, issued under the authority of 43 CFR 8364.1 and 43 CFR 8341.2(a), limits travel from December 1 to May 1 in Garvey Canyon, 15 miles north of Fruita, Colorado to non-motorized means. The length of road with this additional seasonal closure is approximately 1.5 miles, which is joined to the existing seasonal closure indicated in the Grand Junction Resource Management Plan of 1987. The affected public land is in the Grand Junction Resource Area, Grand Junction District, and is located in T. 8 S., R. 101 W., Sections 7 and 8, and T. 8 S., R. 102 W., Sec. 12, 6th Principal Meridian; Garfield County, Colorado. EFFECTIVE DATES: The restriction shall be effective December 15, 1994 and remain until rescinded or modified by the Authorized Officer. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of the seasonal closure is to significantly reduce human-induced stress on wintering deer and elk in an area where costs in energy loss are particularly high due to the topography and the concentration of animals. The closure affects about 1.5 miles of road in lower Garvey Canyon. A sign will be posted before the gate indicating the closure season and the reason. Information including maps of the restricted area is available in the Resource Area Office and District Office at the addresses shown below. Persons who are exempt from the restrictions include: (1) Any Federal, State, or local officers engaged in fire, emergency, or law enforcement activities; (2) BLM employees engaged in official duties; (3) Persons authorized to operate motorized vehicles within the restricted area, such as natural gas well service people and permitted grazing operators.
