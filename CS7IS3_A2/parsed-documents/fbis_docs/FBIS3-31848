In 1994, the restructuring of lower echelons will be finalized: Army corps, brigades, and independent battalions. Thus, it is believed that in this way the mobility and effectiveness of troops will improve. The government strategy program of the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] has set up the coordinating instrument for the activity of the Ministry of National Defense. Given the efforts to stabilize the economy and the difficulties characteristic of Romania's transition to the market economy, the Army has made indubitable progress. The Army's noninvolvement in politics and its increased credibility form the starting point for training our troops even under difficult financial conditions -- three times fewer funds than in 1989. One of the Army's successes was maintaining the national defense industry intact (Defense Minister Niculae Spiroiu recently said that "not even a single drill press was given away") and ensuring 74 percent of the combat equipment from our own supplies. Aside from this, all export orders have been finalized and, given the fact that the military conversion process has begun, we have started manufacturing products designed for civilian purposes. The Army has not imported anything that can be manufactured in our country, except for top technologies to be used in the defense industry. As a result of this technological adjustment, high performance systems on the basis of licenses from the NATO member countries or Israel have been manufactured in our country. In the area of electronics, Israel benefits from valuable U.S., French, or own technologies not to be matched by similar Soviet technologies (speed, precision, pattern, consumption, and so forth). Let us recall that during the Arab-Israeli war the big tank battle in the Sinai (1973) was won by Israel with a lot of leeway. General Ariel Sharon's victory in the second biggest tank battle of all time was not a battle of more powerful and bigger tanks, but a battle of more "intelligent" tanks with better night "vision" and more precise computer-guided weapons. The same thing was reconfirmed during the Gulf war. Other highly technological products manufactured in Romania in cooperation with Israeli experts are the components of the aeronautical industry (navigation, targeting, and fire-contol systems). It is known that the training of pilots in Israel (a country with limited resources like we ourselves) and technology have tripled their combat capacity and the number of sorties of each plane and pilot. This is how they ensured their supremacy in the air, although they had half as many planes as the Arabs. The most interesting argument, however, is the fact that all NATO members (including the U.S., France, Germany, and Great Britain) are sending their elite pilots and engineers to attend courses in Israel to perfect their knowledge. The contracting of Romania's exercise planes IAR-99 and IAR-108 by Israel and the United States will be all the more successful. Anyhow, these planes are being tested in the two countries. On the other hand, instead of procuring expensive, modern planes like the MiG-21, using Israeli electronic devices would mean important savings. In the area of reducing combat equipment under international supervision, the Ministry of National Defense was able in 1993 to abide by what was established during negotiations and thus able to scrap 25 percent of the planned equipment (especially used and outdated ones). In 1994, scrapping will be increased to 35 percent, and what is left for 1995 is 40 percent. In the area of cutting back troops, their number will amount to 268,000 (on 1 January 1994) and 230,000 (in 1995). They will be, first and foremost, fighters, not people from auxiliary branches, because the "Army can no longer be jack of all trades and do everything" (as Lieutenant General N. Spiroiu put it). Given the East European conflicts, the only area of balance and security is the one under NATO's umbrella. Romania's tendency to avoid dangerous imbalances and to get closer to NATO is justified and necessary because NATO remains the only political-military body able to offer guarantees for territorial integrity and the continuation of our democratic process. A gradual getting closer to and integration in the North Atlantic structures are possible on the basis of compatible and complementary military standards and doctrines based on the following principles: 1. The inviolability of national and European security; 2. The defensive nature of forces and limiting them solely to the national territory; 3. The preparation of the territory and of the economy for defense; 4. The national exclusiveness of ordering Romanian military components. Certainly, NATO integration involves high costs. Restructuring the Army and the national defense industry will entail important financial efforts throughout several years. We have to bear in mind, however, that beginning in 1968 Romania detached itself from the sole Eastern supplier in this respect and began the construction of its own defense industry on the basis of Western standards: Aviation (on the basis of French and British licenses), artillery (partly on the basis of NATO standards), air-to-ground and antitank missiles (French licenses), and so forth. The main Romanian accomplishments in this respect are based on Western type of components and technologies. Even in the area of telecommunications, everything, beginning with small- and medium-size portable equipment (which is needed by the troops), has been manufactured in our country with transistors, integrated circuits, connections, and computers on the basis of such licenses as Souriou, IBM, Control Data, and so forth. This is why Romania only has to preserve its specialized labor force and to modernize its production capacities by introducing new technologies. This is precisely what is happening now. True, there are dysfunctions, but they are kept under control. Thus, the Army is able to do its duty at all times.
