The program lasted 10 minutes. Answering questions, the prime minister spoke about the general reasons for unemployment in Western countries, the allocation of privatization points by Czech people, and the agricultural policy as approved by the government recently. In this context, the prime minister said: "I think that our merciless pressure to abolish protectionism in our exports, as well as lifting subsidies on Western exports of agricultural produce to our country, is producing certain results. When I was in Great Britain last week and then in Brussels, I had talks with both Mr. Delors and Mr. Christophersen, who is, so to speak, the European Union finance minister. They both indicated that the problem of not subsidizing the exports of agricultural products eastward is suddenly becoming an issue. Originally, this problem was not part of their vocabulary at all. This problem is now there, and they are becoming aware that something has to be done about it." While giving his opinion on the implementation of the government's political program, the prime minister said: "It would be a major institutional and political change if we established a senate in this country. This act or decisionmaking on this matter and the pace of this step are totally different, and I think it is useless to speed up anything in this matter. I will bet that those who are trying to speed up this process are doing so not because they are ignorant of the pace of political life, as I am trying to explain it here. They are not doing it because they think we could not do without a senate tomorrow or the day after. They are using this matter as political cards. They keep pulling out these cards, and that makes it possible for these political parties to say something more definite. They simply pull out a card, and, by doing so, they get media space, the papers, the radio, and so on. I cannot accept this. It is not possible to turn the territorial setup and the Senate into substitute problems that would be tackled at the cost of those problems that are much more urgent." The last question concerned the granting of citizenship to former Czech aristocrats and the return of their property. The prime minister said he hoped that all aspects of this complex issue will have been taken into consideration when laws are adopted.
