Privalov: "The Salvation of Russia Stands Above Differences of Opinion"] [Text] [Begin boxed material] After the elections to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation, a bold expression became popular: "The second coming of the communists." For many, the success of the CPRF in the elections turned out to be perhaps no less unexpected than the triumph of the party of Zhirinovskiy. As we know, the CPRF collected 14.78 percent of the votes cast in the election in the Smolensk region. Although this was less than half of what the LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] got, nevertheless--it is the second result. What do the communists themselves think of this? Our correspondent posed this question to the chairman of the Smolensk city executive committee of the CPRF, Veniamin Nikolayevich Potapov. [End boxed material] [Potapov] First of all, I believe that most of them who did not approve of the decision of Zyuganov's party regarding participation in the elections were convinced that we were right. The results of the voting took the ground out from under the feet of politicians who say that Russia is through with communism. Real prerequisites have been created for a normal and fruitful discussion of an ideological character, without application of labels and insults. Of course, the "second coming of the communists" is a bit overstated. Fifteen percent, you must agree, is not all that much. However, the "Choice of Russia" got even less. Nevertheless, the entire mass media is at its service: Radio, television, and SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI. I pick up a random copy of SN. There is a published sampling of five letters commenting on the results of the election. Four of the letters are in support of the president and "Choice of Russia" and one is about the LDPR. Moreover, the last one is written in such a way that, I believe, does not want no make anyone want to have anything to do with the "Zhirinovsky followers." Yet, as experience shows, it is useless for us to submit our material to SMOLENSKIYE NOVOSTI. [Correspondent] Much has been said recently about democracy, pluralism, freedom of speech, and so forth. How do you explain the situation which has arisen? [Potapov] Lenin already explained everything, and very well. The press and other mass media are always partisan. The always express the interests of certain classes and social groups. They are always dependant on the publisher, on bribes, on support, on the moneybag, etc. Once again we have become convinced of this. [Correspondent] So, perhaps you should follow Lenin's path and create your own ISKRA?... [Potapov] That is easy to say. Today even the major newspapers, as you know, cannot make ends meet. What can you say about us, who have no money? It is good that the CPRF is somehow able to publish NASHA GAZETA in Safonov for certain major events and campaigns. We print leaflets and distribute party literature. We see our main task in the propaganda of our views. [Correspondent] And is this all that the city organization of the CPRF is doing today? [Potapov] We are actively participating in the elections, supporting our candidates, collecting funds for a memorial to Terkin... In general, however, it is not easy for us today. It is not simply that there is a chronic shortage of monetary funds. We do not even have our own accommodations. Despite repeated appeals to Mayor M. G. Zysmanov, the city mayor's office has not considered the fact that we are speaking about a public organization numbering around 700 members for the present day, and has not resolved this question. Negotiations are currently being conducted with the oblast property fund regarding the question of our leasing accommodations in a building on Krupskaya Street. For the present, however, the acceptance of new members and the reregistration of communists is a practically impossible task: There is nowhere to turn. [Correspondent] Evidently, this is a common problem for all local sections of various parties? [Potapov] I would not say so. In the House of Political Enlightenment which was built with party funds (currently a music school), facilities have been allocated for parties whose members in the Smolensk area may be counted on one's fingers. To put it mildly, we are encountering a certain prejudice in regard to the communist party on the part of the authorities. And this despite the fact that we are being controlled by party card holders. [Correspondent] Call them "turncoats," as the readers do in their letters to the newspaper, and we will put an end to the subject. [Potapov] Turncoats--that is too simplified. Just look, practically all the leaders of the current parties were formerly members of the CPSU. And how they have scattered! The communist party has always had, as a minimum, two camps. In one there were those who said about Russia and the Union, "that country." They were the destroyers. In the other were the ones who said "our country," the builders. The struggle between them may be viewed literally over the entire duration of the party's history. The most striking example is the debunking of Leo Trotsky's theory of the permanent revolution. In translation, "permanent revolution" is continuous destruction. The proponents of this theory are currently implementing it in practice under the mark of radical market reforms. Moreover, having brought us out onto the beaten path of "world civilization," our leaders are concealing the fact that our crisis is taking place on the basis of the world crisis. In the Summer of 1992, a conference of heads of state and governments was held in Buenos Aires, where the synonymous conclusion was drawn that if world civilization follows the Western path of development, it will find itself in a dead end. And why do we need to go there? [Correspondent] Nevertheless, even within the communist camp there is no unified opinion regarding an alternative path. [Potapov] Yes, there are differences of opinion. They are being manifested also in the Smolensk region. But the city organization of the CPRF believed and still believes that now is not the time for interparty, and particularly intraparty, sorting out. We are open to cooperation with everyone who speaks out against the shock policy of the current government, for whom it is not differences of opinion which stand above all else, but the salvation of Russia. During the electoral campaign, we also collected signatures in favor of the Russian All-People's Union, helped the party of the cadets, the "Dignity and Charity" movement, and certain others. Today we consider our closest allies to be the Agrarian Party of Russia, the patriotic movement and the Smolensk Popular Assembly. [Correspondent] There are rumors circulating about certain contacts of the CPRF with the party of Zhirinovskiy. [Potapov] We have not had any dialogue with the LDPR. If they agree to it, we, for our part, are not opposed. We may say the same also of the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. In general, however, we are more worried today about the problems of the upcoming elections to the oblast duma and the organs of local self-government. We are proposing already in the near future to hold an oblast conference of the CPRF, to hear the report of the executive organs, to define our pre-electoral platform. We believe that the results of the December elections could be more favorable for us if the supreme administrative organ of the oblast CPRF worked out a preliminary decision on tactics and candidates. This has not been done. I believe we must learn from mistakes.
