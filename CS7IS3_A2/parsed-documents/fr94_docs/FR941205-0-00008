FR941205-0-00008 FR941205-0-00002 Several comments also questioned whether the INS could fairly administer a fee waiver process. They alleged that the INS previously has used improper criteria in adjudicating applications for waivers of fees for Temporary Protected Status and for renewal of employment authorization documents. These comments urged that the process be fairly implemented by removing irrelevant discretionary factors from the waiver procedure and focusing solely on the applicant's ability to pay the fee. Some argued that the INS should propose, publish, and elicit public comments on uniform guidelines for adjudicating fee waivers for all INS applications. Others argued that the INS should create a fee waiver process for asylum applicants under a separate regulation, independent of 8 CFR 103.7(c). Some proposed that asylum applicants filing through an approved voluntary agency or an accredited representative should receive automatic fee waivers. Many comments suggested that waiver guidelines should incorporate the poverty guidelines of the Department of Health and Human Services. Some comments suggested that a time limit be set within which the INS must make waiver determinations and, if the decision is not made within that time, that the waiver be granted. Comments also suggested that the fee-paying or waiver status of the applicant not be disclosed to the asylum officer adjudicating the claim. One comment suggested that the filing of a fraudulent fee waiver be used as evidence weighing against the applicant's credibility on the underlying asylum claim. Several comments stated that under section 286(m) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. 1356(m), the INS may not impose a fee for asylum applications. This section provides that the INS may set its fee for providing adjudication and naturalization services at a level that will ensure the full recovery of costs for those services, including those provided without charge to asylum applicants or other immigrants. Several comments also stated that a specific fee for asylum applications is unnecessary because after the implementation of asylum reform, the surcharge added to INS fees in conformance with section 286(m) should generate sufficient revenues to cover the costs of the asylum program. A number of comments made recommendations for changing the fee proposal. One comment proposed setting the fee at $615, which is the estimated total cost of adjudicating an asylum application. Under this proposal, if the applicant could not pay the fee at the time of filing, then he or she should pay half of the fee at the time of filing and pay the balance within 90 days or at the time of the interview, whichever is sooner. One comment suggested loaning the entire cost of asylum processing ($615) to the applicant. The loan could be paid back in one to three years as the person begins to work. Some comments suggested that the fee be deferred so that a person granted asylum pay the fee when he or she applies for adjustment of status or for any other subsequent benefit under the Act. For those whose applications are denied and who subsequently seek another immigration benefit, such as adjustment of status upon marriage or reentry after deportation, the asylum fee would be collected at the time the applicant submits the respective application. The comments argued that applicants will be in a better position to pay the fee at the time of these subsequent applications. One comment suggested that the fee not be charged to those who file their asylum application before an immigration judge in exclusion or deportation proceedings. This comment noted that most of the alleged abuse of the asylum system occurs in applications filed with asylum officers and that it is unfair to charge a fee to those who are defending themselves in removal proceedings. Response and Disposition: The comments received in response to the fee proposal have been carefully considered. It has been concluded that imposition of the fee at this time would likely impose administrative burdens that would not be offset by the anticipated receipts from the fee. Accordingly, the provisions relating to the fee are not included as part of the final rule. Adjudication of asylum applications before the INS will continue to be funded by way of a statutorily authorized surcharge assessed on applications for other immigration benefits. Additional funding provided by the 1995 appropriations for Asylum Reform will provide resources for INS and EOIR. As part of an ongoing comprehensive economic review of its entire fee structure, the INS will examine alternative sources of funding for asylum adjudications, including the possibility of a user fee. 5. General (8 CFR 208.1) a. Effective Date (8 CFR 208.1(a)) Proposed Rule: The proposed rule would have amended 8 CFR 208.1(a) to state that Part 208 applies to all adjudications of asylum applications, whether by an asylum officer or by an immigration judge, on or after the effective date of the final rule. Comments: Many comments urged INS not to apply some or all of the proposed amendments to Part 208 to applications filed prior to the effective date of the final rule. These comments suggested that a ``retroactive'' application of the rule could result in different treatment for asylum applicants who filed at the same time, but prior to the effective date of the final rule_namely: claims filed and adjudicated before the effective date of the final rule will have been processed under the prior practice of a mandatory asylum officer interview and opportunity to rebut a NOID; NOIDs are eliminated for claims filed but not adjudicated by the effective date and, under the proposed rule, such claims could be referred immediately to an immigration judge without an interview by an asylum officer. Some comments also noted that making the rule applicable to applications that have already been filed would have no effect in discouraging the prospective filing of non-meritorious applications.
