A Foreign Office spokesman, when contacted, told XINHUA today that all the staff has been evacuated from the embassy after Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali left Kabul Thursday. "Nobody remains in the embassy in Kabul," he said. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who paid a brief visit to Kabul on Wednesday and Thursday, is expected to give more details this afternoon at a press conference about his visit and the closure of the Pakistan's embassy in Kabul. "The present condition of the chancery in Kabul is such that it cannot serve as a diplomatic mission till major repair and maintenance is carried out," said a foreign office statement. On Wednesday, several embassy employees were beaten and part of the facility set on fire during a violent anti-Pakistan demonstration by hundreds of Afghans. They protested against Monday's killing of the three armed Afghans who had hijacked a school bus and held over 70 children and teachers hostage, demanding ransom, food supply to Afghanistan and opening of Pak-Afghan border.
