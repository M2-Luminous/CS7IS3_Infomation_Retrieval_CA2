Vivekanand] [Text] Amman--Jordan has promised to closely study the status of U.S. firms subject to the secondary Arab boycott of Israel, but there will not be a blanket removal of companies from the so-called blacklist for the time being informed sources said Wednesday [19 January]. The sources, commenting on ongoing contacts between the Jordanian government and European and American governments seeking to end the secondeary boycott, said Jordan did not feel that the time is opportune to removing the secondary list altogether. "Jordan has promised a case-by-case consideration of the companies involved on the basis of its own national interests and the interests of the company involved, but it will not extend a unilateral removal of the secondary boycott at this point in time, said one source. The primary Arab boycott of Israel bans Arab dealings with Israeli companies as well as companies based elsewhere but owned partly or wholy by the government of Israel or Israeli nationals. The secondary boycott applies to companies that deal with Israel or have investments in Israel or use Israeli components in their products. The U.S. and several European countries have adopted legislation to punish companies complying with the requirements of the Arab Boycott of Israel Bureau. In simpler terms, it means that any company providing a certificate that it is not Israeli-owned and its products do not include Israeli components and the ship carrying their products does not call at Israeli ports could face stiff fines. These documents are required by the Arab government enforcing the boycott, and consignments unaccompanied by these certifications could be denied entry altogether into their countries. A lifting of the secondary boycott was one of the key themes of a recent visit to the Middle East by U.S. Secretary of State Ron Brown, who held talks in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, the occupied territories and Egypt.
