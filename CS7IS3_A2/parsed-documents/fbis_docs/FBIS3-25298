Muller and De Wet Potgieter] [Text] South Africa's next minister of defense could be an arch-communist. Rumors are rife that Ronnie Kasrils, chief of the ANC's [African National Congress] espionage division, is currently being regarded by the ANC as the number one contender for the defense portfolio when a cabinet of national unity gets drawn up after the elections. Kasrils, member of the South African Communist Party's Central Committee as well as the ANC's Executive Committee, played a significant role in the ANC's terror onslaught against the republic. He also orchestrated the ANC's protest against the government of the Ciskei, which culminated in a bloodbath at its capital, Bisho. RAPPORT has been told that he is currently enjoying more support in prominent ANC circles than General Bantu Holomisa of the Transkei, who has for a while been a front runner for this portfolio. General Holomisa, a confidant of Nelson Mandela, is believed to be currently regarded as someone with too much of a political "past." APLA's [Azanian People's Liberation Army] murder gangs have for the past three years been launching terror strikes from the Transkei. His support of APLA has gained General Holomisa personal popularity among certain ANC supporters, but there is fear that the Defense Force will not accept his presence as minister. Kasrils is a member of the Transitional Executive Council's subcouncil for defense and is being regarded in ANC ranks as one of the experts in the field of defense. It is believed that he could make a success of the position and win the support of the officers. Flattery About Him From a survey conducted by RAPPORT in Defense Force circles, it would seem that he is acceptable to at least some officers. Senior officers spoke flatteringly about him after last week's Air Force Day ceremonies. His positive comments about the Air Force are believed to have assured him a few more friends among Air Force officers. But in the Army, from whose ranks the last four Defense Force chiefs had been appointed, Kasrils's presence could cause tensions. The general staff recently warned President F.W. de Klerk and his cabinet that the majority of officers will perhaps not support the government in the event of conflict with right-wing elements in the country. Open Rebellion The question is whether the appointment of a communist and former "enemy" as minister of defense will not perhaps result in an open rebellion within the Defense Force. Especially if a new government would decide to disband the local white commandos. Modise Not Named It is obvious that Mr. Joe Modise, commander of MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe, Spear of the Nation -- ANC Military Wing], has not been named as a candidate for the defense portflolio. Mr. Modise is the most senior "military man" in the ANC, but represents the "Transvaal" element within the organization. For a long time there has been tension between him and the Xhosa-speaking sector inside the ANC. General Gabriel Ramushwana, former military dictator of Venda, who was recently appointed as commander of the national peace force now being trained near Bloemfontein, is being regarded as a logical successor to General Georg Meiring as chief of the Defense Force. Until last week, he was still on the ANC list of election candidates.
