He told a news conference in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Thursday [21 April] that there had been no serious disagreements during the negotiations. "There was some friction, but Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev put everything in order," he said. Radetskyy said each side had made its own inventory of the fleet, which the two countries plan to divide between them. The inventories listed different numbers of vessels, but, if the difference was ironed out by Friday, a joint inventory would be unnecessary, he said. Radetskyy said Ukraine had proposed that Russia base its portion of the fleet at Donuzlav, 100 km (62.5 miles) west of Sevastopol. "The delegations had different viewpoints on that. Experts are now working on it. We are looking for points of contact and will cut that Gordian knot," he said. Asked to comment on Russia's demand to base its part of the fleet at Sevastopol, Radetskyy said, "They cannot make any demands because they are on Ukrainian territory. The land, water and infrastructure belong to Ukraine. They can only make proposals, not dictate their terms." "The infrastructure is ours and can only be leased to Russia," he emphasized. He said the two sides were looking for a solution but "nobody has yet taken any concrete decision about that or made any promises."
