Consumer groups have been pressing for the controversial provision as a way to fight court battles over damage from defective products. The report instead calls for a rule allowing manufacturers to be free from responsibility for damage caused by defective products if they prove that such defects were not foreseeable at the time of development. Among other proposals, the report rejected a request from the Health and Welfare Ministry that blood products be exempt from the law for the sake of stable supply. The proposals are roughly in line with a report presented last December by the Social Policy Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister. Government officials said they intend to submit a bill on product liability on the basis of the latest proposal by the end of April.
