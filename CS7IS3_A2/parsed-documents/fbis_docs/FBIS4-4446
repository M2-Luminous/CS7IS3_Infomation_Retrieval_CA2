FBIS4-4446 "dreas063_h_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-063 Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 Brunei, Malaysia & Singapore Malaysia * Minister on Islamic Separatists on Thai Border * Minister on Islamic Separatists on Thai Border 94SE0088A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in Malay 17 Feb 94 p 7 94SE0088A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA Malay CSO [Text] Malaysia and Thailand have agreed to change the orientation of the General Border Commission (GBC) in the era following the end of the communist threat. The two countries will make the GBC a commission that emphasizes social and economic development for the sake of finding a way to resolve the various security problems faced by residents of the border area. Malaysian Minister of Defense Datuk Sri Mohd. Najib Tun Razak, who attended the 38th GBC Conference in Bangkok on 7 February, told UTUSAN that the main issue to be reviewed is the future role of the GBC. One of the subjects discussed was the threat of Islamic separatist groups, such as the Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO) and the Pattani Malay National Front (BRN). Najib said that in the high-level talks between the armed forces commanders of the two countries, Malaysia stressed that the problems faced by Thailand are internal ones. "We also stated that we will not help, support, or protect Islamic separatist groups. If we find Islamic separatist groups in Malaysian territory, we will take action, such as arresting them under Malaysian laws. "This matter is rather complex, however, because of the existence of family ties among the border residents of the two countries. "Free movement in and out of each country's territory can make the problem more difficult," Najib explained. He feels that the problem is one of perception, because some Thai military leaders suspect that the Malaysian Government is doing something secretly to help the Islamic separatist groups. "I wish to state that we have never had any secret or clandestine contacts that could be interpreted as helping those groups. Military Action "It is our viewpoint that the way out of the problem is to seek resolution through talks. This problem absolutely cannot be ended by military action. "The only way to resolve the problem is to include and involve all parties in the socioeconomic development process," he said. Najib said that if Muslims in southern Thailand want a better future, they must seek a way to have talks with the Thai Government. This will enable them to get more benefit from the development process and to find a way that will permit them to have a more effective part. He said terrorist activity is no longer an approach that can help determine the future. These subjects are among the main agenda items to be discussed by the two countries throughout this year, and he hopes that prior to the 39th GBC Conference next year Malaysia and Thailand can find points of agreement to serve as future guidelines for the GBC. With regard to the comment by General Kitti Rattanachaya, chief of the Fourth Army Division, that there are Islamic separatist bases in Kelantan and Perak, Najib said such bases do not exist. "It is clear that Malaysia does not give protection to those groups. "If we find that they have fled into Malaysian territory, however, and if we can track them down, we will take action according to Malaysian law."
