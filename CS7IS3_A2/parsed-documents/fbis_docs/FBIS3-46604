The 9.8 percent expansion, the strongest annual growth since 1988, would mean an unexpectedly strong fourth-quarter spurt of around 12 percent, going by the preliminary estimate of about 9 percent for the first nine months of last year. The Ministry of Trade & Industry in mid-November last year forecast 1993 growth of close to 9 percent, a figure which the private sector has since set its sights on. Growth last year was broad-based, and for the first time in five years, productivity grew faster than real wages, said Mr Goh. The strong flow of investment commitments last year, surpassing the 1992 volume of $3.5 billion, confirms that Singapore remained competitive despite a sluggish world economy and China's strong pull, he said. But the overall average last year was pushed up by the exceptional performance of the financial and business services sector, especially the stock market, Mr Goh noted. Also, there are some signs that the manufacturing sector is slowing down, which Singapore should watch carefully, he added. Still, 1994 looks promising with the world economy improving, and Singaporeans can look forward to another good year, the PM said. MTI is sticking to its earlier forecast of 1994 growth at between 6 and 8 percent. With the NAFTA Bill approved in Congress, and the Uruguay Round of trade talks wrapped up, there is now a positive and improving global trading environment, he said. Economic recovery and steady growth in the U.S., Europe and Japan this year will pull other countries along. Except for Japan, growth in the Asia-Pacific will remain buoyant, and Singapore will benefit from the regional boom. Singapore must seek and seize the opportunities by participating in the region's growth, he said. Turning to the longer term, Mr Goh said one problem Singapore should pay more attention to is its rapid ageing population. "This ageing population will have serious implications for our economic vigour and competitiveness," he said. "We need to make major adjustments to cope with this change." Singapore has taken several steps -- raising the retirement age to 60, getting Singaporeans to exercise and stay healthy, getting them to save for old age -- but more still needs to be done. The subject will be discussed in greater depth this year, said Mr Goh. While Singapore is not the only country with the problem, its population is ageing much faster than elsewhere because births have declined sharply after the post-war baby boom, the Prime Minister said. Typical Western countries take 50 years or more for the proportion of elderly above 65 to double from 10 to 20 percent, but Singapore will take only about 20 years. Furthermore, Singapore's edge of a substantially younger population, compared with the developed countries, will narrow and will eventually almost disappear in the next few decades. Over the next 40 years, the Singapore population is projected to grow 30 percent from 2.7 million to 3.5 million, but the number of people above 65 years will jump by three times from 164,000 to 662,000. "Provided we prepare early for what lies ahead, we can surmount this challenge, as we have many other challenges in the past," said Mr Goh.
