In comparison with the last year incomes rose by 37.5 percent, while consumer prices increased by 2.1 times. As a result of the lowered common purchasing power the actual value of goods bought and pay services also decreased. The family consumer structure has distorted in a way that the bulk of money expenses are undertaken to pay for food, public utilities and taxes. The asked families spent more than two thirds of their incomes in 1993 for these purposes: 44 percent for food, 19.5 percent for other necessary goods, 19.2 for pay services. Poor families in 1993 spent 77 percent of their funds for food, public utilities, transport and other necessary expenses.
