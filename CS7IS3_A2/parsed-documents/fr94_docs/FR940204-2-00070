FR940204-2-00070 FR940204-2-00045 [Project No. 2438&hyph;000] New York State Electric and Gas Corp.; Authorization for Continued Project Operation January 31, 1994. New York State Electric and Gas Corporation, licensee for the Seneca Falls and Waterloo Stations Project No. 2438, filed a notice of intent to file an application for a new license on December 19, 1988. Project No. 2438 is located on the Seneca River in Seneca County, New York. Under section 15(c)(1) of the Federal Power Act (Act), the deadline for filing an application for new license and any competing license applications was December 31, 1991. No applications for license for the project were filed. Therefore, on February 24, 1992, as set forth at 18 CFR 16.25, the Commission issued a notice soliciting applications from potential applicants other than the existing licensee. The license for Project No. 2438 was issued for a period ending December 31, 1993. Section 15(a)(1) of the FPA, 16 U.S.C. 808(a)(1), requires the Commission, at the expiration of a license term, to issue from year to year an annual license to the then licensee under the terms and conditions of the prior license until a new license is issued, or the project is otherwise disposed of as provided in section 15 or any other applicable section of the FPA. Notice is hereby given that an annual license for Project No. 2438 is issued to New York State Electric and Gas Corporation for a period effective January 1, 1994, through December 31, 1994, or until the issuance of a new license for the project or other disposition under the FPA, whichever comes first. If issuance of a new license (or other disposition) does not take place on or before December 31, 1994, notice is hereby given that, pursuant to 18 CFR 16.18(c), an annual license under section 15(a)(1) of the FPA is renewed automatically without further order or notice by the Commission, unless the Commission orders otherwise.
