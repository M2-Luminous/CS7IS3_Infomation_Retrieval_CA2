Top brass from Volvo are visiting India from 14 to 17 February in order to become familiar with the market and study business opportunities in the country. The delegation is led by Nils Arthur, deputy managing director of Volvo's Truck International Division. According to an Indian Industry Ministry spokesman, Volvo is to study all important areas, from the possibility of co-ownership of enterprises to component purchases in the country. India has recently opened up the automobile sector to foreign investors, who can start production without the prior permission from the government required in the past. Although the import of foreign cars is still limited, it has become easier to get lower customs duty rates. Mercedes Is Already Here So far only Daimler-Benz has begun the assembly of Mercedes automobiles at the Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company (TELCO) in Pune near Bombay. Manufacturers assessing the studying opportunities offered by this new market include BMW, General Motors, Renault, Peugeot, and Honda. Volvo is represented in India by Modi Motors Private Limited.
