Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in January-February were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date): 01/25 01/31 02/08 Average daily price rise February January Consumer 103.4 102.4 103.3 0.42 0.68 goods and services including: foodstuffs 103.8 102.4 103.8 0.45 0.68 nonfood items 102.2 102.3 102.8 0.36 0.40 for-fee 107.6 103.2 103.1 0.37 2.38 services for the population Prices in the consumer market continue to rise at a faster rate (4.4 percent) in the cities of the Far East. They rose the least (by 1.8 percent) since the beginning of the month in the cities in the Urals. Foodstuffs From 1-8 February prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 3.9 percent in organized trade, and by 3.5 percent in nonorganized trade. Price changes by main categories of food products over this period are shown below (in % of 31 January 1994): Total in organized in nonorganized trade trade All food products 103.8 103.9 103.5 including: Meat and meat 103.3 103.4 103.0 products Fish and fish 105.1 105.2 102.8 products Milk and milk 108.7 109.1 106.8 products Eggs 102.1 102.1 102.0 Sugar 100.7 100.7 100.6 Bread and bakery 105.8 105.8 products Cereals and 104.5 104.6 102.5 macaroni items Vodka 101.2 101.1 101.9 Potatoes and 105.9 104.7 107.4 vegetables Prices with respect to milk products and bread and bakery products in organized trade continue to rise at a high rate. Over January--beginning of February prices for these products rose by 1 percent daily on average. Over the past week prices for meat products and vegetables rose by almost 3 percent; the rate of price increases with respect to eggs slowed down somewhat (by 2 percent). Prices for sugar, confectionery items, and tea also rose insignificantly (by 1-2 percent). In nonorganized trade prices rose over this week on average at almost the same rate as in organized trade. Prices for milk, sour cream, beef, poultry meat, and vegetable products rose at a higher rate (5-13 percent). Prices for pork, butter, vegetable oil, eggs, and apples rose by no more than 2-3 percent. The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic foodstuffs rose over the week by 4.2 percent and amounted as of 1 February to 39,100 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly basis. Magadan remains the most expensive city (R94,900) and Ulyanovsk the least expensive (R22,200). The price differential between them measures a factor of 4.3. Moscow has moved from 35th to 29th place of 132 monitored cities (R43,800 on a monthly basis). Nonfood Items In the beginning of February prices for these items continued to rise at a moderate pace. Prices for sewn items and knitwear, fabrics, tobacco items, and cultural and household goods increased by 2.0-3.8 percent. For-Fee Services for the Population Prices rose over the week by 3.1 percent. For some types of consumer services, prices increased by 10-12 percent. The cost of basic residential telephone service increased two- to fourfold in 24 cities and amounted to R1,500-2,000 a month. The Consumer Market The total volume of retail turnover and for-fee services (at officially counted enterprises) amounted to R6.6 trillion in January of this year and increased eightfold as compared to January of last year. In comparable prices, it declined by 6.6 percent. Retail turnover amounted to R5.9 trillion and increased 7.8-fold in current prices as compared to last January. The physical volume of goods sold decreased over this period by 2.9 percent, and as compared to December--by more than one-quarter. The private sector share (including consumer cooperatives) of officially reporting enterprises accounts for 56 percent of the retail turnover (38 percent in January 1993); the state sector--for 37 percent (60 percent); and other nonstate forms of ownership--7 percent (2 percent). There were R3.1 trillion worth of foodstuffs sold to the population in January of this year, which is eight times more than over the same month last year in current prices, and 7.8 percent less in comparable prices. In January 1994 the population purchased R2.8 trillion worth of nonfood items (a sevenfold increase in current prices, and a 3.3 percent increase in comparable prices). In January of this year R0.7 trillion worth of for-fee services were rendered to the population (at officially counted enterprises), which constitutes an 11-fold increase in current prices as compared to last January, and a 48-percent decline in comparable prices. The share of household consumer services in the structure of for-fee services is declining. In rural areas over the past year the number of combination point-of-service facilities declined by 12 percent. Professionally equipped barber facilities remained in only one half of currently operating enterprises. Only one-third of these facilities still provide electronics and complex home appliances repair services; photo services--7 percent; and shoe repair--10 percent. Mobile services in rural areas are being phased out. Consumer goods and services sold to the population in January of this year through all sales channels amounted to about R13 trillion[.sup]*[/], which exceeds that for last January by a factor of 8.5 in current prices, and by 1.3 percent in comparable prices. Inventories of Goods As of 1 February of this year the value of current inventories of consumer goods in trade and industry of the Russian Federation amounted to R9.2 trillion (at officially reporting enterprises). As compared to 1 February of last year, their volume declined by 4 percent in comparable prices. About 79 percent of inventories (R7.2 trillion worth) are concentrated at retail trade enterprises. Below are data characterizing turnover sufficiency level in terms of inventories of goods: Inventories of goods in retail trade Turnover network sufficiency in terms of inventories (in days of trading) billion rubles as % of the corresponding date last year (in comparable prices) As of 1 926.9 78 43 February 1993 As of 1 January 6,737.6 85 36 1994 As of 1 7,221.3 97 47 February 1994 As compared to January 1993, inventory sufficiency in January of this year was higher with respect to canned meat and fish, margarine and margarine products, sugar, confectionery items, tea, salt, woolen fabrics, clothing and underwear, knitwear and hosiery, footwear, synthetic detergents, radio receivers, refrigerators, and tobacco items. Market Saturation With Consumer Goods In January of this year saturation of all retail trade channels with consumer goods increased as compared to last January by 23 percent, and as compared to December by 4 percent. Below are data characterizing the changes in the consumer market saturation by individual groups of goods (in percentages): Saturation coefficient[.sup]*[/] Saturation index[.sup]**[/] in January 1994 as compared to January December January 01/93 12/93 1993 1993 1994 Total 59 76 87 123 104 including: foodstuffs 60 72 83 119 107 of them: meat products 75 83 84 109 94 milk products 56 68 75 121 104 butter 89 99 98 110 99 vegetable oil 85 96 94 111 98 eggs 97 97 97 100 100 granulated 83 99 98 118 99 sugar confectionery 81 91 91 112 100 items tea 83 97 92 111 95 nonfood items 73 86 94 130 112 of them: sewn items 70 85 91 130 120 knitwear 67 87 88 131 101 hosiery 87 97 96 110 99 leather 69 86 85 123 99 footwear refrigerators 46 78 83 180 106 color 65 84 80 123 95 television sets [.sup]*[/] Ratio of the number of cities where on the day of registration the goods were available for sale to the total number of surveyed cities (132). [.sup]**[/] Ratio of saturation coefficients taking into account data comparability. As the consumer market develops and new channels for selling goods appear, part of the population is shifting from organized to nonorganized trade in regard to goods purchases. While purchases of meat products, sugar, and vegetable oil increased last year by 12-26 percent, and milk products--by 6 percent, their sales in organized trade dropped by 4-15 percent. Monetary Income of the Population The monetary income earned by the population in January of this year amounted to R14.4 trillion and increased 9.7-fold as compared to January 1993; adjusted for the consumer price index, they increased by 7 percent. Disposable monetary income (income less compulsory payments) adjusted for the consumer price index increased over this period by 8 percent. The volume of nominal monetary income in January of this year was lower than in December of 1993 by 16.6 percent. This is typical for a number of years and stems from December payment of quarterly and yearly bonuses, as well as income in the form of interest paid on deposits at the end of the year. The average wages due to workers in January of this year amounted to an estimated R145,000 and increased as compared to December 1993 by 3 percent (in December as compared to November it increased by 39 percent). As compared to last January the average wage increased 9.5-fold. Stratification of the population by level of per capita monetary income continued to increase in January. The income concentration index (Gini coefficient) measured 0.352 in January 1994 as compared to 0.346 in December 1993 and 0.327 in 1992. The value of the subsistence minimum in January 1994 amounted to R51,400 per capita, including R58,000 for work-eligible persons, R36,200 for pensioners, and R51,300 for children. The cost of the consumer food basket included in the subsistence minimum accounts for 68 percent of it. Income of a considerable part of the population (mainly families with many children, incomplete families with children, families with a high proportion of dependents where working members' labor remuneration is close to the minimum, single pensioners, and the disabled) cannot cover even the cost of the consumer food basket taken into account in the calculation of the subsistence minimum, which may be seen from the following data: Population with monetary income below: subsistence minimum cost of consumer food basket taken into account in calculating the subsistence minimum million as % of total million as % of total persons population persons population January 1993 52.8 35.5 21.6 14.5 January 1994 52.6 35.4 26.3 17.7 The value of the subsistence minimum differs substantially across the regions in Russia: from R18,000-30,000 in Ulyanovsk Oblast, the Republic of Tatarstan, and Kursk, Tula, Orel, Smolensk, Voronezh, and Penza Oblasts, to R73,000-97,000 in Moscow, Amur Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), and R117,000-119,000 in Sakhalin and Magadan Oblasts. Industrial Production In January of this year Russian industry produced almost R16 trillion worth of output in current prices. As compared to last January industrial production declined by 23.1 percent. As compared to December 1993 total output declined by 17.2 percent, and daily output--by 11 percent. The fuel and power generation sectors in January of this year produced 89.5 billion kw-hrs of electric power (5 percent less than in January 1993), 27.5 million tonnes of oil, including gas condensate (10 percent less), 25.3 million tonnes of coal (8 percent less), and 57.2 billion cubic meters of gas (the same level of production as January 1993). There has been a considerable decline in the output of the main products of ferrous metallurgy. Steel smelting in January of this year amounted to 3.9 million tonnes (23 percent below January 1993 level); pig iron production--3.0 million tonnes (17 percent less); finished rolled metal--3.0 million tonnes (20 percent less); and steel pipe--327,000 tonnes (47 percent less). In January of this year, the output of half the monitored items in machine building amounted to 50 percent or less of last year. The output of large electric machinery amounted to 400 units (41 percent less than last January); of metal-cutting machine tools--1,800 (47 percent less); drop forge machines--295 (62 percent less); bulldozers--351 (46 percent less); trucks--16,500 (60 percent less); passenger cars--21,300 (71 percent less); and tractors--2,100 (77 percent less). In the chemical and petrochemical industry, because of resource limitations production of most varieties of output continued to fall in January. Overall, 660,000 tonnes of synthetic ammonia was produced over the month (a 27-percent decline as compared to the January 1993 level), 511,000 tonnes of sulfuric acid (35 percent), 135,000 tonnes of calcinated soda (47 percent), 107,000 tonnes of caustic soda (23 percent), 547,000 tonnes of mineral fertilizer (26 percent), 18,300 tonnes of chemical thread and fiber (46 percent), and 1.8 million automotive tires (37 percent). In the petrochemical industry, the output of synthetic spirits declined by 11 percent as compared to January 1993, technical hydrocarbon--by 42 percent, and synthetic rubber--by 37 percent. A similar situation existed in the rubber-asbestos industry: production of rubberized-fabric and conveyer-type rubberized-cord belting, needed for repairs of agricultural machinery, declined by 37 percent and 17 percent, respectively, and that of metal-braid sleeves--by 68 percent. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry in January of this year the outshipment of timber amounted to 68 percent of last year's volume. Production of lumber amounted to 1.9 million tonnes (29 percent below that for January 1993), commercial cellulose--101,000 tonnes (30 percent below), and cardboard--87,700 tonnes (42 percent below). The shortage of timber raw materials resulted in a decline in the production of laminated plywood and window and door frames by 21-26 percent; of mine props and shaft slab--by 34-58 percent; and of preassembled homes made of wood--by three-quarters. In the pulp and paper industry, as a result of difficulties in distribution of paper, whose price has risen numerous times, output declined by 18 percent as compared to the level of the corresponding month of last year. In the construction materials industry in January, a further reduction in output was registered with respect to products used first and foremost in industrial construction. In particular, production of prefabricated ferroconcrete, panels for preassembled-component house building, and aluminum alloy components declined by 25-30 percent; of steel and roof panels and light metal constructions--by 57-63 percent. The output of general-use construction materials declined to a somewhat lesser extent. Production of cement amounted to 2.3 million tonnes (40 percent less than in January 1993), brick--1.1 billion units (22 percent less), window glass--7.0 million square meters (31 percent less), and soft roofing and insulation materials--28.3 million square meters (39 percent less). A considerable decline occurred in January in the production of asbestos-cement items. Suspension of production of high-grade asbestos in the first half of January led to a decline in the output of roof slate by 80 percent, and asbestos-cement pipe and couplers by 49 percent. Production of consumer goods in January declined as compared to last January by 27 percent, including that of nonfood items--by 35 percent, and foodstuffs--by 15 percent. At light industry enterprises in January of this year 232 million square meters of fabrics was produced (5 percent less than in January 1993), 31.2 million pairs of hosiery (26 percent less), 18.0 million units of knitwear (28 percent less), and 4.8 million pairs of footwear (54 percent less). Shortage of material and financial resources remains the main cause of production decline, as well as difficulties in distribution of final products because of their high prices. Production of goods for children is declining at a faster rate. In January of this year as compared to last January, the output of hosiery and knitwear for children declined by 32-45 percent, and of footwear--by almost two-thirds. In the production of complex home appliances the output of refrigerators and freezers, universal kitchen appliances, and electric juicers is rising. With respect to other varieties of home appliances, the January output was below that for January 1993: production of washers amounted to 185,000 (41 percent less); television sets--259,000 (10 percent less); tape recorders--102,000 units (49 percent less) and porcelain, stoneware, and majolica tableware--36.6 million units (19 percent less). As compared to January 1993, the output of vegetable oil, high fat cheese and feta cheese, canned milk, and mayonnaise increased somewhat. Production of most foodstuffs declined somewhat as compared to January 1993: there were 192,000 tonnes of meat produced (24 percent less), 546,000 tonnes of whole milk products (16 percent less), 23,600 tonnes of butter (39 percent less), 1,088,000 tonnes of flour (18 percent less), and 110,000 tonnes of cereals (30 percent less). The process of sugar beet processing is nearly complete. In January of this year 82,400 tonnes of granulated sugar was produced from sugar beet, which is 14 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year. Production of canned meat, baker's yeast, tea, and macaroni and confectionery items lagged considerably (21-41 percent) behind that of January 1993. Commercial bakeries reduced production of bread and bakery items by 12 percent. Production of some varieties of baby food continues to contract. The output of canned meat and grain-based dry mixes for baby and restricted-diet nutrition amounted to 20 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the January 1993 level. One of the main reasons for this contraction is a build-up of unsold inventories at enterprises. Preparation for Spring Sowing On the threshold of spring sowing, Russia's enterprises are in somewhat worse shape with respect to supply of seed of spring grain crops. By the beginning of February the seed supply at farms amounted to 10.3 million tonnes of spring grain crop seeds (not including corn), or 98.5 of the needed quantities as determined by the farms themselves. The supply of wheat and millet seed is adequate. At the same time, farms are short 9,000 tonnes of buckwheat seed (7 percent), 5,000 tonnes of rice seed (8 percent), and 115,000 tonnes of legume seed (12 percent). There is a considerable shortage of seed potatoes (441,000 tonnes, or 17 percent). Seed on hand as of 02/01/94 For reference: seed on hand as of 02/01/93 as % of need thousand tonnes % of farms' needs Spring grain and 10.3 98.5 99.95 legume crops (excluding corn), million tonnes including: wheat 3,024 101 105 buckwheat 119 93 101 rice 62 92 97 millet 50 100.2 95 legumes 846 88 81 Potatoes 2,179 83 92 Soy 88 111 100.3 Farms on 30 territories in Russia have the full supply of seed they need for spring grain crops. Farms in Kaluga, Yaroslavl, Samara, Penza, Tyumen, and Chita Oblasts have 80-90 percent of needed quantities; at the same time, in most of the territories listed above this year's spring sowing will have to make up for a considerable shortfall in the sowing of winter grain crops in the fall of last year. Farms in Smolensk, Perm, and Sverdlovsk Oblasts and Bashkortostan have 56-65 percent of the needed quantities of seed potatoes; in Vladimir, Moscow, and Lipetsk Oblasts--71-75 percent. Preparation of machinery for spring field work is proceeding at a slower pace that past years. By the beginning of this February one-fourth of tractors and trucks and approximately one-third of plows, cultivators, and seeders were in need of repair. Operational as % of total pool 1992 1993 1994 Tractors--total 84 80 75 Trucks 80 78 75 Plows 81 76 70 Seeders 79 73 66 Cultivators 80 74 69 The highest proportional share of tractors and trucks, soil-tilling equipment, and seeders in need of repairs was reported at agricultural enterprises in Arkhangelsk, Pskov, Ivanovo, Kaluga, Ryazan, Nizhniy Novgorod, Kurgan, Perm, and Amur Oblasts. In January of this year agricultural petroleum products storage facilities received one-third less diesel fuel and gasoline than January last year. Stocks of petroleum products as of 1 February were considerably below last year's level. On hand as of 1 February, thousand tonnes 1992 1993 1994 1994 as % of 1993 Diesel duel 1,349 809 420 52 Gasoline 385 376 231 61 Farms in Vologda, Novgorod, Vladimir, Kirov, Tambov, Ulyanovsk, Chelyabinsk, and Kemerovo Oblasts had on hand only 20-40 percent of last year's quantities of diesel fuel and gasoline. The State of Animal Husbandry In January of this year at all categories of farms, including the population's plots and private farms, sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter dropped by 13 percent as compared to the same period of last year, milk yields--by 9 percent, and egg production--by 6 percent. At agricultural enterprises, which account for the production of 60-70 percent of all animal husbandry output, production volumes in January were as follows: January 1993 1994 1994 as % of 1993 Livestock and 511 415 81 poultry sold for slaughter in live weight, thousand tonnes Gross milk yield, 1,759 1,510 86 thousand tonnes Milk yield per cow, 136 126 93 kg Hen eggs produced, 2.5 2.3 94 million units Average yield of 19 18 95 eggs per laying hen, units The output of animal husbandry products at agricultural enterprises declined practically everywhere. As compared to last January, sales of livestock and poultry for slaughter declined in 62 territories of Russia; gross milk yield--in all territories with the exception of Krasnoyarsk Kray and Yevreyskaya Autonomous Oblast; and egg production--in 56 regions. The most significant decline in the production of meat, milk, and eggs took place at agricultural enterprises in Kursk, Tambov, Rostov, and Omsk Oblasts and Stavropol Kray. The production decline in most territories was caused mainly by reductions in the herd of livestock and poultry. By the beginning of February the herd of horned cattle at agricultural enterprises had decreased by 10 percent as compared to the corresponding date of last year; cows--by 7 percent, swine--by 13 percent, and sheep and goats--by 22 percent. The greatest reductions in the herd of main categories of livestock occurred at farms in Kursk, Volgograd, Samara, Saratov, Rostov, Tomsk, Tyumen, and Kaliningrad Oblasts and Stavropol Kray. The decline in the size of herd at agricultural enterprises is only partially offset by an increase in the number of animals on the population's personal plots. City and Local Transportation Services for the Population In January 1994 in almost one-quarter of the republic's capital cities and kray and oblast centers of the Russian Federation more than 15 percent of the planned trips by city ground passenger transportation were not made. The figures for individual cities where public transportation operations were most irregular are presented below: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Scheduled trips not made by urban transportation | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |thousands |(%) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cities where 30% or more of scheduled trips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Groznyy |33.5 |55 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk |8.8 |32 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tver |44.2 |31 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Astrakhan |28.5 |31 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cities where 20% to 30% of scheduled trips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladikavkaz |32.2 |27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Smolensk |27.1 |27 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Moscow |849.3 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Krasnoyarsk |72.0 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Orenburg |53.3 |24 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Khabarovsk |26.0 |22 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tula |55.9 |21 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kaluga |29.9 |20 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cities where 15% to 20% of scheduled trips were not made | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cheboksary |28.7 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Kaliningrad |17.2 |16 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Lipetsk |28.1 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Vladivostok |21.0 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Nalchik |12.8 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Elista |5.5 |15 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The most unsatisfactory was suburban bus service in the following cities: Groznyy (50 percent, or 1,500, scheduled runs not performed); Makhachkala (48 percent, 2,100); Astrakhan (25 percent, 1,400); Orenburg (23 percent, 3,700); Novosibirsk (21 percent, 3,400); Rostov-na-Donu (18 percent, 2,900); and Volgograd (18 percent, 2,500). During January of this year 1,300 runs on local commuter electric trains (34 percent of the scheduled number) were canceled in Volgograd; in St. Petersburg--100 (1 percent); Moscow--74 (0.2 percent); Krasnoyarsk--32 (2 percent); Kursk--28 (5 percent); and Tver--8 (1 percent). Exchange Trading As of the beginning of 1994, 180 commodity, commodity and stock, and stock exchanges were operating in Russia. Over the past year their number decreased by almost one-third. Most exchanges that ceased operations were in Moscow, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Samara, and Saratov Oblasts, and Maritime Kray. Exchange closings are mostly the result of their conversion into trading houses, liquidation of economically weak exchanges, and loss of buyers because of high prices for products and goods. Over the elapsed year exchange activities were characterized by the following data: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1993 |1993 as % of 1992 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Trading sessions conduct-|16.3 |81 | |ed, thousands | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Deals concluded, thousan-|400.5 |2 times | |ds | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Exchange turnover in cur-|1,634 |4.7 times | |rent prices, billion rub-| | | |les | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |including: | | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |consumer goods |215.5 |2.0 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |as % of total turnover |13 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |producer goods |695.5 |3.1 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |as % of total turnover |42 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |monetary resources |234.6 |41 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |as % of total turnover |14 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |securities |482.1 |80 times | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |as % of total turnover |30 | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The bulk of exchange activities is concentrated at 40 exchanges (13 of which are in Moscow), which account for 87 percent of all turnover. Typically they hold trading sessions regularly; their volume of sales is on the increase; and they deal in futures contracts that guarantee delivery of a product at a certain time. The proportional share of operations in buying and selling futures contracts amounted to 9 percent of the 1993 turnover as compared to 1 percent at the beginning of the same year. In December 1993 four exchanges (Moscow commodity, Russian commodity and raw materials, Russian grain commodities, and Murmansk commodity and raw materials) began selling agricultural products received from the United States as humanitarian aid. Over this month they sold 510,000 tonnes of wheat, 210,000 tonnes of corn, 85,000 tonnes of rice, 4,500 tonnes of pork, and 1,600 tonnes of chicken legs. Average exchange prices were considerably lower than domestic producers' prices: the price of pork was R700-800 per kg, chicken legs--R1,000, wheat--R27-32, corn--R25, and rice--R75 per kg. The structure of exchange turnover has changed. Over the elapsed year the share of sales of securities and monetary resources increased by 41 percentage points, while that of consumer goods and producer goods declined, respectively, by 18 and 23 percentage points. The volume of output sold through exchanges remains insignificant in the total production and amounts to about 2 percent; with respect to individual items it fluctuates in the range of between 0.05 percent and 6 percent. Many enterprises and organizations in the environment of poor solvency and high exchange prices prefer to purchase products direct or through barter. In particular, in 1993 direct sales of automotive gasoline were 5.5 times greater than those through exchanges, and of diesel fuel--18 times greater.
