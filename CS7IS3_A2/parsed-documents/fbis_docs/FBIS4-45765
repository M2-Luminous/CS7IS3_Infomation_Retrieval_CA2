Bolivia The Bolivian Forum on Environment and Development, Fobomade, charged that the indiscriminate cutting of trees such as the mara, oak, and other species makes them increasingly close to extinction in the Terevinto and Ayacucho cantons, adjacent to Amboro National Park, Santa Cruz Department. Fobomade Secretary General Loida Rodriguez said this situation is reflected in the increasing transportation of trees to various markets. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 14 May 94 p 6) Alternative Development Under Secretary Raul Enrique Ugalde Castro stated that the Chapare region could disappear in 10 years because of deforestation and pollution, and that "urgent measures must be adopted to avoid this disaster." He said the "worrisome" exploitation of forests has reached an "alarmingly" irrational level. He noted that another "serious" problem is the pollution of rivers and the area as a whole. He said: "Coca maceration pits have contaminated everything," and that a study shows that 50 percent of the fish in Chapare are no longer fertile. (La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 18 May 94 p 1) Paraguayan Ambassador to Bolivia Julia Velilla agreed that the Pilcomayo River is becoming a sewer due to the mineral waste spilled into it from dozens of mines. (La Paz Radio Fides in Spanish 1100 GMT 24 May 94) Brazil On 15 May, 2.5 million of liters of oil spilled from a pipeline linking the Almirante Barroso terminal with the Presidente Bernardes refinery in Cubatao. The oil already has affected the Parequecaba, Guaica, Cigarra beaches in Sao Sebastiao and the Clube and Saco da Capela beaches in Santos, Sao Paulo State. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340 GMT 19 May 94) Approximately 10 metric tons of oil spilled from a truck owned by the Transomega Transportadora company that was parked in the company compound in Santos' Estuario neighborhood. The oil leaked into Channel 5 through rainwater pipes. Efforts are being made to prevent it from reaching the beaches. (Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2340 GMT 19 May 94) Air pollution has doubled in Sao Jose dos Campos. Lycia Maria Moreira Nordemann, National Institute of Space Research expert, reported that 85 micrograms per cubic meter of particles were detected in the air in 1993 compared with 1992 when it was 42 micrograms. She said that on 9-13 August 1993 the average air pollution was 190 micrograms per cubic meter. She added that only 25 percent of the air pollution is caused by local industry, and 75 percent by other regions of Sao Paulo. She noted that rainwater is registering very high acidity levels.
