ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) [42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(3)] directs the Administrator of ATSDR to prepare toxicological profiles of priority hazardous substances and to revise and republish each toxicological profile as necessary. This notice announces the availability of 8 updated drafts and 2 new draft toxicological profiles prepared by ATSDR for review and comment. DATES: To ensure consideration, comments on these draft toxicological profiles must be received on or before February 21, 1995. Comments received after the close of the public comment period will be considered at the discretion of ATSDR based upon what is deemed to be in the best interest of the general public. ADDRESSES: Requests for copies of the draft toxicological profiles or comments regarding the draft toxicological profiles should be sent to the attention of Ms. Kim Fears, Division of Toxicology, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Mailstop E&hyph;29, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333. Requests for the draft toxicological profiles must be in writing. Please specify the profiled hazardous substance(s) you wish to receive. ATSDR reserves the right to provide only one copy of each profile requested, free of charge. In case of extended distribution delays, requestors will be notified. Written comments and other data submitted in response to this notice and the draft toxicological profiles should bear the docket control number ATSDR&hyph;88. Send one copy of all comments and three copies of all supporting documents to the Division of Toxicology at the above address by the end of the comment period. All written comments and draft profiles will be available for public inspection at the ATSDR, Building 4, Executive Park Drive, Atlanta, Georgia (not a mailing address), from 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except for legal holidays.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Kim Fears, Division of Toxicology, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, Mailstop E&hyph;29, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30333, telephone (404) 639&hyph;6304. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (SARA) (Pub. L. 99&hyph;499) amends the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.) by establishing certain responsibilities for the ATSDR and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with regard to hazardous substances which are most commonly found at facilities on the CERCLA National Priorities List (NPL). Among these statutory provisions is that the Administrator of ATSDR prepare toxicological profiles for substances included on the priority lists of hazardous substances. These lists identified the 275 hazardous substances which both Agencies determined pose the most significant potential threat to human health. The availability of the revised priority list of 275 hazardous substances was announced in the Federal Register on February 28, 1994 (59 FR 9486). For prior versions of the list of substances see Federal Register notices dated April 17, 1987 (52 FR 12866); October 20, 1988 (53 FR 41280); October 26, 1989 (54 FR 43619); October 17, 1990 (55 FR 42067); October 17, 1991 (56 FR 52166); and October 28, 1992 (57 FR 48801). CERCLA also requires ATSDR to assure the initiation of a research program to fill data needs associated with the substances. Section 104(i)(3) of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9604(i)(3)) outlines the content of these profiles. Each profile is required to include an examination, summary and interpretation of available toxicological information and epidemiologic evaluations. This information and data are to be used to ascertain the levels of significant human exposure for the substance and the associated health effects. The profiles must also include a determination of whether adequate information on the health effects of each substance is available or in the process of development. When adequate information is not available, ATSDR, in cooperation with the National Toxicology Program (NTP), is required to assure the initiation of a program of research designed to determine these health effects. Although key studies for each of the substances were considered during the profile development process, this Federal Register notice seeks to solicit any additional studies, particularly unpublished data and ongoing studies, which will be evaluated for possible addition to the profiles now or in the future.
