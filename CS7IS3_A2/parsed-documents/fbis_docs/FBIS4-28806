Hwang Chang-yop, the Korean Worker's Party's secretary in charge of international affairs, told the visiting delegation of SDPJ legislators in Pyongyang that "North Korea will not have nuclear bombs" and has neither the technology nor funds for such a purpose. SDPJ officials in Tokyo said the legislators headed by House of Representatives member Kazo Watanabe held talks with North Korean officials in Pyongyang on Monday. Watanabe reportedly conveyed a message from Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to the effect that resolution of the nuclear row through dialogue will help improve relations between Japan and North Korea. The two countries have no diplomatic relations. Hwang's remarks echo comments by North Korean President Kim Il-song in the fall of 1990 to a joint delegation of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and SDPJ members. The SDPJ delegation entered the North Korean capital via Beijing on Saturday and held talks with ruling party officials, including Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the reunification policy committee, over the nuclear problems and bilateral issues. The delegation is returning home Tuesday by way of Beijing. The SDPJ, Japan's second largest opposition party, has traditionally maintained close relations with North Korea, which is suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons development program.
