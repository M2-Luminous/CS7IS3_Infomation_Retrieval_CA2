Of Bolivia's population of 6.4 million, 70 percent are of Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani descent, in addition to some 20 Amazon tribes. Most of them live in poverty or in extreme poverty. In 1993, international organizations considered that Bolivian peasants were the planet's poorest people. "I lament the fact that in Mexico they decided to take up arms, but in Bolivia there will be no such movements because the demands from those sectors are being met, despite the fact that for many years they had been sidelined," the vice president said. Cardenas added that "the exclusion of indigenous peoples is being overcome in Bolivia within the framework of the democratic system," noting that the government has taken major steps "to tackle indigenous people's problems," though he admitted that such steps "are not enough -- but it is important to begin, in order to find answers within the next few years." The government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has announced that as of this year it will implement the "people's participation" program, which will be based on traditional institutions: the "ayllu" (indigenous community) and the "ayni" (mutual cooperative work, "today for you, tomorrow for me") in the areas of education and health. The vice president emphasized that the work by the government "will leave them with no justification for violent action," adding that Bolivian democracy will also contribute to "avoiding the creation of radical indigenous movements." Some movements of apparent indigenous origin have appeared in Bolivia over the past eight years, movements that have tried to vindicate -- through terrorism and attacks -- objectives such as social justice for indigenous people, but they were not supported by the people and were dismantled by the security organs of the state.
