FR940105-2-00057 FR940105-2-00021 III It is further ordered: A. That respondents shall jointly and severally pay to the FTC as consumer redress the sum of five hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000); provided however, that this liability will be suspended, subject to the provisions of subparts B and D below, upon the payment of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) no later than fifteen (15) days after the date of service of this Order. Such payment shall be made by cashier's check or certified check payable to the Federal Trade Commission and shall be delivered to the Federal Trade Commission, San Francisco Regional Office, 901 Market Street, suite 570, San Francisco, CA 94103. B. That, in the event of respondents' default on the $25,000 payment set forth in subpart A above, the amount of five hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made pursuant to subpart A above, shall become immediately due and payable without any notice required to be given to the respondents, and interest computed at the rate prescribed under 28 U.S.C. 1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. C. That any funds paid by respondents pursuant to subparts A and B above shall be paid into a redress fund administered by the Federal Trade Commission and shall be used to provide direct redress to those purchasers of respondents' introductory kits (as described in the complaint) who have not previously been reimbursed by respondents for the cost of the kit through a refund or through the purchase of finished product. If the Federal Trade Commission determines, in its sole discretion, that the redress to purchasers (as defined above) is wholly or partially impracticable, any funds not so used shall be paid to the United States Treasury. Respondents shall be notified as to how the funds are disbursed, but shall have no right to contest the manner of distribution chosen by the Commission. No portion of the payment as herein described shall be deemed a payment of any fine, penalty, or punitive assessment. D. That the Commission's acceptance of this Order is expressly premised upon the financial statements and related documents previously provided by respondents to the FTC, signed and dated July 27, 1992. After service upon respondents of an order to show cause, the FTC may reopen this proceeding to make a determination whether there are any material misrepresentations or omissions in said financial statements and related documents. Respondents shall be given an opportunity to present evidence on this issue. If, upon consideration of respondents' evidence and other information before it, the FTC determines that there are any material misrepresentations or omissions in the financial statements and related documents, that determination shall cause the entire amount of monetary liability of five hundred and thirty-six thousand dollars ($536,000), less the sum of any payments made under subpart A above, to become immediately due and payable to the Federal Trade Commission, and interest computed at the rate prescribed in 28 U.S.C. 1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the unpaid balance. Proceedings initiated under Part III are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other civil or criminal remedies as may be provided by law, including any proceedings the Federal Trade Commission may initiate to enforce this Order. IV It is further ordered that , The individual respondents shall promptly notify the Commission of the discontinuance of their present business or employment and, for a period of five (5) years after the date of service of this order, shall promptly notify the Commission of each affiliation with a new business or employment. V It is further ordered that , Respondents shall, within sixty (60) days after service of this Order on them, and on the first through the fifth anniversaries of the effective date of this order, file with the Commission a report in writing, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which it has complied with this Order.
