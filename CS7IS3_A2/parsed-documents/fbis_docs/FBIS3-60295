Even in view of this, the Russian "Chernobylers" are in no hurry to abandon the contaminated zone. Cottages that have been constructed for them lie empty. The day following the explosion in the Belarusian Chernobyl, a red cloud hung over the skies of Baturovka in Bryansk Oblast. A day later, many people experienced nosebleeds. Baturovka fell within the radioactive contamination zone, the intensity of which presupposed mandatory resettlement of people out of these territories... To this day people in the zone have been trying to live the way they did prior to 1986, as if the Chernobyl events had not put an end to the previously established order of affairs. Farms continue to turn over meat, milk, potatoes, and other agricultural output to the state. Krasnogorskiy Rayon, for example, is expected to deliver 500 tonnes of meat and 520 tonnes of milk this year. Potatoes are sold at the price of R18 per kilogram, which does not fully compensate for expenses. Vasiliy Khandoshko, chairman of Baturovka Sovkhoz, proposed that I act as intermediary between the sovkhoz and Moscow in selling potatoes at R50 per kilogram. However, I refused... They do not like instigators in Baturovka. They believe all the problems stem from them. They are therefore very suspicions of someone new in the area. The words "moving" and "cows" are forbidden topics here. When cows are reluctantly discussed, it is with the challenge: "No matter what Chernobyl horrors you want to talk about, I will be lost without my livelihood." Milk for human consumption in the zone is an extremely dangerous item. Immediately following the accident, a ban was placed on putting livestock out to pasture. Then they had the cattle compulsorily moved out of sight and slaughtered. Local residents reconciled themselves to the loss so long as "clean" products were being delivered to the sovkhoz. Soon, however, the deliveries of milk, cheese, and butter ceased. Baturovka residents then ignored the ban and again brought in livestock. For the older people, it is an extremely bitter pill to abandon their native land, in which their ancestors lie and to which they themselves have become so attached. Some are unable to endure the ordeal of moving and pass away a year or two after arriving at a new location. Many return. It is not only the old people who return. Five families returned to their sovkhoz from Zhukovskiy Rayon. Machine operators and vehicle drivers, they were never able to find work--only boiler operators and odd-jobs workers were needed in the new location. And even here the money was not good and the jobs called for "unskilled laborers." In addition, the new settlements in question do not yet have schools, kindergartens, or stores. Three young families forced to leave Kyrgyzstan settled recently in Baturovka. For about six months, Olga Zavtonova's husband searched all over Russia for a place that could provide housing and an opportunity to begin working. The housing situation proved so difficult in the Russian interior that the Zavtonovs decided to resettle here with their children--where they were immediately provided a brick house. But Olga worries all the same: How dangerous is it to live in Baturovka? Nor does Vladimir Ushakov properly know the degree of danger present. Born and raised in Baturovka, Ushakov was 17 years old when the accident occurred. He served his time in the Army, returned to the village, became a driver, and got married. A year and a half ago, a child was born to the family. In Vladimir's words, doctors are constantly checking the family for "accumulation of radionuclides" in their bodies. Figures are cited during every visit. But what exactly do these figures mean? Then again, the Ushakovs do not have any particular need to decipher them--they are better off just being quiet about things... P.S. In Moscow I looked up Dmitriy Chuksin, deputy head of the Department for Environmental Monitoring and Land Rehabilitation of the Russian Federation State Committee on Chernobyl, and asked him to comment on the situation in Bryansk Oblast. Chuksin initially proposed that the committee be paid a fee for information he provided (which, as I immediately guessed, would be directed towards implementation of the program for eliminating the aftereffects of the accident). But in my private conversation with him, Mr. Chuksin told me that a draft new concept for residing in the region had been drawn up by the committee. It was their position, he stated, that living on the lands subject to the influence of radiation (except for the most dangerous zones--the exclusion and resettlement zones), including Krasnogorskiy Rayon, where this correspondent was at the time, "entailed risk, but was possible." Russian Academy of Sciences Professor Irina Pelevina, a radiobiologist in charge of the laboratory for research in the long-range consequences of the influence of radiation of the Chemical Physics Institute, provided her commentary on this subject: "My own point of view often diverges from the position of representatives of the State Committee on Chernobyl and that of the Bryansk Oblast Administration, as well as from the opinion of certain Russian scientists who declare the possibility of residing 'safely' in territories suffering the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant." "Human life in these regions is linked with constant exposure to radiation in small doses over the course of a long period of time. This situation is fraught with long-range effects (an example of which is the appearance of malignant tumors). The 'risk of emergence of long-range consequences' increases as the irradiation dosage increases. But there is also a risk associated with long-term exposure to small doses. In this regard, such consequences may take quite some time before becoming manifest--hence use of the word 'long-range'! For example, leukoses usually appear after a maximum period of eight to 10 years, tumors of all varieties--after 20-40 years." "If we take the point of view that a 'risk of long-range consequences' exists in inhabited regions, even with respect to a small number of people, then it is simply criminal under such conditions to refer to safe living."
