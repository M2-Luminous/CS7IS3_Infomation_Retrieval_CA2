Beside some modified dated types of arms, some very modern arms have been arriving on this battlefield recently. At the end of January, a convoy consisting of eight trailers sent from Russia crossed onto Bosnia-Herzegovina territory near Raca, carrying arms for the needs of the aggressor's Chetnik army. The trailers contained Elipton bombs -- most likely the arms that Zhirinovskiy referred to during his visit to the so-called Serbian Republic, alleging that this was the new secret weapon of great destructive power -- a surface-to-air missile of unknown type, and antiaircraft guns of Russian manufacture. When the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina started in April 1992, the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army disposed of three missile surface-to-air systems, namely: SA-2 [Guideline], SA-3 [GOA], and SA-6 [Gainful]. We have received confirmation from several sources that the aggressor has strengthened its antiaircraft defense over Bosnia-Herzegovina considerably and introduced missile systems that not even the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army had before the war. All these systems are of Russian manufacture, namely: SA-8 [Gecko], SA-9 [Gaskin], and SA-14 [NATO code name not known]. The SA-13 (Gopher] and SA-11 [Gadfly] also form part of the aggressor's antiaircraft defense. These systems are supported from the territory of the so-called Yugoslavia by SA-12 [Gladiator] missiles. A new missile antiaircraft system has appeared on Mount Bjelasnica and Mount Igman last year that was not identified. The presence of a giant (Cumen) 240-mm caliber mortar, whose bombs weight 130 kg, has been observed at several places throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina battlefield. The (Cumen) fires destructive chemical and nuclear bombs, which means that it does not use classic mortar grenades. Its barrel is 5.5 m long and its range is 9.5 kilometers. The giant weapon weighs 4 tonnes. This mortar was also spotted in positions around Sarajevo. Bearing in mind the number of destroyed tanks on this battlefield and the number of tanks held by the army of the so-called Serbian Republic, it is evident that their hardware is regularly replenished. Tanks that had earlier not even formed part of the armament of the former Yugoslav Peoples' Army, for example, T-72 tanks, have appeared on this battlefield on several occasions. These tanks, which carried the colors, the markings, and the numbers of the Russian Army have also taken part in some of the battles, the press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports. Together with these arms, large contingents of men have been arriving who are servicing them and training members of the Chetnik artillery units. It is also well known that contingents of fully armed and equipped mercenaries are arriving on the territory of the so-called Serbian Republic at regular intervals. They are not stopped on the Russian border, nor are their equipment and arms seized, the press center of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army reports.
