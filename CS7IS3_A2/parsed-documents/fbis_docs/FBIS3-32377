According to PRD presidential candidate Ernesto Perez Balladares, this alliance will be the great coalition against hunger, unemployment, and mismanagement. Balladares stated: "I believe the great alliance will be one against hunger, unemployment, neglect, and government inefficiency, and the alliance is already formed." At a meeting of the National Directorate, some 296 PRD members approved their party's alliance with Pala and the Liberal Party and confirmed their support for the presidential ticket headed by Perez Balladares with Tomas Gabriel Altamirano Duque and Felipe Virzi as first and second vice presidents, respectively. Perez Balladares criticized Arnulfist Party candidate Mireya de Gruber's and former comptroller general Ruben Dario Carles' programs. Carles is supported by the Civic Renewal Party, Molirena [Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement], and the National Renewal Movement [Morena]. Balladares argued the two tickets reflect "the official state of affairs and contain the same proposals but in different packages." Perez Balladares, who did not reject the possibility of other nonofficial groups joining his alliance before 8 February, said: "It is not a matter of sharing the cake, but of sharing an idea, a program. It is a matter of reaching an agreement as to the basis for a program." Perez Balladares criticized candidates such as Carles, de Gruber, and Arias Calderon, who "live in and cling to the past" and who "will blatantly fail in 1994" when the problems and situations have changed. The PRD's directorate reiterated its support for mayoral, legislator, and alternate-legislator candidates nominated by its new allies. Meanwhile, Pala, which also held its political convention yesterday, restated its decision to form an alliance with the PRD and the Liberal Republican Party, and nominated the Perez Balladares-Altamirano-Virzi presidential ticket. Pala President Carlos Lopez Guevara pointed out that although Pala is not represented on the presidential ticket, all the members support a "Torrijist alliance" to reach power together next May. At its convention yesterday, the Republican Liberal Party unanimously supported the alliance and presidential ticket led by Perez Balladares.
