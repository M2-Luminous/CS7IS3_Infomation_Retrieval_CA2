FBIS4-64644 "drweu087_i_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-087 Daily Report 4 May 1994 FRANCE Juppe Demands Release of Aid Workers Juppe Demands Release of Aid Workers AU0405161994 Paris AFP in English 1551 GMT 4 May 94 AU0405161994 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Paris, May 4 (AFP) -- Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Wednesday [4 May] rejected any question of striking a deal for the release of 11 French aid workers detained by Serbs in Bosnia for allegedly smuggling arms to Moslem forces. Juppe said there was "no question of engaging in bargaining of any kind" over the workers for the relief agency Premiere Urgence (First Emergency) and he demanded their "immediate and unconditional release." The workers were imprisoned in a Serb barracks at Lukavica, a suburb of Sarajevo, on April 8 after their aid convoy was intercepted and Serb troops allegedly found weapons in one of the trucks. The 11 were accused of trafficking arms to the Moslem-led Bosnian government army and on Monday, three were indicted for arms trafficking. Premiere Urgence said Tuesday that the three were to appear before a Bosnian Serb tribunal on May 8 and could face the death penalty or up to 20 years imprisonment. The organization said the weapons were planted on the truck by the Serbs themselves. Juppe, speaking to the National Assembly, said he had had confirmed rumours of what he called a "pseudo-trial by Bosnian Serb forces who are completely out of control. If this is the case, we will not accept this parody of justice," he said. The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers for 11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems. Juppe said he would be seeking the support of other Western leaders, and in particular of Russia via its Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, with whom he discussed the case last week. Juppe was due to meet the head of Premiere Urgence, Thierry Mauricet, later Wednesday. Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers and observers from Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights to the trial, in the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale.
