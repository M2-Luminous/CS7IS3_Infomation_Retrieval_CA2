An agreement signed at the Lithuanian Meskuiciai air force base confirms the intent to set up a joint air space control system. Representatives of the Baltic states note technical and financial advantages of such integration and the intention to join corresponding NATO structures. It will probably take 5 to 10 years to create a joint Baltic air space control system. The Baltic representatives also decided to set up a joint training center for air force pilots in Lithuania. Estonian air force pilots took their first training flights on Lithuanian planes at Meskuiciai base today. Lithuania's air force, with four L-39 jet training fighters of Czech production, two transport L-410 planes donated by Germany, and several dozen AN-2 planes and helicopters, is the strongest among the Baltic states and the most experienced. Two of the four Lithuanian jet planes and one helicopter will demonstrate their combat skill on Saturday [28 May] on a military airfield near Riga during celebrations devoted to the 75th anniversary of the Latvian air force.
