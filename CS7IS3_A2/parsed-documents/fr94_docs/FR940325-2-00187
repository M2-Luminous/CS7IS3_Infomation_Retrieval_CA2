FR940325-2-00187 FR940325-2-00089 The Commission finds that the proposed rule change to extend the hedge exemption pilot program is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(6) thereunder. 6 Specifically, the Commission concludes, as it did when originally approving the hedge exemption pilot program that providing for increased position and exercise limits for equity options in circumstances where those excess positions are fully hedged with offsetting stock positions will provide greater depth and liquidity to the market and allow investors to hedge their stock portfolios more effectively, without significantly increasing concerns regarding intermarket manipulations or disruptions of either the options market or the underlying stock market. 6 Id . In addition, with respect to the NASD's proposal to expand the types of securities eligible to serve as the basis for the underlying hedge position to include convertible securities and securities economically equivalent to the stock underlying the corresponding hedging options position, the Commission continues to believes, as it did in approving similar proposals by the options exchanges, 7 that such expansion is consistent with the Act because it will allow investors to use instruments that are economically equivalent to stocks more efficiently and effectively for purposes of hedging their equity options positions. 8 Specifically, the Commission concurs with the NASD's belief that because the value of a convertible security or a security economically equivalent to the stock underlying a corresponding hedging options position likely will fluctuate in tandem with the value of the security that it is convertible into or economically equivalent to, investors with positions in such securities should be able to hedge their positions in equity options with those securities to the same extent that investors with long or short positions in the underlying securities can. Moreover, as with the original hedge exemption pilot program, 9 the Commission believes the expansion of the pilot program in this manner likely will enhance the depth and liquidity in the options markets. In addition, because the hedge exemption pilot program still requires the positions in the securities and the corresponding options to be fully hedged, the Commission believes the expansion will not significantly increase concerns regarding intermarket manipulation or disruption of either the options markets or the underlying stock market. 7 See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32904 (September 14, 1993), 58 FR 49339. 8 See supra note 4. 9 See supra note 1. With respect to the proposed example to be added to section 3 of the Rules, the Commission believes the example may serve to avoid investor confusion concerning the hedge exemption pilot program. The Commission also notes that before the hedge exemption pilot program can be approved on a permanent basis, the NASD Must provide the Commission with a report on the operation of the pilot program. Specifically, the NASD must provide the Commission with details on (1) the frequency with which the exemptions have been used; (2) the types of investors using the exemptions; (3) the size of the positions established pursuant to the hedge exemption pilot program; (4) what types of convertible or economically equivalent securities are being used to hedge positions and how frequently such securities have been used to hedge; (5) whether the NASD has received any complaints on the operation of the hedge exemption pilot program; (6) whether the NASD has taken any disciplinary action against, or commenced any investigations, examinations, or inquiries concerning, any of its members for any violation of any term or condition of the hedge exemption pilot program; (7) the market impact, if any, of the hedge exemption pilot program; and (8) how the NASD has implemented surveillance procedures to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the hedge exemption pilot program. In addition, the Commission expects the NASD to inform the Commission of the results of any surveillance investigations undertaken for apparent violations of the provisions of the hedge exemption pilot program.
