Sergeyev, Commander of the Volga Military District, by Oleg Bedula, date and place not given, under the general heading "The Army and Society" and the rubric "Draft 93-94": "If You Haven't Served in the Army You Are Not Fit to Get Married" -- first paragraph is introduction] [Text] Over 100,000 young men will be sent to Russian Armed Forces military districts and fleets from the Volga and Urals region during the present draft. Our correspondent asked Colonel-General A. Sergeyev, commander of the Volga Military District, to describe how the draft is going. [Bedula] Anatoliy Ipatovich, your speech at the end of the year to the scientific and practical conference at the assembly of leading Russian Defense Ministry personnel had a great impact. Specifically, the statement that Volga Military District commissariats in conjunction with Internal Affairs Ministry and Prosecutor's Office structural subdivisions are taking additional measures to ensure that all deserters, "draft dodgers," and "refuseniks" are brought into line. Is the draft situation really worse than six months ago? [Sergeyev] That is a realistic assessment of the actual situation at a specific moment. I am convinced that draft problems can be resolved more effectively if the local authorities and law and order bodies work in constant and close cooperation with the military commissariats. It is precisely in those republics and oblasts where the internal affairs organs and prosecutor's office have been paying less attention to the draft that there is a "shortfall." Specifically, I am talking about Tatarstan, the Komi Republic, and Samara and Kirov Oblasts. [Bedula] I recall how two years ago you invited leaders of the representative and executive bodies in all the Volga and Urals region republics and oblasts to an enlarged Military Council. Judging by the officials' speeches, close cooperation and collaboration were established at that time on all questions affecting day-to-day Army activity in the territories. [Sergeyev] It is not all straightforward here. The majority of leaders have kept their word, we have established good working contacts with them, and we have mutual understanding and mutual assistance. It is a different matter that in some republics public movements which take a negative view of military service as a whole have gained in strength. When these anti-Army feelings are expressed in legal form by local authority decision, you have the beginnings of overt or covert resistance to federal laws. For example, the Tatarstan parliament recently "amended" a Russian presidential edict by adopting a decree "On the Performance of Military Service by Citizens of the Republic of Tatarstan." According to this document young men studying in daytime study departments of elementary and secondary general education institutions and students who have not completed their studies cannot be drafted into military service. Likewise, young men whose immediate relatives have died or been disabled during military service are also exempt from military service. As a result, we cannot call up close to 9,000 potential draftees. It seems to bother no one in the republic that the parliament's decree contravenes not only a separate provision of the Constitution and the laws of Tatarstan itself but also the federal law which says that defense questions are delegated by the republics to the center. [Bedula] Incidentally, neighboring Bashkortostan, whose population is close to that of Tatarstan in ethnic composition, outlook, and way of life, takes a completely different view of military service. Why is that? [Sergeyev] Yes, Bashkortostan has virtually always fulfilled the General Staff's order 100 percent. But the whole point, it seems, is that on the state, social, and family levels Army service is regarded there as a form of schooling which a physically fit young man has no moral right to shirk. Furthermore, in the countryside a girl's parents still question whether they should let their daughter marry someone who has not done military service. The current draft is also proceeding well in Bashkortostan. The republic's government has allocated the necessary money -- 500 million rubles [R]. All the relevant questions are being resolved promptly and without undue drama. It has been decided that students at technical colleges and vocational and technical schools can complete their studies, take their diplomas, and in January-February we will draft them. We are being actively helped by the Bashkortostan committee for the social protection of servicemen and their families. The committee staged the second congress of parents of soldiers and sailors in an interesting way. The Orthodox cathedral and the main mosque in Ufa held ceremonial services to bless the fatherland's defenders and honor the memory of those who have died discharging their military duty. District representatives and military lawyers answered questions from servicemen, their parents, and the public. The work of the congress was widely covered by the mass media. The committee members' principled approach is shown by the fact that out of 3,214 requests for draft deferral, 451 were rejected as unjustified. Nevertheless, there are "draft dodgers" in Bashkortostan: A total of 389 people failed to attend the draft centers. That number would have been considerably smaller if the Prosecutor's Office had taken a more principled line. The number of citizens charged by the Prosecutor's Office with avoidance of military service is minimal. [Bedula] What is life like generally for a deserter from the moment that he leaves the unit? [Sergeyev] Bad. In Tatarstan, for instance, there were quite a few people who succumbed to All-Tatarstan Public Center propaganda and stole back into the republic to march under national banners. But it turns out that no one was expecting them here. As a result, the "returners" were left to face some serious problems by themselves: There was no possibility of drafting them into a unit on the republic's territory to complete their service here and there was no legal justification for discharging them into the reserve. No one offered them a job. Who needs a man with no documents? Consequently, many went back to their units and made amends... [Bedula] It is no secret that one reason for desertion is the collapse of the system of military-patriotic education which existed in schools, vocational and technical schools, technical colleges, and social organizations. No worthwhile alternative has been found yet. Is it really inevitable that we will squander the considerable potential of young people's preparation for service? [Sergeyev] Much has indeed been lost. But some things have been gained. Recently I learned that in Bashkortostan boys virtually from junior class age dream of serving in the "Mosfilm" Movie Studio's cavalry regiment. Recruits to this unusual military unit traditionally come from draftees from Bashkiria. The current draft is no exception -- 15 young men have already been sent to Golitsyno, near Moscow, where the cavalry regiment is stationed. There is just as much competition for the right to serve on the submarine Komsomolets Bashkirii. Similarly people from Samara and Penza maintain their right to serve in the "president's" regiment. Recently the General Staff received a letter from the Chuvashia leadership requesting that this year young men be drafted to serve on the submarine Chuvashskiy Komsomolets. The Dzerzhinskiy internal troops division is very popular with future draftees from Saratov Oblast. Requests from local authorities and the public to send draftees there are granted whenever possible. When draftees are sent specifically to "their" division, regiment, or category of troops it is not only the Army which gains. Traditions are established in schools, at enterprises, in cities, and in whole republics. Pride will not allow a young man to do service that is inferior to that of his older friends or his neighbors in the apartment block or on his street. Can people fail to be moved by the tradition which has been revived in Orenburg Oblast's Pervomayskiy Rayon: When draftees are being given a send-off, each one receives a small bag containing a handful of his native soil. There has not yet been a single case of desertion by a soldier who has been given such a sacred gift. [Bedula] Nevertheless, increasingly frequently it is being said that this year's draftees are the "wrong sort," that completely different approaches are needed with them because the traditional methods of education are not working.... [Sergeyev] The directorate for work with personnel has studied this problem and come up with some surprising conclusions. The nature of the inner conflicts that draftees are suffering from is due not to national interests, as used to be the case, but to their social status before joining the Army. There are quite a few soldiers in service now who have engaged in no socially useful activity. There is another section consisting of draftees from families with wealthy parents, sometimes commercial traders, and some of the draftees were engaged in trade themselves. A third group -- the most numerous -- comes from the families of workers and peasants. Finally there is a fourth group -- soldiers with less than perfect health but passed as fit by the medical commissions. If we manage to correctly assess the different forms of relationships that develop among soldiers in all four groups and elaborate forms of work with them, we will keep potential "runaways" in military formation. That is why many officers now sit on republic draft commissions. They have a specific task: To study, analyze, and systematize all problems relating to the draft and give specific recommendations on work with young people. Not just to the troops but also to the organs of public education, social organizations, and committees of soldiers' mothers. Of course, the "anti-desertion" campaign will be as productive as possible if all society becomes really interested in it. The forms of work with young people of draft age are most diverse. In Udmurtia, for example, draftees are subject to a fine of one-half the minimum wage the first time that they fail to appear before the military commissariat. The total fine is increased for failure to turn up a second time. With the introduction of financial sanctions the number of "draft dodgers" in the republic fell noticeably. I know that in the Volga region and Urals republics they are studying the question of making deserters repay the cost of the investigation. After all, it costs the Armed Forces between R70,000 and R100,000 to find and bring back one deserter. But given that some Komi Republic enterprise leaders are inciting young men to refuse to serve "for peanuts" by promising them wages of half a million, we will still be tackling the problem of desertion for a long time to come. [Bedula] Anatoliy Ipatovich, reports are coming in from local level about a lack of coordination in the military department's work and mistakes in organizing the draft. [Sergeyev] Indeed, there have been mistakes. The Defense Ministry Central Directorate of Military Transport Communications and the Central Finance Directorate took too long to resolve the question of allocating money for the transport of young draftees to the Far East and the Transbaykal region by civil aircraft. There have been occasions when induction officers from the District fail to arrive to meet new recruits at the prescribed time. But there have been far more instances of a different kind -- of well organized work by commissariats. To assess the situation here in general terms, the present draft has been complex but is proceeding normally. The Army and the Navy will receive a worthy batch of new recruits.
