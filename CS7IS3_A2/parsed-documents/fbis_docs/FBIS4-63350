"Your government, Mr. Kravchuk, has already plundered Ukraine and run down what was a rich land," the LDPR says in a statement received by Interfax on Friday. "Now it is stealing Russian and Turkmen gas and oil transported through your territory." Kravchuk "wishes to sell the Black Sea Fleet (disputed by Russia and Ukraine) for scrap metal, to sell everything that can be sold, in order to flee the devastated country when its people rise and demand reunification with Russia," the party says.
