Arcal is a program that includes 17 Latin American countries, which seek to give their specialists access to state-of- the-art nuclear techniques and enable them to study the use of those techniques in all possible areas regarding the economic and social development of their nations. Here is Daniel Codorniu, vice secretary of the SEAN [Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs], organization responsible for the Cuban nuclear program, with details: [Codorniu] "Arcal is sponsored by the International Organization of Atomic Energy in order to promote cooperation among various Latin American countries for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Cuba has participated in this program since 1987, and in the past years, our participation has increased. During this period, the program has implemented 12 projects, which are mostly related to the issue of applying nuclear techniques to solve social and economic development problems and establishing regulations and procedures to guarantee security [words indistinct]." Cuban technicians and specialists will have an opportunity to exchange views and results in this area during the 11th Arcal Coordination Meeting to be held in Santa Fe de Bogota from 16-20 May. [Codorniu] "During this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota, we will discuss plans for 1995 and 1996 in addition to reviewing the program for the remainder of 1994. We are planning to include some new programs that Cuba has been supporting because they have a strong influence in our development. For instance, we are proposing a new program called induced mutations related with [word indistinct] and technology for improving crops in Latin America. This new program supports the joint use of nuclear and biotechnological methods to produce a better variety of crops." Other events confirm Cuba's advances in nuclear technology. Daniel Codornieu believes the best example is Cuba's acceptance, at the end of 1993, as a full-fledged member of the prestigious American Nuclear Society's Latin American Division. The American Nuclear Society also seeks to coordinate nuclear efforts on the continent. [Codorniu] "This is important because, as you saw [word indistinct], the former program is basically linked with nuclear applications in areas such as agriculture and medicine. Although the Latin American division deals with application concerns, it concentrates on energy problems -- the issue of developing nuclear energy to generate electricity -- and investigations in the area of nuclear energy [word indistinct]. As a result, we are also able to collaborate in the area of nuclear security."
