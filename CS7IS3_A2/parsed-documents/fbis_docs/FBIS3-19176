It is still not known who fired the shot. This is the 19th French soldier killed in former Yugoslavia. Francois Leotard heard the news while in Israel and the defense minister expressed his anger to Pierre Veil: [Begin Leotard recording] As you can understand, my reaction is one of great sadness and anger. France is making sacrifices for peace. The soldiers who are targeted in this cowardly way are soldiers of peace. They are there to accomplish humanitarian missions. They escort food supplies and protect civilian populations. They are Blue Helmets, therefore they are not engaged in a war situation. War is often waged on them in a cowardly way. I express with great vigor my indignation at this kind of behavior. I hope that our mission there is understood despite all the difficulties encountered. Despite these victims, our mission is to bring peace to a war-torn region, which could pose a threat in the future. The French people should be aware of this. [end recording]
