The prime minister went to the TSF radio station to say that a government without an absolute majority would be a mistake and a disaster: [Correspondent] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva arrived in a good mood at the TSF studios for an interview in which he would be willing to talk about everything: [Cavaco Silva] "I got up very late because I went to bed very late last night, therefore I had very little time to think." [Correspondent] Neverthless, he was very well prepared for the debate. For over one hour, he did not hide his wish to have stability when governing the country: [Cavaco Silva] "Portugal does not have conditions at present within Europe if it does not have political and government stability. I think it would be a tremendous mistake for Portugal to return to the time when, in 11 years, we had 16 governments each lasting nine months; I think that would be a disaster." [Correspondent] As far as a possible government reshuffle is concerned, he admitted the future replacement of the minister of agriculture, but rejected the idea of a substantial reshuffle in his cabinet: [Cavaco Silva] "It is not part of my intentions to have substantial, profound cabinet reshuffles before the legislative elections of October 1995." [Correspondent] He went on further to debate the economy: interest rates, the inflation, the escudo, and the opportunity for it to enter the European Monetary System [EMS]. From Cavaco Silva's comments on these topics, we have got two main messages: One is on inflation: [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that Portugal has conditions in 1994 to have the lowest interest rate in the past 23 to 24 years." [Correspondent] The other relates to his decision about the EMS: [Cavaco Silva] "I believe that that decision about the EMS will have been one of the most decisive and important decisions I have taken as prime minister." [Correspondent] He made a reference to the role of the opposition toward the end of the interview and also made a request: [Cavaco Silva] "What I will be asking is for public opinion to exert a certain pressure on the Socialist Party for it to be a little more credible, for it to be a little more honest, a little more sensible, and be little more moderate. Our country needs that, our country needs that."
