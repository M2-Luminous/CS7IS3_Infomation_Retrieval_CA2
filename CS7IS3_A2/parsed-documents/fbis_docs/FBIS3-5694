Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa (JNP representative), who had been entrusted with the selection of the new officials, announced the lineup at a meeting of JNP Diet members of both houses on the morning of the same day and won their approval. Because dissatisfaction with the former executive board has been expressed within the party, claiming that "the party's management and personnel affairs are influenced by the intention of the secretariat," the possibility of changing executives has been studied. The five new executives will soon select members of the standing executive committee, which is a decision-making body second only to the party convention. The new executives are: Kunitaro Takeda, (who will remain as) acting secretary general; Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general; Eiji Nagai and Muneaki Samejima, deputy secretary general; and Hirotaro Yamazaki, chairman of the general committee of Diet members of both houses.
