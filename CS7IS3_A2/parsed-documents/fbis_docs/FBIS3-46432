From 2.9 percent in autumn to the much-awaited whopping ending -- 5.9 percent growth in the fourth quarter. The leap of last year's U.S. economy is a bit like crazy, casting the shadow of recession far and away. But is such a progress sustainable or is it heading toward a nose dive? "The last quarter is often supercharged, with Christmas shopping and everything," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist for PNC Bank Corp. based in Pittsburgh. "This year is a different thing." The Commerce Department reported today that the U.S. gross domestic product, the total goods and services produced in the country, grew by 2.9 percent last year, the biggest climb since 1988. Earlier, it was reported that the country's industrial production was up 4.2 percent last year, the biggest gain since 1988, housing starts and home resales reached four-year and 14-year high respectively, with consumer price gaining the smallest in seven years. President Clinton is taking credit for the economic successes in 1993, especially with his respectable assault on the budget deficit. The deficit is expected to decline by another 40 percent in fiscal 1995. The 20-year low interest rates, the direct result of budget cuts, is becoming a potent tool for pulling the economy out of recession, observers said. But the upturn, as most observers see it, is mostly a product of the normal business cycle. Last year, the strong productivity-enhancing investment was coupled with strong pent-up consumer demands, especially in automobiles and home furnishings. In recent months, retail sales, sales of business equipment, home building, especially the single-family housing starts, and the long- in-the-doldrums merchandise export all turned for the better. But the recovery has skipped some regions, California in particular, and left many workers still without jobs. The newly added jobs are mostly part time and substandard in earnings, observers here said. There are four sectors remaining what economists described as "truly weak": defense production, civilian aircraft making, business spending for commercial real estate, and multi-family housing. Some economists predicted the growth in 1994 will slow down because of the declining bank reserves, a key indicator for trading of bank loans, and consumer spending which they said has been out of line with real consumer income. "There were numerous straws in the wind suggesting that the increase will not be sustainable in 1994," said Erich Herinemann, chief economist of New York-based investment company Ladernburg, Thalman & Co.. "Indeed, there are signs a slowdown may already be underway." Another impediments is the danger of inflation. American Bankers Association (ABA) predicted on Thursday the consumer price index, the most common measure of inflation, will rise from 2.7 percent last year to 3.0 percent in 1994. "While inflation has come down, underlying inflationary pressure cannot be counted out," ABA's economic advisory committee said in its semi-annual report. "Decisive action in the coming months would keep inflation on the ropes." Some private forecasters, meanwhile, are worried about the tax hikes on the rich individuals who are resources for most new investments, and more government regulations in the health care industry. "It's too early to tell how tax hikes will reduce potential economic growth," said Paul Merski, an economist with "citizens for a sound economy" in the nation's capital. "But it will be felt by hundreds of small businesses and their workers," he said.
