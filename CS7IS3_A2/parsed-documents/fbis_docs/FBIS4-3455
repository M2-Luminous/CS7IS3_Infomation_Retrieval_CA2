Mr. Qiu said that judging from the operation of the national economy in the first quarter this year in China, the macro-economic situation in the country showed a "combination of euphoria and worry". Economic growth had nearly dropped to the goal set for macro-control; the economy was operating within an appropriate range; the investment environment had improved to a certain extent; fiscal revenue and spending, credit and foreign exchange income and expenditure had all struck a balance or even showed a surplus; the "bottleneck problem" of energy, raw and finished materials and transportation had been somewhat alleviated; the main consumer goods except for some agricultural products were supplied in an adequate way; the actual income of both urban and rural residents was rising; bank savings deposits were greatly increasing and reform measures of various kinds were being carried out in a comparatively smooth way. According to the economist, outstanding contradictions appearing in the economic operations could not be overlooked. First, prices were continuously growing on the basis of last year's inflation with the highest growth of prices seen in grain, meat, aquatic products, vegetables, clothing and service items, posing an adverse affect on the living of some residents. Second, the difficulties facing the operation of state-owned enterprises have been deteriorating, production growth was dropping sharply with enterprises suffering from the stockpiling of their products, delays in each other's debts and an obvious decline of their economic efficiency. Mr. Qiu held that China was now facing two big problems. If prices are controlled within ten percent and the money supply is still kept tight, this will lead to a gloomy market which will in return result in an overly big drop in economic growth, greater difficulties to state-owned enterprises and the further deterioration of financial difficulties and employment problems. If the money supply is conducted in a more relaxed way, inflation will further worsen. Mr. Qiu believed that at present, on the one hand, control of the overly fast growth of prices cannot be realized through strict control of the money demand, while on the other hand, help to state-owned enterprises cannot be made through putting too much money into them. The central government's macro-control policies should pay much attention to both price stability and economic growth and sustaining appropriate economic growth to sustain the stability of prices in the country. He further pointed out that the country should control inflation by legal and necessary administrative means as well as through tackling market transaction disorder which cultivates the rampant rise of prices and illegal profit-making activities. At the same time, risk funds and reserve system for key materials and commodities and the protection system for low income earners must be established as soon as possible. Mr. Qiu held that provided macro-control and regulation are handled well, the growth of the GDP value in the country will be about ten percent, that of investment in fixed assets by 35 percent to 40 percent and that of retail prices by 16 percent to 18 percent.
