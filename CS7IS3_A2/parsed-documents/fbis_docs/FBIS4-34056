They warned him of the worsening of the resentment in the barracks over low salaries. Military chiefs today leaked official reports passed to the president of the Republic in which they attempt to prove the unfeasibility of the domestic military budget which includes salaries that are considered dramatically low. "The budget does not cover our expenses," said Admiral Arnaldo Leite, chief of the Armed Forces Joint Staff (EMFA). Army Minister General Zenildo Lucena confirmed the concern felt among the military leadership and admitted that a disruption of discipline may occur, although in isolated incidents and within the scope of control of the commanders. Adm. Leite is not as optimistic and considers it risky to attempt to contain the troops' resentment without concrete solutions. During a meeting at the EMFA headquarters today, the four military ministers decided to send President Itamar Franco a draft bill seeking to get Congress to establish a new salary system exclusively for the military. In the report given to President Franco, the military leadership describes the situation as "unbearable." The report contains one worrisome fact, particularly regarding the recessive stage of the Real Plan: "What hurts the military most is that the sacrifice is not being shared equally among all public servants," the report states, adding: "Some employees are much better paid than others." Adm. Leite stressed this serious aspect of the problem, mentioning the impunity with which businessmen commit price abuses, and asked for immediate and concrete measures against them. He said: "What hurts greedy businessmen most is not a prison sentence, but high fines. That way their pockets are affected, like ours." To prove his complaints are well founded, Adm. Leite reported that a squadron admiral, the top post of the Navy career, with 45 years of service, currently earns a gross salary of 2,000 URV's [Real Value Unit] or a net salary of 1,300 URV's. Adm. Leite mentioned his fear of discord among the troops, adding: "If a soldier disobeys the rules we will arrest him, but this is not a solution." Leite believes the solution is a salary that at least allows military personnel to pay their bills, so as to prevent moonlighting -- which is not allowed. The military document warns: "There is a risk of instability in the basic principles of hierarchy and discipline because subordinates blame their chiefs for their low salaries. Since they are prohibited from unionizing or striking, their chiefs -- that is, the Armed Forces Joint Chief of Staff -- must interpret their feelings and fight for the troops' demands." Here is a list of the expenses of a lieutenant colonel graduated from the staff school and with 27 years of seniority, married, with two children, one in college and another one in high school, who is renting a three-room apartment in Grajau District, northern Rio de Janeiro: His gross monthly salary amounts to 1,329 URV's. (All figures are in URV) [1 URV is approximately equal to $1].
