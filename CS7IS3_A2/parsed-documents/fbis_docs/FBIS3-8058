[Jeszenszky] Well, unfortunately, one has to be cautious because there have already been so many agreements in that region in the past which have not been kept. However, I hope that this will be adhered to, for it is of vital importance for both parties. Since this very significant agreement has been concluded after this tragic and bloody war, this indicates a very serious political intention. Another element also has to be emphasized in the agreement: the Croats and Muslims have also agreed that they will not try to create two ethnically pure Croat and Muslim Bosnias. The fact that the communities will have cultural autonomy while the joint affairs of state will be run together is a very good model. [Kovacs] You had talks today with the U.S. defense secretary and secretary of state. Did they ask you about the Hungarian position regarding Yugoslavia? Did they ask for any kind of explanation? [Jeszenszky] No, they did not ask for any explanation and there is no need for that. The Hungarian position was known to them already. I did, however, use the opportunity to illuminate Hungary's special position; that is, our closeness and to a certain extent our vulnerability and the vulnerability of the Hungarians of Vojvodina. Finally, the conclusion was that the United States sees Hungary's special concerns, but it also sees that Hungary has consistently pursued the policies of the past three and a half years. Our policy in the Yugoslav question is quite unequivocal: we support a settlement, we want peace, and this peace should be the fairest possible. [passage omitted] Hungary's foreign policy is balanced; Hungary gives humanitarian aid to Vojvodina but also to the Serbs living there. Hungary accepts Bosnian refugees and Hungary is forming a new friendly relationship with Croatia, reviving traditions going back centuries. We are confirming these with talks also. I visited Belgrade in January and I am planning to visit Zagreb and Sarajevo also in the near future. So Hungary is able to form good relations with every one of the parties -- to varying degrees, naturally -- and this is in accordance with the will and expectations of the international community. [Kovacs] Did you have an opportunity or was there a need to talk about the AWACS planes using Hungary's air space? [Jeszenszky] There were no need for talks about this. We are in continuous contact with NATO and I know what kind of useful information we receive from these planes. The planes' mandates are unchanged. [passage omitted] [Kovacs] The U.S. State Department has carried out its annual analysis of human rights in every country. This analysis also contained critical elements in connection with Hungary. Did you react to these critical elements? Did you discuss this at all? [Jeszenszky] These were not mentioned and this itself indicates that these critical elements are not serious enough to create concern in the Government of the United States. As long as this report is much less critical of Hungary than, let us say, of Great Britain, I am not worried. Having said that, there are certain points in this report which do not correspond entirely to the situation in Hungary, or they are rather one-sided, and we shall respond to these at the appropriate level proving precisely the real situation, so we did not have to discuss this issue at this level.
