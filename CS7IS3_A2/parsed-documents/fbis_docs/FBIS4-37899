The proclamation dissolving parliament at midnight yesterday was gazetted by President D.B. Wijetunga. Nomination for elections to the next parliament have been set for the period from July 4 to 11. Elections will be held on August 16. The new parliament is scheduled to meet on August 25. Addressing the nation today, President D.B. Wijetunga said the decision to dissolve parliament and to hold general elections was made by me after careful consideration. He said he was convinced that morality was an essential requisite for politics, as much as for every other aspect of public life. I also hold, the president said, that a genuine democratic political system of the highest quality is equally essential. He rejected both covert and espousal of immoral and antisocial and violent means to acquire power or remain in power. It is this conviction that encouraged him to unhesitatingly go before the people. President Wijetunga said that his sole determination was to provide leadership through exemplary political conduct so that the secretive and corrupt forces that are today interested in capturing power could be defeated and proper behavior and discipline could be inculcated throughout our social fabric. You will agree with me, the president said, that the policies pursued by my government are the most suited for this purpose and the best guarantee to achieve the success we desire. He recalled that in his address to the nation when he assumed office in May last year, he stated that he could not act as a politician but as a statesman in charge of his duties having the best interest of the people at heart. He said he took over the presidency at a crucial time and was able to bring about a considerable degree of political and social stability before the country. In keeping with the economic and political philosophy of the government, we freed the stranglehold of respective policies and embarked on totalling the new economic program. President Wijetunga explained in detail the policies implemented and the achievements. He referred to the Janasaviya [welfare program] as a major thrust in poverty alleviation. He also recalled the invitation extended to the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] to cease hostilities and discuss a negotiated political settlement and join in the political framework of the country. However, he said that these measures did not bring about concrete results. The government succeeded to a great extent in ridding the Eastern Province of militancy. The fact that elections to local authorities in this province were able to be conducted successfully shows ample proof of this.
