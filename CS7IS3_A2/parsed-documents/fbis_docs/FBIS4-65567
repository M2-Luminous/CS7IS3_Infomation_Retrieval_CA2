Shamelessly flouting the rules of the new television democracy, he granted not a single smile, not the shadow of a smile, to the television cameras that focused on him as he listened 26 times to the litany of Berlusconi and his ministers pledging to him their allegiance to the Republic, the Constitution, the laws, and so on, and so on. Why was Scalfaro not smiling, while the prime minister openly (and justifiably) displayed his joy and even [Interior Minister] Maroni, in his casual gray suit contrasting with the prevailing blue, looked less than usual like some character from one of Ossian's funeral poems. We think we know why: On Republic Night, the president felt his shoulders burdened by a second responsibility together with that of guarantor assigned to him by the Constitution -- an unexpected responsibility as leader of the opposition. This is no paradox. Since election day there has been no opposition in Italy. There is no opposition from the Left, which is lying like some huge, brain-dead organism; and there is no opposition from the Center which, despite the million votes gained, is represented in parliament by a tiny minority undermined by many opportunists prepared to go over to the winning side. In fact, to be honest, this is not the first time that the opposition has disappeared in Italy. During the years of the historical compromise, which was previously called assemblyism (because it substituted the parliamentary assembly for the government in the role of the country's political leader) and subsequently called associationism (that is, criminal association between majority and opposition in order to avert problems), Italy relinquished both the function of government, which was delegated to the assembly, and the function of opposition, which was eliminated by criminal agreement. Now credit is due to the Right led by Berlusconi at least for its loudly proclaimed determination to regain the function of government. But the opposition remains invisible, like some mythical creature. The Left cannot make up its mind to throw out the rubbish of the ideologies inherited from the 19th century and to create the great Democratic Party -- liberal and Rooseveltian. The Center cannot make up its mind to become intensely liberal, that is, equidistant from the radicalism of the Left and from the Reaganism of the Right, thus facilitating liberal gains and at the same time opposing illiberal regressions. In this coma being suffered by the opposition, which is as profound as the new majority is coarse and unsubtle, there is only one force on which democracy can depend to ensure that its two supporting columns, government and opposition, remain standing as best they can: Scalfaro. Berlusconi in government and Scalfaro in opposition. This will be the Italian people's democratic guarantee. We know that the Italian people do not like Scalfaro much. Those of his own generation do not like him because of his youthful Catholic intransigence, and the younger generations do not like him because of his ecstatic manner of talking, with his eyes raised to the heavens, using lofty words, spelling out the most obvious concepts in the most leaden manner. And yet this man is the repository of the trust of those Italian democrats (by the way, how many democrats are there in Italy?) who refuse to see guarantees and rules left like the beaches on a Sunday after the encampment by the hordes, with their baggage of lasagne, eggplant pie, toilet paper, and other goods. We must hope that the chief of state and leader of the opposition, Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, will be granted the most complete success, namely, the government's democratic irreproachableness.
