But the authorities in Beijing, flooded with such applications, are putting the brake on allowing firms to convert to limited liability status, as more than one-third of them are running at a loss. "To do so, we have to carry out many structural reforms. But the work is well in progress," said Wang Pei Zhou, president of the steel giant. A reform plan, adopted by the Communist Party Central Committee in November, requires state enterprises like Baoshan Steel to come up with "corporate systems." The changes include reassessment of fixed assets, adoption of Western-style accounting methods, and separation of welfare facilities like schools from the parent company. In particular, such welfare facilities are a great burden on state enterprises. "The separation is a necessary step to improve our business performance," Wang said in an interview at a luxury hotel operated by the steel firm. The company's "living quarters," including hotels, schools, hospitals, shopping centers, a big gymnasium and apartment buildings for 23,200 employees, accounts for about one-fifth of the 13 square kilometers covered by the complex, which faces the Chang Jiang River. Even with these burdens, the 15-year-old steel company posted a pretax profit of 570 million yuan on sales of 18 billion yuan last year, paying a total of 3 billion yuan to state coffers as of December, 1993. Under share-listing guidelines, candidate companies must meet five conditions, according to Wang Hui Zhong, assistant researcher at the Shanghai Securities Exchange. These are registered capital of 50 million yuan or more, public offering of 25 percent of issued shares, profits for three successive years, approval by its "board of directors," and recommendations by two stock exchange members. The stock exchange saw a total of 20 company listings last year with 101 "A" shares for Chinese residents and 19 "B" issues reserved exclusively for overseas investors, Wang said. This month, 15 companies, including Maanshan Iron and Steel, are being listed on the local bourse. "Surely, there are no problems of efficiency and creditworthiness," boasted Wang. "A public listing, domestic and overseas, depends wholly on the government's decision." Baoshan last month started building a plant for 1,580 mm hot- rolled band steel, the key element in a third-phase project that also calls for construction of a blast furnace, two cold-rolled steel mills and a plant to make silicon steel. Under the plan, the steelmaker's present output capacity of 6.5 million tons per annum will be raised to eight million tons by 1997 with a final goal of 11 million tons in 1998, the president said. Zho Ya Long, an official with Shanghai Wan Guo Securities Co., however, said, "listing of Baoshan is unlikely, while that of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Iron and Steel Works, which has applied to the central government for permission for the fund-raising, will take place in the near future." "The Shanghai No. 3 works needs capital to raise production of heavy steel plates for fast-growing domestic shipbuilders. Shanghai municipal government has already given the green light to the plan." Meanwhile, Beijing is curbing listing of big state companies such as Baoshan for fear that an excess of new issues would spoil the fledgling stock market, the local securities firm official says. "Fund-raising through the stock market has helped us upgrade technology by using money for active capital spending," said Rong Jia Xiao, manager of comprehensive management department at Shanghai Erfangji Co., which floated its first A and B shares in 1992. China's top spinning machine maker, which became the first mainland-listed company to obtain American depository receipt approval in December, had to transform its management mechanism into a stock company for a tough survival race in the domestic and world markets, Rong said. "The management reforms began in mid-1980s, when all the rights were controlled by the state. Promotion of workers had been decided on by the local government," he recalls. The Shanghai-based firm, with 5,500 workers, used money from issuing a shares for investment in building a computer-controlled design and production system last year, rong said. Shanghai Erfangji raised one-third of the capital and investment money it needed on the stock markets and borrowed the remainder from Chinese banks last year. "Management places a high priority on returns of profits to shareholders. A dividend of 0.04 yuan is scheduled for the business year, which ended on December 31," he said. The government still owns 46 percent of the textile machinery firm's outstanding shares, followed by overseas investors' 41 percent and domestic individual investors' 11 percent, according to a midterm financial report. Rong said, "domestic investors are very speculative, but foreign investors into B shares are mature and stable. Removing a wall between A and B shares is welcome, as it will lead to further inflows of foreign investors' money to the domestic stock markets." In response to a question about insufficient disclosure systems in China, Rong insists, "bank officials are permanently stationed at our office to keep a close eye on how much we pay in salaries to employees, and certified public accountants check our records."
