With Bosnian Serbs retracting a previous offer to give the Moslems a third of the former Yugoslav republic in an ethnic carveup, peace mediators held out little hope for progress here. "There is no particular reason for optimism," conference spokesman John Mills said after the European Community and United Nations mediators held separate talks with the warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems. The talks coincided with further fighting in Bosnia and continuing hand-wringing in the West over its Yugoslavia policy. [passage omitted] In the peace negotiations, which resumed here after being broken off on December 23 in Brussels, Moslems and Serbs accused each other of rejecting the EC peace plan for the ethnic division of their country. [passage omitted] Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic called the Serb proposal unacceptable and [Bosnia-Herzegovina Ambassador to the UN] Sacirbey accused the Serbs of bad faith as they "have still not accepted the concept of a viable territory" for a future Moslem republic. [passage omitted] Sacirbey said the Bosnian delegation had presented the Croats with new proposals concerning the Adriatic port of Neum, the southern city of Mostar and central Bosnia, but there were no details.
