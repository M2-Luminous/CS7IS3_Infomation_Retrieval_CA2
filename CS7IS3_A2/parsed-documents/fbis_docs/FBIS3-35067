For it is inconceivable for the big powers, headed by the United States, to continue violating the national independence and sovereignty of world nations for decades. International control means restricting the activity of these satellites under an international treaty so that it does not extend beyond the borders of the states concered. No doubt, the Third World countries are the main target of the hostile satellite activity conducted by the major states, especially the big capitalist powers. Therefore, they must either find the necessary means to counter the dangers of these satellites by taking the initiative to call an international conference to be attended by all states concerned in order to discuss this issue, or raise the matter with the UN General Assembly or Security Council, despite the hardships they might expect from the United States and its Western allies in the United Nations. By stressing the danger of the espionage satellites to the Third World countries, we are not excluding their danger to some European and Asian states which are allies of the United States. But this alliance has not protected, and will not protect, the national independence and sovereignty of those states or their underground resources; nor will it protect telephone conversations between government officials, company owners, board directors, and, in fact, anything in those states which is considered vital to the United States. Perhaps, it is important when seriously discussing the drafting of a treaty or an agreement on earth satellites to take into consideration the scores of satellites which have been orbiting the earth for several years carrying out intelligence and military missions for their states. These satellites must be destroyed. The data they have collected so far must be placed at the disposal of the United Nations through an elected special commission, which would decide what to do with this data for the sake of protecting other nations' independence and sovereignty. There must be a complete ban on the use of outer space for military purposes. Furthermore, the United Nations should be informed about the programs of satellites which are used for non- military purposes. It would be useful if the programs of the United Nations and its cultural and social agencies, which are actually based on the UN Charter and not influenced by U.S. foreign policy, could be transmitted via these satellites on a worldwide basis in the interest of international peace and security and the cause of common understanding and friendship among peoples and nations. Nobody doubts the hardships and financial problems facing the world organization and its various agencies. But launching a special UN satellite is a more worthwhile cause than spending money on so-called peace-keeping forces dispatched here and there under the UN flag, when the country responsible for starting crises in various parts of the world is the one that refuses to pay its financial contribution to the budget of the United Nations and its agencies, but which can be more generous sometimes when it comes to dirty missions undertaken by its forces and the forces of other nations in such countries as Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Angola, and elsewhere. The Americans and their Western allies are turning the United Nations into a murderer and a policeman, and an arsonist and a fireman at the same time. This is the tragedy of the organization that was originally established for the sake of achieving and preserving world peace. It is sinking to its ears in the quagmire. While the United States claims to defend international peace and security, what it does in practice is that it places the national security of world nations at the mercy of U.S. national security through these satellites and sophisticated espionage aircraft, which conduct their operations outside international control. Of course, all this takes place under the infamous U.S. theory that considers American interests and individuals as part of the national security that the U.S. Administraton must defend by every means, including the use of military force against any country where American interests or nationals may have been exposed to danger, despite the lack of a political motive. It is strange indeed that nobody inside or outside the Third World countries has thought about the danger of U.S. and allied satellites to their national security. And if they have, we have not heard a single opposition voice to the operations of these satellites in international organizations. This attitude has encouraged and is still encouraging the imperialists to continue to use outer space for spying on other nations and collecting military and economic data with complete disregard for the meaning of the national independence and sovereignty of those nations.
