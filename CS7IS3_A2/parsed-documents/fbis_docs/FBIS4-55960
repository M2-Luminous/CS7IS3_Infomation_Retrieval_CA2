Immediately upon their arrival from the airport, President Krajisnik [title as heard] and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha left for the Russian Permanent Mission to the United Nations where they sat down with the member of the contact group representing Russia. They stayed there for nearly two hours and afterward went directly to the Palace of Nations to meet with Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg. This meeting lasted for quite some time. At approximately 1700, after the meeting, Momcilo Krajisnik gave a brief statement for the press in which he stressed that the Serbian Republic delegation will participate in the talks on three conditions: That it be given a perfectly equal status; That all hostilities end immediately; That the percentages regarding the division of territories be a subject of discussion and negotiations and not determined in advance by a dictate. Namely, if this is the case then there is no reason for the talks. Regarding [President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency] Alija Izetbegovic, he is repeating his stance that he had not arrived to negotiate but to merely inform himself and establish contacts with the representatives of the United States and Russia in the contact group.
