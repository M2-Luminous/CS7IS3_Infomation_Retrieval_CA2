The clairvoyance of Comrade Kim Chong-il in triumphantly leading the cause of socialism has been demonstrated in constantly developing in depth socialism on a new ideological and theoretical basis with deep insight into the demand of the time. He comprehensively systematized the fundamental principle and contents of the chuche idea with energetic thinking and pursuit. He proved in a scientific way that only the chuche idea, the revolutionary idea centred on the popular masses which gives the man-centred outlook on the world, is the guiding idea which makes it possible to solve most correctly all the problems arising in the accomplishment of the socialist cause. Then, he proclaimed the chuche idea as the guiding idea and theory of our age by formulating the revolutionary idea of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song as the system of the idea, theory and method of chuche. His clairvoyance has been displayed also in that he has wisely guided the efforts to strengthen the party and enhance its leadership function and role, in compliance with the prospective demand of socialist and communist construction, grasping this as the main point, and has always kept to our way, the way of chuche in socialist construction. He gave a comprehensive exposition of original policies envisaging that the party's leadership must be continued in the communist society. And he has strengthened and developed our party to be a tested guide of the cause of socialism and communism and constantly enhanced its role with energetic guidance. He set forth the revolutionary slogan "Let us live our own way!" With the chuche-based will and faith that the Korean revolutionaries must build socialism and communism on the land of Korea and build an ideal society of the people with our own efforts in conformity with our people's aspiration and will. And he has wisely led the revolution and construction so that they could be carried on in the Korean way, the way of chuche. It is a splendid fruition of the wise guidance of the dear leader with clairvoyance that an invincible socialism is confidently advancing along its own way without the slightest vacillation under any circumstances has been built in our country, stresses the article.
