FR940105-2-00120 FR940105-2-00057 Determination of Significance and Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement and To Conduct Scoping for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Seattle, WA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Northwest Mountain Region of the Federal Aviation Administration (``FAA'') and the Port of Seattle (``Port'') announce that the FAA and the Port, acting as joint lead agencies, intend to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a proposal by the Port to develop a new parallel runway and other airport facility improvements to be examined in an update to the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (Sea-Tac Airport) Master Plan. To ensure that all significant issues related to the proposed action are identified, scoping comments are requested. DATES AND ADDRESSES FOR COMMENTS: To facilitate the receipt of written comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. The first meeting, in a workshop format, will be conducted for the public on February 9, 1994. A meeting for Federal, state and local agencies will be conducted on February 10, 1994. Send comments to, or seek additional information from the responsible Federal official: Mr. Dennis Ossenkop, Airports Division, Federal Aviation Administration, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., suite 540, Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. To be considered, written comments must be received on or before February 25, 1994. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Recent planning studies have indicated both an existing and long-term need for additional airfield capacity at Sea-Tac Airport. Under current demand levels, the Airport experiences reduced operating capability and delay during bad weather conditions due to the close-spacing of the existing parallel runways. During busy hours, arrival demand exceeds the bad weather arrival capacity and aircraft and passenger delays result. In addition to increasing the severity of delays caused by bad weather, continued growth in aircraft operational demand is projected to exceed Sea-Tac's annual airfield capacity within the next ten years. The objective of the Master Plan Update, and accompanying EIS, is to address the bad weather capacity problem and to meet long-term regional air travel needs spurred by a growing regional economy. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will be prepared for the Master Plan Update, which is expected to include numerous projects including, but not be limited to: A new parallel runway and improvements to the passenger terminal, ground access system, and other support facilities. The range of new parallel runway options that may be considered in the EIS are anticipated to be in the immediate vicinity of the existing airfield at Sea-Tac Airport. Based on the Master Plan Update, other airport developments that may be considered in the EIS would be located on or in the immediate vicinity of the existing Sea-Tac Airport property. Mitigation measures will be proposed, as necessary, for the significant adverse impacts created by development. Major actions or concepts to be discussed in the draft EIS include the no action alternative and other reasonable alternatives meeting the purpose and need. Such alternatives are expected to include several options related to runway lengths, separations and threshold stagger. The FAA and Port of Seattle have determined that the new parallel runway is likely to have a significant adverse impact on the environment. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) is required under the National Environmental Policy Act and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c) and will be prepared. The FAA and Port of Seattle have identified the following key areas for discussion in the EIS including, but not limited to: Alternatives, noise and land use, social and socio-economic impacts, human health, water resources, biotic communities, construction, earth, transportation and air quality. Scoping is the initial step in the preparation of the EIS. The scoping process is ``an early and open process for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying the significant issues related to the proposed action.'' Agencies, affected tribes, and members of the public are invited to comment on the scope of the EIS. You may comment on alternatives, mitigation measures, probable significant adverse impacts, and licenses or other approvals that may be required. Comments and suggestions are invited from Federal, State and local agencies, and other interested parties and individuals to ensure that the full range of issues related to a Master Plan Update EIS are addressed and all significant issues identified. To facilitate the receipt of comments, two scoping meetings will be conducted. A public workshop will be conducted to receive written comments on February 9, 1994 from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m. at Tyee Senior High School, 4424 South 188th Street, City of SeaTac. The second meeting will be held on February 10, 1994 between 9:30 a.m. and 11 a.m. for Federal, state and local agencies in the Sea-Tac Auditorium, Mezzanine Level Main Terminal Building, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Issued in Renton, Washington on December 20, 1993. Edward G. Tatum, Manager, Airports Division, Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Renton, Washington. William E. Brougher, SEPA Responsible Official, Port of Seattle. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;137 Filed 1&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
