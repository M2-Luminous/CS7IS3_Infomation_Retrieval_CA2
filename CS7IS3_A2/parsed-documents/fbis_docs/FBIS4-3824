Yu Aijun was still wearing part of his uniform when arrested last Sunday, the Beijing- run TA KUNG PAO reported. The brother of another suspect, Wu Lihong, serves in the paramilitary Peoples' Military Police in the Hangzhou military district. However the report said there were only three suspects in the case and no military involvement in the raid, in which 24 Taiwan tourists were killed on a pleasure boat on March 31. The director of Taiwan's National Security Bureau, Yin Tzung- wen, told members of parliament in a closed-door meeting on Wednesday that eight to 10 people were involved in the case and that a number of them were soldiers of the Peoples' Liberation Army (PLA). But with China denying the charge as "pure fabrication" and no evidence emerging to support the theory, calls began in Taipei yesterday for Yin to step down. "The issue is serious. If it was found later no mainland soldiers were involved in the case, he (the security head) should assume political responsibility for providing false information," an opposition MP, Chen Shui-hian, said. Opposition MPs said Yin should not to use false information to trick lawmakers into supporting the annual budget of the security bureau. It was during a meeting with opposition MPs to review the bureau's budget that the PLA charge was made. "As soon as the mainland government reveals all the details and completes court proceedings of the case, we will ask Yin and the military information bureau director to report to us how they handled the case," Chen said. Taiwan officials also announced yesterday they would not allow expansion of imports from China until the completion of an inquiry into the incident. Meanwhile, two journalists from the Hong Kong-based TVB Superchannel (TVBS), who were detained by police in Zhejiang on Wednesday, remained in Hangzhou last night. Ma Yu-yuen, a Taiwanese passport holder, and Cheuk Tak-ming, a Hong Kong resident, were detained and interrogated for reporting without permits when they arrived at the scene of the incident.
