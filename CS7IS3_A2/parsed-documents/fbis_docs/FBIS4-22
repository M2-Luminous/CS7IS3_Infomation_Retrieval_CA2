FBIS TRENDS-08APR94-BALKANS Iliescu Calls for an End to Yugoslav Sanctions Iliescu Calls for an End to Yugoslav Sanctions SUMMARY Suggesting that Romanian willingness to enforce United Nations economic sanctions against Belgrade is waning, Romanian President Ion Iliescu, during a visit to Bucharest by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, criticized the sanctions as counterproductive to the search for peace in former Yugoslavia. Although Romanian authorities had indicated their weakening support for the sanctions since early this year, Iliescu's criticism was the strongest authoritative statement to emerge so far from the Romanian Government. Despite Romania's wavering, other bordering states are apparently holding the line on supporting sanctions. END SUMMARY Breaking ranks with other neighbors of former Yugoslavia, Romania has called for an end to the UN sanctions against Belgrade. Speaking at a press conference during Milosevic's 5 April visit to Bucharest, Iliescu declared the UN embargo a "forceful measure" akin to military action that does not contribute to "finding a solution to the problem" in former Yugoslavia. As an alternative, he argued, lifting the sanctions would be "an important element" in "creating premises for finding peaceful solutions" to the conflict. While Iliescu did not go so far as to declare that Romania would not continue to enforce the sanctions, he and Milosevic did agree that Romania and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY--Serbia and Montenegro) make preparations for immediate resumption of trade pending the lifting of the embargo (Bucharest radio, 5 April). Recent statements from the Romanians, who have long complained of the adverse effects on their economy of the UN sanctions against the FRY, foreshadowed Iliescu's 5 April remarks. Foreign Minister Teodor Melanescu recently expressed support for the "slackening or complete lifting of the sanctions" as progress is made "during negotiations" toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict (Rompres, 1 April). In a January interview, Iliescu expressed his displeasure with continuation of the sanctions. Criticizing unnamed "international bodies" for not treating the crisis in former Yugoslavia with "adequate understanding," he charged that they were taking an "approach" that "has been quite dangerous'' for Yugoslavia and ''for the stability'' of the the entire region." The UN sanctions have caused "suffering to all innocent people'' and ''nobody stands to gain'' from the continuation of this abnormal situation" (Dimineata, 29-30 January). At about the same time, Bucharest radio quoted FRY Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic's claims that, during Jovanovic's January visit to Bucharest, Iliescu said Romania had never advocated and never supported" the "inhuman and very harmful sanctions" (Bucharest radio, 25 January). Iliescu has not been observed to deny the accuracy of Jovanovic's recollection. Other States Claim Firm Stand At least for now, the other states bordering the FRY continue to declare their intentions to do their best to enforce the sanctions: -- Foreign Ministers Stanislav Daskalov of Bulgaria and Alfred Serreqi of Albania recently met in Tirana and, according to the Albanian media, declared that the "embargo against Serbia must not be lifted" (ATA, 29 March). -- Following a visit to Belgrade, Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszensky reiterated his country's stance that Hungary "supports the lifting of sanctions" only if "Belgrade meets international expectations" (Budapest radio, 7 February). Moreover, he denied that Hungary would "ease sanctions" enforcement "in return for a more tolerant policy" in the FRY toward Serbia's Hungarian minority population (MTI, 7 February). -- While the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has sought relief from the UN for the severe impact of the sanctions on its economy, President Kiro Gligorov has insisted that his country has "consistently" done its "part in the implementation" of the sanctions (Nova Makedonija, l October 1993). Implications While Iliescu did not threaten to end enforcement of sanctions in Romania as long as they are still legally in force, his statements suggest that Romanian officials are unlikely to take vigorous enforcement. Indeed, Romanian border guards and customs officials may well take Iliescu's remarks as a signal that they should look the other way at sanctions violators. Moreover, other frontline states may question the wisdom of taking strong enforcement action if Romania begins to gain economically by allowing the sanctions regime to deteriorate on its borders.
