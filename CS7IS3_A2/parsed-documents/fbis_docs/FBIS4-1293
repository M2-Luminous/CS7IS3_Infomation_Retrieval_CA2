African National Congress National Chairman Thabo Mbeki earlier said passersby had made a citizen's arrest after seeing a white man running from a car which was packed with explosives. The suspect had parked the car outside a Department of Home Affairs office in Benoni on the East Rand, he said, adding police were dealing with the matter. But police spokesman Col Steve Senekal said there was no truth in Mr Mbeki's statement. He said passersby had noticed a vehicle with a suspicious parcel inside. Police took the car away and searched it. There were no explosives. "We have been trying to get hold of Mr Mbeki to clarify the matter," Col Senekal said. At least 19 people were killed and more than 130 were wounded in two car bomb attacks on Sunday and Monday.
