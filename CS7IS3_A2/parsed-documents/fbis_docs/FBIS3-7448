Saying that the publication of the war scenario against the North cannot be overlooked, the paper in a commentator's article warns: The South Korean ruling quarters should ponder over the grave consequences that may arise from their reckless acts of leading the situation to the brink of war in collusion with outside forces against fellow countrymen. The article says: The "plan" revealed recently by the puppet Defence Minister of South Korea, Yi Pyong-tae, provides for "five-phase military actions". It is a war scenario against the North which was worked out through a confab between ranking officers of the U.S. Forces and the puppet Army in September last year. This is the first time that South Korea opened to the public an established war scenario against the North. This shows the Kim Yong-sam group is a cohort of bellicose elements more swollen-headed for northward invasion than the preceding rulers, and plainclothes warmaniacs more dangerous than those in military uniforms. This is proved eloquently by the reckless military moves of the South Korean authorities. The South Korean puppets recently held military confabs such as "meeting of security-related ministers" one after another over the "nuclear issue" of the North and "reexamined" their "policy toward the North" and "defence posture". On that basis, they decided to introduce Patriot missiles in South Korea and resume the Team Spirit joint military maneuvers and issued a "special alert order" to the entire puppet Armed Forces. These are ill-boding military moves to carry the war scenario against the North into practice. As a result, a strained situation that might trigger off a war any moment has been created on the Korean peninsula. It has been made clear that the South Korean puppets are a group of traitors indifferent to peace in the country and the fate of the nation. The Kim Yong-sam group must remember that they unilaterally nullified the inter-Korean agreement and the joint declaration on denuclearisation. The United States and the South Korean authorities watching for a chance to realise the war scenario against the North are wholly to blame for the tensions on the Korean peninsula. The root cause of disasters must be grubbed up in time. The bellicose elements such as the puppet defence minister trying to plunge our nation into the scourge of nuclear war must be punished immediately and the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime be ousted. With no military threat can the United States and the South Korean rulers frighten the Korean people. Unshakable is the will of our people and People's Army to punish the aggressors and provokers and safeguard security of the country and the nation. We are fully prepared to deal a thousand-fold retaliatory blow if the South Korean rulers unleash a war against the North in league with outside forces. The provokers will have to pay dearly.
