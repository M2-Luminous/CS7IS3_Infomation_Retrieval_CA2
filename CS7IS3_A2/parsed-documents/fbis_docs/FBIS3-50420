"The meeting was held in a very calm atmosphere; we talked about the reasons for his dismissal," the prime minister added. The prime minister did not give specific reasons, but he said that the privatization of the Silesian Bank was not the direct reason for Kawalec's sacking. Pawlak explained that during a conversation with him on Friday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Marek Borowski reiterated that he expected a reply in writing to his questions concerning the reason for Kawalec's dismissal. The prime minister pointed out that the letter had not yet reached Borowski, and for that reason he did not want to reveal any details contained in the letter. When asked if Kawalec's sacking could weaken the Polish Peasant Party-Democratic Left Alliance coalition, and if there already was a candidate for the vacant post to replace the recalled minister, Pawlak explained that there is not yet an agreement concerning the candidate. With regard to the coalition, the prime minister said he does not think that Kawalec's dismissal could cause any problems.
