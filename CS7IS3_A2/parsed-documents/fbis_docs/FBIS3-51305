In this regard, he said border controls will be intensified to neutralize the arrival of illegal immigrants, and that foreigners who violate residence regulations will be repatriated. Ruckauf discarded the presence of activities linked to the Shining Path guerrilla organization but warned that activities by different clandestine organizations involved in bringing illegal aliens to the country are being investigated. The government also is studying the possibility of investing about $40 million to re-equip provincial police and the Border Police to stop any attempt at violence. Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will determine where to get the funds to purchase shields, rubber bullets, tear gas, and anti-riot equipment. Quick deployment forces capable of controlling outbreaks similar to the one in Santiago del Estero will be created. In this regard, Ruckauf noted the work by the intelligence services that "worked well under a situation difficult to predict." Regarding the repatriation of 30 Peruvians, Ruckauf explained that the same measure will be implemented with other illegal residents "even though Argentina continues its open-door policy." Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella said the deportation of the illegal immigrants was made due "to the illegal occupation of houses and the lack of work contracts justifying their presence in Argentina." Therefore, vigilance efforts will be intensified at the borders with the use of modern computerized control systems that will be obtained through international bids in the next 30 to 60 days. Ruckauf rejected any possibility of new outbreaks of violence, "but we will take all the necessary precautionary measures just in case."
