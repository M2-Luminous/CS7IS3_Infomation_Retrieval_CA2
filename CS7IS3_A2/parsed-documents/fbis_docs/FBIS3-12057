No one will ever be able to criticize or applaud Colosio in the future because no one will know if the words which were virtually his last might have come true: "I want to be president because I want to support the most needy in my country." Thus far, while the incredible and forever debatable theory of a lone assassin makes the rounds, Colosio's death has upset Mexico's political panorama, cast a gloomy shadow over Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration, and created uncertainty regarding who will be the next presidential candidate for the party that has been in power for more than 50 years in Mexico. The assassination has shocked the entire world but it has devastated Mexico because, emotions aside, it has created an air of instability with regard to the 21 August elections when approximately 50 million Mexicans will elect a new president under turbulent social conditions. Carefully selected, Colosio graduated in 1972 from the Monterrey Technological Institute and studied regional development and urban economy at the post-graduate level at the University of Pennsylvania. He was an academic researcher in Austria and in Mexico he taught classes at several institutions. After Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office, Colosio was appointed president of the PRI, thus becoming one of the party's youngest leaders. Colosio was also a senator for Sonora State, secretary of urban development and ecology, and later secretary of social development, the post he held until he was appointed PRI presidential candidate in November, 1993. Colosio's campaign encountered no problems at the outset but following the Zapatist National Liberation Army's uprising on New Year's day, he was widely criticized by the opposition and factions in his own party for his alleged failure to speak out against the crisis and because his team of advisers was perceived as weak. It has always been said that Manuel Camacho Solis, a former Federal District mayor and former foreign minister, was Colosio's chief rival. Quite recently, however, Camacho publicly relinquished his presidential ambitions, which is why the slain PRI candidate seemed to have a clear path to the presidency unless another party won. The dramatic void created by Colosio's death has the PRI in suspense because it must appoint a new presidential candidate. Many people have mentioned Ernesto Zedillo as a possible candidate -- totally dismissing Camacho Solis -- a former education minister, a brilliant economist, and also a former budget minister, [the latter] a position that had been held by Mexico's last two presidents, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas de Gortari prior to their election. Nevertheless, some analysts believe Zedillo is not the politician the PRI needs at this time; they need someone who is capable of dealing with a growing wave of popular discontent as well as with the as yet unresolved conflict in the southern State of Chiapas. Colosio's assassination took place on the very day the Mexican Senate approved legislative reforms aimed at making the election process more honest. The reforms in question resulted from a strong political struggle to make the elections as impartial as possible, especially in view of the political tension experienced in Mexico during past presidential elections. The PRI is in need of a new party spirit, new work methods, and less bureaucracy. Colosio once said it should keep the people at the core of its decisions, which should not be made from behind a desk. If the armed uprising in Chiapas prompted a radical change in Mexico, the assassination of the PRI presidential candidate creates renewed uncertainty and expectations which will not be easy to fulfill.
