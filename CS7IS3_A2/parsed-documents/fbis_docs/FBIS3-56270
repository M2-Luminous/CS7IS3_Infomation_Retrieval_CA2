"All is going well," he told an Interfax correspondent after the first round of talks on Thursday morning, lasting 20 minutes longer than scheduled. The delegations met in a narrow circle. [passage omitted] The meeting was held in an atmosphere of sincere partnership with neither side trying even to imply its specific role, Presidential Spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov said, commenting on the first round of talks as the two sides met in a narrow composition this morning. In his words, both sides proceed from a premise that peace and stability in Europe and worldwide is impossible without Russia and the United States. Elaborating the point, Kostikov said the world was in need of "a solid new order and great powers." As shown by various conflicts including military, there can be no stable peace without great powers, he went on to say. Kostikov spoke of a widespread beliefs in Russia that it remained a great power politically, militarily and culturally. Russia's elections and new constitution, the NATO summit in Brussels and the implementation of the Tokyo accords by G-7 states dominated the agenda of the morning session, he said. President Yeltsin spoke of Russia's turbulent though chaotic process of parliamentarism and democracy, but he stressed that his country had already joined the club of constitutional democracies. Kostikov said the two leaders had exchanged views on relations between the legislature and executive in a modern democratic society. Clinton briefed the Russian leader on the resolutions adopted by the NATO summit in Brussels including the U.S. partnership for Peace proposal. Kostikov said that since little was known of the U.S. proposal in Russia, such information was useful. As he described the U.S. initiative as a politically attractive declaration rather than a real program, Kostikov said it needed more substance. There were no differences on the impossibility of drawing new demarcation lines in Europe, the spokesman said. For his part, member of the Presidential Council Andrannik Migranian said the obscurely-worded concept of the Partnership for Peace proposal would for a long time leave Eastern Europe and Russia outside the framework of mechanisms for decision making on European security. He is opposed to attempts to try to make NATO universal and create a European security structure in its place. Instead, Migranian calls for a security structure allowing all countries to take an equal part in any decision making on European security. He also said the question of understanding and recognition of Russia's special role throughout the former Soviet Union would come on the summit agenda. Migranian says that Russia is the only factor capable of safeguarding regional peace and security. He denied that Russia was out to establish a neo- imperial or hegemonistic order in the region, adding that the reason was that no single international agency or regional force was able to act as guarantor of peace and stability in that area. "I think the sooner the western countries agree to provide appropriate financial and diplomatic support to Russia, the quicker peace and security will come to reign in what used to be the Soviet Union," Migranian said. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigory Karasin described the U.S.- proposed Partnership for Peace initiative as an alternative to the mechanical expansion of NATO and a rapid acceptance of new members. In his words, Russia will hold a comprehensive exchange of views on the Nato's Brussels summit with as many countries of Eastern and Western Europe as possible to determine optimal ways of promoting cooperation in maintaining stability and security in Europe. Karasin said the Russian-American dialogue must not be taken as an attempt by the two great powers to strike separate accords. The question is one of joint searches for such means of European stability that will provide security guarantees to all European states regardless of size, geography, economic or military potential, he said.
