It is the foremost glory and pride for our people to fully enjoy the happiness in which they find nothing to envy in the world while upholding the great father as one large family. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: I am very glad that Comrade Kim Chong-il commands people's respect, love, and admiration as a leader who inherits the cause of the revolution. There is no happiness for the people greater than living and carrying out the revolution upholding the great leader [widaehan yongdoja] as their father. Our people boundlessly trust and follow the dear comrade leader as father now. Here lies our people's noble feeling of ideological resolve to enthusiastically adore and follow to the end of the world the great leader who takes total responsibility for all their destiny and future and tenderly cares for and leads them. Traversing the long and glorious road of the revolution under the leadership of the dear comrade leader, our people have learned deep in their hearts the leader's greatness, his love for the people, and his noble communist virtue. For our people, the dear comrade leader is a great teacher and benevolent father who takes total responsibility for their destiny and blooms it. The dear comrade leader not only commended our people as masters of the revolution and good teachers [as heard], but granted them the noblest political life and continuously gives them familial love to be acclaimed generation after generation. It is the firm conviction of the dear comrade leader that without the people, the leader, the revolution, the party, and sovereignty would lose the significance of their existence. Thanks to the fatherly love of the dear comrade leader, all the working people in our country not only participate in political life freely today but carry out their duty for society and group honorably. In the loving bosom of the dear comrade leader, mistreated workers, peasants, and intellectuals and their sons and daughters have been brought up today to be cadres of the party and the state, guiding functionaries of plants and enterprises, deputies of power organs of various levels who discuss the political affairs of the country, heroes, professors, and doctors, thereby making their creative wisdom and talents flourish. There have been a number of proud statesmen and great men who made a name for themselves, but we do not know of any great statesman and people's benevolent father like the dear comrade leader who embraces all the people of the country in his bosom and brings them up to be true revolutionaries. The song "There is no fatherland without you" sung by all the people of the country from the bottom of their hearts reveals the infinite gratitude and boundless extolment to the people's benevolent father [inminui chaaeroun oboi] who takes total responsibility for and blooms their destiny and future. Our people's great pride in upholding the great father consists in all the people fully enjoying infinitely rewarding, happy lives. The dear comrade leader whose natural disposition consists of love for and trust in the people, worked out and put forth the lines and policies for the people so that all the activities of the party and the state may consistently serve the people. Today, all policies and considerations for people worked out and taken in our country and the deep concern and scrupulous care extended evenly to each individual household and each individual person by our party and state are precious fruits brought about by the great father's noble politics of benevolence. The dear comrade leader has designated the promotion of people's welfare the supreme principle in our party's activities, and with the improvement in people's lives, has given all kinds of consideration to provide them with greater joy and happiness. The dear comrade leader's firm position is that there can never be satisfaction in the struggle to improve people's livelihood and that greater happiness for the people should be achieved by all means by even seeing to it that mountains are leveled off or oceans reclaimed. Through modern streets and numerous monumental structures--the Kwangbok Street, the Chongchun Street, the Tongil Street, the West Sea Floodgate, and the 1 May Stadium--which have been built in recent years, our people are warmly cherishing the dear comrade leader's fatherly love for the people and his energetic leadership. Today, our people firmly believe that tomorrow will be better than today with our party's revolutionary economic strategies implemented by the great leader [yondoja]. The noble intention of the dear comrade leader--who is solving the question of improving people's livelihood while regarding it not as a simple economic task, but as both a strategic question for socialist construction and as an important matter linked with the future of the fatherland and people--is reflected in our party's revolutionary economic strategies for thoroughly implementing the agriculture-first policy, the light industry-first policy, and the trade-first policy. Under today's difficult circumstances in which we need to achieve socialist construction in the midst of acute confrontation with the imperialists, formulation and implementation of grand economic strategies aimed at providing our people with a more affluent and happier life is by no means a simple question. This is a great idea and great project which can be worked out and implemented only by the dear comrade leader who is endlessly sparing no pains for the people. The boundless happiness of our people holding the great father in esteem also lies in everyone helping and guiding one another, and living harmoniously in one large revolutionary household. Today, our country has become one large revolutionary household thanks entirely to the brilliant embodiment of the dear comrade leader's noble politics of benevolence. Regarding the idea of valuing the people as heaven as his personal motto, the dear comrade leader spares nothing for the people's happiness and future. Our society is literally becoming one large revolutionary household because the dear comrade leader's politics of benevolence is brilliantly being embodied and because the revolutionary sense of obligation and camaraderie are coming into bloom throughout the country. Though they have been born in different places, have different revolutionary duties, and have different personalities and tastes, our party members and workers are living today while holding each other dear in a genuine relationship of comradeship. There is no country anywhere in the world as our country, a society in which all people throughout the country share life and death by helping and guiding each other, vigorously march forward by upholding the leader's [yongdojaui] intentions and ideas with singlehearted loyalty, can see his own hope and talent realized and brought into full bloom without worrying whatsoever about daily life, and are most thoroughly guaranteed of their dignity and rights, because they are holding the great leader [yongdoja] in esteem as the father. Our people's firm belief and will are to show complete loyalty and filial piety, upholding the dear comrade leader who is taking full responsibility for their fate and future and bringing them into blossom. There are no people in the world like our dignified and happy people who are living in the most glorious era and carrying out the revolution, while holding the dear comrade leader in esteem as the father.
