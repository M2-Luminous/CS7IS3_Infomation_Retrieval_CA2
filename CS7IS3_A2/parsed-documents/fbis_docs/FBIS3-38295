FBIS3-38295 "drweu021aa_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS UNHRC Sessions Opens in Geneva; Agenda Previewed AU3101150294 Paris AFP in English 1445 GMT 31 Jan 94 AU3101150294 Paris AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Geneva, Jan 31 (AFP) -- The UN Human Rights Commission opened its annual session here Monday [31 January] with a warning from its outgoing chairman that the Bosnian war will undermine the UN's credibility unless the world community intervenes there soon. Mohamed Ennaceur of Tunisia denounced the "passiveness (and) impotence" afflicting Bosnia. "If the states which have the capacity and duty to intervene do not do so rapidly and effectively, and if the international community continues to content itself with dead-letter resolutions...the continuing drama of the Bosnian people will dangerously weaken the credibility of the UN," he said. Ex-Yugoslavia will be high on the agenda during the Commission's six-week annual session, which opened Monday by electing Dutch diplomat and lawyer Pieter Van Wulfften Palthe as Ennaceur's successor. Atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina will come under the spotlight on the basis of a new report by former Polish prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. The Commission will also discuss the issue of war criminals' impunity. Ibrahima Fall, UN undersecretary general for human rights said last week he hoped that in the wake of the establishment of an international court on ex-Yugoslavia in The Hague, a permanent court would be set up to prosecute those who seriously violate human rights throughout the world. Heading the list of leaders addressing the session is Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who is due to appear Tuesday to denounce India for what officials have called its "occupation" of Kashmir and repression of the Moslem-majority population there. PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat is also expected to address delegates Tuesday, while Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres is due February 10. UN sources here said that a U.S. call for the Commission to no longer treat the Israeli occupied territories as a case apart was likely to be rejected due to opposition from Arab states. It was unlikely that resolutions aimed at Israel -- particularly for its occupation of the Arab territories -- would be done away with or presented differently, the sources said. Former Swiss foreign minister Rene Felber is to present a report on the occupied territories after meeting 'Arafat in Tunis and a visit to Israel this month. Meanwhile Georgia succeeded Monday in adding a clause on "ethnic cleansing" in civil wars onto the agenda in the light of its own conflict with Abkhaz separatists. The outgoing chairman welcomed multirace elections in South Africa scheduled for April, and the successful conclusion in December of a world trade liberalisation accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Ennaceur also highlighted the appointment of the first UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Ecuador's UN ambassador Jose Ayala Lasso is due to be officially confirmed in the post in the next few days. Fall meanwhile called on all member states to ratify UN conventions on human rights. Among countries again expected to undergo criticism over their human rights records will be Sudan, Zaire, Iran, Iraq, Burma, Haiti, Cuba, Togo, Indonesia -- over East Timor -- and China.
