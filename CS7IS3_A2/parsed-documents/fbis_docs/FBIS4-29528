President Kim Il-song's recent proposal for a summit was made through a third person, namely former U.S. President Carter, not through official channels. What is behind the government's assessment that official verification of the North's intention is not necessary? [Minister Yi Hong-ku] If a proposal is related to internal relations or is put forward between two different countries, it should be made through diplomatic channels and be examined through official means. However, as you know, this is related to an international issue of the nation, and there is no fixed procedure for this kind of event. We assessed that the North's intention conveyed by former U.S. President Carter is relatively precise. Therefore, we decided to push ahead for the talks. [Anchorman Yi] As you, Mr. Minister, pointed out earlier, acceptance of the proposal for a summit and our proposal for holding a working-level contact for the summit have taken place simultaneously. Is there any special reason for us to propose first a working-level contact? [Minister Yi] As all of our people may agree, the situation on and around the Korean peninsula is very strained. This being the case, we think that if one decides to resolve all problems, including the strained situation, through summit talks, we should push ahead with such talks as soon as possible. This is precisely the reason we put forward the proposal first. Besides, we maintained the position that all problems can be sufficiently discussed between the top leaders of both sides. Therefore, there would be no serious obstacles in preparing the summit. [Anchorman Yi] How does the government grasp the true intention of the North side in proposing a North-South summit at this point? [Minister Yi] As we know, former U.S. President Carter recently visited North Korea. However, in view of the international atmosphere and of the atmosphere on the Korean peninsula, it is highly likely that the North Korean side drew a conclusion that a resolution of all problems would be difficult without direct dialogue between the North and South, which are the very relevant parties. [Anchorman Yi] How will you deal with the issue of nuclear transparency in the future? [Minister Yi] The issue of nuclear transparency is an important, inevitable issue for a solution to the nuclear problem. Therefore, this issue will always remain as an important one in the future as well. However, we do not intend to raise this issue during the forthcoming preliminary contact because we want to advance the contact to a summit without wrangling with each other over agenda items, just as in the past. This is why we do not directly mention the issue. [Anchorman Yi] People think that a summit without any substantive result and a summit merely for the sake of a summit is not desirable. What we are most worried about is that the summit may result only in giving time to North Korea for its suspected nuclear development. How do you view this? [Minister Yi] Such worries are quite natural. However, as our president has mentioned many times, our position is not to hold talks merely for the sake of talks. The very situation we are facing today necessitates talks between the North and the South. This is why we are pushing ahead with the talks. Who would benefit from these talks is an issue that we should cautiously examine. However, we believe that holding talks would be beneficial to both sides and to our nation. [Anchorman Yi] The world, although welcoming it, is generally showing a cautious reaction to the North-South summit proposal. How is the government analyzing external conditions for a summit? [Minister Yi] History shows that summits were not successful on the Korean peninsula despite brisk discussions for their realization. This being the case, no one can be sure about the success in talks. This is why some people have expectations and hope for the talks while the others are worried about them. Nevertheless, we believe it is right that at a time when the Cold War has ended, both, the North and South should directly seek means for the resolution of problems based on the principle for solving problems by those who are directly concerned. This is the position of our side in pushing for the talks. [Anchorman Yi] Thank you for your interview today.
