This was revealed by a recent provincial taxation conference. The province has benefited most from the country's opening-up policy and reforms since the early 1980s and it has enjoyed increasing economic development as well as steady tax and revenue growth. Under the new taxation system, taxes are classified and collected separately by the central and local governments, ensuring that both have stable income sources, with the central government gaining a larger share of increased incomes. Last year, the province's total taxation revenue reached 36.3 billion yuan, the highest in the country. But its contribution to the central government in 1993 amounted to less than six percent of the province's revenues. Under the new tax revenue-sharing system, 70 percent of increased revenues collected by the provincial government are to go to the central government. This means that the province's contribution this year will be many times the 2 billion yuan (230 million U.S. dollars) handed over the previous year. But leaders at all levels of the province have worked hard to support the new taxation system in spite of the extra payments to Beijing under the new system. By this February, the province's total industrial output value had jumped to 54.83 billion yuan, up 19.7 percent on the same period last year, and retail sales to 259.2 billion yuan, up 32.8 percent. A total of 1.35 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment had also been used, an increase of 47 percent over the same period the previous year. The province's tax revenues steadily rose alongside these increases. By March 10, this year, the province had collected altogether 7.6 billion yuan in taxes from its industry and commerce, an increase of 2.11 billion yuan (38.5 percent) over the same period last year. In contrast, the province's price hikes showed signs of rising less fast: it stood at 18.3 percent in January, 4.1 percentage points lower than the previous month.
