FBIS3-13182 "drnes047_k_94007" FBIS-NES-94-047 Document Type:Daily Report 10 Mar 1994 IRAQ Reopening of `Baby Milk Factory' Reported JN0803151294 JN0803151294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic on 2 March on page seven publishes a 1,500-word report by correspondent Khudayr 'Abbas Mahmud entitled "AL-THAWRAH Reveals a Secret About the Baby Milk Factory for the First Time." The report says the factory, which was the target of allied bombing on 21 January 1991, has been reconstructed and is now operational, producing "milk that is 100 percent Iraqi" called "Biladi" [English: my country]. The report includes an interview with the factory's chief engineer, Qays Hanna Dawud. Asked why the factory was an allied target, Dawud says everyone in the West knew the factory was built by a French company at a cost of $35 million and was completed in 1984, "however, the foreign company failed to operate the factory to produce milk according to the required specifications. So the factory remained inactive until 1990 when attempts were made by the General Establishment for Milk Products, which is currently in charge of the factory, to find solutions to those technical problems. The French, who were among the aggressor states, knew that it was a baby milk factory." Asked about the connection between U.S. companies and the factory, Dawud says that the U.S. "Wyath Company" was approached to modify the factory designs, that a team of experts from that company had actually visited the factory, and that an Iraqi delegation led by the late Ghassan Ibrahim, director general of the General Establishment for Milk Products, was actually in the United States on 2 August 1990 to sign a contract with the U.S. company. The contract dealt with operating the factory and using the trademark of the Wyath Company, which produces the children's powdered milk brands: "SMA" and "S-26." Dawud notes: "This secret, which has been revealed by AL-THARAH for the first time, serves as categorical proof that the Americans and the French knew that it was a factory for producing milk for children." Asked about the damage caused to the factory, Dawud says the factory sustained 95 percent damage and that allied aircraft "made use of the information and the visit by the American delegation of six experts, who came to inspect the factory and make their technical assessments before the departure of the Iraqi delegation to the United States. This was in addition to the maps the French had." Dawud concludes: Under orders from President Saddam Husayn, the Corporation for the Implementation of Food and Medical Projects, an affiliate of the Military Industrialization Organization, began reconstruction work on the factory on 1 April 1992. Foreign companies were contacted for assistance, but they refused to provide the equipment needed. So the teams of the Military Industrialization Organization relied on their own initiatives and skills and reconstructed the factory, which was reopened on 21 January 1993, the second anniversary of its bombing.
