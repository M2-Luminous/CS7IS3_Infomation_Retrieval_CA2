FBIS4-30583 "dreas124_d_94019" FBIS-EAS-94-124 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 South Korea Seoul To Lose European Textile Tariff Reduction Seoul To Lose European Textile Tariff Reduction SK2706034994 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES in English 27 Jun 94 p 8 SK2706034994 Seoul THE KOREA TIMES English BFN [Text] Korea will be stripped of its European tariff reduction favor on textile products, during the latter half of this year, and will see more cuts in items subject to the generalized system of preferences (GSP), starting next year, the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) said yesterday. The KFTA said that the European Union's (EU) board of directors have recently agreed that they will suspend the GSP favor for Korea's textile products under the multi-fiber agreement (MFA), starting July 1. The withdrawal of the GSP favor is apparently in retaliation for Korea's imposition of higher tariff on European wool products, a KFTA official said. Korea exported $57,233,000 worth of textile products under the GSP in 1992, representing 16.5 percent of GSP-Favored exports to the EU and 3.37 percent of total exports. The official said that the EU plans to draw up a law on its new GSP system to be applied during the 1995-2005. The law draft will be presented to the EU's Executive Commission in July for finalization by the end of this year. He said, quoting a report from KFTA's branch in Brussels. Korea will remain beneficiary of the EU's new GSP but the items and volumes benefiting from the GSP will sharply decline, he said, adding that this assumption is based on reports circulated so far. Korea has been given GSP favor by the EU since 1971, except for 1988-91 when the favor was suspended due to bilateral disputes over the protection of European intellectual property rights. The EU has also used the GSP as a leverage in trade negotiations with Korea on several other items, including automobiles. Korea ha sold 20.8 percent of its total exports to the EU under the tariff rate reduction. General industrial products, including automobiles, and textiles represented 96.1 percent of total GSP-favored exports but the major export items of automobiles, electronics goods and textile products have received reduced favored due to the EU's protectionist measures, the KFTA official said. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's exports to the EU under the GSP were 9.3 percent in 1992, and those of Mexico 21.8 percent. China saw 39.3 percent and members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) 34.8 percent.
