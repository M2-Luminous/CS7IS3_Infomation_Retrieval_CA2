DIE TAGESZEITUNG presents on overview: Baden-Wuerttemberg: Examination of each individual case. In Bavaria, too, each individual case is decided. For amounts of up to five grams of hashish, criminal prosecution can be waived. No tolerance for hard drugs. Berlin: Examination of each individual case. Same as in Bavaria for cannabis products. In Brandenburg criminal prosecution can be waived. In this case, the "amount of drugs needed for approximately three hits" must not be exceeded. Bremen: The amount of hashish must not exceed a limit of 10 grams. The limit for hard drugs is three grams. Hamburg: No information. Hesse: Examination of each individual case. The prosecutor general's office has issued a noncommittal recommendation that criminal prosecution can be waived for amounts of up to 30 grams of cannabis products and one gram of heroin. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: Examination of each individual case. Lower-Saxony: Examination of each individual case. North Rhine-Westphalia: Up to 10 grams of hashish and up to half a gram of heroin should not be liable for punishment as a "small amount." Rhineland-Palatinate: Already in January 1993 Justice Minister Caesar introduced a Bundesrat initiative, according to which possession of less than 20 grams of hashish and less than 100 grams of marijuana is punishable only with a fine. Saarland: No guidelines. Criminal prosecution for the possession of small amounts is usual only on the third repetition. In the case of hard drugs "criminal prosecution measures" are taken no matter what. Saxony: Examination of each individual case. Saxony-Anhalt: Here the Justice Ministry "decided quite deliberately" not to give any specific amounts as a limit so as not to limit "the leeway of the public prosecutor's office." Schleswig-Holstein: Upper limit 30 grams of hashish; cocaine and amphetamines up to five grams; heroin up to one gram. Thuringia: Thuringia may be renowned for its sausages, but relatively little is known about hashish there. Last year police seized 300 grams all over the land. Thus, the public prosecutor's offices have little experience. Proceedings may be halted for amounts up to five grams. In other cases: "No soft treatment for hard drugs."
