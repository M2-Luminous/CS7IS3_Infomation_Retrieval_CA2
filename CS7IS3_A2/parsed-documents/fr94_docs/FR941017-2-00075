FR941017-2-00075 FR941017-2-00051 The licensee has evaluated the effects of the power rerate on in-plant radiation levels in the Peach Bottom 2 and 3 facility during normal conditions. The radiation levels during periods of normal operation and post-operation are expected to increase by no more than the percentage increase in power level. However, because many areas of the plant were designed for higher than expected radiation sources, the small increase in radiation levels expected due to power rerate will not affect radiation zoning or shielding in the plant. During periods of normal and post-operation conditions, individual worker exposures will be maintained within acceptable limits by the existing ``as-low-as-reasonably-achievable'' (ALARA) program, which controls access to radiation areas. The ALARA program at Peach Bottom has been instrumental in the lowering of annual collective doses at the plant over the past several years. Since 1985, the three-year average dose at Peach Bottom 2 and 3 has decreased by approximately 70 percent. The licensee stated that the original accident radiological consequence analyses could not be exactly reconstituted and, therefore, the reconstituted analyses were performed using methodology described in the updated final safety analysis report (UFSAR) with the original licensing basis assumptions at 3528 MWt (102 percent of the uprated power level). The licensee's reconstituted analyses indicate the calculated offsite radiological consequence doses are within the dose reference values given in 10 CFR Part 100 and also meet the control room operator dose limit given in 10 CFR 50, Appendix A, General Design Criteria (GDC) 19. In the Peach Bottom operating license safety evaluation report issued in August 1972 (Safety Evaluation of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station Units 2 & 3, Docket Nos: 50&hyph;277, 50&hyph;278'' issued by the Atomic Energy Commission, dated August 11, 1972), the staff performed an independent radiological consequence analyses at 3440 MWt (105 percent of current power level). The staff believes that, in general, offsite and control room operator doses will increase proportionally to the increase in power level. Therefore, the staff did not recalculate the offsite and control room operator doses resulting from a postulated design basis loss of coolant accident (which is the controlling design basis accident (DBA)). Instead, the staff proportionally increased the doses based on power levels using the same licensing basis assumptions used in 1972 and compared them with the licensee's reconstituted calculation (See Table 1 below). Neither the staff nor the licensee included radiation doses resulting from (1) main steam line isolation valve leakages and (2) SGTS fission-product bypass during the reactor building pressure drawdown time following a DBA, since they were not included in the original licensing basis assumptions.
