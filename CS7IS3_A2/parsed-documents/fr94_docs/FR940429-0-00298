FR940429-0-00298 FR940429-0-00016 Change: The final regulations have been revised to incorporate this clarification. 44. Comment: Some commenters objected to the restriction that a false certification discharge would only apply if the false certification was made by an ``eligible'' institution. The commenters believed that the HEA intended the false certification discharge provision to apply to certifications made by both ``eligible'' and ``ineligible'' schools. Discussion: This was discussed in detail on page 2490 of the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability on a loan if the student's eligibility to borrow ``*␣*␣* was falsely certified by the eligible institution *␣*␣*. '' (emphasis added.) The statute prescribes the scope of the discharge for false certification under section 437(c) as extending to those instances in which the ``student's eligibility to borrow under this part was falsely certified by the eligible institution *␣*␣*.'' 20 U.S.C. 1087(c)(1). The commenters proposal would have the effect of ignoring this language, which on its face limits relief to individuals whose personal eligibility status was falsely certified, rather than to those who contend that they were ineligible because the school at which they were enrolled was not an ``eligible institution.'' This limitation embodies a congressional choice to exclude those grounds that were really challenges to the eligibility status of the school itself, and nothing in the language or the legislative history suggests that this limitation is inadvertent or unintended. Moreover, institutional eligibility rests directly and indirectly on a host of qualifications. The lack of one or more of these qualities in a school mistakenly determined to be eligible by the Department would, under the commenters' view, suffice to make eligible for discharge all borrowers enrolled at the institution while the deficiency persisted_a period that could stretch over several years_regardless of whether that deficiency related to the adequacy of the training and skills provided to the borrower. The text itself and the legislative history show no intention of such a broad and costly view of the discharge provision. The Secretary does not, however, consider borrowers who attended schools that allegedly lacked eligibility to be barred by that alleged deficiency from relief under the false certification provision, but merely that the falsity on which they would seek relief must relate to a certification about their personal eligibility, and not that of the allegedly ineligible institution. The Secretary does not have the authority to discharge a loan that was made to a borrower for attendance at an ineligible school. Change : None. Section 682.402(e)(2)(ii) 45. Comment : Some commenters noted that lenders and guaranty agencies generally are not required to keep loan records longer than five years after the date a loan is paid in full. In light of the borrower's statutory right to a false certification discharge for loans received on or after January 1, 1986, the commenters recommended that the regulations prescribe the procedures to be followed by lenders and guaranty agencies who learn of borrowers who claim to have repaid their loans in full more than five years ago, but for whom the lender or guaranty agency has no existing records. Discussion : In these cases, the Secretary expects the lender and guaranty agency will examine records reasonably available to them from other sources. If the lender or guaranty agency are unable to locate records of a loan paid in full more than five years ago, it would be the responsibility of a borrower who requests a loan discharge to provide the required documentation needed for a discharge of the loan. Change : None. Section 682.402(e)(2)(iv) 46. Comment : Some commenters recommended that the regulations require the holder of a loan discharged under the false certification discharge provision to forward the original promissory note marked ``canceled'' or ``satisfied in full'' to the borrower within 30 days after discharging the borrower's loan obligation.
