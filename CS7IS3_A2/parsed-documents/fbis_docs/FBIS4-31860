Konsolidacni banka can now be added to the four financial institutions whose obligations are currently guaranteed by the state. [Prime Minister Klaus] "The insurance of deposits will be dealt with in a calmer, unhurried way." According to the prime minister, this is a temporary bridging amendment until an entirely new banking law is prepared. [Klaus] "We need more time for this new law, some peace, which is why we have now opted for a partial temporary amendment toward strengthening banking supervision and strengthening or tightening the regulatory framework from the viewpoint of the central bank vis-a-vis the commercial banks, with the unambiguous aim of safeguarding or attempting to safeguard the interests of depositors." For example, any bank can be fined up to 50 million korunas or have its basic assets reduced for irregularities in its activities. To the existing irregularities for which banks can be punished by the Czech National Bank are now added engaging in banking trade that harms the interests of depositors and having nonprofessionals or people who are not civically irreproachable [osoby obcansky bezuhonne] in management positions. The amendment also permits the forced administration of a bank for up to two years and further extends the powers of the administrator.
