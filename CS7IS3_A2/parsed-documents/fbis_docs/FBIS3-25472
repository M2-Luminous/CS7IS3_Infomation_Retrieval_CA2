Public Works and Energy Minister Felicien Gatabazi, a leading member of the opposition Social Democratic Party, was shot dead late Monday, Radio Rwanda reported. Paramilitary police said Gatabazi was assassinated outside his home by gunmen waiting nearby. The killers, who have not been identified, escaped after the attack. A spokesman for the UN Assistance Mission (UNAMIR) in the troubled central African nation declared, however, that the inauguration of the transitional government and parliament was set to go ahead Tuesday despite the violence. "We are still invited (to the ceremonies) at 2:00 P.M. (1200 GMT)," the spokesman said. Supporters of political parties opposed to the transition plan meanwhile threw up barricades on several of Kigali's main thoroughfares, while schools and administrative offices were closed. [passage omitted] Violence in the run-up to the new administration saw five people killed here on Sunday, "two or three" during an opposition demonstration and the others by bandits, according to a UNAMIR spokesman. The radio said police had to intervene late Monday to rescue around 30 officials seized at the Foreign Ministry during a demonstration organised by the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic, a group claiming to represent the interests of Hutus. The formation of the transitional administration has already been delayed three times. Gatabazi, a government minister on two occasions in the 1980s, returned to office in 1990, and was his party's candidate for the post of public works and energy minister in the government to be inaugurated Tuesday.
