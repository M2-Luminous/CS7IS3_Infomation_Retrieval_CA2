Dutch UN armoured vehicles were hit by Serb shells Thursday at the village of Teocak, east of Tuzla, while escorting a humanitarian aid convoy, United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) spokesman Major Rob Annink said. "Air presence was requested and aircraft dropped flares as a warning signal," he explained. There were no injuries. The request went to the UNPROFOR commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant General Michael Rose, who asked one of the regular North Atlantic Treaty Organisation air patrols in the region to approach and fire the flares, said Annink. He did not request full-scale air intervention which would have required the agreement of General Bertrand de Lapresle, commander of UN troops in all of former Yugoslavia, and UN special representative Yasushi Akashi. Both Serb and Moslem artillery have remained active despite the truce around Mount Ozren, in northern Bosnia, with UN observations posts among the targets, the major said. In particular, he referred to an attack on a post in Moslem-held territory east of the mountain, which was hit by Serb artillery, and a Nordic Battalion attacked by light arm fire. There were no injuries or damage, he said. Fighting in the Bihac enclave in western Bosnia, between the mainly Moslem Bosnian Army and a breakaway Moslem group, has died down but Serb forces had fired 160 shells against the army in the region, he said. There were fewer ceasefire violations in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, most of them at the airport. A Serb policeman was killed by a Bosnian sniper and two Bosnian soldiers were wounded by Serb bullets in the town, he said. The Bosnian Serb agency SRNA quoted a local radio report saying the Bosnian Army had launched an artillery attack against the strategic Serb-held town of Doboj Friday. "Several shells" had fallen on the town which was under general alert, the agency said.
