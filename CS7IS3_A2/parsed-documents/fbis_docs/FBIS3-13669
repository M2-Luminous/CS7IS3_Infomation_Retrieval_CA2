The agency cited the official as saying that a ballistic missiles programme in these countries constitutes a serious threat to American national interests. The international affairs editor of the JAMAHIRIYAH NEWS AGENCY, commenting on this said that these statements once more expose a series of facts, the most important that, - they are levelled against countries which are neither Christian nor Jewish. This is new proof of plans by the Jewish-Christian alliance against Islam and other non Jewish and non Christian religions, specifically Confucianism and Buddhism. This can be seen given that these statements do not at all mention the nuclear arsenal which the Israelis have, an arsenal including 200 nuclear warheads, which the Israelis have publicly declared to have in their possession. No one has called for the destruction of these weapons nor has anyone expressed concern about their existence. However, the reason is obvious, namely that there will be no objection to these weapons so long as they are aimed at the Arabs, whom, in the eyes of the Christians and Jews, are undesirable animals who should be annihilated. The Great Jamahiriyah, one of the countries mentioned by the United States has, as a peace loving country, repeatedly asserted that it does not have weapons of mass destruction in its possession, nor does it even consider them, or owning them. Instead, the Great Jamahiriyah is preoccupied with its development programme and building a prosperous life for its people. Therefore, the continuous repetition of such statements which are emanating from the highest American and British official levels if [word indistinct] official terrorism by nuclear superpowers carried out against a peace loving country which is being subjected to unjust harsh measures imposed by these countries which dominate the Security Council and obliges it to adopt resolutions which serve their best interests and their colonialist aims. None of the countries which the American official listed in his statement have ever attacked the United States or Britain. Indeed, the opposite is true, for these countries have, at various times, been the victim of aggression and colonialism stemming from these two countries themselves. Thus, these countries would normally be expected to think about self defence and ways to prevent aggression and colonialism meted out by these two western countries who until this day have deployed their warships off the shores of these countries in a blatant display of provocation and arrogance.
