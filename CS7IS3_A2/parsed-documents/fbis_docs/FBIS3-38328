At the National Alliance party convention, Fini attacks Segni and reevaluates the Lega. And Forza Italia indicates its "compatibility." Fini's National Alliance springs forth born from Berlusconi's right rib. In reality, it is the MSI [Italian Social Movement] with the addition of many converts: former Catholics, former Liberals (Costa and Biondi are interested, even though they did not attend), and a few former Socialists. For the time being, it is little more than a thing, the Gray Thing--actually a faded black. It wears an air of respectability and comes in the economy package so as not to waste votes--old-style, family size. It is a barrier against the dreaded "red tide." It is the immutable nucleus around which the moderates (from Forza Italia to Bossi and including the centrists and the fleeing right-wing Christian Democrats) can gather when the time comes for a conservative majority. And what about Mario Segni? "A snake charmer," hissed Gianfranco Fini (but he quotes him 16 times in his closing speech). Fini is the leader of a party that hopes to garner heavy gains in votes and image from this maneuver, following their strong showing in mayoral elections in Rome and Naples. The setting is a large hall in the back of a hotel in Rome. In the same hotel, Communist Renewal is holding its party convention at the same time. They are only 30 rooms away, but a few centuries separate these opposite extremes. Their understated logo consists of three red, white, and green brushstrokes. Eight hundred delegates and 2,000 guests are in attendance, many more than had been anticipated. A few MSI Deputies are present, but the militant rank and file is noticeably absent as planned. This is the debut of the respectable political right, which is a high-quality product for the middle classes that are in a confused muddle. It represents a daring strategy on the part of the leaders of a new party that leaves behind any nostalgia for the good old days and opens the way for an ultra modern technocracy that is actively courting the Catholic vote. On the platform, we find right-wing Christian Democrats like Fiori and Selva; and in the audience, some former Christian Democrats who are mad at Martinazzoli and even a venerable former head of the Revenue Guards (and of Sismi [Intelligence and Military Security Service], Ramponi, who calls for a tax cut. One of the interested observers is Francesco D'Onofrio (former Christian Democrat and now a centrist outsider), who came to offer his well-meaning "recognition," explaining that the "great majority of Catholic voters belong to the center right, whereas its leadership does not. The cold war had concealed this difference. Now that everything has broken apart, are we the only ones who should stand in the center, providing the highest, solitary witness that Martinazzoli is calling for? Even the pope praised the market as an instrument of liberty." Another high-ranking observer is Giuliano Urbani, the political scientist at Fininvest who is Berlusconi's ghost writer. With him is Antonio Tajani, a young spokesman for the group. Urbani is pleased with the way the day went. He says he "came to show his interest" and support. Bobbio is absolutely right--the First Republic will not completely die (and, I say, there will not a happy birth) if we cannot first overcome the deadly dichotomy between fascism and antifascism. I have not heard anyone here express sorrow over the end of Salazar's regime in Portugal. I see minimum differences of opinion, even though their origins hark back to the distant past. We are all the "children of our history, and this is important." It is a remarkable event and, in its own way, even an historic one. A very agreeable right-wing is on parade in the audience: an ecologist, a writer, a labor union representative, a bureaucrat, and even a terrifying anti-Bossi Leghist. Fini is the ecumenical secretary who is trying to relegate fascism to the archives of history. He is trying to redeem (now or never) those growing millions of votes he has. He is widening the political boundaries of a right that longs to lead the government, that suffers, and volunteers itself. What about the economy? This is Pietro Armani's (former center-left-wing president of IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction]) formula. We need a strong majority "that knows how to force decisions that are certainly not pleasant or popular." He has four [as published] exhortations: fewer administrative restrictions on company decisions; more private (with less taxation) and public (long-term debt) investments; a policy for demographic growth; a revival of research; striving to comply with European standards while better defending national interests; and paying for public services based on actual cost. He promises the return of the "salary brackets" favored by Berlusconi. "At relatively lower labor costs in the south, they fostered the first valid industrial developments." An absolute faith in the "market" and in a "free economy" is guaranteed to the moderates on the right, even though they oppose technocracies and support public employment. Having said that, "politics is the primary tool to regulate, but not intervene in, the production process," declares conservative philosopher Domenico Fisichella. The Alliance's attitude toward the Lega is sweet and sour: a lot of understanding for the voters, but none for their leaders. They are actually accused of having a Marxist-style vision of the state. But even Fini (acclaimed coordinator of the Alliance) seems to think they have gone too far and he makes some revisions. His reevaluates the Lega: "If Bossi is not still under the effect of his honeymoon, his new opinion of us (the only force in the center south that is neither for state socialism nor for the welfare state) is a great step forward from the state of war in the past." He detests Mario Segni ("he is deceiving himself; he will have to make a choice") because he is suspended between the right and the left and most of all because "he has volunteered to lead a government that is open to the moderate progressives, which includes the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left], but excludes the Rete and Communist Renewal once they have been used and discarded."
