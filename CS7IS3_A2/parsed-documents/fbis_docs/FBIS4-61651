Specialists stress that there was not a fire at the station. The incident involved only the ignition of liquid sodium escaping into the atmosphere. This is a perfectly logical chemical reaction, which will cease once the valve has been repaired and sodium stops leaking into the atmosphere. The accident has been assessed at level one on the seven-point international scale of incidents at nuclear power stations. [passage omitted]
