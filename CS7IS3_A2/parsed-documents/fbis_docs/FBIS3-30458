FBIS3-30458 "dreeu023__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-023-A Document Type:Daily Report 3 February 1994 ANNEX Hungary Police Chief Comments on Political Extremism AU0102200294 Budapest MTI in English 1448 GMT 1 Feb 94 AU0102200294 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 1 Feb (MTI) -- The director of the Criminal Justice Department of the National Police, Brigadier General Antal Kacziba, called for more precise legal definitions to protect society more effectively from extremist phenomena, at a news conference in Budapest today. He proposed punishing extremist conspiracy as well. Kacziba said that criminal proceedings had been launched against two members of the World National Popular Rule Party (WNPRP), suspected of having committed the crime of incitement against a community. The suspects are Albert Szabo, 29, a dual Hungarian-Australian citizen who heads the party, and Akos B., a juvenile activist. They made a confession, but did not plead guilty. As previously reported, the complaint lodged by the National Security Office against the two had some connection with the WNPRP meeting in Budapest in mid-January, where they denied that the Holocaust had ever taken place and defined themselves as successors to the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity. The police investigated 16 skinhead attacks involving 88 suspects, 22 of whom were taken into custody, Kacziba said. In the same period, the Budapest court tried three cases on charges of serious bodily or mental harm caused to people for their affiliation to an ethnic, racial or religious minority. The court could not establish proof of this criminal motivation in any of the cases, but imposed a penalty for grevious bodily harm with base motives, and hooliganism. Appeals may be filed. Seven lawsuits involved the use of extremist symbols. Most recently, the police received a complaint against the Budapest organization of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, for displaying a coat-of-arms with a five-pointed red star at their televised meeting on November 7. Kacziba stressed that the criminal code uses no terms like "left wing" and "right wing," and the police are not supposed to qualify the political views of offenders. It is the duty of the National Security Office to detect extremist groupings. The police only conduct criminal proceedings.
