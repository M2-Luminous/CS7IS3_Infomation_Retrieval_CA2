Before the meeting, PFLP-GC Secretary General Ahmad Jibril made a statement in which he said: Our people were not surprised by what they saw in Cairo when the detailed agreement was signed between 'Arafat and Rabin. What happened is an actual translation of the capitulatory deal 'Arafat accepted in Washington. He added: This is a day of sadness for our people and our Arab and Islamic nation. The agreement completely avoided mentioning Jerusalem, the capital of the Palestinian people, the first of the two qiblahs, and the third holiest mosque. He added that the agreement was also void of the right to repatriation and self-determination and did not mention the large-scale settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ahmad Jibril also said in his statement: The agreement was a total surrender by 'Arafat regarding the security file and the economic file. He said: Today, Our people staged a comprehensive strike in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in response to the agreement, pointing out that some parties, which support the agreement like Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi and Hanan 'Ashrawi announced that the agreement was a capitulatory one. Ahmad Jibril also said: We, in the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces, are meeting to assess what happened because there are requirements now, practical requirements on the ground in Gaza and Jericho. He then pointed to statements made by terrorists Rabin and Peres on 'Arafat's upcoming duty to oppress the intifadah. Ahmad Jibril stressed that the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces will not create battles with the upcoming forces of oppression unless 'Arafat completely insists on clashing with the popular forces. He also asserted that the alliance will continue its jihad and militant program, and that time will prove that 'Arafat is unable to conquer the intifadah which will escalate. Ahmad Jibril also pointed out that the agreement that 'Arafat signed is much worse that the Camp David accords. He asserted that our people are aware of what happened in Cairo today. He added: We are determined to continue our plans and to deal with the collapse that 'Arafat and his supporters created. We say that the agreement is not bounding for the Palestinian people. Ahmad Jibril added that these agreements are null and that the future will show who is right. He said that this capitulatory agreement 'Arafat signed today will completely fail within three months. In a similar statement, 'Imad al-'Alami, member of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, said that the agreement is not binding for the Palestinian people, describing it as a poisoned dagger directed at the heart of the Arab and Islamic nation. He asserted that what happened today was not surprising and that the agreement is null and void and will not bind our people. He added that Palestine is not owned by those who sold themselves to the devil, including the 'Arafatist leadership, which disowned our people's revolution, struggle, and all the Islamic and Arab values. Our people adhere to the firm principles of our Arab and Islamic nation in Palestine and to their full right to every inch of our land, Palestine. He said: We will not tire, and we are not pessimist. We are optimist because the people are steadfast and do not disown the martyrs' blood. Regarding the role of 'Arafat's police, 'Imad al-'Alami said that these police will not silence the sound of bullets which will continue as long as there is a usurped right in Palestine. The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces is still in session.
