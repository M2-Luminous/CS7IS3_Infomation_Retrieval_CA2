Boeing Company, Civil Action No. C 94&hyph;746 WD, was lodged with the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington on May 16, 1994. This Consent Decree settles an action filed by the United States pursuant to sections 106 and 107 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607, and section 7003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA''), 42 U.S.C. 6973, naming The Boeing Company (``Boeing'') as defendant. The United States Department of Justice (``the United States'') brought this action on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for reimbursement of past costs and future oversight costs in connection with the Queen City Farms Site (``the Site''). The United States also sought to obtain injunctive relief against defendant. The United States' claims are based on the contamination of the Site resulting from the disposal of industrial waste liquids which contained hazardous substances. The United States alleges in its Complaint that Boeing disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, hazardous substances, or materials which contained hazardous substances at the Site. In this settlement, the Consent Decree provides for Boeing to reimburse the Superfund for past costs totaling $566,027.14.
