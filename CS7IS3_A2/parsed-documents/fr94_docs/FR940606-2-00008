FR940606-2-00008 FR940606-2-00007 Noncompetitive Award of Financial Assistance Pacific Northwest and Alaska Bioenergy Program_State Grants AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of noncompetitive financial assistance award. SUMMARY: The Department of Energy (DOE), Golden Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award grants to: Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs, Energy Division; Idaho Department of Water Resources, Energy Division; Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation, Energy Division; Oregon Department of Energy; and Washington State Energy Office. The awards represent a continuation of DOE funded research, development, and demonstration of bioenergy-related technologies. Public Law 97&hyph;88 provides the statutory authority for the proposed award. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Through the agencies identified above, the states of Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington have been engaged in encouraging the development of bioenergy technologies for at least the last eleven years and have made successful advances to: (1) Produce cost-shared projects, (2) establish regional bioenergy committees, (3) Interact with trade and professional associations, (4) Provide technical assistance to developers and utilities, (5) Produce targeted information, and (6) Implement regulatory incentives or reduce regulatory and environmental barriers which promote the development of bioenergy technologies. Research, development, and demonstration activities occurring under these grant agreement will provide needed data and information to DOE and the bioenergy industry. This helps remove barriers to the utilization of bioenergy technologies. Therefore, these financial assistance applications are being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary to continue activities presently being supported by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of no other entities within respective state boundaries which are conducting these activities in the near or distant future. The project period for the grant agreements is expected to begin in July 1994 for a five year period. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $475,000 for each state for this project period (State in-kind match equals $125,000 and U.S. DOE funds equal $350,000).
