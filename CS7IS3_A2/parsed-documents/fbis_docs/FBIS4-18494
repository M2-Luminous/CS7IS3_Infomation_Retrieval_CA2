The army got a considerable amount, but they are not truly satisfied, for the programs already launched are bottomless pits. This somehow expresses the general philosophy of the forthcoming 1995-2000 military planning law. [Defense Minister] Francois Leotard announced yesterday at the Polytechnic School that "the final version is definitely ready." According to our information, the planning law envisions an annual increase of 0.5 percent per year in defense equipment allocations on the basis of the 100.4 billion francs mentioned in the 1994 budget. It will thus be a deviation from the 5-year law aimed at reducing budgetary expenditures, which advocates a yearly drop of 0.5 percent in public spending. For the part covering the last three years (1998-2000), military planners even envision an annual increase of 1.5 percent in expenditures if economic growth permits this. That is, an overall figure between 657 and 664 billion francs in current terms over 6 years. At the outset, the general staffs and the Defense Ministry had asked for a minimal increase of 3 percent per year to maintain the large armaments programs already launched. According to a report by French Democratic Union (UDF) deputy Arthur Paecht, these programs will swallow up about 574 billion francs over 8 years, of which about 150 billion were already allocated before the end of 1993. According to a senior military official, the army will thus be compelled to economize "on operational costs and abandon small programs," but also to cut major programs and delay those it wants to launch as soon as possible. Briefly put, it will have to dream of strong growth for better days ahead. A compromise will be proposed to [President] Francois Mitterrand, who has expressed the hope that the ballistic missile M5 designed to replace the M45 on nuclear missile-launching submarines should not be sacrificed. The Defennse Ministry also proposes to delay putting this missile into service from 2005 to 2010 so as to limit its allocations in the next 6 years. On the other hand, studies will begin next year to modernize the Albion Plateau where Francois Mitterrand wants new nuclear missiles deployed in 2003, while numerous experts propose that this land component of the (nuclear) strike force be purely and simply abandoned. In contrast, no decision will be made regarding the construction of a second nuclear aircraft carrier before 1997. This second aircraft carrier was requested by the Navy to replace the Foch, after the Charles de Gaulle, taking over from the Clemenceau, enters into service in 1999. One of the most threatened programs, the NH90 European transport helicopter --launched in cooperation with Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy--will be the object of serious review next year. According to a military official, the specifications of this helicopter intended for the Navy and the Army will be reviewed so that the program's total cost (9 billion francs, of which 4.2 billion will go to industry and the state) be reduced by 20 to 30 percent. The planning law does not envision new delays for the delivery of the Dassault-built Rafale fighter aircraft to the Air Force and the Navy in the year 2000. However, the number of aircraft may be reduced. This program alone is estimated at 178 billion francs on the basis of 320 aircraft for the French armies. The Leclerc tank may be scaled back. While 1,400 units were originally envisioned for the Army, the present target is 650, and there is even talk of 400 tanks. The Army is also concerned about its total force. It should have 233,000 soldiers in 1997, compared to 290,000 in 1990 and 241,000 in 1994. The Budget Ministry would like to reduce this number even further. Prepared by the Defense Ministry in conjunction with the general staffs and the General Armaments Delegation (DGA), the bill will still be discussed next week by the office of the prime minister. It will be reviewed by the defense council and Francois Mitterand at the beginning of April, presented to the council of ministers at the end of April, and submitted to Parliament at the end of May.
