I left there at 1800. An hour later, Chief of Defense Staff Admiral Venturoni issued orders to keep 200 paratroopers on a state of alert with a view to sending them out to Rwanda." This was said by Gen. Bonifazio Incisa di Camerana, Army chief of staff, during an official visit to the 3d Army Corps command in Milan. "We have been training troops for interventions abroad for some time. For Bosnia, we trained the Garibaldi Brigade of Caserta -- 3,000 troops, mostly volunteers on extended service. A few hundred will be enough for Rwanda, since we have been talking about a joint action with the French and the Belgians." It seems that the present preference is for a UN intervention, however, because the French are not well regarded by the Tutsi ethnic group, who are threatening to shoot them the moment they land. So our troops would suffer too. Have the orders changed? "We are soldiers, and we go wherever and with whomever the government orders us; we simply obey orders. It is not my job to concern myself with politics. I must, rather, consider technical problems, logistics, which are complicated by the fact that Rwanda is not on the sea, unlike Somalia, so we could only use air transportation. So to supply such an effort with the few C-130's and G.222's that we have would cause us major difficulties." These anxieties are well founded. The 46th Air Transport Brigade has 12 four-engined C-130 Hercules aircraft and 38 twin-engined G-222's, with a potential freight capacity of 20 tonnes and 9 tonnes, respectively. So the problem concerns not manpower -- a Hercules could carry up to 92 men and a G-222 up to 53 -- but supplies: from vehicles to water. Furthermore, the actual availability of usable aircraft is around 50 percent. Further limitations are imposed by routine tasks in Italy, exacerbated at present by firefighting activities.
