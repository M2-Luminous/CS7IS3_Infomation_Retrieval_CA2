He added Barbados would help facilitate Cuba's full integration into the community. Castro replied the independent position Barbados has historically assumed regarding the Cuban cause impressed him very much. Castro also expressed his confidence bilateral relations will become closer, particularly in the context of the future Association of Caribbean States, which will be established in Bridgetown next July. Sandiford thanked Castro for the Cuban delegation's participation in the conference. The conference concludes today in Barbados.
