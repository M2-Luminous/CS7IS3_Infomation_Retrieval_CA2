Today, at a session of the people's deputies in the House of Culture in Skrunda, in which local inhabitants took part, a decision was made to ask the Latvian Government to ensure that the functioning of the radar base be ended at the same time as the foreign army withdrawal is completed. This decision was accepted notwithstanding the explanations of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, leader of the Latvia's Way Faction Andreys Panteleyevs, or the Minister for Special Tasks Edvins Inkens, who tried to persuade the citizens that Latvia would only gain if the agreement was signed and there would be a precise time set for the radar station to cease operations. A. Panteleyevs said that if the agreement would meet the requirements of the Latvian Government, it would contain a point stating that the facility should be dismantled immediately after the agreement is concluded. The old radar has gone out of date and it is not foreseen that it could be operated for more than four years. During this period, everything should be done to make Russia invest money in building a radar station in Baranoviche, in Belarus. V. Birkavs emphasized in his turn, that by signing this agreement Latvia could integrate quicker into Europe. He said advantage should be taken of the support of European international organizations -- the prime minister mentioned in particular the friendly attitude toward Latvia of the leaders of the Western European Union -- to conclude the agreement with Russia. V. Birkavs also reported what he had learned during his visit to the United States -- there is great interest concerning the Skrunda radar base, yet the leaders of foreign countries usually do not give concrete advice; such advice must be found by the Latvian Government itself. E. Inkens explained that the agreement would make it possible to more effectively control the functioning of the radar station. Currently, there is no such possibility to do this. Answering questions from the citizens gathered, V. Birkavs reported that Denmark has promised to send concrete material aid as well as its experts to control the environmental situation in Skrunda. [passage omitted] Specifying the facts due to which the Skrunda station ought to be closed immediately, in addition to those already known -- such as a greater instance of diseases among inhabitants than anywhere else, especially children, the negative influence upon the environment, and pollution -- the inspector for environment protection Igo Midrian also mentioned the great amount of freon which is used in the station's cold storage plants. This could create complications for Latvia when it ratifies the Montreal convention on ozone protection. Therefore, the agreement should foresee a clause stating that freon used by the radar station be put on the account of Russia. The inhabitants also expressed their dissatisfaction concerning the amount of compensation -- $2 million. According to them, the sum is too small. They also expressed a view that it is necessary to establish a special local medical center, because according to the head doctor at Skrunda hospital, Martins Abolins, diseases in this region have a more serious nature than in other areas of Latvia. V. Birkavs made a promise that the entire amount of the obtained compensation will be used to meet the needs of the inhabitants of the area effected by the radar station. He also allowed for the possibility that inhabitants who feel that their health is endangered be provided with a place to live outside of the area for the next four years. The operation of the Skrunda radar station is being felt in the area of Skrunda, as well as in the villages of Ranki, Laida, Rudbarzi, Snepele, Nikraca, and Turlava, including Kuldiga, which has 40,000 inhabitants.
