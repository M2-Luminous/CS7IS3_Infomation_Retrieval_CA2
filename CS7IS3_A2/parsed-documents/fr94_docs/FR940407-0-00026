FR940407-0-00026 FR940407-0-00004 In addition, the commenter raised several arguments concerning the legal validity of the reasons OSM set forth in its May 19, 1993, notification to Utah that provision II.1. of the September 4, 1993, agreement between Utah and OSM was contrary to law and therefore not binding on OSM. The Director notes these arguments but does not respond to them because they are outside the scope of this rulemaking to the extent that Utah did not submit in this amendment proposed rules incorporating provision II.1. of the agreement. 5. Jurisdiction Two commenters expressed concerns that Utah's proposed definitions of ``road,'' ``public road,'' and ``affected area,'' would inappropriately broaden the State's jurisdiction under the State Act to regulate ``public roads'' that service coal mining operations, coal exploration activities, and most haulage. The commenters noted that the term ``public road'' would no longer be applied in determining areas that should be permitted under the State Act since that term, as proposed, would be limited to defining areas unsuitable for mining. The commenters stated that, accordingly, the definition of ``public road,'' which includes criterion (d) indicating that a public road must meet construction standards for other public roads of the same classification in the local jurisdiction, will no longer be applied in determining whether or not a road should be permitted under the State Act. OSM disagrees with the comment that Utah's proposed definitions will inappropriately broaden the State's jurisdiction under the State Act to regulate ``public roads.'' As discussed above under part III.A. of this notice, on February 25, 1991, Utah adopted certain revisions to its definitions of ``road'' and ``public road'' at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;100&hyph;200, along with a supplemental policy statement that, considered together, would exempt all public roads from regulation under the Utah program. That adoption by Utah, however, did not take effect because it was never approved by OSM, as required by 30 CFR 732.17(g). Thus, the term ``public road,'' as adopted by Utah on February 25, 1991, was never effective as a matter of law. Consequently, Utah's proposed amendment does not serve to broaden its jurisdiction to regulate a ``public road.'' In addition, and more importantly, even if Utah's proposed definition of ``public road'' is mistakenly interpreted as broadening jurisdiction, it is not inappropriate since it is no less effective than the corresponding Federal definition of ``public road.'' 6. Public Roads and the Phrase ``Substantial (More Than Incidental)'' Public Use Two commenters stated that Utah's proposed definition of the term ``affected area'' appears to exclude public roads and requested that Utah further defined the phrase ``substantial (more than incidental)'' public use, as used in the definition of ``affected area.'' In addition, one of the commenters said the definition of ``affected area'' should be clarified to state a percentage of vehicle traffic other than mining that would constitute public use. OSM acknowledges the comment that Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' appears to exclude public roads. However, as discussed above under part III.C.1. of this notice, the editorial note in Utah's proposed definition of ``affected area'' has the effect of including in the ``affected area'' all roads that are included in the definition of ``coal mining and reclamation operations.'' OSM disagrees with the comments that Utah further define the phrase ``substantial (more than incidental)'' public use and that Utah provide a percentage of vehicle traffic other than mining that would constitute public use. In the preamble to a final rule establishing performance standards for roads associated with surface coal mining operations, OSM said that: State laws vary widely in their road classification systems. OSMRE [OSM] is concerned that roads constructed to serve mining operations not avoid compliance with the performance standards by being deeded to public entities. However, it is not OSMRE's intention automatically to extend jurisdiction over roads into the existing public road network. Jurisdiction under the Act [SMCRA] and applicability of the performance standards are best determined on a case-by-case basis by the regulatory authority.
