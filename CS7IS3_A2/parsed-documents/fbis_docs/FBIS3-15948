It also abolished the law on the elections of the autonomous republic's representative body, adopted by the Georgian Supreme Soviet on 9 July of that year, during Zviad Gamsakhurdia's rule, which stipulated a quota for deputies of Abkhaz ethnic origin higher than the total number of all other deputies. A decision was also taken to transfer the functions of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet to the Abkhaz council of ministers in exile, which is based in Tbilisi, having determined its status as a temporary body.
