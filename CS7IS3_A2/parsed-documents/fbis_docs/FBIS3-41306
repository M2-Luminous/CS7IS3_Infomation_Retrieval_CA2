During an interview on 10 February, the day after President Bill Clinton announced his National Drug Control Strategy, Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary for drug trafficking affairs, said that despite "the dramatic increase" of drug trafficking activities in Brazil in the past five years he "is not sure there is full consciousness in the country about the dangerous levels the problem has reached." According to the diplomat, who was the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia in the 1980's, Brazil today is--together with Germany, Switzerland, and China--one of the biggest suppliers of the chemicals used for manufacturing cocaine. The country also has become "one of the main routes for the transit of drugs, particularly on its way to Africa and Europe." Brazilian Ambassador to Washington Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima was informed during a recent conversation with another top-ranking U.S. official that the next annual report on drug trafficking the State Department will publish in a couple of months will say that during 1993 there was "a relaxation of controls" on drug trafficking in the country. Last week the ambassador asked the Foreign Ministry to supply him with information to reply to these allegations as well as Gelbard's public declarations. In Brasilia, official sources recognized that the seizure of an increasing volume of cocaine confirms the increase in drug trafficking activities in Brazil. "The state's incapacity and corruption and the judicial system's inefficiency also have limited government actions," an official explained. In any case, Gelbard's remarks were not well-received. "These remarks fail to recognize the country's continuous efforts to fight drug trafficking in very adverse circumstances," said one of the ministers' advisers interested in the problem. The official recalled, for instance, that the federal government recently created a Special Narcotics Secretariat to coordinate the fight on drug trafficking. The Americans should know of the difficulties we are going through, another top-ranking official said. He added: "Today our Federal Police drug trafficking control programs are almost entirely financed by the U.S. Government, which is shameful for the country." During the past three years, Washington assigned Brazil a yearly amount of nearly $1 million (out of a total of $80 million allocated for international cooperation to fight drug trafficking). Strictly speaking, Gelbard's remarks do not add anything new to what we already know. For the past few years Washington has been expressing concern about the expansion of drug trafficking activities in the Brazilian and Venezuelan Amazon regions. As Gelbard said last week: "Just as in other aspects of its economy, Brazil has the capacity to produce a large-scale drug trafficking economy." Besides, "it is the only Latin American country that manufactures all the products necessary to become self-sufficient in narcotics production, from precursors to epadu [Brazilian coca plant]." The fight on drug trafficking is one of the issues Washington wants to discuss during the hemispheric heads of state summit the Clinton administration is preparing for September.
