Hun Sen told AFP by phone that government troops were successful in a three-pronged attack on the radical faction's headquarters and the logistics base for guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia. Hun Sen said ten government soldiers were killed and more than ten wounded in the operation, most by mines. "One of the prongs moved very fast and had to wait for the other two. But today, the three met together and shook hands in Anlung Veng," Hun Sen said. Other government and diplomatic sources, however, said they were not sure whether the military had captured the base. But Hun Sen said the Khmer Rouge did not put up much resistance, but dispersed and escaped. The guerrillas were pushed 15 kilometers (10 miles) north of the base and were occasionally firing mortars at the government troops, Hun Sen said. A high ranking officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he thought government troops had occupied part of Anlung Veng. "But we are not sure whether Anlung Veng is 100 per cent liberated or not," the officer said. A Western diplomat said that, while he believed the government was close, he thought the troops were moving slowly because of booby traps and mines.
