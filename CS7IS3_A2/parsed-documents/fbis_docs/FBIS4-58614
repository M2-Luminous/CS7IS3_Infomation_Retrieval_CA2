The Plan and Budget Commission has worked about 74 days in three shifts. In the final nights before the budget was presented to the Majles the discussions continued until dawn. Often when the Majles appeared to be in recess the commissions were active. Even during the 10 Days of Dawn celebration, when the Majles was closed for a week, all the commissions continued working, and the deputies submitted about 2,000 proposals to the Plan and Budget Commission. During the period of studying the budget notes, some of the commissions worked very hard, presenting a special opinion about every row and contacting and consulting with experts from the Plan and Budget Organization and the relevant ministries. Here, after the Plan and Budget Commission, one may also mention the Agriculture Commission, for most of the recommendations and requests for change came from this commission. Along with these positive characteristics, there are some points that cannot be easily passed over. One deputy told our correspondent: During the budget discussions and debates, a small number of the deputies do not pay enough attention to the nation's interests and the ceiling on commitments. They give priority to their own electoral districts. For example, with regard to the creation of power plants and new electrical power networks, they only consider their own regions as having priority and make recommendations for it. Another example is that the steel projects, which are being pursued in three provinces, are not needed by the country, and there is no export market for them either. It would be very appropriate if the deputies would only consider the nation's interests when submitting their proposals. Dr. Kamran's Comments on the Answer From the Ministry of Education and Training Following the publication of the answer from the deputy minister for education in the Ministry of Education and Training to the comments by Dr. Kamran in the newspaper RESALAT on 12/11/1272 [1 March 1994], he said in a contact with our correspondent: What was said concerning the improper spending of credits from Note 55 had nothing to do with the Ministry of Education and Training. This organization has no specialist relationship with the Majles Islamic Art and Guidance Commission. The protest from the respected deputy minister of education in this ministry was beside the point. Also, this year organizations have also been approved by the commission under Note 55, which have a direct relationship with the Majles specialist commission.
