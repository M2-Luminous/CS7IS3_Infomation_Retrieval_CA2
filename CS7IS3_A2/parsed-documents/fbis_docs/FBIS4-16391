The Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and those accompanying him on the trip were seen off at Baku's Bina Airport by Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Republic's Supreme Soviet; Afiaddin Dzhalilov, deputy chairman of the Republic's Supreme Soviet; deputy prime ministers, ministers, and other officials. The Azerbaijani leader granted an interview to our correspondent Beshir Sherifov at the airport. [Begin recording] [Sherifov] Mr. President, you are leaving for an official visit to Moscow and will hold talks with the heads of state of CIS countries. What will the benefit of these talks be for Azerbaijan? [Aliyev] As you know, we are going to attend the regular meeting of the CIS. The CIS heads of state will discuss matters on the agenda of the meeting. We will take part in these discussions. A number of important problems will be discussed there. We have our own views on these issues. However, during this meeting I mainly intend to raise once again the need to prevent Armenia's aggression against Azerbaijan. This is because, as I said, a war between CIS members is abnormal, it is an abnormal situation. Therefore, this issue is my main concern. I consider it more important than other issues, because Armenia's Armed Forces offensive against Azerbaijan is continuing. Intensive attacks were also launched yesterday. Before arriving here at the airport in the morning, I contacted the commanders at the front. The Armenian Armed Forces are continuing their attacks today. They are not stopping their aggressive actions and intentions. I intend to raise these issues in strong terms. I also want to state that our military units and fighters are able to resist the attacks of the Armenian Armed Forces and are dealing them deserved replies and blows. However, sadly enough, the Armenian side still fails to draw the necessary conclusion from this. I addressed the nation and the entire world on 12 April on Armenia's aggression. Reports coming in yesterday showed that my appeal to the world has been positively received. We have already received reaction from various countries. However, what pleases me most is that our people, the Azerbaijani citizens, have highly appraised this address. The commander of the troops headquarters at the front, deputy defense minister, commander of the troops in Agdere [Mardakertskiy] and Geranboy [Shaumyanovskiy], and other commanders informed me last night that after my address many of the deserters returned to the Army yesterday and are taking part in the fighting. A certain sector informed me yesterday that more than 100 deserters have returned. I highly appreciate such a thing. And therefore, I gave orders yesterday that they be pardoned for the crime they committed by deserting. And, now through the television I am addressing our young people who have deserted or evaded the mobilization: Let them come to their senses and follow the path of those young people who have taken the correct path. I was very pleased when informed at night that the deserters are now returning to their units. This means that our people and youth are acting with reason and conscience. I believe that some of them might have fallen onto the wrong path out of objective reasons, inexperience, or youthfulness. However, what is satisfying is that they are now becoming aware of their responsibilities. In one word, our army units are standing firm on the fronts. The attacks resumed early this morning. However, these attacks are being checked and repulsed, and I am sure that it will continue to be thus and our homeland will be defended. However, as I said on 12 April and I am saying now, we want to put an end to the war. I have invited the Armenian side to peace talks. After an hour I will be in Moscow and there I will make the same call to the leadership of both Armenia and Russia, and other CIS leaders. Let us see. I have not lost hope, and I expect that our views would produce some positive results. [Sherifov] Cables arriving at Azerbaijan television prove that your address to the nation was well received and the people are expecting much from your meeting in Moscow. [Aliyev] I also have such an expectation. We will see. [end recording]
