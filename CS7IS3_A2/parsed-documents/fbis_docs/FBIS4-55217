However, the authentic Macedonian flag is printed on the invitation for applications to this fair. The organizers of the Macedonian stand at this fair have confirmed that the invitation had the "trimmed" sun from the Macedonian flag printed on it, which is seen as a provocation! Today, the Macedonian Ambassador in Great Britain Risto Nikovski will ask for an official explanation from the CITEX organizers. It is unclear as to who made the change of symbols on the flag, printed on the invitation for the participation to the fair.
