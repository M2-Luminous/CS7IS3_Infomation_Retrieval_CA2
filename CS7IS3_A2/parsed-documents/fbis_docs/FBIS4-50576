The amount of funds drawn in that year was equal to the total amount for the 14 previous years. In the same year, more than 83,000 foreign-funded projects were approved, involving $111.4 billion, of which $27.5 billion was actually used to run the projects. The increases in these three figures over the previous year were 70.6, 91.7, and 150 percent respectively. Meanwhile, in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as the supply of office floor space to consumers related to foreign business firms fell short of the demand, many potential renters were looking for leases. Some high-ranking officials said jokingly that this was the third "foreign" tide since 1979, characterized by the influx of foreign funds! The years 1984 and 1988 saw two peaks of foreign investment in China. Now, after ups and downs, this upsurge in the great tide has finally gained enough momentum to bring forward the third peak. So far, the actual amount of foreign funds drawn in has reached $61.8 billion and the number of foreign-invested enterprises exceeds 100,000, employing a labor force of nearly 10 million and accounting for nearly 8 percent of the country's gross industrial output value and about one-third of the country's import-export volume. Beijing Jeep, Xian Jansen [2799 2773], Shenzhen Kangjia [1660 0163], Tianjin Shike [0670 0344], and Shanghai Volkswagen... all these brand names and the products bearing these brands have long been regarded by the Chinese public with great relish. At present, a new, multilevel, omnidirectional opening-up pattern is taking shape in China, integrating coastal areas, areas along rivers and borders, and hinterland provinces and regions. Amid this process, investments by foreign businessmen are showing the following new characteristics: --The sources of investments are diversified and investments are imported from more than 120 countries and areas, of which Hong Kong (including Macao), Taiwan, the United States, and Japanese interests are the largest investors. --Investment targets are extended from coastal areas to the hinterland because the proportion of foreign investments in the hinterland in the total foreign investments in the country has increased by more than 10 percent. --Investment forms tend to be diversified. Since 1992, nearly 30 Sino-foreign joint ventures and a few stockholding companies aiming at investment in productive projects have received approval for their establishment and more than 50 enterprises have issued category B and category H stocks abroad. By issuing stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Maanshan Iron and Steel Corporation managed to raise capital of nearly 4 billion Hong Kong dollars on a single occasion. Efforts are being made to explore other investment instruments, such as funds, bonds, and trusts. The formation of this new pattern has been followed by a great shift in the focus of investment: --The investment structure has been further optimized in the wake of the shift from short-cycle, appropriate technology and quick- return medium and small projects to capital- and technology-intensive medium- and long-term large projects. The average investment value per project, which used to be less than $900,000 before 1991, increased to nearly $1.35 million last year, with a number of investment projects of rather great size beginning in infrastructure and basic industries. Of the FORTUNE 500 largest enterprises, 52 companies have entered China to make investments in 26 trades, involving nearly $4 billion. This accounts for about 50 percent of all U.S. investments in China. Technological cooperative projects run by IBM, Dupont, Bell, Siemens, Philips, Mitsubishi, and Matsushita have been launched in China in turn and all these investors are very eagerly expanding their investment scale. --The field of investment is expanding daily. In the past, over 90 percent of foreign-funded investments were in productive type projects. According to last year's incomplete statistics, however, at least 20 percent of the projects and 30 percent of the investment funds have now gone to real estate, development of large tracts of land, tourist facilities, and other branches of tertiary industry, such as transport, banking, insurance, consultative services, and commercial retail sales. After the Japanese Yaohan International Marketing Group's arrival in Pudong, some open cities have now begun to allow foreign businessmen to invest in large commercial building projects and some information and consultative service companies and accountant firms, run using Chinese and foreign capital, have also been allowed to start business. Foreign businessmen are even encouraged to run newly opened sea transport routes and invest in oil fields in North China, including the Tarim Basin oil field. --In addition to this, we have also seen a shift of focus from separate, single investment projects to joint investment or combined regional development projects. The introduction of foreign funds has, to a certain extent, made up for the shortages in funds to run construction projects in China. At the same time, the import of foreign advanced technology, equipment, and management know-how has filled gaps in some industries and foreign-funded enterprises have become the mainstays in such industries as auto manufacturing, elevator, color TV tubes, and microelectronics. The introduction of foreign capital into China has given an impetus to the transformation of the operational mechanism in Chinese enterprises. Foreign-funded enterprises have set a good example to local ones and many old Chinese enterprises have been reinvigorated through joint projects with foreign firms. China's number one leading clock and watch manufacturer, the Polaris Group, which faced an impasse before introducing foreign capital, is once again thriving and the Harbin "Suibao Thermal Flask" has also made its might felt once again after introducing overseas capital. The introduction of foreign capital has also helped expand export trade producing foreign exchange earnings and increasing financial revenue. According to customs statistics, the import-export volume of foreign-funded enterprises alone totaled $43.75 billion in 1992, equal to the country's total import-export volume 10 years ago. Last year, China's tax revenue contributed by taxpayers related to foreign capital totaled 20.5 billion yuan, an increase of 80 percent over the previous year. So we may say that the third "foreign" tide signifies the most exciting and influential development in China's accelerating marketization and internationalization process. Only the Fittest Will Survive However, one cannot be sure that no negative factors arise as the "foreign" tide surges ahead. There is no doubt that we have faced some problems when introducing foreign funds. The following are some of the prominent problems: The distribution of foreign funds is still irrational. Medium and small projects in general processing industries still make up rather too big a proportion of all the investments, whereas relatively few key investment projects have been launched to develop economic sectors which badly need to be developed. What is more, investments are dispersed and investment projects which have been initiated blindly are quite common. For example, in 1992, a great influx of foreign funds went into the real estate industry. This was because some localities which were very eager to draw in foreign funds laid undue stress on "quantity" rather than on "quality," and they did not know enough about the distribution of foreign funds, the technology involved in foreign-funded projects, their scale, and the market conditions. Control over importing foreign funds has yet to be intensified. Some foreign businessmen do not keep their promise to provide the funds to finance investment projects, or the funds are recalled soon after they were laid out, whereas the enterprises concerned continue to enjoy the preferential treatment which has already been granted. Some foreign-funded enterprises claim to be suffering losses but many of them are actually making profits, claiming to be suffering losses only to avoid tax payment. Such practices lead to a remarkable drain on state-owned assets. Some foreign-funded enterprises do not export their products according to the ratio as prescribed in the contracts signed, trying instead to enlarge their share of the domestic market and thus reducing the state's foreign exchange earnings. In 1992 alone, the gap between import and export value by foreign-funded enterprises was as wide as $1 billion and management-labor disputes and industrial accidents happen from time to time. In the final analysis, these can be attributed to some other main causes beside the unsound system of laws and regulations. Certain localities have arbitrarily formulated their preferential policies, contract examination and approval procedures are not strict enough, and in some cases the procedures are so loose that whatever is submitted will be approved without exception. In addition, the undue stress laid on preferential treatment in terms of policy has landed some state-owned enterprises, as well as township and town enterprises, in an unfavorable position in the market. The investment environment in some localities does not seem to be good enough as transport, energy, and telecommunications facilities are still underdeveloped; regulations and laws governing the use of foreign funds are not sound enough; and the market mechanism has not been established. This hinders the normal operation of foreign- funded enterprises and the inflow of foreign capital and, as a result, some big consortia with intentions of investing in China are still hesitating to really make a move. Many foreign businessmen said they are very eagerly looking forward to a healthy and orderly environment investment which encourages fair competition, since a few "preferential" measures alone can never substitute for a long-term policy. State Statistical Bureau recently conducted a sample survey of more than 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises and these selected enterprises called strongly for action as soon as possible to step up the establishment of a system of laws concerning foreign investors and increase the transparency in the process of importing foreign funds. Let the "Foreign" Tide Surge Still Higher Some time ago some people were doubtful as to whether or not "the amount of foreign capital imported into this country is too much or not enough." In this regard, an authoritative source of the foreign capital administration department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted that China must be one of the few developing countries that have imported the largest amount of foreign capital in absolute value. But, while other countries started importing foreign capital in the 1960's, China did not make a move until the early 1980's, not to mention the fact that we lost the golden opportunity around 1989 for various reasons. In terms of the per capita amount of imported foreign capital, China ranks far behind Southeast Asian countries and the actual amount of investment made by foreign businessmen accounts for only about 10 percent of the total value of the country's fixed assets. Therefore, objectively speaking, the amount of foreign capital imported into the country is not too much but, instead, is not enough. The survey concerned reveals that China enjoys the following major advantages in attracting foreign investors: An ample supply of labor force, a fast growing economy, and an incomparably vast market. A newly founded small development zone, with an area of only 0.5 aquare km, in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, which perviously was little known to foreign investors, has attracted investors from 10 countries and areas, not to mention the special economic zones along the coast and the large municipalities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai. A city in Zhejiang Province nicknamed "the pocket-sized entry port" attracted a host of foreign businessmen as soon as it declared its intention to invite foreign investment. The Hong Kong Wharf (Holdings) Group owned by the late world-class shipping magnate Y.K. Pao, and other big companies, such as General Motors, Chengta [2973 1129], and Mitsui, have invested $10 to $100 million U.S. dollars in that city. This has fully proved foreign investors' great interest in China as well as our country's appeal to foreign investors. The problem is how are we going to ensure better quality of foreign investment projects while trying to attract more foreign capital. The shift of focus from quantity to quality is a gradual process. Our people used to be afraid that importing foreign capital would result in the occupation of our market by foreign interests, that foreign-funded enterprises would squeeze out state-owned enterprises or, in brief, that foreign investors would take away all the benefits. Views like these have been on some people's minds all the time during the opening-up process. A city in Jiangsu Province prepared a list of enterprises, with extremely low economic returns, which were about to close down, and they were recommended as partners for joint ventures with foreign investors. Meanwhile, those enterprises with good economic returns and great potential for development were "protected" by being excluded from the joint venture candidate list. As a result, over a long period, foreign- funded enterprises in that city have had no chance to thrive. Some joint ventures which were running big projects and had already had large factory buildings built could not start operation simply because the government department concerned hesitated to give them the green light. In fact, it is fair for us to pay some price to attract foreign businessmen to make investments in our country. The purpose of investment is to make money, and only if you are willing to give away some "benefits" will you be able to dispel others' doubts and misgivings, will investors be willing to invest in large-scale and high-tech projects, and will we thus enjoy domestic prosperity. Now that Coca-Cola and McDonald's have come, the beverage and fast food industries are thriving on an unprecedented scale. Motorola's huge investments have enabled hundreds of thousands of Chinese to use the wonderful telephone pagers. If the Shanghai Volkswagen had not been transformed into a Sino-German joint venture, this plant, we are afraid, would not have been able to produce Santana-brand cars so soon. What is our greatest advantage? It is the enormous market with a 1.1-billion population. So "market in exchange for capital" and "market in exchange for technology" are the only natural choices before us when we are to capitalize on foreign funds.
