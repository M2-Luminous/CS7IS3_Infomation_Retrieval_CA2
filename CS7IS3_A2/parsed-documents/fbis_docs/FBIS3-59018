Senior Conservatives said yesterday that the party would have far less than the 1 million pounds it spent five years ago when Margaret Thatcher launched her doomed crusade against the Brussels bureaucracy. The indications are that for the first time in modern electoral history, Labour will not be financially outgunned. It spent just over 400,000 pounds centrally in 1989 and is poised to fight the June 9 Euro-poll on an equal footing with the Tories. One Tory source said: "Money is a big problem. There is no slush fund, and we cannot borrow another million. We are right up against our overdraft limit." The cash crisis, due to a slump in morale among party activists, has forced a drastic reworking of the campaign for the council elections, on May 5 and the European poll. In contrast to 1989, when Central Office spent heavily on a nationwide anti-Brussels poster campaign, funds will be concentrated on the 87 Euro-constituencies. Under electoral law, a ceiling of around 30,000 pounds applies locally to each candidate for a Euro-seat. This sum is still big enough, however, for Sir Norman Fowler the party chairman, to divert some money from the centre. Conservative MEPs [members of the European Parliament] have received around 440,000 pounds from the European Parliament this year to promote its work, but this cannot be used for campaigning and cannot be spent after February 9. "We'd rather a constituency spent 10,000 pounds on keeping its agent in place or a couple of leaflet drops than put the money towards a page of advertising in a national newspaper," a source said. Neither Mr Major nor Sir Norman, however, intends to give up without a fight. Central Office will move to a war footing well before the elections for district councils and London boroughs, and party chiefs are treating the two elections as a single campaign. They concede that they have been blown off course by the uproar over Back to Basics and taxation, but intend to go on the offensive as soon as the dust settles. "What we want is the Labour Party voting against us clause after clause in the Criminal Justice Bill, attacking us over deregulation, along with the steady drip of good economic news," an insider said. In 1989 the Tories lost 13 seats on a vote split of Labour 40 percent, Conservatives 35 percent. With their support now under 30 percent in the opinion polls, Mr Major faces another drubbing, and some projections suggest that his party will be reduced to a rump of around a dozen seats.
