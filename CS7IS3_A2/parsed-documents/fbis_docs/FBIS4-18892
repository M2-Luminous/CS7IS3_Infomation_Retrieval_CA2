For some weeks now, Bosnia was no longer making the headlines, Sarajevo no longer featured in TV news programs, and, following so many horrors broadcast live, the media's silence authorized us to believe that the peacemaking process was by now under way in the former Yugoslavia. True, for the past two months the snipers in the hills have no longer used Sarajevo's women and children for target practice. The threat of intervention was enough to force the Serbs to move back their outposts. Restoring the NATO deterrent was enough to enable Russian diplomacy to do its share, thus giving rise to a genuine hope of peace. We must volley the ball, Western governments and the United Nations immediately told themselves, we must everywhere apply the formula which worked so well in Sarajevo, we must preempt the unavoidable resumption of hostilities. What happened, instead? What happened was that, while the Americans' and Russians' bipolar diplomacy got bogged down in the complicated setting up of federations and confederations -- without thereby effectively involving the Serbs, and without solving the key problem of the territory's division -- the United Nations did not succeed in mustering, worldwide, the 10,000 blue helmets requested by general Rose (though, in fact, many more were actually needed) to pull apart the opposing forces immediately and ensure the surveillance of the worst hotspots. Italy was never asked to contribute to this effort, and this was a lucky break, considering the political climate in which such a difficult decision would have had to be made. However, a much weightier factor than our absence, or than others' half-heartedness, was the confirmation of the United States' unwillingness to commit land forces in Bosnia unless agreements had already been subscribed to and guaranteed by the parties involved. Which is tantamount to saying never. Washington's unspoken message (which was rendered unavoidable by the opinion polls, and by President Clinton's volatile relationship with Congress) must have played a part in relighting the fuse and unwittingly convincing the Serbs, and perhaps also the Muslims, that the use of arms was still a viable option -- that they could start again, perhaps setting out from the Gorazde enclave. This is a major provocation, given that a year ago Gorazde was specifically declared a "safety area" by the UN Security Council. Therefore, the massacre which has been going on now for days, and the imminent fall of the town overcrowded with refugees, have convinced Butrus-Ghali, and then NATO, to launch the first limited allied attack against Serbian land positions since the four Serbian pirate aircraft were shot down. This irreproachable decision, which might have been rendered unnecessary if, over the past few weeks, the West had resolutely jumped the peace train, is now again giving rise to all sorts of questions: Will the anti-Serb deterrent work this time too? How will the Russians react? Will it be possible to resume negotiations? Above all: Is there a real chance of peace unless America makes use of her armed credibility also in the field? A sad question, this latter one, for Europeans.
