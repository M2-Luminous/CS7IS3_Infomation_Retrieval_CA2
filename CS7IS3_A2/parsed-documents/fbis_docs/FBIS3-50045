[Ivanov] During the 1989-1994 period there is a continuing tendency to reduce the country's military budget. If in 1989 it was 8.1 percent of the national budget in 1990 it decreased to 6.7 percent. In 1991 and 1992 it was 7 percent, while in 1993 it dropped to 5.7 percent. What is envisaged for 1994 is within the framework of 6.5 percent of the national budget, an amount that is smaller than the 1990 budget. We regress to a lower level. This is as far as absolute terms are is concerned. The amount is actually much less when you consider the inflation since 1990. [Spiridonov] Is this tendency characteristic only of our country or also of our neighbors? [Ivanov] As far as I know there is no such tendency among our neighbors. [Spiridonov] The military themselves felt the insecurity and irregularity of receiving funds from the Ministry of Defense. [Ivanov] For almost six months (until June, when the 1993 budget was adopted), the army functioned with one twelfth of its 1992 budget. Throughout that entire period the prices and inflation were completely different and the overall economic situation was much more complex. As a result, at the end of the first half of 1993 the army lagged behind in payments for supplies, services, and repairs, both locally and internationally, by more than $600 million. This fact had an exceptionally negative effect on the suppliers of the various branches of the army and resulted in refusal to supply the army with various materials. I mean food, clothing, water, electric power, and telephone services. The delay in the payments prompted the suppliers in question to refuse the army's supply orders. This process continued until the end of the year and produced our unpaid debt of 480 million leva. [Spiridonov] The issue of the army wages is probably in the same category? [Ivanov] All the established terms of paying army personnel were violated. Pay for army officers, non-commissioned officers, military employees, and soldiers was delayed by 5-10 days. Another paradox emerged: In July 1993 the pay of the officers and non- commissioned officers was delayed by two weeks. Naturally, this created great tension in the army units. You know that in the remote garrisons, and not only there, the young military families are in a very grave situation. Spouses are unemployed and the families rely on a single salary. [passage omitted] [Spiridonov] What resources does the army need in 1994? [Ivanov] After most responsibly reviewing the real situation in the army and in accordance with the instructions of the Finance Ministry on preparing the 1994 budget we prepared the budget of the Ministry of Defense. All state institutions are familiar with it. It is the most economic variant, which has been coordinated with the army's real minimal needs. [Spiridonov] Are you satisfied with the defense means envisaged by the Finance Ministry's draft budget? [Ivanov] The total military budget proposed by the Finance Ministry amounts to 12.7 billion leva. It hardly covers a part of the army's real needs. Priority again was given to the everyday maintenance of the army, and not to the army's technical supply, for which only 5 percent of the budget has been envisaged. [passage omitted]
