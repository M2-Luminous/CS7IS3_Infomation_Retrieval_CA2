Aliyev was speaking on Sunday as he received the special Russian presidential envoy Vladimir Kazimirov at talks on Nagorno-Karabakh in Baku. The Russian diplomat arrived in the Azerbaijani capital from Iran, where he had had consultations with that country's foreign ministry officials. He said consultations with the Turkish Foreign Ministry were due to be held shortly. President Aliyev would like the current cease-fire to be used to speed up the process of negotiations. At the same time Aliyev said that Azerbaijan's conditions for a final political agreement remained unchanged -- Armenian armed detachments must be withdrawn from captured territories and Azerbaijani refugees returned to their homes. President Aliyev promised that supply lines would be restored and the safety of Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenians as citizens of Azerbaijan ensured. President Aliyev said that a discussion of Nagorno-Karabakh's future status would depend on the comprehensive implementation of all those requirements.
