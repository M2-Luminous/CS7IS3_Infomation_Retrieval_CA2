The Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION in English on 11 April on page 11 carries an almost identical full-page advertisement, omitting the last two sentences. The text is as follows: "A message from the TEC to all public servants including members of the security forces in South Africa, the TBVC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states and the self-governing territories "In less than three weeks' time South Africa will be participating in a unique and historic event: the elections of 26/27/28 April 1994. "It is in the interests of all South Africans that this crucial and important phase of the South African transition to a non-racial and non-sexist democracy be peaceful and successful. "This election will relegate past differences to history and usher in a new era of hope, reconcilliation and prosperity for all South Africans. "At the same time the TEC is aware of: "-- The increasing concern among public servants, including members of the security forces, about their future, pensions and salaries. "-- Strikes and rumours about strikes. "-- Concern about promotions and job security. "The TEC has already taken concrete steps to address these concerns and problems: "1. Public servants are being made aware of the provisions of the Constitution of South Africa which comes into effect on 27 April 1994. In terms of section 236 of the Constitution, a person who was immediately before 27 April employed by any department of state (including a police force), administration, military force or other institution performing government functions shall continue in such employment. Furthermore, there is clear and unambiguous provision that -- "(a) the terms and conditions of such employment shall continue to apply; "(b) the pensionable salary or pensionable salary scale of such a public servant shall not be reduced; and "(c) there shall be a Public Service Commission which shall exercise its powers relating to public administration fairly, impartially and independently. "2. Although the Constitution comes into operation only on 27 April 1994, the TEC has, on the basis of the provisions of the Constitution guaranteed all public servants their jobs, salaries and pensions. "3. Certain steps have already been taken by the TEC in preparation for the implementation of the Constitution: a task force of the TEC was appointed to deal specifically with the concerns of public servants and to co-ordinate the participation of all public servant organisations in the preparation for rationalisation of the various public services. "4. This task force has already intervened in specific instances to assist in restoring normality and addressing concerns of public servants. "5. Where necessary, as in the case of the concerns of members of the South African Police and Correctional Services, the Management Committee of the TEC will meet organisations of public servants to address problems. "The is convinced that the elections cannot and must not be postponed. It is vital that the elections proceed in an effective and organised fashion, without any disruption. "Public servants are essential to the success of the elections. "Your dedication to serving our country and your skills are indispensable to a successful transition. "In the interests of a peaceful and democratic future for our country. "The TEC urgently appeals to all public servants "a) to accept the assurance from the TEC that their future is secure after 27 April 1994 and that in the meantime any urgent problem will receive the necessary attention; "b) to give their full support and participation to the administration and security of the election; and "c) to take part in the process of rationalisation of the public services, to accept responsibility for ensuring a democratic and peaceful transition, and to refrain from any action, particularly strike action, which can benefit only those who want to disrupt the elections. "A successful election will lead to a stable country and an effective government that can, as a matter of urgency, attend to the concerns and problems of public servants. "The TEC calls on all public servants, including members of the security forces, to play their part."
