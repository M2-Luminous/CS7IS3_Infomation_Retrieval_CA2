Sources inside and outside the commission confirmed this week that they have information tying Mtetwa to the receipt of weapons from the network alleged to have been set up by renegade South African Police members. The police portfolio in the Natal cabinet has been at the centre of this week's battle between the ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in Natal over regional executive positions. It has also emerged that the government of national unity is keeping new details of the involvement of key former South African Police [SAP] and IFP officials in political violence under close wraps for fear of the political repercussions. The MAIL & GUARDIAN has been leaked the second report of the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] task group on hit squads in the KwaZulu Police which names IFP PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] leader Themba Khoza, IFP PWV parliamentarian Humphrey Ndlovu, and 16 senior KwaZulu (KZP) policemen who are said to have taken part in hit squad activity. No action has been taken on this, although it is dated March 29. And a new Goldstone report, which was expected to have been made public, has been sent to the international team investigating the involvement of IFP and SAP officials in "third force" activity. This report, dealing with covert operations against anti- apartheid activists, corruption and other criminal activities by policemen, was expected to be released three weeks ago, according to sources in the ANC. Sources in the commission have confirmed that such a report was drawn up. "There was going to be a report but it was decided it was inappropriate for Goldstone to have his own report now that the international team was investigating," said a source close to the minister of safety and security. Goldstone is understood to have discussed the report with the minister, Sidney Mufamadi. Judge Richard Goldstone confirmed his commission had handed over the relevant information to the international team. "All information has been submitted to the international team," he said. Asked if his commission would produce further reports on the matter, he said: "It depends very much on what comes out of the international investigation. There may or may not be, I really can't say." The second report by the TEC task group investigating hitsquads in the KwaZulu Police recommends the immediate suspension of the deputy commissioner of the KZP, Major General Sipho Mathe, on grounds that he aided and concealed the activities of hit men in the KZP. Among other things, he is accused of "disgraceful conduct" by failing to investigate hit squad claims against three senior Inkatha members. The report paints a frightening picture of the systematic concealment, failure to investigate and conniving at hit squad activity in the KZP by senior officers. It recommends the suspension of two KZP brigadiers, C.P. Mzimela and B.L. Ndlovu, and a district commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sipho Mdluli. It also calls for charges of defeating the ends of justice to be investigated against L.A. Hlengwa, a former policeman and currently an IFP head office official in Ulundi. Also recommended is the suspension of two majors, two captains and a lieutenant and the investigation of a brigadier, a major and two captains. The TEC report says an investigation into a massacre at Nqutu, Natal by a KwaZulu policeman, Lieutenant Mbatha, "revealed that the rest of the suspects were members of a hit squad that operated from hostels in East Rand and that Themba Khoza and Humphrey Ndlovu were involved in the planning of the massacre." The reluctance to take firm action against "third force" suspects reflects differences in both the ANC and the government about how to deal with criminal rightwing elements in the security forces. In the ANC, there are those who are urging a "softly-softly" approach, in an attempt to win these elements over. They appear to have the backing of State President Nelson Mandela. Others feel the quick removal of those who were involved in orchestrating violence is the only way to finally stop those involved in political destabilisation and get to the bottom of the political violence which has rocked South Africa since 1990. The debate around indemnity is also crucial. The authors of the TEC report urge the TEC to grant selective indemnity to witnesses who are prepared to give further details of "third force" activity. They warn that without being able to offer potential witnesses indemnity, there is "little or no prospect of rooting out those orchestrating this significant cause of political violence." The government has made no substantial moves towards addressing this particular indemnity issue. Senior former South African Police officers are pushing for a blanket indemnity for all political crimes after a cut off date, without disclosure of the crime. They apparently hope this will prevent lower ranking officers from testifying against their seniors. The ANC and human rights activists have been pushing for the full disclosure by those involved in political violence to help them with their investigations. At the moment, the government is taking the view that they cannot defy the generals without destabilising the security forces -- something they are not prepared to risk. Meanwhile, all Judge Goldstone's witnesses -- the mystery "Qs" who were sent to Denmark for safety in the wake of the release of the "third force" report -- were brought back to South Africa three weeks ago.
