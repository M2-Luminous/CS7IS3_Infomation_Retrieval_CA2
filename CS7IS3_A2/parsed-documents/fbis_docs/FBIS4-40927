Mr. Kozyrev said he discussed the matter with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the two men made public their decision at a joint press conference. Mr. Kozyrev said that a second round of Geneva talks could give a fresh impetus to the political settlement process and noted that he and his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd, agreed that the meeting in Geneva should be held before the G-7 meeting in Naples. Next week the liaison group on the mapping of Bosnia will hold a new meeting, Mr. Kozyrev reported, adding that the sides should work out a common position on the issue as soon as possible.
