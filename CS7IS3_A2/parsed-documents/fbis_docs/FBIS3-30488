Gaber announced that a high government delegation of the Russian Federation will arrive in Macedonia at the beginning of March, which is also when the embassy will be opened in Skopje. In its announcement, among the rest, the Macedonian Foreign Ministry says: "The Russian Federation was among the first to recognize the Republic of Macedonia under its constitutional name, and sponsored the resolution for the acceptance of our country to the United Nations. The support from the Russian Federation of Macedonia's request for admission as a full member of the CSCE has been continuous, which represents a clear confirmation that an independent and sovereign Republic of Macedonia is an unsurpassable factor of peace and stability in the region, and broader in Europe." As it is known, the Russian Federation recognized the Republic of Macedonia in August, 1992, while it is establishing diplomatic relations after a year and half. Otherwise, the Republic of Macedonia has been recognized under its constitutional name by 11 other countries, besides the Russian Federation.
