However, as the North side again demanded the issue of announcing a joint communique, the contact is undergoing difficulties [nanhang] in its initial stages. In a keynote speech, Pak Yong-su, head of the North Korean delegation, claimed that the North side's withdrawal of its four- point demands during the sixth contact was an epoch-making step and that the South side should therefore show a compromising stance by accepting the North side's demand. Noting that the two sides agree on the principle of exchanging special envoys, he again proposed that a joint communique be announced. To this, Song Yong-tae, senior delegate of our side, said that procedural matters for exchanging special envoys should be settled in consideration of the urgency resulting from the lack of time before 21 March, when the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks are scheduled to be held. He put forward a compromising plan [cholchungan] which stipulates the issue of achieving national reunification based on the three-point principles of independence, peace, and great national unity, which includes the missions of the special envoys, as well as the principle of great national unity and national independence which the North side proposed additionally. Delegate Song Yong-tae stressed that our side's compromising plan has taken the North side's opinion into full consideration and is designed to promptly resolve the disputed problems, to finalize the date of exchanging special envoys, and to settle all procedural matters.
