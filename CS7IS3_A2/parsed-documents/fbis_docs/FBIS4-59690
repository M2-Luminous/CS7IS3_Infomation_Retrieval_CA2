They have been violating the will of the people and their values throughout the era in which they were in control. They, as well our people, realize the extent of the tolerance, brotherhood, and generosity displayed by the forces of unity and legitimacy toward the deceived ones who directed their weapons against unity and legitimacy. Can our people believe these degenerate rumors after seeing with their own eyes the tolerance of the leader president in 'Imran and the tolerance of our forces, the forces of unity, in al-Dali', Musaymir, Mukayras, Abyan, and (?Rassal). With all honesty and sincerity, we stress that the forces of unity and legitimacy view as equal all citizens of Yemen. They have always been, and will remain, the protectors of the citizens and their property and honor, and the protectors of the people's sacred goal in defending unity and Constitutional legitimacy.
