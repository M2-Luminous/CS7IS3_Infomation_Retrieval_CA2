We have news from reporter Kim Han-chu regarding the people's feelings on national security. [Reporter Kim] This is reporter Kim from Myongdong. Now, Myongdong Street, where a darkness is deeply closed, is overflowing with citizens, who want to enjoy their early summer time in the middle of the city. The street is very active as ever, and, also, is very crowded with customers, who visit stores, as well as many cars that visit there. I feel the citizens' calmness from their walk on the street. The Myongdong street is very active and as calm as ever compared with the overseas atmosphere that has been rapidly changing as a result of the North Korean nuclear issue. However, citizens do not seem indifferent to the North Korean nuclear issue. I will have conversations, for a moment, with citizens who walk on the street regarding their feelings on the present situation, which is recently being called a crisis situation based on rumors of war. How are you? People say that the present situation on the Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that war may break out on the peninsula? [Unidentified man-on-the-street #1] I don't think that a war can break out. Also, I don't think that North Korea or the United States are reckless. It is important for North Korea to maintain its system. Therefore, North Korea will not easily invade South Korea. [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, what do expect will be the result? [Unidentified man #1] I think that we can easily defeat North Korea. As one a military reservist, I, in my view, think that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces combat capability is more superior to that of North Korea. [Reporter Kim] They say that people are very indifferent to the present situation on the Korean peninsula. What do you think? [Unidentified man #1] I also think that people are too indifferent to it. I think that the key reason for people's indifference to the present situation is due to the military leadership's intervention into politics in the past, or due to politicians' abuse of national security for the preservation of their power. Anyway, I think that we should be fully ready to deal with North Korea in order to avoid a war. [Reporter Kim] I will have an interview with another man. You came to the Myongdong street with your family. I have one question for you. People say that the present situation on the Korean peninsula is a crisis situation. Do you think that a war may break out? [Unidentified man #2] You mean a war. I don't think that a war will break out. [Reporter Kim] Do you have a special reason for such an opinion? [Unidentified man #2] If a war breaks out, we can win a victory because of our strong national power. Anyway, I don't think that a war will break out on the peninsula. [Reporter Kim] If a war breaks out, what do you expect its result will be? [Unidentified man #2] I don't know about the result. However, because of our strong national power, we can win a victory. [Reporter Kim] I will have more interviews with people. [Begin recording] [Unidentified man #3 ] I think that Kim Il-song will never break out a war as long as he is not crazy, because we should live together on the peninsula. [Unidentified woman] I don't think that a war will break out. I think that our national power has been strengthened enough to avoid it. [Unidentified man #4] I think that because the North Koreans are aware that we are strong, they cannot break out a war. [Unidentified man #5] I believe that it is highly possible that a war will break out, because North Korea faces economic difficulties. [Unidentified man #6] I don't think that North Korea can easily start a war because of Japan or the United States. [end recording] [Reporter Kim] Most people believe that a war will not break out. Of course, the people's opmistic view that a war would not break out originates from their ardent desire that a war must not break out on the Korean peninsula.
