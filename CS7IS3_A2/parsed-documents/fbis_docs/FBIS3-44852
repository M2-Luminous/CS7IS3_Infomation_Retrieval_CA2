We have interviewed the relevant persons about those questions and have sorted out their answers in the following paragraphs for your reference. [RENMIN RIBAO] What actually constitutes the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong? [Relevant person] The 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong include the election of the District Boards in September 1994, the elections of the Urban Council and the Regional Council in March 1995, and the election of the Legislative Council in September 1995. Because these three tiers of elections are to be conducted in 1994 and 1995, they are generally called the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. [RENMIN RIBAO] What are these organs called the Legislative Council, Urban Council, Regional Council, and District Boards? [Relevant person] The Legislative Council, Urban Council, Regional Council, and District Boards are the components of the political structure of the British Hong Kong authorities. They differ in nature, function, and organization. Let me explain the general situation as follows: The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has been established according to the Letters Patent and is the highest among the three- tier structure created by the British Hong Kong authorities. In Hong Kong, the governor holds all the power; decisionmaking and legislative powers both belong to the governor. The Legislative Council does not have legislative power and is only there to assist the governor in legislation, to debate bills, and to examine and discuss affairs. The Legislative Council does not have the power to initiate a bill; this power rests with the Executive Council or the chief secretary, and the power to approve it rests with the governor. After a draft bill is adopted in the Legislative Council, it has to be approved by the governor in order to become law. In addition, Britain has the power to veto a law which has been passed by the Legislative Council and approved by the governor. Britain may also legislate on behalf of Hong Kong. The Legislative Council in Hong Kong is completely different from the representative congresses of sovereign states -- which are legislative organs possessing supreme power -- it is only a consultative body which advises the governor on legislative matters. The Legislative Council in Hong Kong has three main duties: First, to discuss and pass laws proposed by the Executive Council and to formulate regulations, including those determining the allocation of funds; second, to discuss, supervise, and control the government's financial expenditure; and, third, carry out inquiries and debates on government policies and matters which concern the people. Since its establishment in 1843, the Legislative Council in Hong Kong has undergone major changes in its organization. The current Legislative Council has 60 members, and among them 18 are directly elected from districts, 21 are appointed, and 21 are elected from functional constituencies. The Urban Council and the Regional Council constitute the middle tier of the three-tier structure established by the British Hong Kong authorities. They are regional organizations that do not have political power. The two councils are on an equal footing and may also be called the two Municipal Councils. The former has jurisdiction over Hong Kong Island and the urban areas in Kowloon, while the latter has jurisdiction over the New Territories and the outlying islands. Their functions are to provide residents with cultural, recreational, and urban services, including environmental management, hygiene control, management of hawkers, and the construction and management of public recreational and sports facilities. The current Urban Council has 40 members, among whom 15 are elected by the people, 15 are appointed, and 10 are members from various urban District Boards. The current Regional Council has 36 members, among whom 12 are elected by the people, 12 are appointed, nine are members from the District Boards in the New Territories, and three are members who have reserved seats -- the chairman and the two vice chairmen of the Heung Yee Kuk [a body representing the indigenous population of the New Territories]. The District Boards constitute the lowest tier of the three-tier structure established by the British Hong Kong authorities. Like the two Municipal Councils, the District Boards are regional organizations without political power. Their function is to provide consultation; in concrete terms, they primarily provide the government with ideas on matters which affect the welfare of the individuals who live or work in the districts and assist in supervising the work and policies of various government departments at the district level. In addition, the government often consults the District Boards on important issues which affect Hong Kong residents, such as the examination of regulations on urban planning, public housing policy, and health service reform at the grass-roots level. Hong Kong is currently divided into 19 districts, and District Boards differ in the number of members. The current round of District Boards has a total of 441 members, among whom 274 are elected by the people, 140 are appointed, and 27 are members who have reserved seats -- the chairmen of the rural committees of the New Territories. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why must the Chinese and British Governments hold talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong? [Relevant person] According to the provisions of the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Chinese Government will resume sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997; the British Government will return Hong Kong to the PRC on 1 July 1997; and its administrative power over Hong Kong will end on 30 June 1997. Therefore, the political system and framework set up by the British Hong Kong authorities will also come to an end. Although the Letters Patent and the relevant stipulations stipulate that the members of the Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards -- bodies which have been set up by the British Hong Kong authorities -- should serve for four years, and, speaking in terms of time, their tenures will not expire on 30 June 1997, due to the fact that they are the components of the political structure established by the British Hong Kong authorities, this three-tier structure should be disbanded on 30 June 1997. By then, the new legislative assembly of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR] and new regional organizations will be organized according to the decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress [NPC] and the provisions of the Basic Law. Therefore, in the first place, the British Hong Kong authorities have no right to bother about the political structure after 1997. Proceeding from the overall consideration of maintaining a stable transition for Hong Kong and the smooth transfer of political power, however, the Chinese Government hopes to be able to make the proper arrangements for the transition of the three-tier structure and its members through cooperation with the British Government on the basis of convergence with the Basic Law. As early as the drafting of the Basic Law, the Chinese and British Governments held many rounds of discussions on the development of the political system in Hong Kong (including the exchange of letters between the two foreign ministers in early 1990) and reached agreements, understandings, and a consensus. The British Government has promised time and again that the development of Hong Kong's political system during the transitional period will converge with the Basic Law. In order to enable the members of the final the Legislative Council in Hong Kong to become the members of the first legislative assembly of the Hong Kong SAR, on 4 April 1990, the NPC Standing Committee adopted the Decision on the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR, which specifically stipulated that "the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR shall be composed of 60 members, with 20 members returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections, 10 members returned by an election committee, and 30 members returned by functional constituencies. If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative Council before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC and who meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the Region may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, become members of the first Legislative Council of the Region." Because the two Municipal Councils and the District Boards were regional organizations without political power, the NPC did not formulate specific regulations on the transition of the members of these two tiers of organizations, leaving the issue to be decided through discussion between the Chinese and British Governments. The Sino-British Joint Declaration clearly stipulates that the Chinese and British Governments should strengthen cooperation on Hong Kong during the latter part of the transitional period and should examine together the measures which must be taken in order to ensure the smooth transfer of political power and a stable transition. Because the members of the Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards to be elected in 1994 and 1995 all face a problem of transition, the relevant 1994/95 electoral arrangements must be discussed by both the Chinese and British Governments so as to reach a consensus. The Chinese and British sides held talks this time with the precise purpose of discussing how the Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards that are to be elected in 1994 and 1995 can converge with the Basic Law, so that their members can serve beyond 1 July 1997 and can become members of the first legislative assembly and regional organizations of the Hong Kong SAR, so as to realize a smooth transition for Hong Kong's political system. The Chinese and British sides have yet to reach an agreement on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements. Under these circumstances, the British side has already submitted part of the relevant draft to the Legislative Council for discussion, and this has meant that the negotiations have stopped. Thus, the terms of office of the members of the last Legislative Council, the two Municipal Councils, and the District Boards to be formed by the British Hong Kong authorities in 1994 and 1995, will have to stop on 30 June 1997. [RENMIN RIBAO] What was the background against which China and Britain started talks on the electoral arrangements for Hong Kong? [Relevant person] As everyone knows, in October 1992, Hong Kong Governor Patten, who had been in office for less than three months, delivered his first policy address, in which he unilaterally proposed a "constitutional package" which sought to make important changes to Hong Kong's current political system. This proposal was made without prior discussion with the Chinese side, and such a thing should have been done according to the provisions of the Joint Declaration. The package included a concrete plan for the 1994/95 electoral arrangements for Hong Kong. This "package" violated the Sino-British Joint Declaration in terms of content and in terms of the way it was proposed; it violated the principle of convergence with the Basic Law; and it violated the relevant agreements and understandings already reached by the Chinese and British sides. It may be summarized as the "three violations" political reform package. Patten's proposal of the package has placed an obstacle before cooperation between China and Britain on the Hong Kong question and has caused unrest and division in Hong Kong society. If Patten's plan is to be followed, it will make it impossible to have a smooth transfer of governing power over Hong Kong in 1997 or to have a smooth transition, and this will greatly affect Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. Shortly after Patten proposed the "three violations" package, the Chinese Government expressed their strong objection to it. At that time, both the Foreign Ministry spokesman and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office spokesman solemnly pointed out that, during Hong Kong's transitional period, if the development of the political system is unable to converge with the Basic Law, the responsibility will not rest on the Chinese side. When the leaders of the Chinese Government met the leaders of the British Government, they repeatedly made it clear that they hoped the British Government, keeping in mind the overall consideration of maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and the common interests of China and Britain, will return to the track of discussion and cooperation as stipulated by the Sino-British Joint Declaration. At the same time, Patten's package naturally met with strong objection and criticism from the people of various levels in Hong Kong, as well as from knowledgeable persons in Britain, both within the government and without. It was precisely under these circumstances that the British Government had no choice but to request diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese Government on the issue of Hong Kong's 1994/95 electoral arrangements. Proceeding from the overall consideration of realizing Hong Kong's smooth transition and maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, the Chinese Government accepted the proposal on conducting diplomatic negotiations put forward by the British Government. [RENMIN RIBAO] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong, what elements of Chris Patten's proposal gave concrete expression to the "three violations?" [Relevant person] On the issue of the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's "three violations" found expression in the following points: 1. He changed the character of the indirect elections through the functional constituencies and transformed the elections by functional constituencies into direct elections in a disguised form. The system of functional constituency elections was designed by the British Hong Kong Government according to Hong Kong's history and the condition of social development and was first put into practice in 1985. It served the purpose of guaranteeing that people in the business and professional circles who play an important role in Hong Kong's economic prosperity and social stability would have representatives in the Legislative Council. When drafting the Basic Law, the Chinese Government affirmed such election form in consideration of the current condition of the development of Hong Kong's political structure, and the Basic Law specifies that, for the first three terms of the Legislative Council after the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR, seats would still be preserved for members elected by functional constituencies. Because these Legislative Councillors are to be elected by various functional constituencies determined in legal terms, this is a form of indirect election. The British Hong Kong Government also acknowledged in its legal documents that the functional constituency elections are indirect elections. In his "constitutional reform package," however, Patten replaced all forms of corporate voting with individual voters; at the same time, he extended the franchise in the functional constituencies to all eligible voters in the local working population so that "every single worker" in Hong Kong will have the second opportunity to vote in addition to the direct election. Patten's arrangement not only changed the original purpose of arranging functional constituency elections but also transformed the indirect elections through functional constituencies into direct elections in various trades. 2. With regard to the composition of the Election Committee, Patten's proposal violated the Sino-British agreements and understandings on this issue. In early 1990, the Chinese Government and the British Government repeatedly held consultations on the composition of the Election Committee. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and then British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd exchanged letters several times (these diplomatic documents were made public on 28 October 1992). Finally, the two sides reached an agreement on the composition of the 1995 Election Committee. The British side agreed in principle with the composition form and proportion specified by the second point of Annex I of the Basic Law for the Election Committee, which stipulated that the committee will be composed of four sectors, specifically, the industrial, commercial, and financial sector; the professional sector; the labor, social services, religious, and other sector; and members of the Legislative Council, representatives of district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress, and representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Each sector was to hold 25 percent of the seats in the Election Committee. Patten, however, disregarded the agreement reached by the Chinese side and the British side a long time ago and put forth a different method for forming the Election Committee in his "constitutional reform package." According to Patten, the committee will be wholly or mostly composed of directly elected District Board members. The Basic Law's specification that the Election Committee be included in the election of the first SAR Legislative council was aimed at increasing the representativeness of the Legislative Council and ensuring the balanced participation of people in all social strata and in all walks of life. Patten's proposal, however, not only directly violated the agreement that had been reached by China and Britain, but also went against the original reason for setting up the Election Committee. 3. On the issue of the elections of the District Boards and the two municipal councils, Patten proposed in his package that all appointed membership to these organizations be discontinued. This violated the principle of the gradual development of Hong Kong's political structure specified by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. In addition, this was not suited to the actual operational needs of the District Boards and the two municipal councils. [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the crux of the Sino-British dispute over the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong? [Relevant person] Chris Patten introduced his "constitutional reform package" in the name of "expanding democracy in Hong Kong." This gave the public the false impression that Patten is trying to expand democracy in Hong Kong, while the Chinese side does not agree with the development of democracy in Hong Kong. This is absolutely not the case. For more than 150 years of British rule in Hong Kong, the governors have consistently arrogated all power to themselves, and there has never been democracy whatsoever in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Legislative Council was established in 1843, and all of its members were appointed by the governors in over 140 years after that. Not until 1985 -- after the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue was signed -- did a few indirectly elected legislative members sit on the council. Therefore, the development of Hong Kong's political structure must proceed from this historical and social reality and must proceed in an orderly way step by step so that it will be favorable to the maintenance of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. In the remaining years of the transitional period, Patten rashly decided to "expand democracy in Hong Kong" and make a great change to the existing constitutional system without regard to the agreements, understandings, and consensus that the Chinese side and the British side had reached. He did this in an attempt to impose the British-style parliamentary democracy upon Hong Kong and to compel Hong Kong to cover the road to a perfect parliamentary democracy in a few years which the Western capitalist countries took several hundred years to cover. This can only serve to create obstacles to a smooth transfer of power and endanger Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. The Chinese Government has consistently favored promoting democracy in Hong Kong. It was the Chinese Government, when beginning the talks on the Hong Kong issue with the British side in 1982, that clearly announced the adoption of such principles and policies as "one country, two systems," "allowing Hong Kong people to administer Hong Kong," and "allowing Hong Kong to exercise a high degree of autonomy" after China recovers sovereignty over Hong Kong. The Basic Law, in particular, provides specific and adequate guarantees for the Hong Kong people's democratic rights. According to the Basic Law, the chief executive of the Hong Kong SAR will be selected by election or through consultations and ultimately will be selected by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures. The SAR Legislative Council will have full legislative power and administrative supervisory power. It will have the right to impeach the chief executive. The number of seats returned by direct elections will increase from 20 to 30 in a short period of six years from 1997 to 2003. The method of forming the SAR Legislative Council will be specified in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in accordance with the principle of orderly and gradual progress, and all members of the Legislative Council will eventually be elected by universal suffrage. Facts show that the democracy to be introduced in Hong Kong after 1997 as stipulated by the Basic Law will be much greater than that which has been given to the Hong Kong people by the British rulers over the last 150 years. This was precisely the reason why the Basic Law was extensively supported by the masses from all social strata in Hong Kong. When the Basic Law was officially promulgated in April 1990, the spokesman for the British Foreign Office also explicitly indicated that the Basic Law "lays the foundation for Hong Kong's future status" and "is the acceptable reflection of the Joint Declaration." In the course of drafting the Basic Law, the British side repeatedly stressed the need for the convergence of the pre- 1997 developments of Hong Kong's political structure with the Basic Law, and the Chinese side and the British side reached a consensus on this matter. Obviously, the British side should make arrangements for Hong Kong's 1994-95 elections in accordance with the principle of convergence with the Basic Law and with the agreements and understandings reached by the two sides in order to make things favorable to the changeover of government and smooth transition in 1997. However, the British side has openly broken faith with the Chinese side and has gone its own way. All this shows that the crux of the Sino-British dispute over Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements is in no way concerned with a number of specific issues related, for example, to the arrangements of the functional constituency elections or the election committee election, nor does it concern the issue of whether it is necessary to promote democracy in Hong Kong or the speed at which democracy should be promoted; rather, this is a matter of whether the British side is willing to act in good faith and a matter of political principle concerning whether it is still willing to honor the Joint Declaration, to make the development of Hong Kong's political structure converge with the Basic Law, and to observe and implement the agreements and understandings that the two sides have reached. [RENMIN RIBAO] What is the basic position and attitude that the Chinese have held in the talks? [Relevant person] When the two sides were still making preparations before the beginning of the talks, the Chinese side announced its position, that the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong must be based on the Sino- British Joint Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law, and the relevant agreements and understandings already reached between the two sides. The Chinese Government maintained that, if the two sides could reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements through the talks, this would be conducive to the smooth transfer of government and a smooth transition in 1997, would be favorable to both sides, and would be in keeping with the fundamental and long- term interests of the Hong Kong residents. In order to enable the talks to proceed smoothly and to reach an agreement at an earlier date, the Chinese side consistently held a sincere and positive attitude toward the talks and made great efforts to promote the talks inside and outside the meeting place and to quicken the process of the talks. The Chinese side agreed to restore the meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group and the meeting of the Airport Committee; solved the issues concerning the cable television franchise contract, the renewal of Hong Kong Electric's agreement, and the garbage landfill zone in the western New Territories; made the Sino-British Land Commission solve the 1993-94 land allocation issue; endorsed starting the western tunnel project and the Central and Wanchai reclamation project before a comprehensive agreement on the new airport financial arrangements was reached; and proposed that two meetings of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group be held separately in Beijing and London within 1993 to quicken its work. All this showed the Chinese side's sincerity for restoring Sino-British cooperation on the Hong Kong issue. In the course of the talks, the Chinese side not only adhered to its principles, it also showed flexibility. For issues on which agreements and understandings had been reached by the two sides in the past, the Chinese side insisted on following the existing agreements and understandings; on issues which were not explicitly mentioned by the existing agreements and understandings or had not been discussed by the two sides, the Chinese side adopted a flexible approach and showed its willingness to hold discussions with the British side in order to seek solutions acceptable to both sides. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the talks make progress so slowly and fail to reach any agreement over such a long time? [Relevant person] Before the beginning of the talks, the British side agreed with the principle of converging with the Sino- British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and agreed to take the agreements and understandings that the two side had reached in the past as the foundation for the talks as the Chinese side required. If the British side could actually act according to these "three principles" in the talks, then it would not be difficult for the two sides to reach an agreement. However, things did not go according to our wishes. The British side repeatedly went back on its words during the talks. It not only refused to put forth its own plan according to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, but also refused to acknowledge the agreements and understandings previously reached between the two countries. In the talks, although the British side showed some flexibility on certain concrete issues, it continued to insist on the position of Patten's "three violations" package and made no substantial changes. For the issues which are not clearly specified in the Basic Law or on which the two sides did not reach agreements or understandings in the past, the British side stubbornly required the Chinese side to totally accept its ideas. Moreover, during the talks, the British side even mentioned some affairs within the scope of China's sovereignty and some issues that were not related to the talks and required the Chinese side to make a promise, thus creating obstacles to the talks. At the beginning of the talks, the British side said that they had always maintained a positive and constructive attitude toward the talks, but actual practice in the talks only showed the opposite. During the course of the talks, the British side continued to play "little tricks" to undermine and disrupt the smooth process of the talks. For example, before the two sides reached any agreement, the British Hong Kong Legislative Council hastily adopted the "draft bill on the Boundary and Election Commission" and substantially increased the number of elected District Board members, and the British Hong Kong authorities gazetted the "Ordinance on the Proposed Number and Names of Districts" and decided to decrease the number of District Boards from 19 to 18. The British Hong Kong authorities also connived at and supported the decision of the Constitutional Development Panel of the Legislative Council to discuss Governor Patten's "constitutional package" in an attempt to advance the legislative process while the talks were going on. A senior official from the British Foreign Ministry even openly alleged that the future Sino- British agreement would be submitted to the Legislative Council for discussion and revision, thus placing the decision of the Hong Kong Legislative Council above the agreement reached by the Chinese and British Governments. Throughout the process of the talks, the British side also continued to exert pressure on the Chinese side by setting a deadline for the talks and warned that "the Hong Kong governor would make a decision if there was no obvious progress in the talks." Because the British side stubbornly stuck to Patten's "three violations" package and created obstacles to the talks on every issue, the talks made progress very slowly and failed to reach any agreement over a long period of time. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why did the Chinese side propose that the issue concerning the arrangements for the Legislative Council elections and the District Board and Municipal Council elections be separately discussed and solved? What was the British side's attitude toward this? [Relevant person] In order to advance the talks and also in consideration of the fact that the elections to the District Boards and the two Municipal Councils will be held earlier and that the issue related to this part of elections is simpler, in the fourth round of the talks the Chinese side proposed that the issue concerning the arrangements for the elections to the District Boards and Municipal Councils be first discussed and solved before the issues concerning the Legislative Council elections are discussed. However, this proposal was rejected by the British side, which argued that the 1994-95 elections should be handled as a "package." As the talks had been held for more than five months and little progress had been made, on 1 October when meeting with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in New York, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen once again proposed that the 1994-95 electoral arrangements be discussed and solved in two separate parts. Qian pointed out that, as 1994 was drawing near, time was pressing, and the 1994 elections were comparatively simpler, so the two sides might first discuss the issue of the 1994 elections and reach an agreement. The more complicated 1995 election issue can wait, as there is still time for the two sides to continue the discussion. This was the principle of "dealing with easier things first and dealing with more difficult things later" and the reason behind the Chinese side's proposal for "separately" dealing with the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in Hong Kong. At that time, the British side once again turned down the Chinese side's proposal. In his second policy address in October 1993, Patten also made it clear that "this was impracticable." Because the Chinese side's proposal was reasonable, however, it was endorsed and supported widely by many Hong Kong people. Afterward, the British side had no choice but to agree with the Chinese side's proposal on discussing the electoral arrangements for the District Boards and Municipal Councils first, but it set forth three preconditions: requiring the Chinese side to agree to lower the voting age from 21 to 18, to accept the British side's proposal on the voting method, and to discontinue all appointed membership in these organizations. The British side's intentions were obvious. On one hand, it tried to meet the Hong Kong people's wishes by agreeing to "separately" handle the 1994-95 electoral arrangements in order to free itself from the predicament; on the other hand, it tried to use the three preconditions to set an obstacle to the actual "separate" handling, because, if the Chinese side did not accept the three requirements, "separate" handling would become impossible. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why is it said that it is entirely possible for China and Britain to reach an accord on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies? [Relevant person] The Chinese side has criticized the British side's consent for "separating" the 1994 and 1995 electoral arrangements and its practice of setting out three preconditions, while indicating that that was not a constructive attitude in seeking a solution. Proceeding from the overall situation, however, the Chinese side agreed to the British side's requirement on lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 years, while raising no objection to the British side's proposal of adopting the "one-seat, one-vote system" (a district ballot method, namely, the number of districts coincides with the number of seats, with only one seat to every district. Each voter can cast only one vote in the election.) On the issue of abolishing appointed seats, the Chinese side set forth a different opinion. That was the focus of the argument between the Chinese and British sides over the electoral arrangements for district boards and the two municipal bodies. Chris Patten's suggestion on abolishing the appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal bodies in his "constitutional reform package" immediately met strong opposition from the presidents of the district boards and the two municipal bodies and the majority of their members. Neither did the majority of Hong Kong residents approve of abolishing all appointed seats. Taking into consideration this wish of Hong Kong residents as well as the actual operation of the district boards and the two municipal bodies, the Chinese side believed that maintaining some appointed seats would be conducive to those bodies better exercising their functions, and fall in line with Hong Kong's actual conditions; on such grounds, the Chinese side was for maintaining the existing number of appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal bodies. Nevertheless, on the grounds that the Legislative Council would abolish the system of appointed seats in the 1995 election, the British side insisted on the abolition of appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British side's grounds did not hold water. Whether or not the appointed seats exist in the district boards and the two municipal bodies has nothing to do with the election of the Legislative Council, because their nature and functions are different. The two sides conducted repeated discussions on this issue; despite the fact that the Chinese side compromised and stated that the number of appointed seats should be axed to one-fourth of all seats from the original one-third based on the principle of proceeding in an orderly way and step by step, the British side was bent on abolishing all appointed seats, and was unwilling to yield an inch. In order to reach an accord with the British side on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies as quickly as possible, the Chinese side exerted efforts again during the 15th round of talks, and set out a compromise way of taking into consideration both sides' positions, bypassing disputes, namely, an explanation would be added to the understanding reached between the two sides: The British side was for abolishing the appointed seats in the district boards and the two municipal bodies; the Chinese side was for maintaining an appropriate proportion of appointed seats. After 30 June 1997, the Hong Kong SAR Government would decide on the number of district boards and appointed seats on its own based on the stipulation of Basic Law Article 98. This plan of the Chinese side actually allowed the British side to abolish appointed seats before 30 June 1997, but after that date an appropriate proportion of appointed seats would be established according to the relevant stipulation in the Basic Law by the Hong Kong SAR Government. The British side agreed to the Chinese side's opinion on the issue of appointed seats mentioned above. By then, the Chinese side had already adopted the British side's opinions on the issues of the voting age, voting method, and appointed seats involved in the elections of the district boards and the municipal councils, and had met the British side's demands. In addition to the aforesaid issues, there were two other issues involving the election of the district boards and the municipal councils. One of the issues was that the nongovernment nature and functions of the Hong Kong district boards and the two municipal bodies would remain unchanged in the last four years of the transition period because of convergence with the relevant stipulation in the Basic Law. On this issue, there was no major difference between the Chinese and British sides. Another issue was that for convergence with the Basic Law, the Chinese side required the British side to promise to lift restrictions on delegates to the people's congresses at various levels from the Hong Kong area participating in elections. On this issue, the British side eventually expressed their agreement after some procrastination. The aforesaid conditions showed that on all issues involved in the elections of the district boards and the two municipal bodies, the Chinese side and its British counterpart tended to become unanimous in their positions. In fact, it was entirely possible for the two sides to reach an accord on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies in the wake of the 15th round. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why was it that the two sides failed to reach an accord when the Chinese side and its British counterpart had tended to become unanimous in their positions on all issues involved in the elections of the district boards and the two municipal bodies? [Relevant person] The cause of the failure of the two sides to reach an accord on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies lies precisely in the fact that the British side raised new issues and set out new demands. Before the 16th round of talks began, the British side put to its Chinese counterpart the proposal that the voting method characterized by "one seat, one vote" for the election of the district boards and the two municipal bodies must also be applicable to the 1995 district elections of the Legislative Council. This demand of the British side was groundless, because neither regulations nor precedent exist that the same voting method must be adopted in the elections of district boards, the two municipal bodies, and the Legislative Council. Matters regarding the election of the Legislative Council, including the voting method to be adopted, could be resolved later in discussions on those elections. Otherwise, matters could be made complicated, and it would not be conducive to the talks' progress. However, the British side insisted on including the application of the "one seat, one vote" voting method to the election of the Legislative Council in the memorandum of understanding on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies. The British side stated that its demand was based on the need for a "balanced" accord, for "practical and political reasons." The so-called "balance" the British side referred to was its agreement to lift the restrictions on delegates to the people's congresses at various levels participating in the election of the three-tier assemblies, with the change in the voting age being applicable to the three-tier elections. Under such circumstances, if the Chinese side disagreed with adopting the same voting method for the election of the three-tier assemblies, that would spell imbalance. Directed at the British way of putting it, the Chinese side specially submitted a draft understanding to the British side in the 17th round of talks, with the suggestion that the three points, namely, the voting age, the voting method, and lifting restrictions on delegates to the people's congresses be confined to the elections to the district boards and the two municipal bodies, and that all issues involving the elections to the Legislative Council be resolved later. However, the suggestion of the Chinese side aimed at seeking a solution to the problems was immediately rejected by the British side. As to the so-called "practical and political reasons," the British side chiefly referred to the two following points: First, the legislation on the voting method for the Legislative Council needs be adopted as quickly as possible; if the voting method should pass through legislation on two occasions, that would be a waste of time. In actual fact, the voting method for the district boards and the two municipal bodies and that for the Legislative Council have no necessary connection; their legislation has always been separate in the past. Furthermore, the election of the Legislative Council is to take place in September 1995, it was not so pressing in terms of time, and could be resolved later on. That being the case, this reason of the British side's did not hold water. Second, the British side said that back in 1992 the Legislative Council had adopted a motion on its adoption of the "one seat, one vote system" for its 1995 election; that being the case, it was imperative to fix such a voting method at present. The British side actually wanted the Chinese side to accept the opinion of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, and place its opinion above the talks between the Chinese and British Governments. The Chinese side would never accept that point. Under the circumstance that the British side had failed to achieve its aim of killing two birds with one stone, namely simultaneously resolving the voting method for the Legislative Council and that for the district boards and the two municipal bodies, the British issued a "statement" shortly before the conclusion of the 17th round, saying that the British side could no longer continue the understanding reached with the Chinese side in the first phase of the talks, and unilaterally announced the interruption [zhong duan 0022 2451] of the talks on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies. Facts have proved that precisely because of the jeopardy deliberately introduced by the British side, no accord was reached in the Sino-British talks on the electoral arrangements for the district boards and the two municipal bodies. [RENMIN RIBAO] Why do we say that the British side should be held responsible for the termination of the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements? [Relevant person] Before the talks started, when both sides sides were discussing through diplomatic channels the issue of holding talks, the Chinese side already had pointed clearly that if the British side submitted the relevant bills to the Legislative Council [Legco] before an agreement was reached between China and Britain through the talks, it would indicate that the British side had no sincerity whatsoever in the talks and would mean the termination of talks; the responsibility would not rest on the Chinese side. Through diplomatic channels the Chinese side once again expressed this solemn and just stand following the end of the 17th round of talks, but the British side turned a deaf ear to the repeated warnings and dissuasion of the Chinese Government. On 2 December 1993, Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten issued a statement on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements, declaring that on 10 December 1993, he would gazette part of his bill on Hong Kong's elections and on 15 December, would submit the bill for discussion by Legco. In response to this British move, spokesmen from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY branch in Hong Kong issued separate statements reiterating that if the British Hong Kong authorities went ahead with the legislative process on the 1994/1995 elections in Hong Kong, this would mean that the British side had terminated the talks unilaterally. The British side went ahead, however, regardless of warnings, gazetting the relevant bill as scheduled, and tabling it before Legco for its first and second readings. The facts demonstrate that the Chinese side has shown the utmost sincerity and patience toward the talks, and that the British side should be held fully responsible for their termination. Although the British side has continued to say that they wish to have an 18th round of talks with the Chinese side on the remaining issues related to the 1994/1995 elections -- which are more complicated -- and that they "will never leave the negotiating table," this is but a trick to deceive the public and to shift responsibility for terminating the talks onto the other side. If the British side is truly sincere about resuming the talks, reopening of talks will be possible only after it has withdrawn the partial bill that has been tabled before Legco. The door to negotiations remains open; the key lies in the attitude of the British side. [RENMIN RIBAO] As the Sino-British talks over Hong Kong's electoral arrangements have terminated, what does the Chinese side plan to do? [Relevant person] It is very clear that because China and Britain are unable to reach an agreement on Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements, the transition issue does not exist for the members of the last Legco, the two municipal councils, and the district boards of the British Hong Kong administration. Their term of office will last only until 30 June 1997. By that time, the Chinese side will have "set up another kitchen" in accordance with the decisions of the NPC and the relevant provisions of the Basic Law, and will have reconstituted Legco and the district organizations of the Hong Kong SAR. Recently, the Preliminary Working Committee of the Hong Kong SAR Preparatory Committee held its second plenary meeting. The participants discussed Hong Kong's current situation and expressed their strong resent against the serious measures taken by the British side, which submitted part of the bill concerning Hong Kong's 1994/1995 electoral arrangements to the Legco under conditions of no agreement having been reached between the Chinese and British Governments. The meeting held that this was a deliberate sabotage of the talks by the British side and that the British Government should be held responsible for all consequences. It decided to accelerate the pace of various preparatory work for resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
