In the past, when something like this happened, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] launched fierce attacks against the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Your party is so quiet this time. [Murayama] Would that make any difference? Anyway, the SDPJ's stand of wanting to root out corruption has not changed a bit. Diet members receive so many requests from organizations and individuals to help them, but they must by all means avoid getting involved in money matters. [Hanaoka] What will your party do to delve into the scandal? [Murayama] I think that the recent construction corruption scandal has deep roots. The Diet should look into the truth of the matter to see whether people higher up are involved. On the other hand, the Diet also needs to pass the 1994 budget. We should do this so as to not allow the matter to impede the Diet's deliberations nf the budget bill. [Hanaoka] The SDPJ played a major role in the recent soap opera of a cabinet reshuffle. But don't you think it would be embarrassing if a prime minister and his chief cabinet secretary said different things? [Murayama] Having a prime minister and his chief cabinet secretary not be able to speak frankly is not desirable. But you know the proverb, "After rain comes fair weather." [Hanaoka] People say that the bipolarization of power within the coalition has become clear following intraparty clashes over the cabinet reshuffle and the national welfare tax. Do you think that this bipolar structure will become fixed? [Murayama] That is not what happened. It was coincidence that the views of the SDPJ, the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger] came to agree. No, there will not be two polarized forces confronting each other within the coalition. [Hanaoka] Is it correct that your party will not accept increasing the consumption tax rate under any circumstance? [Murayama] We have not said that the consumption tax can never be increased under any circumstance. What must happen first is for the government to present a clear vision on welfare to the people. If the vision is acceptable to the people and if the tax is to be made a specific tax for the purpose of funding pensions, we will accept the increase. When that is done, it will also be necessary to revise some unfair conditions in the existing tax system. We are not objecting to everything. [Hanaoka] How do you visualize the upcoming realignment of the political world? [Murayama] We need to view the matter from three angles: maintaining the coalition government, cooperation in the elections, and the political world's reorganization. The basic condition is that we must not allow the LDP to return to power. Having different political ideals is no reason for the coalition parties to be unable to cooperate. All electoral districts will require flexible yet bold cooperation by the parties based on this basic guideline. First of all, we would like to form a structure wherein the coalition parties can cooperate in the elections. [Hanaoka] What is the possibility of the coalition parties developing into a new, new party? [Murayama] When political ideals differ, it is difficult to expect that. Besides, there is the possibility that the framework of the coalition government will change as a result of the next election. [Hanaoka] Within the SDPJ, there are the left-wing group, which opposed the political reform bills, as well as the right-wing group, which supported them. The party appears to have the explosive possibility of breaking up at any time. [Murayama] I regret that act of going against the party's agreement and voting against the political reform bills. The principle is that decisions which are reached after proper intraparty discussions should be respected. But the people who do not respect the decisions cannot be helped. There is now a general agreement in thinking that the liberals of the SDPJ and of the DSP should come together under one umbrella. [Hanaoka] The words -- the liberals of the SDPJ and the DSP -- sound good, but isn't liberalism a concept of emphasizing protection of the weak and having big government? [Murayama] No, you should not put it that way. Helping the weak is not something only the central government can do. That can be done by transferring more power to the local governments and having them do it. Anyway, one role of the SDPJ and DSP liberals is to secure social justice, which will enable the weak and the strong to coexist. [Hanaoka] What course will the SDPJ and DSP liberals take to become unified? [Murayama] First, the SDPJ must escape the old shell of the 1955 regime of Japanese politics. We will have to see in which direction the party will change. In the course of changing, it is possible that the party will turn into a new party. I think that the political world will change several times while undergoing the simultaneous upper house and local government elections and the general elections. Forming a new party to contest the next general election would be one choice, even though I cannot imagine the possibility of the SDPJ getting together with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] or the LDP. [Hanaoka] Within the LDP, there are some who hope that the next general election will be held under the current medium-size electoral district system. Is it not what the SDPJ wants really, too? [Murayama] No political vacuum must be allowed to occur. If a situation arises wherein the prime minister is convinced that the only way left for him is to dissolve the Diet and hold a general election, then that will be unavoidable. [Hanaoka] You have recently appeared on several television variety programs. You must be a popular man. [Murayama] I don't have much more time in which to be in politics. What I have to is to help the party overcome this difficult time, create a new foundation, and then pass the baton to new people.
