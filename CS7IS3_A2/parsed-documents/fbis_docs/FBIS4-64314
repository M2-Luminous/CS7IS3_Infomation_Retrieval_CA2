[passage omitted] The French Government hopes that close cooperation will continue with the Italian Government. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said that it will be necessary to judge on actual evidence: [Begin Juppe recording] Since the birth of the EC, Italy has been one of the most fervent players in the construction of the Community. I hope it will still be the same. This government has just been formed; we do not know its projects. We must judge on actual evidence. What is said during an election campaign does not always allow one to pass a precise judgement on what a government will do after the elections. I think that we should wait and see what will happen in the next few weeks and months. I really hope that we shall continue to work closely with Italy and that what is the very foundation of the construction of Europe -- a community of values and the same ideas about democracy and the rule of law -- will continue to exist in Europe. This is the foundation of European identity and of the construction of the European Union. [end recording]
