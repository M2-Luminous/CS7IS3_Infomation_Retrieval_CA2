Background The Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Libyan Sanctions Regulations, 31 CFR part 550 (the ``Regulations''), to add new entries to appendices A and B. Appendix A, Organizations Determined to be Within the Term ``Government of Libya'' (Specially Designated Nationals of Libya), is a list of organizations determined by the Director of FAC to be within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya,'' as set forth in §550.304(a) of the Regulations, because they are owned or controlled by or act or purport to act directly or indirectly on behalf of the Government of Libya. Appendix B, Individuals Determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government of Libya, lists individuals determined by the Director of FAC to be acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of the Government of Libya, and thus to fall within the term ``Government of Libya'' in §550.304(a). Appendix A to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of the designation of Arab Hellenic Bank, S.A., Lafitrade Holdings BV, Sabtina Limited, Teknica Oil Services (Overseas) Limited, and Teknica (UK) Limited as Specially Designated Nationals of Libya. In addition, the listing for The Libyan Arab Uganda Bank for Foreign Trade and Development is amended to note the bank's new name, Tropical Africa Bank Limited. Finally, Jardine House, located at 6 Crutched Friars, London EC3N 2HT, England, is identified as blocked property of the Government of Libya. Appendix B to part 550 is amended to provide public notice of ten individuals determined to be Specially Designated Nationals of the Government of Libya: Dino Armani, Giampiero Armani, Dr. Najmeddine Abdalla Arifi, Dr. Nuri Abdalla Berruien, Marcello Busenti, Dr. Mukhtar Ali El&hyph;Ageli, Bahjat Fadel El Amir, Mustapha Ali El&hyph;Khoja, Smeida El&hyph;Hosh El Naili, and Hassan Senoussi Zughaid. Messrs. Dino and Giampiero Armani and Mr. Busenti are shareholders in Oilinvest (Netherlands) B.V., previously identified as a Specially Designated National, and the remaining individuals are officers or directors in other institutions named as Specially Designated Nationals in this amendment. All prohibitions in the Regulations pertaining to the Government of Libya apply to the entities and individuals identified in appendices A and B. All unlicensed transactions with such entities or persons, or transactions in property in which they have an interest, are prohibited unless otherwise exempted or generally licensed in the Regulations. Determinations that persons fall within the definition of the term ``Government of Libya'' and are thus Specially Designated Nationals of Libya are effective upon the date of determination by the Director of FAC, acting under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury. Public notice is effective upon the date of publication or upon actual notice, whichever is sooner. The list of Specially Designated Nationals in appendices A and B is a partial one, since FAC may not be aware of all agencies and officers of the Government of Libya, or of all persons that might be owned or controlled by, or acting on behalf of the Government of Libya within the meaning of §550.304(a). Therefore, one may not rely on the fact that a person is not listed in appendix A or B as a Specially Designated National as evidence that it is not owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or indirectly on behalf of, the Government of Libya. The Treasury Department regards it as incumbent upon all persons governed by the Regulations to take reasonable steps to ascertain for themselves whether persons with whom they deal are owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act on behalf of, the Government of Libya, or on behalf of other countries subject to blocking or transactional restrictions administered by FAC. Section 206 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1705, provides for civil penalties not to exceed $10,000 for each violation of the Regulations. Criminal violations of the Regulations are punishable by fines of up to $250,000 or imprisonment for up to 10 years per count, or both, for individuals and criminal fines of up to $500,000 per count for organizations. See 50 U.S.C. 1705; 18 U.S.C. 3571. Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, does not apply.
