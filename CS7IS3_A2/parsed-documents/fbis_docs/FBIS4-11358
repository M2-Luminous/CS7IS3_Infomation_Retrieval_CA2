During the first round of elections, the party had already ensured control of the assembly as well as a majority in the country's local governments. The party will now be responsible for leading the country through a key phase of economic recovery and consolidation of peace. With Armando Calderon Sol as president, ARENA has agreed to encourage a government of national accord in order to continue advancing in the process of pacification, democratization, and implementation of an economic adjustment program. It is expected that in addition to macroeconomic stability, the economic program will also ensure an improvement in the standards of living of the 5.6 million Salvadorans. Calderon Sol was elected 24 April with 68 percent of the votes, as opposed to the 32 percent received by his closest adversary, Democratic Convergence candidate Ruben Zamora. The new president promised to ensure the participation of all forces which support the governability and political stability of the country, which ended a bloody war in 1992 that lasted more than a decade. With 39 of 84 seats, ARENA will control the Legislative Assembly through a simply majority of 44 seats, as a result of obtaining the support of the right-wing National Conciliation Party, which obtained four seats in the elections. The former guerrilla group Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front [FMLN], which won 21 seats during the 20 March parliamentary elections, has stated it believes ARENA will control the legislative branch with intolerance, despite assurances it is planning to seek an accommodation with all the political parties. ARENA also secured clear-cut control over the local governments by winning 206 of the 262 municipal offices open to elections. The Christian Democratic Party was able to secure 29 municipal offices; the FMLN won 16, and the Authentic Christian Movement was only able to win one mayoral office. Monday, Calderon Sol said that with these results, ARENA has further consolidated itself as the country's leading political force. He added its main opposition will now be the FMLN, which has become the second leading political option as a result of its strong showing in the elections. ARENA was founded in September 1981 by deceased Major Roberto d'aubuisson, who was cited by the Truth Commission as the organizer of the death squads, which assassinated an unspecified number of individuals during the past decade for political reasons.
