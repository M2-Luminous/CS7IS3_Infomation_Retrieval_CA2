"The exchange of visits by high-level officials will surely promote the development of our bilateral ties," Li told visiting Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov and his party here this afternoon. In response, Gasanov said his country gives priority to its ties with China and that President Aliyev is keen to visit China. China and Azerbaijan are both Asian countries and the friendly contacts between the two peoples date back to the "silk road" period of 2000 years ago, Li noted. Recalling his visit to Azerbaijan some 40 years ago, Li said his memory of that visit is as fresh as ever, and the Baku oilfield is well known among the Chinese people. Li noted that the Chinese government gave Azerbaijan prompt recognition after it gained independence, and the two countries soon established ambassadorial-level diplomatic ties. "For the past two years our bilateral relations have marked steady and healthy development. I am satisfied with that," the Chinese premier said. During the meeting Gasanov conveyed to Li the regards from President Aliyev to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders. The current Azerbaijan-China ties are good, Gasanov said, adding that his country is willing to co-operate with China in every field. He also expressed his admiration for the progress China has made through reforms while maintaining its stability.
