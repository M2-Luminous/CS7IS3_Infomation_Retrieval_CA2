What is the effect? What new conflicts have we met with in the process? Have such aspects as production, circulation, financial revenues, and commodity prices been adversely affected? This reporter invited Finance Minister Liu Zhongli to learn his views on these hot issues about which people are concerned. The Tax Reform Has Not Brought About Drastic Fluctuations or Huge Increases in Commodity Prices Commodity price increases were widespread last winter and this spring, and the masses had strong grievances against this situation. Many people suspected that it had something to do with the introduction of the new tax system. So what is the truth? Liu Zhongli explained: We set great store by mass opinion, and have been tracking and looking into their views ever since the introduction of the new tax system. Now I can say for certain that the tax reform has not brought about drastic fluctuations or huge increases in commodity prices. Last year, prior to the tax reform, every tonne of rolled steel was priced over 4,000 yuan, but since the introduction of the new tax system this year, the price of rolled steel not only has not risen, but has dropped a bit, showing that the law of supply and demand is functioning. Some people said that the levy of consumption tax led to increased prices for refrigerators, color television sets, and other household electrical appliances, but this too is groundless. At present, the scope of the consumption tax levy does not cover household electrical appliances. The key targets of the levy can be divided into five major categories: 1) Special consumer goods -- such as cigarettes, liquor, and firecrackers and fireworks -- excessive consumption of which will jeopardize people's health, the social order, and the ecological environment; 2) Luxuries and non-daily necessities, such as gold, jewelry, jade, and cosmetics; 3) High energy-consumption and high-grade consumer goods, such as automobiles and motorcycles; 4) Petroleum-related goods that cannot be regenerated, such as gasoline and diesel fuel; and 5) Consumer goods with certain financial significance, such as car tires and products for skin and hair protection. Compared with the former tax system, there is basically no change in taxable consumer goods' overall level of tax burden, even if the consumption tax is levied on these products, and most of the tax items are basically at the original level of burden. The levy of the consumption tax will not affect the level of commodity prices. People objected to increased vegetable prices, with some saying they were caused by the tax reform, but Liu Zhongli considered such remarks as not conforming to the reality. He said: At present, vegetables are still levied at the original retail tax rate. The main reasons accounting for price rises in vegetables are: 1) Vegetable plots in the suburbs of many cities have been transformed into real estate and economic development zones, and new vegetable plots must be developed in the outer suburbs, thus incurring greater cost; 2) Some wholesalers and retailers running vegetable businesses have seized the opportunity of the introduction of the reform to raise prices, fix prices in excess of those authorized, and ask exorbitant prices, thus disturbing normal pricing order in the market and driving up the level of commodity prices; and 3) Vegetable prices also depend on whether it is off or peak season, and on the law of value. Comrade Liu Zhongli said: To understand the level of commodity prices, we must uphold the standpoint of seeking truth from facts and of the market economy. To solve this problem, the basic method is to handle things according to law and to increase effective supplies to the market. The State Council meeting on the "Shopping Basket" project will have a positive meaning in stabilizing non-staple food prices. After citing numerous facts, Liu Zhongli pointed out with emphasis: The root cause of increases in the general level of commodity prices is excessive investment and granting of loans, excessive currency issuance, and the exceedingly rapid growth of consumption funds. In the final analysis, price increases are caused by the double pushing of the forces of demand -- for consumption and for investment. The party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to this problem, and have already decided, on the one hand, to carry out massive inspections of commodity prices and the scale of investment for capital construction and to strengthen and improve macroscopic regulation; and on the other, to carry out the "Shopping Basket" project and increase effective supplies to society by vigorously developing agriculture. We are going to solve the problem and stabilize commodity prices by taking the measures in these two respects. The tax reform is correct and cannot be doubted, and we should continue to progress on this basis. The Tax Reform Has Not Adversely Affected Production, Circulation, and Financial Revenues Liu Zhongli said: The new tax system has operated for three months, and the overall situation is normal. We have basically achieved steady transition without causing any great problems. All walks of life in society and most enterprises have responded calmly to the introduction of the new tax system and the changes in tax burdens. The introduction of the new tax system has not increased the tax burden of foreign businessmen investing in China, thus dispelling their doubts. Industrial production is still developing rapidly. According to statistics compiled by the State Statistical Bureau, from January to February, industrial enterprises at and above the county level throughout the country completed 541.9 billion yuan worth of output value, up 18.16 percent over the same period last year. As far as financial revenues are concerned, a trend of huge growth is still shown. By the end of February, the national domestic financial revenues (excluding debts) increased 32.1 percent over the same period last year, including 41.405 billion yuan of industrial and commercial tax revenues, which registered an increase of 32.3 percent over the same period last year. As for the general value-added tax [VAT], as a shared tax, a total of 21.503 billion yuan was turned over to treasuries from January to February, and 71.1 percent and 28.9 percent of the sum was turned to the central and local treasuries, respectively, which was basically close to the requirements of the tax-sharing system. As proved by practice over the past three months, the tax reform package is a proper one, and the positive results achieved by the reform have strengthened our confidence and determination in scoring a sure victory in the tax reform. Compared With the Former Tax System, the New VAT Merely Makes Changes in the Method of Tax Calculation, But It Does Not Increase the Overall Tax Burden of Commodities The VAT, in essence, is a levy on the amount of added value. So what is the most fundamental difference between the post-reform VAT and that in the former tax system? Liu Zhongli said: Our country started levying the VAT on an experimental basis in 1979, and there was no unified standard of tax burden; the scope of the levy was not wide; the product tax levied on the links of industrial production and coexisted with and overlapped the VAT; the business tax was levied on commodity circulation link, whereas the unified industrial and commercial tax was levied on enterprises linked to foreign investment; and there was no unified taxation policy. Moreover, restricted by the scope of the levy, it was difficult to implement a tax deduction system in which invoices clearly indicating the amount of tax payment are produced. Consequently, even though taxes were reduced or remitted in a certain link, taxes still were deducted in the following link, thus making it impossible for the VAT to bring its intrinsic mechanism of control into play. Liu Zhongli said that the implementation of the new VAT embodied the characteristics of being standardized, close-knit, and convenient: First, the scope of the levy is widened, that is, the links of production, import, wholesaling and retailing businesses, and processing all are included in the scope of the VAT levy. Second, the scope of taxpayers is widened, that is, all units and individuals selling goods and offering labor services for processing and repairs inside the PRC and importing goods into the territory are included. Third, tax rates are combined and simplified, that is, the tax structure has only two grades of tax rates; the basic tax rate is 17 percent, while the low tax rate is 13 percent. In addition, a zero tax rate is levied on exports, whereas a six percent tax rate is levied on small taxpayers who do not have sound accounting and auditing practices. Fourth, a VAT deduction system is implemented in which invoices are produced that clearly indicate the amount of tax payment. At present, some people regard the 17 percent of extra-price tax [jia wai shui 0116 1120 4451] as a tax levied on top of the selling price. Liu Zhongli said that this practice was certainly incorrect. The so-called in-price tax [jia nei shui 0116 0355 4451] refers to the fact that prior to the reform, the amount of VAT was included in selling prices, and the tax rates were calculated according to the tax-inclusive prices; whereas the so-called extra-price tax refers to the fact that the rates of post-reform VAT are calculated according to the prices that do not include VAT, and the prices and the amount of VAT are separately stated. However, when commodities are sold in the retailing link, the tax amount is still included in the prices, rather than separately stated. Compared with the former tax system, the new VAT merely makes changes in the method of tax calculation, but it does not increase the overall tax burden of commodities. Hence, the selling prices of commodities should not be raised. Using special invoices to implement the VAT can close the loophole of loss of state taxes. However, for small taxpayers who do not have sound accounting and auditing practices, the marketing of their products will be affected, to a certain extent, because they are not included in this taxation category, which will be unfavorable to the production, operation, and development of small enterprises. So, how can we solve this problem? Liu Zhongli said: This problem really exists and we have taken note of it. To affect the production and operation of these enterprises, we have already taken a number of measures. However, the fundamental way is still to help these small enterprises take the path of sound accounting and auditing so as to promote and strengthen the VAT administration. Implementation of the land VAT helps standardize the order of real estate transactions, rationally regulate value-added land gains, and keep land and apartment speculation in check. It is a good thing. However, some foreign businessmen have strongly objected to it, so is it unfavorable to foreign investment in our country's real estate industry? Liu Zhongli pointed out: Since 1987, our country has been reforming the system of land use and has allowed profit-making transfers of land use rights. Over the past two years, the real estate industry has developed very rapidly and the real estate market has begun to take shape. At the same time, however, some problems also have arisen. For example, land allotment crazes arose in some localities, and some units and individuals took the opportunity to speculate on plots of land and unbuilt apartments so that the state incurred great losses in land assets gains, whereas certain units and individuals reaped staggering profits, thus affecting the normal operation of the state's overall macroscopic regulation. To reverse this situation, we began to levy the land VAT, the purpose of which is to encourage normal real estate development and management, curb real estate speculation, and standardize the order of real estate transactions. The State Council already has promulgated regulations, stipulating that the land VAT must be levied, the unified tax system must be enforced throughout the country, and no locality is allowed to work out its own policy. Some reasonable suggestions will be considered when drawing up the detailed rules and regulations for implementation. There is no tax reduction or exemption in the VAT, but for those enterprises and professions which really have run into difficulties and are supported the state -- such as welfare enterprises set up by the disabled and the coal industry -- how can their tax burden be settled and lightened? Li Zhongli said: Even the VAT rate of these enterprises and professions cannot be altered because the following links will have to bear a heavier tax burden if theirs are lightened. So what should we do? We can take the method of levying the tax first, before returning the proceeds to them. In addition, we can adjust our financial policy to support the development of these enterprises and professions. Overall, the Tax Reform Will Not Increase Enterprises' Tax Burden After reforming enterprise income tax and levying the new VAT, some enterprises complained that they had to bear a heavier tax burden, so what actually has been achieved by the three months' practice? As far as the turnover tax reform is concerned, enterprises are most affected by the VAT reform. Since VAT is an extra-price levy and the sytem of tax deduction by producing invoices is implemented, such taxes paid by enterprises are the remaining sum of the taxable amount of goods sold minus the taxable amount of goods bought, and is transferred to buyers through sales. Hence, the VAT will not increase enterprises' tax burden. Liu Zhongli said: The three months' practice of the new tax reform also proves that the tax burden of most enterprises is the same as before, or even slightly less than previously, and that only a minority of enterprises are affected by the reform, and the effect is next to nothing. Such being the case, why have some people said that they shoulder a heavier tax burden? Liu Zhongli said: One of the situations is that in the past several years, the task of tax levies was not strictly fulfilled, and various localities reduced or exempted many taxes, so when we started levying the new VAT at every level and closed all the loopholes, some people perhaps felt that their tax burden was heavier than before. Another situation is due to a broader tax base. For example, suppose the tax rate is three percent and the pre-reform annual turnover was 1 million yuan, then 30,000 yuan of tax should be paid, but when the post-reform annual turnover reaches 1.3 million yuan, then 36,000 yuan of tax should be paid. Such a case cannot be considered an increase in the tax rate and the tax burden, but is due to a broader tax base brought about by a larger turnover. In addition, the reform of enterprise income tax has unified income taxes paid by all types of enterprises, which are all subject to a 33 percent proportional tax rate. Moreover, the regulatory tax for state-owned enterprises has been abolished, and such enterprises are exempt from paying "two funds" ["liang jin" 0357 6855 refers to construction fees and budget adjustment funds for key energy and communication projects]. For enterprises having a low profit level, a two-grade proportional tax rate, that is, 27 percent and 18 percent, has been set. In this way, most enterprises have a lighter income tax burden than before.
