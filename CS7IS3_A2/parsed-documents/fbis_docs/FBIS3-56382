"This is a historic moment," he said at a news conference at the Ukrainian Embassy in Moscow, noting that "Ukraine, along with other states, is marching along the road of nuclear disarmament." In Kravchuk's opinion, the joint Russian-American-Ukrainian agreement, signed in Moscow, on the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine gives it a guarantee of security and will help to receive compensation in nuclear fuel. The agreement will also help to step up economic relations with other countries. The withdrawal of strategic nuclear weapons from Ukraine is based on the Russian-Ukrainian treaty. As for tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from the republic, Russian, U.S. and Ukrainian experts will have to determine their value, the Ukrainian president stressed. Later, Ukraine will be compensated in the form of subtraction from Ukrainian debts to Russia for energy carriers. Noting that Russian-Ukrainian relations were given a new impetus, Kravchuk expressed confidence that the problem of the Black Sea Fleet will be settled in 1994 and "then our countries will have a good prospect for the future". "In geopolitical respect, we have to live on this earth of ours, and there is no other way out," the Ukrainian president stressed.
