He noted that their presence is illegal and described them as a "time bomb." He said that if they break the law we will not throw roses or rice at them. Al-Rajjub, who returned to the occupied territories from Tunis on 17 May, said that the agreement that the PLO and Israel signed is "unfair." He said that the Palestinian party is committed to keeping law and order regarding the settlers and others. He said: We pledge to all Palestinian political forces to respect their right to express their stances freely and in a democratic and civilized way. He noted that every political force has the right to call for strikes, stage demonstrations, hold seminars, protest to the authorities, and express their views as they deem fit. However, he vowed that the Palestinian authorities will be firm and not allow any political faction to take the law into its hand and impose a strike by force. Regarding the pro-Israeli collaborators, al-Rajjub, who holds the rank of a colonel in the Palestinian security organ, said that they constitute a very serious factor. He said that this problem will be handled on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the degree of the crime committed by these collaborators. However, he stressed that from now on the Palestinian authorities will not allow any collaborator to think he is above the law or to carry arms on the streets. He called on individuals who collaborated with Israel to reconsider their past so that the new authorities will be able to determine their future. Al-Rajjub emphasized that the Palestinian security organ will establish close cooperation with the Arab security agencies and emphasized that there will be no direct or indirect cooperation with the Israeli security agencies.
