Laar was speaking to reporters after returning from Stockholm where Laar, his Latvian counterpart Valdis Birkavs, and Lithuania's Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius attended an annual meeting of the Nordic Council. But Laar declined to elaborate on the topic of the common tactics. He said relations of all three with Russia were quite similar at the moment. "Also the situation of Lithuania is not much better than that of Estonia and Latvia, because problems are created by the Kaliningrad region and Russia's military transits through Lithuania. When Estonia and Latvia once succeed in getting the Russian troops out, the Kaliningrad region surely will become one of the main security political problems of the Baltic region," the Estonian leader said. He added that the Nordic prime ministers had issued clear-worded political support to demands by Estonia and Latvia that Russian troops be pulled out from these countries by Aug. 31. The Nordic prime ministers in a statement issued at the meeting Monday said Russia must withdraw its troops from Estonia and Latvia by Aug. 31, 1994. Laar said it was very important that the statement included the final date for the troop withdrawal. He said the meeting in Stockholm had named absurd Russia's demands that Estonia must pay 23 million U.S. dollars to build houses for the repatriated Russian military. "Some of the Nordic countries have already allocated money for building flats for military leaving to Russia and have also signed agreements on the issue. Sweden is ready to allocate money at once after the troop withdrawal agreement is signed. There was also an idea voiced in Stockholm that the aid should be channeled directly to the Baltic countries if Russia continues its present course," Laar said. The Estonian prime minister had separate meetings in Stockholm with prime ministers Carl Bildt of Sweden and Esko Aho of Finland. "At those bilateral meetings I didn't deal with complaining about the situation that has emerged, but tried to seek concrete ways for solution. For Estonia speedy integration with Europe surely is one possibility," he concluded.
