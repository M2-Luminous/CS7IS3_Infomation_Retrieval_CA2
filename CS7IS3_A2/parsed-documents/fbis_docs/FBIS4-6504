The People's Army does not waver at all although the imperialists and reactionaries are trying their hardest to stifle the DPRK and destroy the Korean-style socialist system. NODONG SINMUN today says this in an article headlined "Our People's Army is Invincible Revolutionary Armed Forces Unfailingly Loyal to Comrade Supreme Commander". The article goes on: It is a great honour and pride of the Korean people that they have the invincible revolutionary Armed Forces the whole of which is pervaded by intense loyalty to respected comrade supreme commander and whose entire officers and men are fighting vigorously, firmly rallied around comrade supreme commander. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has said: "It is a greatest honour and pride of our party to have the People's Army that resolutely defends the party and the leader and implements to the end the party's orders and instructions at whatever cost". The invincible might of the KPA lies in that the whole Army has the unshakable faith and will to become a gun and bomb decisively defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and a revolutionary Army trait of implementing his orders and instructions to the end even by going through thick and thin without hesitation has been thoroughly established in the whole Army. All men of the KPA from generals to soldiers become a fort and shield to defend respected comrade supreme commander. The officers and men of the People's Army are now taking to their hearts the motto of loyalty "We serve comrade supreme commander!". The KPA does not know the slightest deviation or vacillation in upholding the leadership of Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il with loyalty and is resolute and valiant like an angry lion in defending the authority of its leader. The pledge of faith made by Pak Yong-chol and his seven brothers to become eight rifles and eight bombs decisively defending Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and the resolve of the seven brothers and sisters of Yi Chang-ung to be genuine revolutionaries like Yi In-mo defending General Kim Chong-il with rifles in the van eloquently show how warm and resolute the faith of the officers and men of the KPA in upholding the leader is. The revolutionary Army moral of the KPA represents the spirit of soldiers to unconditionally carry out the orders and instructions of Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il even by dedicating their bodies as human bullets. Proud looks of the KPA lie in the unity in one ideology and will and the oneness of action whereby the entire Army moves as one on orders from Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il, and the well-regulated order of action in which it follows his orders and instructions even if the sky sank to the ground and the ground collapsed. The KPA's revolutionary moral is being displayed to the full not only in performing military duties but also in upholding the grand plan of socialist construction and guidance of comrade supreme commander. The invincible might of the KPA also lies in the beautiful tradition of Army-civilian unity highly displayed among the entire officers and men who take a warm care of and love the people and unhesitatingly lay down their lives for them. All the officers and men of the KPA are devoting their all to crystallizing the idea of Army-civilian unity set forth by Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and are becoming an integrated whole with the people. Holding in high esteem Supreme Commander General Kim Chong-il and upholding his leadership with loyalty is an inseparable noble ideological and moral trait of the officers and men of the People's Army, a revolutionary trait prevailing in the whole Army. As they have invincible ranks, the heroic Korean People's Army capable of defeating any formidable enemy, the Korean people are always confident and convinced that they can accomplish the socialist cause of chuche.
