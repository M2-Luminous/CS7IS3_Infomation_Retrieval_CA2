In the words of Leyla Yunusova, no attempts to destabilize the situation in the Republic are being made by the opposition. On the contrary, the opposition is trying to engage in political struggle by more civilized and democratic methods. According to the NDPA chairman, three main political blocs have emerged in Azerbaijan: two oppositional blocs -- the Democratic Congress and the Centrist Parties Bloc -- and the third bloc -- the leadership of the country. As Leyla Yunusova stressed, there are also parties which for one reason or another do not subscribe to the points of view of these three associations.
