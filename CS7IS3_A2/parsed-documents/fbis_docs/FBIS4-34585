According to what was observed, the big difference is that the COB no longer has the support of the miners, its political guidelines are linked to those of the current government and are without structural changes. After 10 days of meetings, the 10th COB Congress concluded early on the morning of 10 June in the city of Tarija. The expectations of its members and of the government itself were focused on that congress, awaiting the consolidation or rejection of the theories of change and organizational and internal adjustments to the COB. But the reorganization did not take place, and the congress ratified the COB as a "classist and labor" union organization that recognizes the importance of those who do not earn a wage, receives them as important allies, admits their numerical importance, while the political and ideological lines are established by the proletariat. Unlike in previous years, the COB will be led by a union leader and guided by a political document which follows that ideological trend: Oscar Salas of the Democratic Socialist Alternative (ASD). For the first time in its history, the COB will not have the support of one of the most important sectors: the miners. The COB executive secretary, who was reelected, said this will surely weaken the organization a bit. Opposed to this idea, the most radical within the union claim the result of the congress could increase a polarization of positions at the grassroots in the absence of a board that represents the demands of all members. In an unusual form of election, Salas and the executive committee that will accompany him during the next two years were elected by designation of each of the sectors and not by the congress, which is the top union authority. The designation of Executive Secretary Oscar Salas and of Finance Secretary Carlos Camargo was established after they left the congress; the installation of the new union board was held in absence of the top leader and half of the congress participants. The organization of the executive committee which will be led by Oscar Salas does -- as he himself admitted -- strongly favor parties of the government coalition, 50 percent in total. Among them are leaders of the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement], of the MBL [Free Bolivia Movement], and of the UCS [Solidarity Civic Union], while the rest comprises the ASD, Eje Pachacuti [Pachacuti Axis Movement], Comunero, Condepa [Conscience of the Fatherland], MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left], FRI [Revolutionary Front of the Left], POR [Revolutionary Workers Party], and the PIE [expansion unknown] of the Filemon Escobar trend. Salas said this has little importance because during the previous administration the COB was fully controlled by the Patriotic Accord.
