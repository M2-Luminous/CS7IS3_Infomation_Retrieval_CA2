FR941110-0-00178 FR941110-0-00016 We would invite facilities to use inservice programs conducted by sources with an in-depth knowledge of the area(s) which require specific training so the positive change is achieved and maintained. We would also encourage facilities to use programs developed by well established centers of geriatric health services education and training. These centers include, but are not limited to, schools of medicine or nursing, Area Health Education Centers, and centers for aging. These centers should have established programs in geriatrics and geriatric psychiatry. We only recommend to the facility where it can obtain its inservice training program. The ultimate test of the training program will be in the outcome of care achieved by the facility after completion of the training program. If the resident's care circumstance has not improved after training, the facility, upon resurvey by the State agency, will be subject to stronger sanctions. We also require that the payment for the directed inservice training is the responsibility of the facility. Section 488.426␣Closure or Transfer of Residents, or Both Comment: Several commenters said that HCFA should give more guidance on when closure of a facility and/or transfer of residents are appropriate. Others were concerned because the regulations did not set out procedures for State transfer of residents. A few commenters said that closures should be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the proposed §488.240. Some commenters insisted that closing a facility should only be a last resort when alternative methods have failed or the physical plant is unsafe. Other commenters said HCFA should include a definition of the term ``emergency'' in the regulations. Response: The closure of a facility and/or transfer of the residents are measures of last resort that are taken only in an emergency situation. These actions are rare, but most States have had experience with such actions. Most States have a relocation plan that outlines the circumstances under which the plan will be put into effect and the procedures to be followed. Because of this, we believe it would be unnecessary to mandate procedures for States to follow in cases of closure or transfer of residents. The Act places the responsibility for closure and/or transfer upon the States and proposed §488.240, the content of which is now incorporated into §488.426, requires any transfers to be orderly. We do not believe that any greater procedural specificity is required in Federal regulations. We also do not believe that it is necessary to define ``emergency.'' We define words only if their definitions will have a narrower application than definitions commonly found in dictionaries. That is not the case for the use of the word ``emergency'' in this regulation. Comment: Some commenters insisted that a temporary manager be appointed to oversee the transfers whenever large numbers of residents are involved. Other commenters believed that States should be required to get a court order before closing a facility or transferring residents. Response: We do not agree with these comments. We believe the States should retain the flexibility to implement emergency relocation plans according to the circumstances of each case. The States have the knowledge and experience to choose the optimum combination of procedures to handle each unique situation. Obtaining a court order could delay the implementation of the relocation plan in an emergency situation and would add nothing to the process. The same can be said about the imposition of a temporary manager, because it is the State that is experienced in closure and/or transfer of residents' situations, not necessarily a temporary manager. Comment: One commenter noted that the Act at section 1919(h)(5) cross references the transfer of residents to sections pertaining to facility-initiated transfers and discharges. Consequently, the final rule must require States to set up procedures which include written notice, involvement of ombudsmen and orientation procedures. Response: Sections 1819(h)(4) and 1919(h)(5) of the Act, which make reference to a resident's rights upon transfer, speak to them as they relate to the ``safe and orderly transfer of the residents *␣*␣*'' We believe that whatever appeal rights individual residents have when the facility in which they reside faces termination bear only on the appropriateness of the transfer plans for those individuals and not the correctness of the government's decision to terminate the facility's provider agreement. For example, an individual may disagree with the nature or location of the facility to which he is slated for transfer and could challenge such a decision under the appeals process provided by sections 1819(e)(3) and 1919(e)(3) of the Act.
