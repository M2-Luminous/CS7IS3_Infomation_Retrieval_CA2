Since the adoption of the reform and opening up policy, Inner Mongolia has achieved rapid economic and social progress, and the living standards of its people of various nationalities have improved substantially. Owing to historical, geographical, and social factors, however, the region remains quite underdeveloped when compared with developed areas. While Premier Li Peng says in his government work report that "it takes time before such a situation can be changed once and for all," what Wang Qun, secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee, is thinking about is how to shorten the time as much as possible. Wang Qun said: To speed up the development under market economic conditions, we must have new ideas and merge Inner Mongolia's economic development and the central government's macroeconomic regulation and control and strategy. We also must establish our footing in relying on our own efforts, bring our local resources into play, and work hard according to the law of market economy. By doing this we can keep our own initiative and achieve a sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development. Under the new situation, we will miss the good opportunities if we wait and hesitate. Wang Qun said: To develop our economy under the new situation, our remote minority region must reassess its strengths and weaknesses. Inner Mongolia is a big place with rich natural resources. We have an area that is one-eighth of the national total, but we have only 22 million people. Our potential for developing farming, animal husbandry, village and town enterprises, energy and raw material industries is great and our market is huge. Now the state has brought the policy of supporting and promoting minority areas' economic development into its macroeconomic regulation and control and will give minority areas even greater support in terms of investment and preferential measures, we should say that this has provided Inner Mongolia with a historical opportunity for development. Feeling a little excited at this time, Wang Qun continued: "Facing such an opporrunity, the vast number of cadres and people in Inner Mongolia must do away with their outmoded concepts that took shape under the planned economic system that had gone on for a long time; heighten their awareness about information, the market, opening up, economic returns, competition, and the law; and understand and master objective laws about the market economy, such as laws governing value, supply and demand, and competition." Commenting on cooperation between Inner Mongolia and neighboring regions and developed areas, Wang Qun said that the economic development in Inner Mongolia and those areas can be complementary. He said: Inner Mongolia can at least become a base producing meat and nonstaple foodstuffs for northeast and north China. Grain is a special commodity, and Inner Mongolia can provide them with large quantities of wheat, corn, soybean, and other miscellaneous cereal crops of good quality. Because Inner Mongolia has plenty of raw materials and fuel resources, we can serve as a powerful base for material and fuel supply for coastal areas in east China and other economically developed areas enjoying fast industrial growth. Generally speaking, people in Inner Mongolia are not very well trained; but we can use the vast personnel markets. We can send people to study and receive training in the South, and we can also hire people in the South to give full scope to their abilities in Inner Mongolia. Wang Qun said: Opening up to the outside world is another important respect. The region's total imports and exports in 1993 topped that of the previous year by 28 percent, reaching $1.2 billion. The region also made substantial headway in 1993 with regard to utilizing foreign capital, investing in areas outside the region, contracting foreign construction projects, and exporting labor services. Inner Mongolia shares a 4,200-kilometer long border with Russia and the People's Republic of Mongolia, and its 18 border towns are playing an increasingly important role. Many leagues, banners, and counties are actively bringing in the foreign capital they need for upgrading the technology of their enterprises so their goods can become more competitive in the world market. The world markets for the region's agricultural and livestock products, construction materials, alkaline-based chemical goods, and coal are broadening. Wang Qun concluded: While Inner Mongolia will establish the footing of its economic development in the domestic market, we will also explore the world market so that these two markets can promote one another. Only by doing this can we train a large number of capable personnel; set up a great number of competitive enterprises; improve the efficiency, quality, and exchange-earning capability of our farming and animal husbandry. By then, the economic development of our remote, minority region will have a greater vitality and will have reached a higher level.
