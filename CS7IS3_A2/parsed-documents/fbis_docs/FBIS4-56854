The deputies have asked for a special meeting of the Chamber of Deputies to analyze the meaning, purpose, and terms of a free trade agreement with the United States. Jose Antonio Viera Gallo, president of the Socialist Party bloc in the Chamber of Deputies, told reporters that Chile's foreign trade is very diversified, that its main trade partners are in Asia and the EU, and that the U.S. share of Chile's foreign trade is only 20.5 percent. The socialist deputy underscored that Chile's trade with the EU and Asia yields a surplus while its trade with the United States generates a deficit. Viera Gallo emphasized that an agreement with the United States will not greatly benefit Chile and cautioned against "a mirage." He added that a free trade agreement will probably improve the sales of manufactured products which currently pay high customs rates in the United States, but will harm exports of raw materials which now pay just 1.8 percent in the United States. Viera Gallo pointed out that the United States has already raised objections regarding three sensitive areas: price brackets for agricultural products, waiting periods for the repatriation of capital which the United States wants to be less than 1 year, and intellectual property rights because the Chilean law on patents is considered inadequate. Socialist Party deputies, who belong to the ruling coalition, have also indicated that a new agreement must be reached with the members of the Common Market of the South: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay.
