At that time, today's fighters for democracy did not even mention Slovak statehood, let alone the Slovak presidency. Even my friend Jozef Sitko, currently chief of the president's press section, once called speculation about a Slovak state and the post of Slovak president extremely nationalistic. I reminded Mr. Michal Kovac of this immediately after his election as president, at his meeting with nationally oriented journalists. To make matters clear right from the start, I supported Michal Kovac's candidacy for the presidency both as journalist and as deputy to the former CSFR Federal Assembly, particularly in view of his contribution, as chairman of the Federal Assembly, to the civilized and constitutional partition of the Czechoslovak state. The sort of people with whom the president surrounded himself after his election came as a shock to me, however. Some people from his circle were active opponents of Slovak statehood. The president repeats in a stereotyped way that he wants to be everyone's president. Although this sounds nice, many of us are asking whether he also wants to be the president of those who had fought for an independent Slovakia. All kinds of Czechoslovakist and anti-Slovak cadres have entrenched themselves at the Castle [seat of the Slovak president]. One of them is Alojz Rajnic, deputy to the former Federal Assembly for the Christian Democratic Movement. In the Office of the President, he was in charge of the Slovak state's security policy. What were his qualifications for this post? While a Federal Assembly deputy, he had voted against an independent Slovak state. A few days ago, I learned that he was leaving the Castle at long last. He is leaving to assume the post of chief of an outlying branch of the Presidential Office that is being set up in Kosice. During our last meeting, I conveyed to the president these objections in person. I was extremely perturbed by the fact that a certain aversion to Prime Minister Meciar, verging on hatred, had taken possession of him. He told me briefly what he also said in the National Council of the Slovak Republic the day before yesterday. I conceded that Meciar was making mistakes, also with regard to diplomatic restraint. What cannot be ignored, however, is the credit he deserves for the founding of the state and the enormous endeavor he is devoting to the elimination of the transformation pangs and the building of Slovak statehood. In no way has he ever violated the Constitution, the law, or the principles of democracy, freedom, and pluralism. The Meciar phenomenon is stirring Slovakia; the young state needs both Michal Kovac and Vladimir Meciar, I wrote after that meeting. I hoped that they would make their peace with one another. After all, in the Czech Republic, too, there are disagreements between the president and the prime minister, but no one is making a fuss about it. Unfortunately, the Slovak president has turned the misunderstandings between the Castle and the government into a confrontational drama. Like a telltale, he complained to the world that the prime minister did not come to welcome him at the airport. The president has become too absorbed in himself. It is as though he did not want to take into consideration certain historical connections. For example, he accepts without any reservations the title of first Slovak president. "The president's Slovaks" (they bear the emblem of the president's banner) do not protest and do not emphasize that Michal Kovac is the second Slovak president. The first president was Dr. Jozef Tiso, irrespective of his evaluation by history. The Slovak nation can excuse all kinds of things, but the sight of Michal Kovac with headphones on, listening to a Hungarian-Slovak translation at the congress of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement, was an insult to the stately post of Slovak president. The people were looking forward to the Slovak president's speech [in parliament on 9 March]; they expected it to be conciliatory, calming, and supremely statesmanlike. What they heard, however, were tones of confrontation that open the doors to the Balkanization of our life. Unfortunately, these are the traces that the second Slovak president is leaving behind him. He has somehow forgotten who supported him, nominated him, and elected him. Under the influence of his advisers, he has staked on a risky card. He has not even noticed that he is cheered mostly by those who did not want an independent Slovakia.
