FBIS4-13306 "drnes076_d_94001" FBIS-NES-94-076 Daily Report 16 Apr 1994 Libya Minister Comments on Solidarity With Iraq Minister Comments on Solidarity With Iraq JN1604161194 Baghdad INA in Arabic 1230 GMT 16 Apr 94 JN1604161194 Baghdad INA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (INA)--Tahir al-Juhaymi, Libyan minister of economy and finance, has called on Arab countries to release Iraq's frozen assets from their banks in order to confront the unfair embargo imposed by an unjust American will. Al-Juhaymi made a press statement to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Cairo on the periphery of a meeting held by Arab financial institutions. He said no law in the world allows any force to confiscate and freeze other countries' assets, for any reason. This represents a strong blow to international laws and norms. He described the embargo imposed by the United States and its allies on Iraq, and the freezing of Iraq's assets, as a negative turning point in the history of international relations and the United Nations. This is a full-blown confrontation between the correct and progressive forces in the world and the incorrect and colonialist forces on another. He said the embargo on the Iraqi and Libyan people and the continuous killing and starving of their sons before the eyes of the world represents the end of international legitimacy and the fall of all slogans raised by Western countries and America about human rights, democracy, and the so-called new world order. The Libyan economics minister reiterated his country's total solidarity with the people and Government of Iraq in waging the fateful battle and their efforts to foil the embargo. He said he is confident that Iraqi and Libyan victory in the battle will inevitably be achieved.
