FR940526-0-00039 FR940526-0-00016 5. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 5 Kentucky proposes to add a new subsection (4) which states that the requirements of 405 KAR 24:040 section 2(6) must be met if the applicant proposes to conduct surface mining activities within 100 feet of a public road. The proposal is substantively identical to that portion of the Federal rule concerning public roads as set forth at 30 CFR 778.16(c). Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than its Federal counterpart. 6. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 10 Kentucky proposes to revise section 10 to clarify that the rule pertains to applications for a permit, major revision, amendment, transfer, or renewal of a permit, and to require that any proof of publication which is filed must be acceptable to the cabinet. The revision to section 10 is substantively identical to the Federal rule set forth at 30 CFR 778.21 except that the Federal rule doesn't require proof of publication for permit transfers. There is no Federal counterpart for proof of publication of a permit transfer, but this is consistent with 30 CFR 774.17 which requires advertisement of the transfer. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposal is no less effective than its Federal counterparts. 7. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 37 Kentucky proposes to revise the information required in the postmining land use mining and reclamation plan, to include a discussion of how the proposed postmining land use is to be achieved, including management practices to be conducted during the liability period for the commercial forestland, cropland (including hayland), and pastureland land uses. There is no direct Federal counterpart. However, the proposal is consistent with 30 CFR 780.23(a)(2). Additionally, Kentucky proposes to delete former subsection (1)(d) which required that the reclamation plan include detailed management practices when the postmining land use was grazing. Pursuant to 405 KAR 16:210, grazing is not one of the approved land uses in Kentucky. Therefore, the Director finds that the deletion of this subsection does not render the State's program inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA or the Federal regulations and is approving the deletion. 8. 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 Section 38 Kentucky proposes to delete section 38 which deals with the mining and reclamation plan for transportation of coal on public roads. This deletion was appropriate since Kentucky had deleted the statutory authority for this regulation. On August 10, 1990, OSM approved (55 FR 32619) the deletion of this statutory authority, which was previously found at KRS 350.060(11). In addition, there is no corresponding requirement in either SMCRA or the Federal rule. The Director finds that the proposed deletion will not render Kentucky's program inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments Public Comments The public comment periods and opportunities to request a public hearing were announced as follows: (1) For the submission dated June 28, 1991 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1059), in the July 22, 1991, Federal Register (56 FR 33398); (2) For the submission dated March 13, 1992 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1119), in the April 23, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 14818); (3) For the submission dated July 21, 1992 (Administrative Record Number KY&hyph;1167), in the September 23, 1992, Federal Register (57 FR 43946); and (4) The proposed revisions were reopened for public comment in the October 27, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 57767). The public comment periods closed on August 21, 1991, May 8, 1992, October 8, 1992, and November 26, 1993, respectively. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearings so no hearings were held. The Kentucky Resources Council (KRC) filed comments regarding Kentucky's proposed deletion of 405 KAR 8:030/8:040 sections 2(6) and 38. In regard to the deletion of section 2(6), the Director has considered the concerns raised by KRC as discussed in Finding III.2. herein, and determined that the proposed deletion would render Kentucky's program less effective than the Federal program. With regard to the proposed deletion of section 38, KRC questioned the wisdom of the deletion since KRC felt that information required by section 38 ``provided an important source of information linking numerous contract mines to the companies who controlled the extraction and the processing of the coal.'' KRC stated that ``[T]he maps have provided information that has resulted in the imposition of reclamation liability on companies that owned or controlled the contract mines, based on linkages that might otherwise not have been possible to support absent such information.'' In addition to the reasons discussed in the Director's Findings, there are no comparable requirements in the Federal regulations for the submission of such information. OSM cannot require states to enforce provisions for which there are no Federal requirements. Therefore, the Director is approving the proposed deletion. The Director notes that he found Kentucky's ownership and/or control information requirements, with two exceptions, to be no less effective than the Federal regulations. See 56 FR 47907, September 23, 1991).
