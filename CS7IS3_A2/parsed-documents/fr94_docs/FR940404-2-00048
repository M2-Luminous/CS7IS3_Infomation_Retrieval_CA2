FR940404-2-00048 FR940404-2-00034 3.2.2.1␣ Hottest wash at minimum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.1 for a test load as specified in section 2.8.2.1. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E ht,min . 3.2.2.2␣ Hot wash at minimum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.2 for a test load as specified in section 2.8.2.1. The hot wash setting shall be at a minimum of 140 ○F (60 ○C) and a maximum of 145 ○F (62.8 ○C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E h,min . 3.2.2.3␣ Warm wash at minimum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.2 for warm wash setting at a minimum of 100 ○F (37.8 ○C) and a maximum of 105 ○F (40.6 ○C). Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E w,min . 3.2.2.4␣ Cold wash at minimum fill. Repeat section 3.2.1.1 for the coldest wash setting. Measure and record the kilowatt-hours of electrical energy consumed for the complete cycle as E c,min . Ensure that the inlet water temperature is maintained per section 2.3.1. (iv) Sections 4.1 through 4.6 in Appendix J shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 4.1␣ Per-cycle temperature-weighted machine electrical energy consumption for maximum and minimum water fill levels. Calculate the per-cycle temperature-weighted electrical energy consumption for the maximum water fill level, E max , and for the minimum water fill level, E min , expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as: E max = (0.05 × E ht,max ) + (0.25 × E h,max ) + (0.55 × E w,max ) + (0.15 × E c,max ) E min = (0.05 × E ht,min ) + (0.25 × E h,min ) + (0.55 × E w,min ) + (0.15 × E c,min ) where: E ht,max =as defined in section 3.2.1.1 E h,max =as defined in section 3.2.1.2 E w,max =as defined in section 3.2.1.3 E c,max =as defined in section 3.2.1.4 E ht,min =as defined in section 3.2.2.1 E h,min =as defined in section 3.2.2.2 E w,min =as defined in section 3.2.2.3 E c,min =as defined in section 3.2.2.4 4.2␣ Total per-cycle machine electrical energy consumption. Calculate the total per-cycle energy consumption, E TE , expressed in kilowatt-hours per cycle and defined as: E TE =(0.72×E max ) + (0.28×E min ) where: E max, E min = as defined in section 4.1 (v) In CFR §430.22, paragraph (j)(1)(i)(B), change the following: From: ``*␣*␣* according to 4.6 of Appendix (j) *␣*␣*'' To: ``*␣*␣* according to 4.2 of Appendix (j) *␣*␣*'' (vi) Section 430.22 of the CFR, paragraph (j)(2), shall be deleted and replaced with the following: (J)(2) The energy factor for water-heating clothes washers shall be the quotient of the cubic foot capacity of the clothes container as determined in 3.1 of appendix J to this subpart divided by the clothes washer energy consumption per cycle expressed as the total per-cycle machine electrical energy consumption as determined in 4.2 of appendix J to this subpart. The resulting shall be rounded off to the nearest 0.01 cubic foot per kilowatt-hour. (3) The Waiver shall remain in effect from the date of issuance of this Order until DOE prescribes final test procedures appropriate to these washing machines, models 10504, 12004, and 20004, manufactured by Asko. (4) This Waiver is based upon the presumed validity of statements, allegations, and documentary materials submitted by the petitioner. This Waiver may be revoked or modified at any time upon a determination that the factual basis underlying the Petition is incorrect. (5) This Waiver supersedes the Interim Waiver granted to Asko on September 7, 1993 (58 FR 47130). Issued in Washington, DC, March 25, 1994. Frank M. Stewart, Jr., Acting Chief of Staff, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;7875 Filed 4&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
