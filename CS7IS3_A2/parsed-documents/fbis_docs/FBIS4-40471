This was stated on Thursday in an interview to Interfax by Viktor Ilyukhin. He noted that this fact was reflected in the State Duma's decision, which had been prepared on this matter. The lower chamber plans to discuss the president's edict at a plenary meeting on Friday 17 June. Ilyukhin stressed that in conditions when the Constitutional Court is temporarily not operating, only the president can halt the operation of the edict. A recommendation to Boris Yeltsin to do this is also set out in the draft State Duma decision.
