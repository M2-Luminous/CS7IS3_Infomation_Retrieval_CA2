He said that the presidential anti-crime decree was one of the first signs of emergency legislation on the issue. Shakhray believes that Russia is doomed to live through a period of extraordinary legislation. He says that in the struggle against banditry and organized crime there can be no place for competition between the State Duma, the president and other institutions of power. "They still have to pool their efforts," Shakhray said. He said that a number of provisions in President Boris Yeltsin's decrees had been followed up upon in a draft law approved by the government and submitted to parliament for approval. The future law would "dramatically enhance responsibility for both committing and organizing crimes." "The basic human right is the right to life and the safety of children and the family. All other rights must be made subordinate to that right," he said.
