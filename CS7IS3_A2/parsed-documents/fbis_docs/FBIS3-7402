The inspection, in line with a government-wide move to stamp out irregularities related to state-funded construction projects, will focus on how Yulgok projects were awarded to civilian contractors, whether they are proceeding as scheduled and if there are any irregularities, ministry officials said Monday. Most of these projects were launched as long-term undertakings under a tight security lid and thus have not been inspected over the years. The first-time inspection will be extensive in covering many Yulgok construction projects and put particular stress on checking whether project officials have taken bribes, an official said.
