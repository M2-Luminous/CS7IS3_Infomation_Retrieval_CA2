The incident raises a question. Had the two American helicopters been downed by Iraqi aircraft what would have been the consequences? Answer--disastrous. By now, Pentagon would have mobilized allied support and once again we would have witnessed a display of American military machismo with innocent Iraqi citizens being the target of relentless hellfire of the allied war machine. Though the blunder has shaken up the whole Clinton administration, outwardly it has managed to remain calm and unperturbed by issuing the usual, monotonous statements of "working as quickly as possible to complete the investigation into how the accident happened," and offering the perfunctory condolences to the families of the victims. It's only when Americans erroneously kill their compatriots or get killed by the enemy that it becomes an eye-opener for U.S. policy makers to review their rules of engagements in military operations abroad. The rules defining when U.S. forces can attack enemies have now been tightened. Last year's missile attack on the Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad over the `Bush kill plot' controversy, is still fresh in the mind. President Bill Clinton, just a few months in office when he ordered the surprise missile attack, was bubbling with confidence. Now after a series of foreign policy and military faux pas we see a Clinton deflated and the American people demoralized over Washington's foreign policy. Human errors made at the lower levels are a reflection of bigger blunders committed by the top brass. The American military has become overbearing, insufferable and bumptious just like its leadership. Its aggressive attitude towards the `enemy'--to kill rather than counter--has made even missions, supposedly altruistic, into bungling operations, nullifying their very purpose. In this case, even presuming that the helicopters had been Iraqi, it would not have justified shooting them down, without any provocation. During the three years the allied forces have been monitoring the no-fly zone, in northern Iraq, no Iraqi aircraft have been sighted as far north in the no-fly zone, as the U.S. Blackhawks were. When it comes to firing at the enemy, the normal international flight procedures and safety rules are completely violated. Nay, they don't exist at all for the American military forces. Recall how they downed an Iran Air flight to Dubai in July 1988 by "erroneously" identifying it an enemy aircraft? And in October 1992, the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga fired a missile at the Turkish destroyer Muavenet, killing five Turks including the captain? U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry admits that half a dozen procedures should have been in place to have prevented the latest `friendly fire' tragedy, while General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff says the F-15 pilots were not required to get clearance before firing their missiles at the `enemy'. Which all goes to show that the top officials themselves are foggy about the rules governing such eventualities.
