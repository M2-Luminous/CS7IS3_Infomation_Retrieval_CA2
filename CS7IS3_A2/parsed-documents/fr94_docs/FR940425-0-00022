FR940425-0-00022 FR940425-0-00016 25. The Commission's staff is continuing to work with NTIA to make government spectrum available for relocation of existing 2 GHz operations. Further, the Commission believes NTIA will make a good faith effort to accommodate as many as possible of the links recommended for relocation by the Commission. The Commission will request that special consideration be given to reaccommodating links that are technically difficult to accommodate elsewhere, including those that operate in bands allocated for unlicensed services, those of public safety services, and those that require long paths. 26. AMSC Subsidiary Corporation (AMSC) requested that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding not apply to the 1970&hyph;1990 and 2160&hyph;2180 MHz bands. AMSC stated that these bands were allocated internationally at the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference to the mobile satellite service (MSS) and plans to petition to have them allocated to MSS domestically in the near future. AMSC argued that the relocation rules adopted in this proceeding were developed for local markets and terrestrial technologies and that they may not be feasible for MSS, which operates nationwide or, in some cases, worldwide. 27. This proceeding establishes relocation rules for the emerging technologies bands and does not address what types of services should be authorized in these bands. Other rule making proceedings, such as 2 GHz PCS, address specific services. Thus, AMSC's request is beyond the scope of this proceeding and therefore is not being adopted, but may be considered in a later proceeding that addresses MSS. 28. Ordering clauses. Accordingly, it is ordered , That the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed to the Second R&O by Comsearch, Digital Microwave Corporation, and Western Tele-Communications, Inc. and the petitions for clarification or reconsideration filed to the Third R&O) by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials Special Committee on Communications, Public Safety Communications Council, Public Safety Microwave Committee, Forestry-Conservation Communications Association, Association of American Railroads, Unlicensed PCS Ad Hoc Committee for 2 GHz Microwave Transition and Management, Utilities Telecommunications Council, Apple Computer, and AMSC Subsidiary Corporation are granted to the degree stated above and are denied in all other respects. 29. Further, it is ordered , That parts 21, 22, and 94 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations are amended as specified below effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register . This action is taken pursuant to sections 4(i), 7(a), 303(c), 303(g), and 303(r), of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 157(a), 303(c), 303(g), and 303(r). 30. It is further ordered , That this proceeding is terminated. List of Subjects 47 CFR Part 21 Radio. 47 CFR Part 22 Radio. 47 CFR Part 94 Radio. Amendatory Text I. Parts 21, 22, and 94 of title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as follows: PART 21_DOMESTIC PUBLIC FIXED RADIO SERVICES 1. The authority citation in part 21 continues to read: Authority: Secs. 1, 2, 4, 201&hyph;205, 208, 215, 218, 303, 307, 313, 314, 403, 404, 410, 602; 48 Stat. as amended, 1064, 1066, 1070&hyph;1073, 1076, 1077, 1080, 1082, 1083, 1087, 1094, 1098, 1102; 47 U.S.C. 151, 154, 201&hyph;205, 208, 215, 218, 303, 307, 313, 314, 403, 404, 602; 47 U.S.C. 552. 2. Section 21.50 is amended by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows: ยง21.50 Transition of the 2.11&hyph;2.13 and 2.16&hyph;2.18 GHz bands from Domestic Public Fixed Radio Services to emerging technologies. (a) Licensees proposing to implement services using emerging technologies (ET Licensees) may negotiate with Domestic Public Fixed Radio Service licensees (Existing Licensees) in these bands for the purpose of agreeing to terms under which the Existing Licensees would relocate their operations to other fixed microwave bands or to other media, or alternatively, would accept a sharing arrangement with the ET Licensee that may result in an otherwise impermissible level of interference to the existing licensee's operations. ET Licensees may also negotiate agreements for relocation of the Existing Licensees' facilities within the 2 GHz band in which all interested parties agree to the relocation of the Existing Licensee's facilities elsewhere within these bands. ``All interested parties'' includes the incumbent licensee, the emerging technology provider or representative requesting and paying for the relocation, and any emerging technology licensee of the spectrum to which the incumbent's facilities are to be relocated. (b) Domestic Public Fixed Radio licensees in bands allocated for licensed emerging technology services will maintain primary status in these bands until two years after the Commission commences acceptance of applications for an emerging technology services, and until one year after an emerging technology service licensee initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations or, in bands allocated for unlicensed emerging technology services, until one year after an emerging technology unlicensed equipment supplier or representative initiates negotiations for relocation of the fixed microwave licensee's operations. When it is necessary for an emerging technology provider or representative of unlicensed device manufacturers to negotiate with a fixed microwave licensee with operations in spectrum adjacent to that of the emerging technology provider, the transition schedule of the entity requesting the move will apply. * * * * *
