All delegates to the IAEA Board of Governors looked relieved. The IAEA dropped the North Korean nuclear issue as the United States and other powerful countries thought it would. They had chosen this approach among many possibilities because the IAEA governors would easily accept this formula without opposition. It has been proven that this approach had been correctly chosen. Hours before the meeting began, it had been speculated that the meeting would conclude the discussion in a few hours. The IAEA spokesman frequently came out of the meeting room and smiled, as if to say that the meeting was progressing well. When we analyze the entire scene, we realize that the IAEA does not want to do its duty regarding the North Korean nuclear issue. The IAEA should be involved in and resolve any nuclear issue worldwide. This time, however, the IAEA referred the North Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council, where "power" is applied to resolve issues. This, in a sense, is an act of shirking its duty, which the French delegate severely criticized. When the governors cast votes on the IAEA resolution, they did so after examining if it would be correct for them to refer the North Korean nuclear issue to the `power' of international politics, not if North Korea had really rejected nuclear inspections. The UN Security Council will decide on the North Korean nuclear issue based on the interests of various member nations and the power structure of international politics. Each country involved, however, expressed its view on this issue at the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. A majority of governors voted for the resolution because they agreed they should deal with the North Korean nuclear issue by mustering the "will of the world" at the United Nations. Some of the governors abstained after examining their own interests and nonnuclear concerns. Five among the 35 governors abstained. This means one-seventh expressed semiopposition on this issue. The IAEA stressed that it would absolve North Korea anytime it receives nuclear inspections. The prevailing opinion, however, was that no IAEA governor expected that North Korea would do so.
