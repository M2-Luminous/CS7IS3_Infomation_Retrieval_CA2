The joint venture between the Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford and China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) will be the first for Ford, which, in 1978, was the first the big three automakers to sell vehicles in China after 1949. "We are extremely pleased to have SAIC as a partner," said Alex Trotman, Ford chairman and CEO after meeting with Shanghai's Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren last week in Dearbon. "We believe that this joint venture will be good for Ford, good for our partner and good for China," the chairman stressed. Ford sources said that SAIC's Yan Feng Division and Ford's Plastic and Trim Products Division will collaborate to produce automotive components including interior trim, seats, instrument panels and other plastic parts. Ford, meanwhile, is involved in discussions with several Chinese manufacturers that could lead to joint ventures in such automotive product areas as glass, electronics, engine mangement and air conditioning. The company, Ford sources said, is also interested in vehicle assembly opportunities in China. Ford has representative offices in Beijing and Shanghai and recently established a new Ford China Operations Organization headed by James Paulsen. A range of North American-build Ford vehicles, including Tempos, has been introduced in China and 10 dealers have been located in major Chinese cities.
