SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 9, 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST) and the FAA issued two related notices on the subject of Federal policy on airport rates and charges. A notice of proposed policy entitled ``Proposed Policy Regarding Airport Rates and Charges,'' listed and explained the principles that the OST and the FAA believes define Federal policy on the rates and fees that an airport proprietor can charge to aeronautical users of the airport. Docket No. 27782 (59 FR 29874, June 9, 1994). Notice 94&hyph;18, a notice of proposed rulemaking entitled ``Rules of Practice for Federally Assisted Airports,'' proposed detailed procedures for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for alleged violation of Federal requirements involving rates and charges and other airport-related requirements (59 FR 29880, June 9, 1994). The FAA Authorization Act of 1994, Public Law 103&hyph;305 (1994 Authorization Act) was signed into law on August 23, 1994. The 1994 Authorization Act includes provisions that specifically address airport rates and charges. This supplemental notice is intended to assure that the proposed policy statement reflects relevant provisions of the 1994 Authorization Act. Summary of Proposed Policy Statement The proposed policy statement includes five principles with supporting guidance for each. In brief, the first principle would establish the continued reliance on direct local negotiation between airports and aeronautical users. DOT/FAA would be available to resolve the issues raised in a dispute when the airport and aeronautical users are unable to resolve disputes directly.
