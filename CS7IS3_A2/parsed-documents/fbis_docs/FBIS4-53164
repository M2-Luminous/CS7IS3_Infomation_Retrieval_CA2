The deal involves four new earth stations to be constructed at JORN transmitter-receiver sites in Queensland and Western Australia and the JORN Co-ordination Centre in Adelaide. As well, NEC will help expand existing earth stations at other Defence Department facilities to improve communications. The new stations will be used to carry signals between JORN sites, via a transponder leased by the Defence Department on one of the Optus B-series satellites. NEC will be required to integrate the new facilities with the management system for the overall Defence Satellite Network under the terms of the contract. Overall control of the network will rest with the Commander Defence Communications Group in Canberra through the Satellite Facilities Control Centre in Melbourne. Known as the JORNSATCOM contract, the work carried out by NEC is essentially a turn-key project and will be carried out by a local team skilled in such work. NEC Australia's managing director, Mr Ben Okamoto, commenting on the use of commercial communications equipment by the Defence Department, said the JORN project represented another step forward in this process. The Director General Joint Project Management in Defence Material, Brigadier Neil Horn, said Defence had a strong commitment to the electronics industry in Australia. "The contract with NEC exemplifies the positive benefits of having resident high-technology companies," he said.
