The message was delivered by two masked, armed members of the IRA's Tyrone Brigade at an evening celebrating the Easter Rising, just hours after Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness hinted that the republican movement would respond positively to renewed direct contacts between the Government and Sinn Fein. Security chiefs in Belfast have meanwhile warned police and troops not to drop their guard before and immediately after the ceasefire ends. The statement from the Tyrone Brigade boasted of the morale-boosting effects of the recent mortar attacks on Heathrow and claimed that the republican movement had never been in a better position to carry on its military campaign. Hundreds listened as the statement was read in a hall near Cookstown, Co [County] Tyrone. One of the IRA men assumed a firing position holding a revolver above his head as another read it out: "The Tyrone brigade of the IRA extends its greetings to you, our loyal supporters and, most especially, to the families of our fallen comrades. Make no mistake about it, never before has the republican movement been stronger, more united or more confident. "A few recent and unscheduled landings at Heathrow worked wonders for us all and it caused serious international embarrassment to the British government. As an army which lives and fights in the occupied zone, we state absolutely that the British will be glad to get out of Ireland when our work is done." The mood of supporters at the event was buoyant, if almost victorious. "Why should we give in to the Brits when we are winning?" was a typical sentiment. The display will be an embarrassment to the Sinn Fein leadership, which has been at pains to cultivate an image of flexibility and commitment to peace. While it could be interpreted as no more than reassurance to stalwarts that the leadership is not about to sell out, it may also appear to confirm Dublin's fears that Mr Adams is not capable of persuading sufficient numbers of the IRA to end violence and take the constitutional path. Irish government sources yesterday indicated they did not expect a breakthrough by the weekend. "There's not enough time in which anything could happen," said one source. Mr Adams said yesterday that the Government could not just criticise or dismiss the IRA ceasefire without proposing an alternative. He was responding to a government statement which said Sinn Fein and the IRA knew exactly what was required to bring peace. They could deliver it if they chose. Martin McGuinness, leading Sinn Fein executive member told a meeting in Derry: "It is my firm conviction that the IRA initiative is clearly an attempt to end the current stalemate around the issue of clarification and to move the peace process forward." David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, told an Apprentice Boys rally in Lurgan that the IRA ceasefire was an attempt to lay the blame for the failure of the peace initiative on Downing Street. He said the ceasefire fooled nobody. "This so called ceasefire is only a manoeuvre. If all that Mr Adams could get from the hard men is three days then Mr Adams isn't worth much consideration." Andrew Rodgers, the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, called for Mr Adams to explain through the media exactly what clarification he needed, so that everyone could judge where the problem lay.
