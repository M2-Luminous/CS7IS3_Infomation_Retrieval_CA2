A series of meetings culminated in a meeting with British Prime Minister John Major. [passage omitted] In a statement to AL-HAYAH, al-Hariri said that British officials are interested in developing bilateral relations, especially in work spheres. They are also interested in bolstering the Army and internal security forces. He stressed their support for Resolution 425 in order to liberate southern Lebanon from the Israeli occupation. Al-Hariri pointed out that the policy pursued by Lebanon in the [peace] negotiations has produced positive results so far. He stressed that no one can conclude an agreement on Lebanon, nor can anyone conclude an agreement at Lebanon's expense. He said that participation in multilateral negotiations before progress is achieved in the bilaterals would harm Lebanon more than its nonparticipation in the multilaterals. He stressed the need to adhere to Resolution 425, "because it is the legal foundation for the Lebanese negotiator." He pointed out that his government is working to tackle the peace challenge, to stand fast, and to rebuild the infrastructure without waiting for aid, despite its importance. Talking about the criticism campaign against the government, he said that the major part of it does not take account of the concept of the democratic process. "It is criticizing figures rather than programs."
