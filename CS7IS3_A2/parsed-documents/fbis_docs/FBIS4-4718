The Japanese diplomats assembled in the antechamber of the government chief's residence were anxiously following the debate under way in the Diet (Parliament), where the opposition was blocking the vote on a budget without which the government could not have functioned. Meetings were shortened or canceled for the same reason. It is therefore a conflicting assessment which the foreign minister drew from the visit he made to Tokyo from 31 March to 2 April. On the one hand, he had "the impression of a real desire by Japan to do something with France." On the other, he was able to assess the limits and difficulties of a "political dialogue" which his visit ("the first bilateral visit for seven years," he pointed out) was aimed at reopening after a period of relative "negligence" following the tensions created in 1991 by Edith Cresson's remarks about Japanese "ants." The problems of the heterogeneous coalition which Mr. Hosokawa heads and the realities of a severe economic recession mean that Japan is still more focused on its internal problems than usual. Alain Juppe was also able to observe that Japan's foreign policy is limited almost entirely to relations with the United States. "Sixty-five percent of our diplomacy is concerned with Washington, 25 percent with our Asian neighbors, and 10 percent with the rest of the world, of which 5 percent is with Europe in general. In that, France does not account for more than 2 percent," a Japanese diplomat said, despite being a lover of France. Juppe twice heard Hosokawa stress the "special relationship" which links Tokyo and Washington. The Japanese certainly expected French support against the threats of American economic sanctions. Juppe criticized "unilateralism" while "hammering home" to his interlocutors that the Europeans would not smile on Japanese-American agreements giving preference to American interests alone. But, outside these tactics of the big three-sided game of international trade, can there be a real "political dialogue" between Paris and Tokyo when France has its highest trade deficit with this country (23 billion francs in 1993) and when it continues to revolve around America? "We are forced to have a dialogue with Tokyo," the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry] replied. First, because Japan has become an economic and financial power (the second in the world) which is strictly speaking impossible to ignore. For instance, Alain Juppe approached his hosts asking them to participate in support for the policy of devaluing the CFA franc in Africa, and helping to try to save Algeria (of which they are the second biggest creditor). And the most practical plans discussed related to cooperation for development in Africa and Indochina. In addition, Juppe said, "a country which has this economic power will not remain a political dwarf." The Japanese are also more present, not only in Asia but on theaters as diverse as Africa, Latin America, and the Near East, and in the international bodies. Tokyo is lobbying for a seat as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and Paris is in favor of that. "This is no longer 1945," Alain Juppe pointed out. "The world has changed..." However, it is necessary to find a way of expanding the Council without reducing its efficacy and without offending other candidates for a seat (India, Egypt, or Brazil). Above all, Japan would have to be prepared to meet the obligations of this status, starting with the dispatch of troops to take part in peacekeeping operations. However, it, like Germany, has not solved the constitutional and political problems which hamper it. The complexity of the question means that the French minister finds it "difficult to see how things could be decided in 1995" (on the 50th anniversary of the United Nations). The menacing question of North Korea's nuclear ambitions is more urgent. Japan preaches caution and moderation whereas France advocates a firm stance. "Our main concern is proliferation," Alain Juppe explained. France is campaigning for a definitive renewal of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1995. The Japanese position is more ambiguous. They sometimes link the question of the NPT and North Korea with that of the ending of nuclear tests. This is an embarrassing link for France which intends "to reserve the right to conduct a series of additional tests," deemed vital to the modernization of the deterrent force. The French even go so far as to suspect the Japanese of not being very enthusiastic about ratifying an NPT which would prevent them from equipping themselves with nuclear weapons if necessary. It may be here that the French desire for "dialogue" finds its most convincing justification. In the long term, one diplomat explained in fact, if Japan becomes a big power "like the others," it is preferable to "bind the giant in every possible way by urging it to participate in a responsible way in the international community," to "channel the desire for power in the right direction," as Juppe puts it. The latter left Tokyo for a visit to India (2 through 5 April) then China (where he will join Edouard Balladur on 6 April) at a time when the cherry trees were producing their first blossoms. Is this a promise of a new Franco-Japanese spring? Mr. Hosokawa should be in Paris in early May, followed by Emperor Akihito in the fall. But the Franco-Japanese hopes and good intentions have hitherto been forgotten as regularly as the blossoms falling from the cherry trees....
