"Undoubtedly, this is of no special interest to Estonia - I think that during next decades we are not planning to supply us with such weapons," Estonia's Environment Minister Andres Tarand said on commenting the new law. The law, however, enables Russia or some other foreign country sell missiles or other weapons to other countries through Estonian ports, Tarand said. The law initiated by Estonian government regulates export and transit of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, Tarand said while adding he did not approve transit of such environmentally hazardous materials. Such activities, however, provided international rules are observed might bring Estonia economic benefits.
