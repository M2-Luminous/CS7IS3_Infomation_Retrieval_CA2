Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic answers questions from OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. It is easy for journalists to speak with the 43-year-old prime minister. The conversation proceeds as though with an old colleague. Because immediately after graduating from the legal faculty at Zagreb University, the future head of state worked for two years on the radio and for three years after that he was editor in chief of the journal PRAVNIK (lawyer). At the very beginning of our discussion, Nikica Valentic especially emphasized that from 1990 through the spring of 1993 he headed up the largest oil company in Croatia, INA, which has almost 30 years of experience in successful partnership with Russia. I was interested in the possibility of obtaining firsthand information about the economic situation in the country. If we recall the recent past, Croatia accounted for about $2 billion in Soviet-Yugoslav commercial exchange. [Dunayev] What were the economic results with which Croatia celebrated its anniversary? After all, it acquired independence even before Russia did--30 May marks the fourth birthday of the young European state... [Valentic] Like all former socialist countries, we inherited an economic mechanism from the past. But, in spite of the consequences of war and destruction (about half a million refugees are in the country, living on state welfare) and the fact that one-quarter of the internationally recognized territories of Croatia are occupied, we are conducting radical economic reforms, although we have not received a single dollar of outside aid. We are also consistently implementing privatization of enterprises and banks. About one-quarter of them already have been privatized. Croatia has one of the lowest inflation rates as compared to other former socialist countries, which became possible as a result of rather tough macroeconomic monetary policy. While just recently the inflation rate approached 3,000-4,000 percent, it now has declined to the European "standard" of 10 percent. We have stopped printing money and realistically appraise labor remuneration and enterprises profitability. Over the past two years, foreign currency reserves have reached $2 billion. At the same time, our foreign debt is no more than $2 billion. The average wage rose to 400 marks [currency as published] a month, and, by the end of the year, will increase by another 100 marks [currency as published], which will place our country among the leaders of the former socialist bloc states. Croatian experience has attracted world attention, since it is a unique example of a successful economic reform in extremely unfavorable circumstances. [Dunayev] What are the prospects of economic reform in Croatia? [Valentic] This depends to a large extent on the success of privatization, as well as structural changes in key industrial sectors: shipbuilding, food processing industry, and metalworking. Croatia possesses exceptional economic resources. First and foremost, it has about 4,000 kilometers of Adriatic shoreline, famous throughout the world for its clean water and appeal to tourists. Croatian agriculture can produce European quality foodstuffs in quantities twice as great as the domestic need. Two-thirds of the gas and oil used in the country is produced in Croatia. Therefore, we can maintain that, under "nonwar" circumstances, Croatia could be an unquestionable economic reform leader among the former socialist countries. Income from tourism alone can bring up to $5 billion annually. Croatia's geographic position is extremely favorable--it sits at the crossroads between the West and the East; at the same time, about 3 million Croatians, whose experience is invaluable for the country, live in the West. You have already noticed that we do not have any problems with foreign currency, which can be purchased and sold freely. Croatia is a European country that is small but open to international cooperation. Our goal is to join European structures, without any borders or customs. And I have no doubt that in the final count economic progress in Croatia will succeed. [Dunayev] What is your opinion of the state of Russo-Croatian economic relations? [Valentic] I see it as exceptionally fruitful. I am also certain that the process of change both in Croatia and in Russia will bring the business circles of our countries closer together in a variety of spheres. Both our friendly relations and good political contacts, which we value very much, work in favor of it. I would like to particularly emphasize the opportunities for tourism in Croatia, since lately we have noticed an increase in the number of visitors from such countries as Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. They are confident of the comfort and complete safety of their vacationing in Croatia. We hope very much to see Russian tourists as well in our Adriatic region; they are welcome and are well-known here. ...The prime minister presented us with a gift--a photo album with colorful photos of the Adriatic shore and islands. And confessed that hardly anyone can tell these days how many there are of these islands. Even the official figure quoted by tourist reference books seems fantastic--1,185. To see for yourself that all this is true, we invite you to watch a special report devoted to tourist attractions of Croatia, which will be shown on Russian television in the program "Business in Russia" on 30 May. Precisely on the day of the national holiday--Croatia's Independence Day...
