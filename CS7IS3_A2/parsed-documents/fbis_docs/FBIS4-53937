The consulate general in Ho Chi Minh has been demanding quick return of the property and the city has recently notified that it will hand over the building within the first half of the year, the official said. The government reportedly plans to use the site as cultural center and school for Koreans in Vietnam. An estimated 800 Koreans, including diplamats and expatriates, live here and education problem for their children may be resolved to some extent if the center is turned into a school, the official said. The 162-pyong [one pyong is six square feet] two-storey building had been used as a school and Taekwondo gym until 1975 when Korean troops withdrew from Saigon after if fell to communism and broke diplomatic ties. Seoul and Hanoi restored full relations in December 1992. Koreans here have to send their children to expensive international schools in Malaysia, Taiwan or Singapore because there are no Korean schools in Vietnam.
