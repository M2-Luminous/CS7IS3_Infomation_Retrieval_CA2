I assure you that there is no call for concern. Abu-'Ammar is in good health. He is only somewhat exhausted and has the flu; that is all there is to it. He will resume activity tonight. He is just a little tired. It is a very mild case of influenza. Brother Nidal, you have noticed that for two weeks -- after the issue of his statement about jihad in Johannesburg -- there has been a series of rumors about Abu-'Ammar, his family, and about his illness. Now there is another rumor that he has been, or will be, taken to the hospital in Amman. [Qabalan] Then the illness you say the Palestinian president has overcome will not affect his commitments, engagements, and his forthcoming visit to Jericho in the near future? [Mrs. 'Arafat] Reassure our people inside that Abu-'Ammar will be on time. He is in good health. There is absolutely no call for concern. [Qabalan] Mrs. 'Arafat, thank you.
