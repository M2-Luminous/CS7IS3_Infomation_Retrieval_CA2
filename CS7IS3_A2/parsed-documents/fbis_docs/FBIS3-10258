The party said so in a news conference today. Rothschild [Francois] filed a report: [Francois] Good Morning. CONACOM is on the same wavelength as the Haitian deputies. Victor Benoit's party has just brought its unconditional support to a plan for settlement of the crisis, voted as a resolution on March 2 by the deputies. In a meeting with the press today, CONACOM asserted that it welcomes the legislators' initiative. CONACOM, which participated in the discussions in Washington that resulted in the elaboration of this plan, believes this document represents a compromise between the two antagonistic sectors, President Aristide and General Cedras. CONACOM also believes that the legislators' resolution takes into account the demands of both sectors in the Haitian crisis. According to Victor Benoit's party, this resolution represents a step in the right direction, toward the Governors Island accord. [Begin Benoit recording, in Creole] CONACOM strongly supports the legislators' proposal and the resolution of the Chamber of Deputies for the following reasons: A. It is a good proposal, in compliance with the country's Constitution, the Governors Island accord, the New York pact, and the Miami conference. B. It is a good proposal, written in a spirit of compromise. It respects President Aristide's demands -- his return to power in Haiti and Gen. [Cedras'] anticipated retirement. This proposal also respects the general's demands: amnesty for the Army and for many people within society. It respects the demands of the entire political sector: the formation of a government of national concord, sociopolitical appeasement following national reconciliation. This proposal also respects what all the classes in the country are demanding: the lifting of the embargo so the people can operate under good conditions. [end recording] [Francois] Questioned on President Aristide's position -- who has already rejected this plan presented by the legislators -- the CONACOM leaders indicate that they do not seek confrontation with the president-in-exile. According to Micha Gaillard, one of the members of CONACOM leadership, the party intends to continue talking with President Aristide on that question. Regarding the post of prime minister, the CONACOM secretary general denied that the trip to Washington was to negotiate such a position. In any case, Victor Benoit points out that if President Aristide asks him to govern the next government, he will be ready to accept such a proposal.
