Regarding efforts to practice thrift and oppose waste, the prime minister said this is a major issue that will have a direct impact on production, business, and the daily life of units and laborers. According to the prime minister, the task must be carried out from the top down to the lowest levels. Efforts must be made to showcase good examples from among the cadres and party members, while measures must be taken to improve the organization of agencies and motivate the people to abide by the law. The prime minister urged sectors and agencies to strive to promote thrift and oppose waste in production and business at each organization and enterprise, and to make this a widespread and far-reaching movement among the people during the new stage. He said: Efforts must be made to save capital in order to achieve industrialization and modernization. This is part of the cause of building a prosperous people, a strong nation, and an advanced society. He contended that it is time for all localities to practice thrift. The mass media should commend good deeds and denounce waste and lavish spending. He said that the mass media plays an important role in this regard, and that the results of these tasks should be reviewed periodically to draw on experience and formulate measures to carry out work more effectively. Efforts should be made to renovate work styles and design additional concrete measures, while opposing feasts being organized to celebrate anniversaries or welcome high-ranking officials when they visit the provinces and municipalities. He stressed that this will save the people's time, energy, and money.
