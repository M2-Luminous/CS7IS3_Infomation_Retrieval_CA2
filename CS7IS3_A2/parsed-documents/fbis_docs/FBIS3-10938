After Pablo Escobar's death, a struggle took place within the Medellin Cartel for its control. As a result, Roberto Escobar was attacked. It is believed a group under the leadership of Fidel Castano, alias Rambo, was behind this attack. Gustavo Tapia, alias Techo; Luis Carlos Molina Jepes; Miguel Angel Builen; and (?Mickey Ramirez) comprise the group. The members of the splinter group hit by Pablo Escobar are demanding the return of their properties that were seized and $20 million. To meet these demands, Pablo Escobar's widow Maria Victoria Henao; her brother Fernando Henao, alias Hierbas; and those incarcerated in the Bogota jails, Carlos Mario Urquijo, Fernando Pozada Fierro, Luis Carlos Aguilar, and Gustavo Gutierrez Arrula have reached an agreement through attorneys to return all the properties. This group, under the leadership of Rafael Galeano and Mireya Moncada, are supported by the Cali cartel and Fidel Castano. In addition, they demand that all the properties of all the cartel members who are incarcerated be returned as compensation for the deaths of their relatives. This agreement has been accepted by some of the incarcerated individuals and by Pablo Escobar's widow. Roberto Escobar, as successor to the Medellin Cartel chief, however, does not accept this agreement. Therefore, he wants the inmates to be transferred from Santa Fe de Bogota to Medellin to reorganize and reactive the militias and the gangs that have always operated with Medellin Cartel funds.
