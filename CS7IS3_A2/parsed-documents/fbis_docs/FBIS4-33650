More than 500 cases of assassination, kidnapping, and the disappearance of nearly 1,000 individuals who opposed Pinochet -- whose regime extended from 1973 to 1990 -- were filed in court during the four years of Patricio Aylwin's administration, who was succeeded by Eduardo Frei. "We support the principle that those found responsible by the courts should be punished," Secretary General of Government Victor Manuel Rebolledo said. "A new amnesty law has not been contemplated," Rebolledo added, referring to the amnesty law promulgated by Pinochet in April 1978 freeing many of his agents from facing trials for crimes committed before that date. One of those crimes was the assassination of former Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier, who was killed by a bomb that exploded under his car in downtown Washington on 21 September 1976. On 3 June, the Supreme Court refused to apply the amnesty law to absolve two of the main culprits in that crime, former intelligence chief General Manuel Contreras and Brigadier Pedro Espinoza, who were sentenced by a lower court to seven years in prison.
