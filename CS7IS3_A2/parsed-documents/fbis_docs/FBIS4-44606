The lasing wavelength is 860 nm at room temperature and a peak power of more than 20 mW has been achieved in single-mode pulse operation. The device operates in single longitudinal mode (SLM) between 0�C and 80�C. As a preliminary result, the threshold current for a 5-6-�m-wide oxide device is approximately 700 mA. 1. Introduction The DFB semiconductor laser is one of the critical devices used in large-scale, long-range fiber optic communications. As electro-optic devices are being developed, the DFB laser also plays an important role in optical information processing and optical measurement. There are two DFB laser feedback mechanisms, i.e., index-of-refraction-coupled and gain-coupled.[.sup]1[/] The use of a structure to separately block carriers and optical waveguide makes the index-coupled DFB laser a practical device; it becomes the mainstream of DFB semiconductor lasers. Nevertheless, there is a stop band in an index-coupled DFB device and there are two lowest modes of the same gain threshold on either side of the stop band.[.sup]1[/] Therefore, an index-coupled DFB device, in principle, does not operate in a single mode. This issue becomes more critical in dynamic operating conditions. Using a _l_/4 phase shifter,[.sup]2[/] a strip width modulator,[.sup]3[/] or a high-reflection/no-reflection coating[.sup]4[/] can overcome mode degeneracy and improve single-mode yield. However, single-mode stability can easily be affected by spatial hole burning[.sup]5[/] and end reflection.[.sup]6[/] Contrary to the problem we discussed above, the lowest gain threshold mode of a gain-coupled DFB laser is at the Bragg wavelength. Hence, it is truly operating in a single mode. Even a compound DFB laser that is both index-coupled and gain-coupled can also totally eliminate mode degeneracy and operate in a single mode.[.sup]7[/] On the basis of understanding of its superiority, research on gain-coupled DFB laser devices is very active worldwide. To date, there are two ways to incorporate the gain-coupling mechanism into a DFB laser. One is to fabricate a gain grating. For instance, a grating can be grown on an active layer using an OMVPE [organo-metallic vapor-phase epitaxy] technique on a non-planar surface.[.sup]8,9[/] The other way is to incorporate a loss grating near the active layer to periodically modulate the net gain of the laser.[.sup]10[/] Compared to index-coupled DFB lasers, gain-coupled DFB lasers of both types have a number of advantages, including higher single-mode yield,[.sup]11,12[/] extremely low chirping at high dynamic modulation,[.sup]13,14[/] capability to generate single-mode ultra-short pulses[.sup]13[/] and low noise induced by external reflection.[.sup]15[/] The gain-coupled DFB laser has proven its role in optical communications. A gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive loss grating is attracting more attention because there are no special requirements in its fabrication. Devices have been fabricated worldwide using techniques such as OMVPE, LPE [liquid-phase epitaxy] and CBE [chemical beam epitaxy] with materials such as GaAlAs, InGaAlAs and InGaAsP.[.sup]10,14,16,17,18[/] In this work, for the first time a GaAlAs/GaAs gain-coupled MQW DFB laser with an absorptive grating has been successfully prepared using MBE. In addition, for the first time in China, a gain-coupled DFB laser has successfully lased at room temperature. 2. Device Structure and Fabrication Technique Figure 1 shows a cross-sectional view of the laser. The active layer employs an MQW structure to further optimize the performance of the device. An absorptive loss grating is incorporated on top of the active layer to periodically modulate the longitudinal optical field of the laser. This is equivalent to a periodic modulation of the net gain of the optical field mode along the longitudinal axis in order to incorporate the gain-coupling mechanism into the laser. In the structure shown, the change of conduction mode of the absorptive loss grating to n type as compared to its surrounding p type can further lower the threshold and improve the nonlinearity effect caused by absorption saturation.[.sup]18[/] The gain-coupling coefficient, a parameter that reflects the strength of optical feedback as a result of periodically changing gain, is a direct function of factors such as the absorption coefficient of the grating material and grating thickness. To this end, we calculated the relation between the absorptive layer thickness and gain-coupling coefficient.[.sup]19[/] After taking actual fabrication into consideration, we only calculated a three-stage grating and the result is shown in Figure 2. When the absorptive layer is more than 50 nm thick, the normalized gain-coupling coefficient is greater than 0.8, which is sufficiently large to improve device performance. On the other hand, increasing the absorptive layer thickness will also raise the dc component of the periodic loss, i.e., the average mode loss, which causes an increase in the threshold current of the device. Therefore, the thickness of the grating has been fixed at 50-80 nm. A carrier blocking layer is introduced between upper guiding and absorptive grating to effectively confine injected carriers in the active layer. A high-refractance epitaxial layer, i.e., a low-Al-composition layer, is added underneath the absorptive grating layer. On one hand, it acts as a waveguide to enhance the effect of the grating to raise the coupling coefficient. On the other hand, it can avoid possible oxidation and contamination of the high-Al-composition grating due to exposure to air during fabrication. Figure 1.

Gain-Coupling Coefficient vs. Absorptive Layer Thickness When Bulk Absorption Coefficient Is 5,000 cm[.sup]-1[/]</graphic> In the first MBE process the following layers are grown on top of a Si-doped (1-2 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) GaAs substrate: n-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As lower cladding layer (1.5 �m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]), Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As lower guiding layer (0.25 �m, undoped), Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As/GaAs triple-quantum-well active layer (well width 10 nm, barrier width 12 nm, undoped), Ga[.sub]0.79[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As upper guiding layer (0.25 �m, undoped), p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As carrier blocking layer (0.15 �m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]), p-Ga[.sub]0.76[/]Al[.sub]0.21[/]As guiding layer (0.05 �m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]), and n[.sup]+[/]-GaAs absorptive layer (0.05 �m, 1 x 10[.sup]18[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]). Because it is impossible to fabricate primary GaAlAs/GaAs gratings using conventional techniques and the process to make secondary gratings is hard to control, we chose to fabricate a tertiary grating that is capable of having a sufficiently high coupling coefficient under a given set of conditions.[.sup]18[/] A holographic exposure system based on a 325-nm ultraviolet laser was employed to make a tertiary grating with a periodicity of 378 nm. Afterward, it was chemically etched in H[.sub]2[/]SO[.sub]4[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]2[/]:H[.sub]2[/]O = 9:1:1 at 5�C for 4 seconds to obtain a triangular absorptive loss grating. In the second MBE process, a p-Ga[.sub]0.56[/]Al[.sub]0.44[/]As upper cladding layer (1 �m, 5 x 10[.sup]17[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) and a p[.sup]+[/]-GaAs ohmic contact (0.5 �m, 1 x 10[.sup]19[/] cm[.sup]-3[/]) were grown on top of the grating. Making a DFB laser using an MBE technique has not been reported in China and is extremely rare elsewhere in the world. The difficulty involved is the secondary epitaxy process on the grating due to the fact that crystal quality and surface morphology of the boundary are adversely affected by oxidation and contamination. We also encountered a great deal of difficulty in this work. A unique secondary epitaxy technique[.sup]20[/] based on the characteristics of MBE was developed to overcome this problem. To simplify the technique, the device has a basic oxide film strip structure. A 200-nm-thick SiO[.sub]2[/] film was deposited by RF sputtering. A 5-6-�m-wide strip was obtained by etching in a buffered HF solution. A p-type Au-Cr contact and an n-type Au-Ge-Ni contact were made by evaporation. 3. Device Performance Lasing was successfully achieved at room temperature. Figure 3 shows the output light intensity as a function of injected current for a 300-�m cavity device operating with 500 ns and 1 kHz pulses. The threshold of the device is 700 mA at 20�C. The primary reason for this high threshold current is that the device does not have any lateral blocking. In addition, the quality of the primary epitaxy process needs to be improved. Figure 4 shows the lasing spectra of the same device at different injection currents. When the injection current is approximately 0.9 times the threshold (see Figure 4(a)), besides the Fabry-Perot mode at the gain peak, the DFB mode 7 nm away is significantly enhanced. This is a piece of evidence that this mode has a larger threshold gain difference compared to other surrounding modes. When the injection current approaches the threshold, the DFB mode begins to lase (see Figure 4(b)) at approximately 860 nm. As the current is further increased (see Figure 4(c)), it operates completely in a single mode. It is worthwhile to point out that it is difficult to see a stop band in a gain-coupled DFB laser. Our device is no exception. Figure 3. Peak Output Power vs. Injected Current Figure 4. Lasing Spectra at Different Injection Currents In addition, the peak single-mode optical output is over 20 mW. Higher power spectra were not measured because of the danger that the photomultiplier tube might be damaged. However, from Figure 3, the peak pulse output should be no less than 50 mW. Besides the large optical cavity effect due to the relatively thick guiding layer in the device, it also illustrates the advantage that a gain-coupled DFB laser is not affected by space burning at high power levels. Figure 5 shows the lasing wavelength as a function of temperature. Due to equipment limitation, it was only measured between 0�C and 80�C. No mode hopping took place within this temperature range. The temperature coefficient of the wavelength is approximately 0.07 nm/�C. This is another piece of evidence that our device is operating in the DFB mode. Figure 6 shows the lasing spectra at different temperatures. It is obvious that it continues to operate in a complete single mode up to 80�C. Figure 5. Lasing Wavelength vs. Temperature Figure 6. Lasing Spectra at Different Temperatures 4. Conclusions A GaAlAs/GaAs MQW gain-coupled DFB laser with an absorptive grating has been successfully fabricated using an MBE technique for the first time. At room temperature, the device lases at 860 nm. At 20�C, the current threshold is 700 mA. The device remains lasing in SLM within a range of 0�C to 80�C. The peak power in single-mode single-ended output at room temperature could exceed 20 mW.
