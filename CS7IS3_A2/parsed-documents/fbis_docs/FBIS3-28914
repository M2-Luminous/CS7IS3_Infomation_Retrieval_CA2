Hosokawa made the remark to reporters aboard a special government jetliner which landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 5:50 P.M. Sunday. He said his government will assemble officials of various government agencies either Monday or Tuesday to explore steps to revive the abortive trade talks with the U.S. Hosokawa met Clinton in Washington for three hours Friday and attended a breakfast meeting with the President at the White House on Saturday. Japan-U.S. economic framework talks are designed to help correct the trade imbalance by increasing the access of foreign firms to Japan's markets in the auto and auto parts and insurance sectors and boosting foreign participation in government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment. Asked at his official residence about a report in THE WASHINGTON POST's Sunday issue suggesting potential U.S. trade sanctions against Japan, Hosokawa said, "it's too early" to speculate on U.S. action.
