At this session, we have relayed and studied Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of the third plenary session, summarized Liaoning's previous anticorruption work, exchanged experiences, and studied and arranged the work tasks of the next step of the anticorruption work. Comrade Shangwen has given a report, and the opinions he spoke on had been approved by the standing committee of the provincial party committee after discussions. It is hoped that all localities and departments will conscientiously implement them in line with their actual conditions. I will speak on three issues in the following. 1. We should enhance the understanding of the importance and urgency of the anticorruption work in the new situation. Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission used the Marxist viewpoint and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to expound the importance and urgency of the anticorruption work and the dialectical relationship between reform, development, and stability from the perspective of adherence to the party's basic line and the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. He also emphasized: "Waging the anticorruption struggle, in the final analysis, is meant to consolidate and strengthen the party's ties with the masses in the new situation, to consolidate our party's status as a ruling party, and to enable the party to better hold the heavy historical task to lead reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive. The relationship between the party and the masses is a basic political issue concerning the success and failure of the party's cause. We should emphasize this repeatedly and sound the alarm for a long time, and comrades of the entire party should attach great importance to it." His remarks profoundly told us that the key to whether the anticorruption work can be carried out thoroughly, persistently, and more effectively and yield good results at different stages lies in unifying the thinking of the entire party, especially the thinking of leading cadres. In line with the guidelines of Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the arrangements made at this third plenary session, and the specific conditions of Liaoning, all cadres with party membership, especially leading cadres, should particularly address the following three issues on the understanding of the anticorruption work. A. The previous anticorruption work should be estimated in a realistic manner. To implement well Comrade Jiang Zemin's speech given at the third plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the guidelines of the session and to make this year's anticorruption work successful, we should first correctly estimate the previous anticorruption work. The provincial party committee recently held a standing committee meeting to hear and conscientiously discuss the provincial discipline inspection commission's report. The provincial party committee held that since August last year, party committees, governments, and discipline inspection, supervision, and judicial departments at all levels in the province had conscientiously followed the arrangements of the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee to actively carry out the anticorruption work, with the focus on reform and economic construction; and that thanks to the concerted efforts of all fields, the desired purpose was basically attained, good results were achieved at varying degrees in the three tasks that should be emphasized as required by the party Central Committee, corrupt phenomena in some aspects were checked, and more prominent achievements were won by the localities and departments which had done a better job. Through practice, we have achieved a more profound understanding of the guidelines of the party Central Committee's instructions on opposing corruption and explored and accumulated some good experiences and methods. However, this is only a good beginning, and we must never overestimate it. We should recognize that there are still many disparities and problems in the current anticorruption work. The principal ones were: The work in various localities and departments was not evenly developed, and some localities and departments failed to fully grasp this work although they had conscientiously relayed the guidelines and devised plans in a timely manner. Leading cadres failed to deeply conduct self investigation to see whether they were honest and self-disciplined and to make self corrections, and some situations discovered during self investigation were not in conformity with the actually existing problems; some problems had been touched once but not been realistically solved; and some problems discovered during self investigation had not been corrected. We lacked strength in investigating and handling major and appalling cases, and the progress in this work was not rapid. Some localities and units had the serious problem of practicing protectionism, failed to report a case to the security authorities and to file a case for investigation which they should do, and failed to strictly handle the cases. Some failed to achieve noticeable results in checking unhealthy trends, and the masses of people were not pleased with this. Some leading cadres failed to fully understand anticorruption work and failed to actively carry out this work on their own initiative. Judging from the situation of the whole province, the progress of the previous stage of anticorruption work still lagged far behind the demands of the party Central Committee and the masses of people, and the achievements gained were not consolidated. If we slightly slacken our efforts in this aspect, some problems will possibly "come back." These are the problems which the broad masses of people are mostly worrying about and the party committees and governments at all levels must resolutely check. Therefore, in addition to affirming the previous stage of achievements in a fact-seeking manner, we should also recognize the existing problems, sum up experience, enhance understanding of the protractedness, complexity, and arduousness of anticorruption, firmly cultivate the idea of grasping this work unswervingly, and carry out anticorruption struggle in a deep, sustained, and more effective manner. B. We should correctly understand and handle the relationship between, reform, development, stability and anticorruption. This is a crucial year for comprehensively implementing the decision of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central committee, an important year for China to enter the stage of carrying out comprehensive supporting package reform of the national economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and a year facing many heavy tasks and severe tests in anticorruption. Therefore, party committees and governments at all levels should proceed from the overall situation of the whole party's work, correctly understand and properly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability and anticorruption, and in addition to exerting efforts to deepen reform, expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability, act in line with the unified plans of the central authorities, and conscientiously attend to anticorruption work. Only by persisting in reform and development can we realize a long-term social stability. And if we carry out reform and development, we must have a stable social environment. Social instability will make us unable to smoothly conduct reform and development and to successfully carry out all other undertakings. Reform, development, and stability constitute the overall situation of the whole party's work, and anticorruption is an important guarantee for reform, development, and stability. We should carry out anticorruption work in close connection with the overall situation of the whole party's work, consciously submit ourselves to and serve this overall situation. Judging from the problems exposed in our province's anticorruption struggle, corrupt phenomena have infiltrated into all social sectors, and particularly, they have seriously corroded our party and government organs as well as the ranks of cadres. Last year, the discipline inspection and supervision organs across the province filed and handled 7,444 cases on law and discipline violations and punished 5,527 party-member cadres. Of these cases, 3,504 were filed for investigation and handling during four months from September to December, and 40 percent of which were cases on law and discipline violations in the economic sector, and 175 cases involved cadres at and above the county (section) level. Procuratorial organs across the province filed 2,299 economic criminal cases for investigation last year, 1,452 cases of which each involved more than 10,000 yuan, and 193 cases each involved more than 100,000 yuan, and these cases involved 77 cadres at and above the county (section) level. The large number of criminals who abused power to practice graft and pervert justice for bribes, the large sum of money involved, and the mean tricks adopted were shocking and directly undermined reform, opening up, and economic construction. Some unhealthy trends characterized by abuse of power for selfish gains and extortion of money, especially those in some departments and trades, seriously infringed on the interests of the masses and aroused strong dissatisfaction among them. Therefore, we should be determined to eliminate the corrupt phenomena, punish corrupt elements, and correct the unhealthy trends. Otherwise, we will dampen the masses' enthusiasm and lose their support, and stability, reform, and development will be affected. This year marks the largest number of reform measures to be implemented, and the quality, range, and dynamics of reform will also be unprecedented. The process to deepen reform will also be the process to adjust the relationship between the state, the local authorities, enterprises, and laborers in terms of power, responsibility, and profits. It will unavoidably involve the interests of many fields and may create social fluctuation at varying degrees. Because the extension of reform has been expanded but the formulation of the standards of activities falls behind, law and discipline breaches committed by taking advantage of the loopholes in laws, regulations, policies, and systems may increase. The depth of reform and the wide range of the adjustment of interests have instilled vigor to social life and provided favorable conditions for enterprises to compete on an equal footing. However, they will also create new contradictions and some sensitive, complicated, and destabilizing factors. Under such circumstances, it remains a serious task and test we should not dodge to not only add impetus to reform and promote development and stability but also keep the momentum of the anticorruption work going and make the work more effective. Some state-owned enterprises in Liaoning are suffering serious deficits and have failed to pay wages to their workers for a long time. The retired personnel in some localities also experience many difficulties in their life. In rural areas, some people still do not have sufficient food and clothes. Problems in public security are also very conspicuous. All these problems merit our great attention. Party committees and governments at all levels, especially principal leading cadres, must learn to take the overall situation into account; proceed from the general task of safeguarding reform, development, and stability to achieve success in opposing corruption and advocating honesty; comprehensively and correctly analyze the situation from the perspective of strengthening the party's flesh-and-blood relations with the masses, consolidating the political power, and maintaining the lasting order and stability of the state; and properly address the conspicuous contradictions cropping up in the process of advancement. Leaders should go to the places where problems are conspicuous to resolve the contradictions in a timely manner, safeguard social stability, and create a good environment for reform and development. C. The principle of attaching equal importance to two tasks should be adhered to. Attaching equal importance to the two civilizations is Comrade Xiaoping's consistent idea and an important component of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. As early as the initial period of reform and opening up, Comrade Xiaoping raised the issue of attaching equal importance to two tasks, one being reform and opening up, and the other being crackdown on economic crimes. Later, Comrade Xiaoping again repeatedly emphasized, from different angles, the need to attach equal importance to the two tasks and called for "competence in both." He also emphasized that "we should oppose corruption in the entire process of reform and opening up." As has been proven in practice, his theses are totally correct. The leading collective of the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its nucleus has unswervingly implemented the principle of "taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough," successfully made several important decisions, adopted a series of major measures, and pushed forward the work of opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty. In his speech at the recent third plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out again that in waging the struggle against corruption, the party committees and governments at various levels should firmly grasp the center of the economic construction, persist in the principle of taking a two-hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough, and make overall plans and take all factors into consideration. So, at the time of grasping the economic construction, we are required to attend to the work of opposing corruption. At present, some of our comrades do not accurately understand the importance of anticorruption. Some of them maintain that the corrupt phenomena are brought about by reform and opening up and these phenomena are unavoidable. Some maintain that so long as the economy is developed will the corrupt phenomena naturally be eliminated. These ideas are wrong. The purpose of reform is to liberate and develop productive forces and to promote the economy. Some corrupt phenomena actually emerge due to the facts that the legal system is not perfect in the course of replacing the old systems by the new and that some people are affected by the capitalist corrosive ideas in the course of conducting reform and opening to the outside world. By no means are the corrupt phenomena brought about by reform and opening up. But, these phenomena are caused by the failure to thoroughly or deeply conduct reform. On the one hand, we should unswervingly wage the struggle against these phenomena, end their development trends, and reduce them in a step-by-step manner; on the other hand, we should deepen reform and perfect the legal system to fundamentally wipe out the soils and conditions which create corrupt phenomena. Each and every party member and each and every cadre should clearly understand that developing the market economy does not mean giving up socialism, advocating the coexistence of various sectors of the economy does not mean giving up the public ownership, and we must persistently attend to both spiritual and material civilizations to promote the development of the socialist market economy. On no account do the corrupt phenomena naturally disappear when the economy is developed. When the corrupt phenomena spread unchecked, it will be difficult to promote the economic construction. The economic construction, even though promoted, is temporarily promoted and will finally fall. Many facts prove that negative and corrupt phenomena are major reasons for affecting reform, opening up, and economic construction. The more profoundly the reform is carried out and the better developed the economy is, the more we should resolutely oppose corruption. The tasks for reform and development in 1994 are very heavy. The party and government organs and the leading cadres at various levels should concentrate more energy on grasping the implementation of major reform measures. That is, we should continue to enliven state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, take the increase in economic results as a key link, deepen reform, accelerate the pace of transformation, speed up the pace of readjustment, intensify management, and lay a good foundation for setting up a modern enterprise system. Simultaneously, we should continue to intensify agriculture's role as the foundation of the national economy and further rejuvenate the rural economy. Simultaneously, we should vigorously cultivate new economic growth points. Under such circumstances, we should further persist in the principle of "grasping with two hands" and "play the piano well." We must never slacken the anticorruption work just because the tasks for reform and development are heavy. Due to the fact that our province was deeply affected by the highly centralized planned economy, our ideology, management systems, and rules and regulations have many things that are not suitable to the requirements for setting up the socialist market economic system. We must exert great efforts to solve these problems. On the one hand, we should pay attention to guiding the broad masses of party members, cadres and people to further emancipate the mind, renew their ideas, bravely make explorations, boldly engage in practice, suggest ways and means for reform and development, and make contributions to reform and development; on the other hand, we should pay attention to grasping the ideological trends and well grasp the mass media orientation. We must be sober-headed, tell truth from falsehood, and have a clear-cut stand to know what we should support, advocate, restrict, and oppose within a period of time. As for some wrong thinkings and acts, we should not leave them unchecked as well as should clear them up and give guidance to them. We should criticize and educate wrongdoers who deserve to accept them. We should boldly protect and support the new things cropping up in reforms. Great attention should be paid to protecting and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres in plunging into reform and construction. We should vigorously publicize and commend those who have performed their official duties honestly; done the administrative work industriously for the people; engaged in their work industriously; boldly pioneered roads; and made prominent contributions to reform, opening up, and economic construction. By coping with the evil trend cropping up in the administration honesty in every period, we should remind cadres of the trend in a timely manner and give an early warning to them so as to arouse them to pay attention to it and to avoid the mistake. As for cadres who have attempted to do their best in work wholeheartedly and committed faults because of their poor experience, we should help them summarize their experience and lessons and support them to better do their work in the future. We should correctly handle the contradictions among the people and turn the negative factors into active ones. We should chiefly give criticism and education to cadres who have committed malpractice. It will be all right for these cadres as long as they have actively examined and corrected their mistakes. We should impose necessary party-discipline sanction on cadres who have refused to accept the education and to correct their mistakes. We should strictly handle those in line with the law and party discipline, who have violated the criminal law and party discipline. 2. We should successfully grasp the implementation of anticorruption work in various fields this year by closely following the whole situation in the work undertaken by the entire party. The third plenum of the Central Discipline Inspection Commssion has made overall arrangements for the anticorruption work this year. In line with the demand of the central authorities, by bearing the province's reality in minds, and by closely following the whole situation in the work undertaken by the entire party, we must further enhance our measures and reinforce the dynamics in work. A good job should be done in grasping the implementation of anticorruption work in various fields this year. Efforts should be made to concentrate efforts on dealing with the deep-rooted problems; to strive to score greater achievements; and to ensure the deepening of reform, economic development, and social stability in the province. Comrade Shangwen has made specific arrangements in his report for implementing the three tasks of anticorruption struggle. I, hereby, would like to stress again the following several issues: A. We should seize the emphasis of encouraging leading cadres to perform official duties honestly and to be self-disciplined. The focal point of self examination and correction in the campaign of administration honesty and self discipline this year is still aimed at the leading cadres at the county (section) level. By bearing in their minds the reality in their own localities and units and according to the five provisions set by the central authorities and the five provisions issued in the year, party and government organs at all levels throughout the province should further do a good job in self examination and correction in the anticorruption work. Leading cadres at all levels and particularly principal leading comrades should play a leading role in the work. Leading bodies at province and city levels should strive to score better achievements in this regard so as to set an example for their subordinate units. In conducting self examination and correction, we should concentrate our efforts on grasping implementation and scoring practical results. As for the problems that have been exposed in the course of self examination and correction in line with the five provisions issued in 1993 but which have not been corrected, we should enhance the supervision and inspection and correct or handle them in line with the provisions concerned. We should organize forces to investigate the problems committed by some cadres who have not conducted self examination and correction and about which the mass has lodged strong complaints. They should be strictly handled as long as they have been proved as true. As for the problems whose mistakes have been clarified in line with the limits of policies set the five provisions issued in the year, we should correct them by intensively conducting self examination. As for the problems that have involved in a wider range in the society and whose contents are more complicated, we should do a good job in carrying out investigation and study in advance and have the provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory department to organize the departments concerned to formulate the limits of policies, to successfully conduct the pilot work, and to handle them in an overall way after gaining the experience from the pilot work. We should integrate the self examination and correction with the reports and opinions of the masses to bring into play the supervisory role of the masses. Party organizations at all levels and particularly discipline inspection commissions and organizational departments at all levels should be practically responsible for the work, enhance the supervision over party-member cadres and particularly leading cadres, and regard the results of administration honesty and self examination as an important content in appraising and employing cadres. B. We should reinforce the dynamics in dealing with serious and appalling cases. Emphasis in handling cases this year is still directed at party and government leading organs and the departments of judiciary, administration, law enforcement, and economic management and should be placed on handling cases that are disturbing and damaging reforms, development, and stability, as well seriously violating the law and discipline. In line with the exposed clues of cases, various localities should earnestly analyze and study them and formulate explicit and specific plans for handling the cases that should be dealt with immediately. They should concentrate their efforts on dealing with the important and typical cases and the serious and appalling cases that have a guiding significance on the whole situation. We should affix responsibility on those who have blocked or disturbed the handling of cases, hidden the cases, put off the investigation of cases, and not handled the cases after finishing the investigation. When encountering difficulties and problems that have caused the suspension of carrying out investigation or handling of cases, the principal leading comrades of party and government organs should take up the difficulties and problems personally and adopt resolute measures to do away with the interference and obstruction and to vigorously make a breakthrough in dealing with them. The organs of discipline inspection, supervision, and judiciary should uphold the principles and boldly deal with the knotty problems. Under the situation in which reform is being continuously deepened, we should not only investigate and handle the acts that have not been stopped, though prohibition has been issued, but also handle the acts of not observing the order. We should strictly enforce the discipline among those who "have provided counter-measures for coping with the policies issued by their higher authorities" and damaged the whole interest in order to obtain the immediate and partial interest and the interest of small communities to ensure the smooth enforcement of administrative orders and the implementation of various reform measures. C. We should continuously correct the malpractice. All-out efforts should be continuously made this year to score obvious results in dealing with the two problems of collecting fees arbitrarily and spending public funds on outside and overseas tours. We should resolutely implement the announcement on the collection suspension of some fees. By no means should we break our promise to the people by announcing the collection suspension on the one hand and continuously collecting fees arbitrarily on the other hand. As for the administrative fees and the income accumulated from fines and confiscations, we should enforce the managerial regulation of "double-track system between income and spending" in this regard. Departments concerned should rapidly make contact with their higher organs so as to formulate as soon as possible specific methods for implementing the regulation. Efforts should be made to earnestly implement the regulation on encouraging the economic entities run by the party and government organs to get rid of their relations with these organs. A good job should be done in clearing up and returning the unpaid occupation of property by the party and government organs to enterprises. Efforts should be made to intensively clear up and correct the arbitrary apportioning and the problems of asking assistance from enterprises on various pretexts. In correcting their malpractice, various industries and trades should define one or two targets while handling the existing prominent problems so as to conduct specialized consolidation over the targets. Various localities should also select several departments, industries, and trades to be the key units of taking up the work of correcting malpractice. Those who did a better job in correcting the malpractice and scored certain achievements in this regard last year should concentrate their efforts this year on consolidating and upgrading their achievements, as well as on deepening their consolidation to score more obvious results. D. We should further perfect the supervisory mechanism and take radical and stopgap measures simultaneously. Developing the socialist market economy requires the guarantee of law. Only by perfecting the legal system and establishing the effective restriction mechanism of supervision can we prevent and eliminate corrupt phenomena systematically and ensure the healthy development of the socialist market economy. Therefore, in the course of anticorruption we must attach great importance on establishing legal systems, integrating anticorruption with the establishment of legal systems, and taking radical and stopgap measures simultaneously. We should not only establish a complete set of regulations and rules for the market economy, but also a series of laws and regulations for anticorruption so as to provide legal basis for more effectively punishing the corrupt. In coping with the loopholes cropping up in the course of anticorruption in the fields of management and systems, we should earnestly summarize the experience and lessons; perfect the systems; and enhance the management to resolutely block them. Some regulations and rules that were proved as effective in the past should be continuously enforced and popularized. Meanwhile, attention should be made to exploring the new ways of enhancing the fostering of work style and administrative honesty and of carrying out anticorruption struggles. Now, some of our comrades' sense of legal system is getting blunted. No sooner do we stress the necessity to have the daring to think, do, and pioneer than these people engage themselves in unlawful and undisciplined activities. Therefore, education must be strengthened. We should organize the broad masses of party members and cadres to conscientiously study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping"; should prominently conduct the education on building socialism with Chinese characteristics; should conduct education on the purpose of the party, party discipline, and the legal system; should foster an accurate outlook on life and value; should enhance the sense of party discipline and the sense of the legal system; and should ensure that power should smoothly move in the cycle of policy decisions, implementation, supervision, and feedback. We should strengthen the improvement of party style and administrative honesty among enterprises and institutions and vigorously sum up and popularize the good examples emerging from the construction of the spiritual and material civilizations. Leading cadres of the enterprises and institutions should be honest in performing official duties, be self-disciplined, observe disciplines, and abide by laws. Various kinds of negative and corrosive phenomena, such as abusing power for private gains, engaging in corruption and bribery, and indulging in extravagance and waste, should be opposed. 3. We should realistically strengthen the leadership over the anticorruption work. The current anticorruption tasks are extremely heavy. The previous anticorruption work achievements should be consolidated. The work that has not yet been accomplished need to be continuously done. Some deep-layered problems should urgently be solved. New tasks and requirements in the next-stage anticorruption work have been set forth. That whether or not we can achieve the work in these aspects and make achievements in the anticorruption work is related to the prestige of the party among the masses and to the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. The party committees and governments at various levels should realistically strengthen leadership, carefully organize forces, and achieve this year's anticorruption work in a down-to-earth manner. A. The anticorruption work should be carried out under the unified leadership of the party committees and the governments. The party committees and governments at various levels should put the anticorruption work in the important work agenda. Party and government principal leaders should personally engage in the work. They should not only personally mobilize and arrange the anticorruption work but also attend to the implementation of the work. Party and government principal leaders should engage themselves in the solution of major problems. Anticorruption should be brought into the overall situation of reform, development, and stability. At the time of studying and arranging the work of deepening reform, developing the economy, and safeguarding stability, we should set forth requirements and make arrangements for opposing corruption and strengthening the improvement of administrative honesty and ensure that the anticorruption work and the improvement of administrative honesty should be arranged in a unified manner and develop coordinately. There must be both overall plans and definite targets for the anticorruption work. This work must be carried out in a step-by-step, solid, and steady manner. The party committees and governments at various levels should appropriately convene meetings to hear reports, analyze the situation, study countermeasures, and promote the anticorruption work in a step-by-step and profound manner. B. We should set up and perfect the system of responsibility for opposing corruption. Party and government principal leading comrades should assume overall responsibility for the anticorruption work of their localities, departments, and units. The members of the leading bodies at various levels in charge of the improvement of party style and administrative honesty should directly assume responsibility for the work. Other members of the leading bodies should assume major responsibility for the anticorruption work of the fronts that they belong to. Each level should guide, on a responsibility basis, the anticorruption work of its lower level. The provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory department should assume responsibility for organizing, coordinating with, guiding, and generally analyzing the anticorruption work of the province as a whole. The work committee of the provincial-level organs should take charge of supervising, inspecting, and generally analyzing the anticorruption work of the provincial-level departments. In carrying out the three tasks for opposing corruption, the provincial-level units and all departments concerned should realistically attend to the work that they take charge of and pay particular attention to studying and formulating, as soon as possible, the policies relating to the three tasks so as to create conveniences for opposing corruption. All cities and provincial-level departments should report on the fulfillment of each and every task to the provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory department. Then, the provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial supervisory department should collect the data for the provincial party committee and the provincial government. C. We should strengthen supervision and inspection. The key to whether this year's anticorruption work can be more effective lies in whether the three anticorruption tasks can be truly carried out. Party committees and governments at all levels should hold their respective responsibilities, adopt various measures, and organize people at an opportune time to inspect how these three tasks are carried out. The central authorities will organize investigation groups to inspect provinces, regions, municipalities, and departments directly under the central authorities in June. The provincial party committee will also organize investigation groups to inspect cities and the departments directly under the province. All localities should strengthen this work in line with the requirements of the central authorities and the provincial party committee. Through the inspection, we should find out problems, strengthen guidance, summarize experiences, and adopt effective measures to make the anticorruption work successful. This work should become a system and be carried out on a long-term basis. D. We should further strengthen leadership over discipline inspection and supervision work and give full play to its role. Discipline inspection and supervision departments are the major organs in charge of the anticorruption work, which shoulder still greater responsibility and encounter still heavier tasks in the future anticorruption work. Party committees and governments at all levels should show concern for and support their work from the perspective of building the party and political power, help them eliminate interference and obstacles, and help them address difficulties and problems in their work in a timely manner. Under the leadership of party committees and governments, discipline inspection and supervision departments at all levels should conscientiously perform their functions, fully and successfully play their role in the anticorruption work, and serve as good advisers and assistants to party committees and governments. We should fully develop the role of people's organizations, democratic parties, and personages without party affiliation, organize them to participate in the work related to the anticorruption struggle, and earnestly listen to their opinions and suggestions. Cadres with party membership at all levels, especially leading cadres, should intensify party spirit training, continuously remold their world outlook, foster the purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, maintain close ties with the masses, give heed to their voice, help them resolve misgivings and difficulties, and share weal and woe with them. We should overcome bureaucracy and formalism, go deep into the reality of life to conduct investigation and study, and help the grass-roots levels and the masses solve problems in a down-to-earth manner. We should give wide publicity to the typical examples in honest and industrious administration and advocate the main theme of this era. Comrades, Liaoning's tasks of reform, development, and stability are very heavy this year and its tasks to oppose corruption are also very arduous. Under the correct leadership of the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee, we are convinced that Liaoning will win greater achievements in the anticorruption work, further facilitate reform, opening up, and economic construction, promote social stability, and ensure the smooth progress of its "second pioneering program" as long as we firmly rely on party organizations at all levels and the masses and make sure that the party and cadres are of one mind and act in unison with the masses.
