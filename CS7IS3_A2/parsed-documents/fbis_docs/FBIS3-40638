Thengadi: "Liberalization Under GATT and U.S. Is a Downright Fraud"] [Text] In spite of all the propaganda in favour of `free trade' concept Ruigrok informs us that the pattern of global trade looks as follows: --approximately 25 percent takes place inside global companies--(intra-company trade), --approximately 25 percent is bilateral trade (by preferential agreements), --approximately 25 percent is barter trade, --approximately 25 percent can be considered `free trade' governed by GATT rules. The author has quoted this from FAST (Forecasting and Assessment in Science and Technology). While advocating the principle of free trade, the US has been following the policy of protectionism regarding textiles right from 1956 when the President was given the authority under the Agricultural Act to negotiate agreements for limiting "imports into the United States of Textiles or Textile products." In the 1980s, the US administration employed non-tariff barriers to insulate the US automobile industry from the competitive threat that, as in the case of the textile industry, was posed by Japanese imports. (As James Dunn points out, post-war international trade in automobiles has always been a mixture of liberalising and protecting elements.) Japan is, in many cases, a one-way trader, not importing any of the product categories it exports. The same is the case with the Japanese foreign investment imbalance. As at 31st March, 1990, Japanese direct investments abroad amounted to seventeen times the value of FDI in Japan. Japanese competitiveness and huge trade and investment imbalances have contributed, according to experts, to the EC and US conflicts with Japan in industrial products. `Toyotism' of Japanese industry has given it a great advantage over `Fordism' of the US and EC industries. To cite a single example. In the 60s and 70s, the EC's ship-building industry could not stand a threat from Japanese ship-building companies' aggressive marketing strategies. With the present growth of Japan's foreign direct investments in the EC and the US, the industries of the latter are demanding more trade barriers and greater protection (Though recently Japanese economy also is showing signs of decay). It is interesting to note that criticism of free trade doctrine has been gaining ground as the EC and the US have been meeting with increasingly fierce competition in a number of industries. Many of the earlier champions of the doctine are today its critics. This opportunism is not a new phenomenon. When German goods were dominating British markets, Britain was the worst critic of free trade principle. After industrial revolution, the equation changed and Britain became the best champion of free trade doctrine. The current American concept of "fairness in trade" reminds Biswajit Dhar of Gladstone's remark made more than a century ago under similar situation: "It (fairness in trade) bears suspicious likeness to our old friend protection." The decline in the economic strength of the United States started in the 1960s. The process of the end of its hegemony commenced around 1973. By the 1980s the United States had come to be established as the economic power going rapidly down hill. Several authors like Linder and others have predicted the end of the US hegemony in the international economy during the early period of the next century. With every new set-back, the US has been deviating progressively from the principle of free trade, and by this time it has completely abandoned that once-sacred doctrine. These recent developments and deviations in the US trade strategy have been aptly elaborated by Biswajit Dhar in his The Decline of Free Trade and US Trade Policy Today. At the level of policy, the demise of `non-interventionist' mode can be seen clearly in the case of US where trade administration has adopted an "activist" trade policy, particularly during the last two decades. While the increased doses of protectionism formed the core of the nature of State intervention in the earlier years--seeking increased market--access for US products by compelling its partner countries to change their policies and become "more open." It, i.e., protectionism has now become the sole thrust of the policy--initiative in recent years. Trade legislation in US since 1974 indicates this trend. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, particularly through its two new provisions, namely, Super 301 and Special 301, unfolds fully the intentions of the policy makers. The protectionist measures adopted by the US have abrogated the basic principles of non-intervention in trade, underlying the post-war trading system governed by the GATT rules. Specific and systematic trade barriers have been raised by the US, in violation of the GATT rules. This has grossly undermined the multi-lateral trading system. In response to the competitive threats from Japan and other newly exporting countries, the US curbed imports by using increasing doses of protectionism achieved through imposition of the non-tariff barriers, and increased exports by forcing open foreign markets using the powers of trade retaliation that were assumed by the US President through the Trade Acts of 1974 and 1988. The first phase gave protection to domestic producers against imports. Quota restrictions on exports to the US were imposed. The US trade administration frequently imposed Voluntary Export Restraints (VERs) and Orderly Marketing Arrangements (OMAs) on several countries. The more prominent industries that were provided import-protection were steels, automobiles, textiles, machine tools and semi-conductors. Section 301 of the 1974 Act was directed at the policies of foreign governments which did not provide free access to US products in their markets. In 1985, the insurance industry in Korea was targeted for this purpose, the action under section 301 of the 1974 Act was initiated. Between 1985 and 1988, when the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act was passed, Section 301 was used 26 times. In the 1988 Act, two changes were made in Section 301. Super 301 was introduced to deal with general and systematic trade barriers imposed by different countries, while Special 301 was introduced to deal with cases relating to insufficient protection of intellectual property rights of US origin. Under Super 301, action could be initiated against the entire gamut of trade and trade related policies that the infringing partners were following in retaliation against a sector or an industry-specific infringement. In other words, Super 301 provided for cross retaliation between sectors. Secondly, Super 301 introduced a time-frame for identifiable specific cases of trade distortions, and initiating cases against countries which, according to US, were obstructing US exports. The cases under Super 301 were to be initiated in 1989 and 1990, and the retaliatory action against the "identified" infringing countries were to be carried out within 180 days of establishing that trade distortions were liable for retaliation. Special 301 covers infringement of intellectual property rights of US origin causing distortions in US exports. Special 301 was to ensure that US exports could be increased by compelling countries to provide a stronger monopoly to US commercial interests in their markets through an appropriate system of intellectual property protection that the US trade administration deemed fit. Unlike provisions under section 337, the Special 301 provision did not put the onus on the complainant to "Prove" the injury. The US International Trade Commission was simply required to institute inquiry into the complaint and grant protection, all within 90 days of the registering of the complaint. In May, 1989, the USTR identified three countries: India, Japan and Brazil and put them on the list of priority countries for action under Super 301; and six trade-distorting practices--the `priority practices'--of these countries were identified, India was found to restrict US exports from entering its markets through two "priority practices." (a) Foreign investors in the country were required to export a part of the produce, and to use locally produced inputs, thereby causing trade distortions, and (b) US service industries were prevented from competing in the Indian market. India's market was completely closed to foreign insurance companies. A new list of `priority practices' under Super 301 was issued in April, 1990. The list had two cases and both involved India. The two priority practices of India listed in 1989 were again included in the 1990 list. Japan and Brazil were excluded. Trade barriers to insurance and investment in India were particularly irritating. In 1989 and 1990, four countries--India, China, Thailand and Brazil, were put on the priority watch list. In April 1991, USTR decided to initiate proceedings under the Special 301 clause. India, China and Thailand were named as priority countries for action under Special 301. The US is insisting upon free trade and the so-called `liberalisation'. The US experts have excelled Dr Goebels in the propaganda techniques. "Repeat a lie hundred times, and it becomes the truth," Dr Goebels said. Hitler went a step further. He said that if a lie is to be circulated, you should not give a simple lie, give a big bluff--so big that people will not be able, because of the magnitude of the given lie, to suspect that such a big news may be a lie. Because of the American propaganda the doctrine of economic liberalisation became popular in the last two decades. De-regulation and privatisation have acquired respectability and authenticity. The IMF and the World Bank have been striving to sell `liberatisation' doctrine to the third world countries by imposing on the debtor countries. Policy of economic liberalisation as a condition of further credit. The GATT and the US are preaching the free trade principle as a sacred gospel truth. But the US is itself violating this "sacred" principle. The US is also violating the standards evolved by the International Organisation for Standardisation. The US public procurement policies are not in confirmity with the GATT Government Procurement code. `Buy-American' restrictions cover vast area. There were thirty-one significant cases of special protection which covered four broad sectors--manufacturing, mining, agriculture and fisheries. Some other services also are being given protection. It is subsidising heavily its farm sector, while demanding that other countries should withdraw all subsidies to that sector. It is following double-standards in case of pharmaceutical sector also. These are clearly the unprincipled bullying tactics. The culprits in this crime are the rulers and the big capitalists of the US--not its common masses who are themselves kept in the dark about developments on economic front. These bullying tactics are being employed not only against the southern, developing countries, but also against European community and North American peoples. The recent militant reaction of French farmers and the strong support given to their gesture by farmers of other European countries; the agitation of the working people of US against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); the effective protest registered by Canadian voters against the ruling party that became a signatory to the notorious NAFTA; the demonstration (on October 2) by 12 purely American organisations of environmentalists and humanitarians against the modus operandi of Cargill--all these indicate that the unholy alliance between the rulers and the big capitalists of US is operating not only against the third world countries, but also against other developed white countries, and even against the less privileged masses of US itself. And these culprits are the champions of free trade, liberalisation and globalisation--a case of Satan Quoting the Bible. To sum up: In its present form-- `Liberalisation' of the GATT and the US is a down-right fraud. `Liberalisation' of Dr Manmohan Singh is sheer gullibility. `Liberalisation' of our air-conditioned radicals is ignorance or hypocricy. `Liberalisation' is a grave challenge to patriots of all non-American countries. Hence the propriety and urgency of `Swadeshi' for all non-American peoples of the world. Genuine liberalisation and hegemonic globalisation can never go together. The Hindu concept of globalisation represents genuine globalisation. The Hindu version of globalisation is fairly well known to all Hindus who are not self-alienated: For them the elaboration of Hindu concept may be a superfluous repetition of whatever they know already. For the benefit of the de-Hindised Hindus a brief restatement of the same may, however, be helpful here. Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya, who could conceive of the Central State Authority without stateism, envisaged evolution of the world state enriched by the growth and contribution of different national cultures, as well as the flowering of the Manava Dharma, enriched by the perfection of all the religions including `materialism'. Revered Sri Guruji believed that the world unity and human welfare can be made real only to the extent mankind realises the ultimate, absolute Vedantic truth that "all is one." What he implied was not elimination of all distinctive features of nations and rolling them all into one uniform pattern. He visualised various groups of peoples coming together in a spirit of familism realising the innate oneness of mankind while preserving their individual identities and special characteristics. The different human groups are marching forward, all towards the same goal, each in its own way and in keeping with its own characteristic genius. The destruction of the special characteristics, whether of an individual or of a group, will destroy not only the natural beauty of harmony but also its joy of self-expression. To seek harmony among the various and diverse characteristics has been our special contribution to the world thought. "The World State of our concept," says Sri Guruji, "will evolve out of a federation of autonomous and self-contained nations under a common centre linking them all...it is the grand world-unifying thought of Hindus alone that can supply the abiding basis for human brotherhood, that knowledge of the inner spirit which will charge the human mind with the sublime urge to toil for the happiness of mankind, while opening out full and free scope for every small life-speciality on the face of the earth to grow to its full stature. Verily, this is the one real practical world-mission, if ever there was one," he remarked. This Hindu concept has been elucidated elaborately by Rishi Aurobindo who envisaged the still further stage of `mass spiritualism'. With this mental background, our rishis conceived of the `Old World State'. "From sea to sea, over all the land, one State." This is genuine globalisation. In its absence, the world cannot go beyond the abortive experiments of the League of Nations or the UNO. Without the growth of such Hindu, i.e., human consciousness, it is impossible in the international economic field to ensure genuine `free trade', maximum utilisation of the scarce resources, development without environmental problems and permanent damage to Nature; adjustment of the presently unlimited human desires with the limited resources of the planet; management of population explosion; diversion of all the huge amounts allocated currently by different countries for their defence budgets to their developmental activities; encouragement to every country to maximise its specialised production; free exchange of scientific and technological information; constitution of International Technological Ombudsman; curbing the activities of international criminal gangs disturbing seriously the economic structures of even the civilised countries; and world peace, harmony and prosperity.
