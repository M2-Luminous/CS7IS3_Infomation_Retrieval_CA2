This is the explanation that the Ministry gave for reinforcing security around diplomatic missions in this capital in the wake of the incident provoked by the forceful entrance of a group of persons into the residence of the Belgian ambassador. In statements for domestic and foreign media, Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso said that Cuba and Belgium continue to reject the permanence of such persons in the building and are holding talks to enforce commonly accepted principles. As part of such contacts, the Belgian Embassy handed to Cuban authorities an official list of the residence's occupants, 121 men, women, and children. The Cuban Government recognizes the inviolability of the Belgian facilities and will abstain from taking any measure that could affect it although the occupants entered through violence, Alfonso pointed out. They also agreed on the impossibility of accepting the use of force to avoid established regular procedures to leave the country, a position that Cuba has already reaffirmed. The Foreign Ministry offered medical services to the Belgians, even to the occupants, as well as food, which is already being supplied with the help of other European embassies. Alfonso noted that reprisals would not be taken against those who leave the residency nor would any obstacle be placed in their efforts to depart Cuba through the normal procedures. Nevertheless, if any of them have cases pending in Cuban courts, this would be taken into account. When referring to other illegalities detected, he pointed out the distribution of political statements to the international media, after their elaboration inside the building, even though only authorized personnel can enter and exit the site. To conclude, Alfonso said that no dramatic developments are foreseen in the Belgium residency situation in the coming hours.
