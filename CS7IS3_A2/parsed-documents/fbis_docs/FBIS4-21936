FBIS4-21936 "jptot015__l94101" JPRS-TOT-94-015-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 1 April 1994 NEAR EAST/SOUTH ASIA SUDAN Flyer Details Umm Durman Mosque Bomber's Confession Flyer Details Umm Durman Mosque Bomber's Confession JN0504114194 London AL-HAYAH in Arabic 1 Apr 94 pp 1, 4 JN0504114194 London AL-HAYAH Arabic BFN [Text] London -- A flier distributed by an underground opposition organization within the Sudanese Police force calling itself "The Homeland's Vanguards," reveals interesting details about the group that carried out the attack on the mosque of the Partisans of al-Sunnah in Umm Durman on 4 February, 1994. The leaflet indicates that the prime suspect in the case, Muhammad 'Abd-al- Rahman al-Khulayfi, confessed to the Sudanese police that his organization is composed of 18 persons who come from Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt. The group planned to assassinate al-Sadiq al- Mahdi, former Sudanese prime minister, and Communist Party Leader Muhammad Ibrahim Naqd. The plan did not include Dr. Hasan al-Turabi or businessman Usamah Bin-Ladin as Khartoum contended. Sudanese opposition sources, speaking to AL-HAYAH yesterday, said the Sudanese authorities had pensioned off 15 police officers after charging them with distributing the flier and making public part of the interrogation with the first suspect in the case. Among the suspects are Brigadier General al-Khayr Madani and Lieutenant Colonel Bura'i Wahbah. The leaflet quotes al-Khulayfi as telling interrogators he was of Libyan citizenship and received military training at the al-Biqa' valley in Lebanon at the hands of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1987 and 1988. From there he proceeded to Peshawar in Pakistan to join the Afghan mujahidin. According to the leaflet, al-Khulayfi disclosed that he met in Lebanon with Yasir Muhammad and 'Abd-al- Baqi Nur, both of whom were killed in a clash with Sudanese police following the attack on the mosque. They were also said to have set up a Sudanese organization under the name "al-Jihad Organization." Yasir Muhammad's group was said to be composed of 18 members who came from Somalia, Algeria, and Egypt. Al-Khulayfi traced his acquaintance with Bin-Ladin back to Peshawar. The two were introduced by the Syrian martyr "Bassam." While in Khartoum, al-Khulayfi pointed out, he was staying with a group of Libyans, with whom he fell out and then left to live in a room at Bin-Ladin's residence in the al-Riyad neighborhood in Khartoum. Al-Khulayfi is quoted as saying that his group was asked to prepare a plan to kill al-Mahdi and Naqd. The implementation was set for last 'Id al-Adha but was aborted by the tight security around al-Mahdi. He indicated that "a Sudanese ordered that we carry out the mosque operation, and told me that two of the Muslim Sudanese mujahidin will shortly arrive to share the house with me and implement this jihad duty." In the course of the interrogation, al-Khulayfi assailed Sudan's Interior Minister Brig. Gen. 'Abd-al-Rahim Muhammad Husayn, and said: "This man, who is ignorant in matters of religion, denied he knew me, although he used to see me at Shaykh Hasan al-Turabi's home. Every time the debate in religious matters became heated, he lowered his head." Al-Khulayfi regarded what he did to be a punishment, indicating that the following day members of his group went to al-Riyad neighborhood not to flee as had been said but to inform al-Turabi and Bin-Ladin. When we got to Bin-Ladin's residence, he berated us because we had not sought his permission. But we told him that war between infidels and Muslims is an ongoing affair. Bin-Ladin then left me and went into his home and asked his guards to arrest us, but we opened fire on them. They were three, two Iranians and an Egyptian. His companion Yasir, he went on, was killed in the clash, and 'Abd-al-Baqi died in the ambulance. Bin-Ladin, the leaflet goes on, has charge of the Arab mujahidin in Sudan and al-Turabi the Islamic jihad in Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, and Mauritania. Al-Khulayfi was quoted as saying: "Why should I attack al-Turabi as some news media reported, when he is the leader of the world Islamic movement?" He stressed that he had no regrets over what he had done.
