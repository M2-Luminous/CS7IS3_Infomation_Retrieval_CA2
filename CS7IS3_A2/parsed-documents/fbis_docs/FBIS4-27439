The draft report proposes that a system be created to provide information to companies desiring to participate in biddings for government procurement, and government procurement be opened to foreign enterprises by simplifying the current business registration procedure. The draft report calls for a sweeping review of regulations under individual laws on the air transportation, communications, and broadcasting sectors in order to encourage foreign investment in Japan. The draft report is believed to have been compiled with the aim of backing up Prime Minister Hata on the eve of the July summit talks (the Naples summit) of the industrialized nations by setting out a package of concrete deregulatory measures for government procurement, which has been a focal point in the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks. The Administration and Finance Reform Subcommittee is under the Tax System Reform Council, which is to draw up plans by the end of June for a sweeping reform of the current tax system. The subcommittee has set up four working groups mandated to study ways of keeping the raising of indirect taxes to a minimum. The "deregulation and creation of new industry team," which is mandated to discuss ways to correct the price differentials between Japan and other nations and to rebuild Japan's industrial structure, has proposed a 35-sector type of deregulation. The draft report confines the deregulation to 30 areas and presents a package of concrete measurements of their deregulation. The government is examining the possibility of incorporating the concrete measures in the second package of external economic measures to be mapped out in June. The Foreign Ministry has not yet provided sufficient information to foreign firms eager to participate in biddings for government procurement. The draft report therefore stresses the need to establish a channel through which information in addition to the official gazette is supplied to foreign firms which are small in their size and which have no history of biddings for government procurement. The draft report calls on local autonomous governments to provide foreign firms with full information on their procurement procedures. With regard to the procedure of filing business registration applications, it is a mandatory to file individual business registration applications with the concerned bureau and department of each ministry and agency. The draft report proposes that the business registration application be filed with a single government office. In pointing out that in the telecommunications industry, the international telephone industry, and the car phone industry "it is hard to think that foreign firms can easily participate in those fields and establish their vested interests," the draft report states unequivocally, "It is necessary to relax as many regulations as possible concerning foreign access to the telecommunications market and to remove regulations from the market." The draft report calls for simplifying the current license system in order for telecommunications companies to jointly use their facilities and mutually connect their facilities.
