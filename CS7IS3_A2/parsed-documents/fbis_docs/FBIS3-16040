He said that the session had fulfilled its task, despite the fact that the deputies did not cover all the issues on the agenda. In his opinion, "the approval of the socioeconomic development plan and the budget of the Republic of Crimea for this year, and the confirmation of the appointment of the new government's deputy prime minister set the necessary work environment for the new executive power." The Supreme Council chairman believes, however, that this was the last session of Crimea's present Supreme Council. It will be impossible to convene a new session, he said, since the majority of parliamentarians are involved in the election campaign to keep their seats. Asked what political forces he thinks would win in the upcoming election, he said that candidates of the Rossiya bloc and the Communists stood the best chance of winning the biggest vote. "The Party of Economic Revival and the Union in Support of the Republic of Crimea are also likely to gain seats, but the new parliament will be a complex one." Crimea's Supreme Council chairman reiterated his opinion on the priority of economic problems on the peninsula. He does not believe it sensible to hold the Crimea-wide poll on 27 March according to Yuriy Meshkov's decree, as it would have no legal force. As for the issue of lifting the moratorium on the referendum about Crimea's independence which is set to be examined at the next session, the Crimean Supreme Council chairman described it as yet another political gamble by those reluctant to leave their Supreme Council seats. "If the Crimean card continues to be played, if there is no peace and stability on the peninsula, then the investments so necessary to overcome the economic crisis will remain Yevhen Saburov's and his government's dream," Mykola Bahrov stressed. Mykola Bahrov also declared his negative attitude to the resolution by Ukraine's Supreme Council obliging Crimea to bring its legislation in line with the Ukrainian laws within a month: In his opinion, this is not a realistic deadline. Asked what he thought of Yuriy Meshkov's statement circulated in the media about the need to withdraw military formations from the territory of the autonomous republic, Mykola Bahrov said: "Be realistic. Crimea is Ukraine's border zone, therefore, its troops have to be deployed here."
