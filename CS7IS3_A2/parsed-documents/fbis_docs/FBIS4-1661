Meng Fulin, chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, spoke at the concluding session. He said: The year 1994 is a year for deepening reform, promoting development, and advancing the socialist market economy, socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization in an all-around way. The new situation and new tasks set forth new demands on the people's congress. For this reason, the standing committees of people's congresses at all levels must devote more efforts to studies. They should conscientiously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, the decision adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, new reform measures announced by the Central Government, knowledge about market economics, the Constitution, laws, and regulations so that they will have a better understanding of the basic policy of the Central Committee and the overall task of the whole party and whole nation for this year, a better understanding of the relations between reform and opening to the outside world, and economic development and social stability -- the three promote one another and form a single entity. Efforts should be made to promote socialist democracy, speed up the drafting of economic laws, conduct publicity and education on the laws and regulations with redoubled efforts, step up supervision over law enforcement, and use laws to guide, advance, and guarantee the smooth progress of reform and construction. We must support and take an active part in reform and construction. The people's congress must make economic construction the focus of its work and subordinate itself and serve the overall task of the whole party and the whole nation so as to advance the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The session was presided over by Shao Ming, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress Standing Committee. Present at the meeting were Vice Chairmen Liu Guangcai, Lu Shengdao, Wu Changqi, Lu Zixiu, Jiang Zehui, Chen Jiyu and Secretary General Lu Desheng.
