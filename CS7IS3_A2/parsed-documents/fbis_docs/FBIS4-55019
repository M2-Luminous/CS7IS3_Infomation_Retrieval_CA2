Our questions: 1. What are the three major political, economic, social, or welfare tasks facing the governing forces in the next four years, tasks that your party accepts and will give preference to even at the cost of other problems? 2. What are the three larger-than-average economic, political, social, or moral burdens facing the society or some strata of the society in the next four years, burdens connected with or independent of the aforementioned tasks that you do not accept or accept only partially, and which you force into the background compared with other similar problems? Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] 1. Out of the next four years' most important welfare measures, developing the state support for child rearing has a major importance. To a large extent, even now, it is the task of family help centers to support the families. The development of this network is justified. In addition to this, the financial transfers in society -- the tax system, social security, and welfare benefits -- have to be formed in such a way as to make it clear for everyone that society does not only emphasize the importance of families in words. The tax system will also have to be changed: During the four years of government, it has to be achieved that only the freely disposable income is taxed. For single parents, a fair possibility has to be guaranteed to reduce their tax basis. We wish to develop the tax system in a direction that will take the number of dependents into consideration. We have to develop further the institute of full-time maternity. In the area of the economy, one of our main goals is to establish a financial and tax environment that fosters economic growth. Of the main tools of market stimulation, we think it necessary to change some important elements of the tax and duty systems in the interest of a more proportionate sharing of taxes and economic development. It is also necessary to reexamine the product structure of the general trade tax to improve the situation of the poorer groups in society. Parallel with the beginning of economic growth, we consider reducing the upper tax limit to stimulate the demand and to protect the domestic producers' interests to be justified. We suggest the abolition of the minimum tax. We only accept the temporary maintenance of the source tax if the budget uses it for development and investment purposes. Economic development is impossible without cultural development. The KDNP wishes to implement a pluralistic cultural policy, we wish to support programs, rather than institutions. Our goal is to establish the dual system of support for culture that exists in Western Europe: a state and economic sponsorship structure. 2. According to the KDNP's economic policy, our task is to make increased incomes possible while maintaining the balance (without significantly increasing inflation, the budget deficit, or the balance of payments deficit) that: -- on the supply side, stimulates investments by enterprises directly from their own incomes and indirectly through using the population's savings; -- on the demand side, creates an effective demand that does not induce inflationary pressure or increased imports of consumer goods. Due to balance problems, this increased income can only be implemented: -- if we accept a temporary deficit of the budget and payment balance, -- and if we use a very carefully designed, selective, and targeted tax system, budget reform, and credit policy. If our program is implemented, the increase of consumer prices cannot exceed 14 to 16 percent. However, in the interest of market stimulation, we cannot make it our goal to reach one-digit inflation in such a short time. In accordance with this, and in the interest of social peace, in the medium term, we can only expect that the budget deficit in proportion to the gross domestic product [GDP] will not decrease, or only to a very small extent. Liberal Civic Alliance Entrepreneurs' Party 1. For three years, since we accepted the program called "Bourgeois Transformation," our party's goals have not changed: competitive market economy, socially solidary society, and two- chamber parliament. We want to replace the state-centered economic policy with a "streamlined" economic policy. Economic stabilization is impossible without capital investment, which in turn needs a predictable economic environment and lasting laws. The reform of state finances cannot be delayed any further, tax payers can only finance the truly necessary tasks rather than budget labels without any function. Instead of self-interested and bureaucratic state privatization, we give preference to a privatization strategy based on public consensus with the involvement of the interest representations bodies. It is impossible to protect the domestic industry and trade without suppressing the black economy. We must guarantee price security for the agricultural producers through changing the subsidy and taxation systems. The state, the local governments, the employers, and the employees have to make a new social pact. Out of the ways of handling unemployment in accordance with the local circumstances, investments from privatization revenue, tax allowances given to enterprises launched in crisis regions, and leaving the greater part of personal income tax with the local governments are important measures. We can handle the regional differences of unemployment through small-area crisis management programs. It is enterprises that can mostly create new workplaces. We need a new constitution and a two-chamber parliament. Politics that unites and balances the interests is the only viable way for the future, for modernization. 2. We do not wish to spend too much energy on debtor, credit, and bank consolidation because this method will not reach the desired results without creating certain guarantees. The primary task to be solved would be bank privatization. Naturally, to achieve this, stabilization is necessary, even through the method of bank consolidation, however, if this is not concomitant with privatization then the capital pumped into the banks has to be seen as money down the drain. Unemployment is a burning and tense problem. At the same time, the huge body of unemployed can be divided into two, well- distinguishable groups. One consists of truly unemployed people while the other group abuses the possibilities provided by the legal system and is possibly an active participant in the black economy. We only wish to deal with the latter group when we make it impossible for them to remain on benefits because their equal treatment with the truly unemployed people evokes serious moral aversions, and our shaky economy cannot support the burdens, either. We do not wish to deal with the issue of further compensations in the future, we respect the already existing compensations but do not support new ones. Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] 1-2. Politics is an art of compromises. Rather than the politicians and political parties having to make compromises with each other, this means that balance has to be found and maintained between society's needs and values. Only the extreme and radical parties would annihilate or suppress all other values or interests for the sake of one particular value or interest. In the past four years, the government led by the MDF has shown that it is possible to maintain stability, namely to establish a balance extending to the whole society between the interests and goals, even under extremely difficult circumstances. We did not implement the shock therapy that had been recommended by other parties and some experts, however, we did not continue the peaceful inaction and dilapidation that had characterized the previous regime. We can promise this balanced policy for the next four years, too. We act, but with moderation, without endangering people's lives and material security with experimentations and short-term solutions. The most important values and the price to be paid for them: -- The preservation of social security in the growth period, too. The framework of the social market economy has been established, the economy has entered a growth period. In legislation and in the state's activities we have to concentrate on patching up the welfare net, we have to achieve that none of the needy people are left without any support. We would mainly like to improve the situation of pensioners and young people; the latter group is especially important because the burdens of setting up a family and rearing children also rest on the younger generations. It is possible that the probably very fast growth will not reach its maximum speed because of the resources spent on social security, but we are convinced that, this way, the growth will have a better foundation and this is profitable in the long run. -- The state has to promote economic growth. Economic growth is vitally important for the country, because living standards have not improved in the last 15 years. An improvement can only be achieved through growth. According to the experience of economic history, growth is always concomitant with minor budget imbalances, the same way as an enterprises is also forced to take on loans if it wants to invest and expand. However, enterprises that are worried about taking on loans and therefore do not develop, will certainly go bankrupt, because the old saying about capitalism that states that you have to run to stand still is true. (In other words, one has to develop even just to maintain the current situation, because the competitors are also developing). We have to make our contacts with Western Europe tighter in all areas. There is only one solution to our economic development and security situation: To return to Europe. To join the European Union [EU] and NATO. Many things might still happen to the east and south of us. It matters a lot what kind of government a country has at the time of a possible radical change and whether it has international security and economic defenses. Neutrality would expose the country to a possible radical nationalist or communist danger. Returning to Europe also requires sacrifices. We cannot conduct a protectionist policy, we cannot introduce customs duties as we wish, because, if we did, our Western partners would do the same to keep out Hungarian goods. We succeeded in that Hungary will open its markets to the European Union later than the European Union to Hungary. Hungarian Socialist Party 1. The most important task is to achieve that society's best forces cooperate with each other in the interest of solving the country's problems and reducing the divisions in society. A new social agreement has to be established between the employers, the trade unions, the interest representation bodies of employees, the civic organizations, and the government that will guarantee peace in the country. The decision-making system has to be changed in such a way as to make it possible to learn about a broad range of views and to create a consensus. The decline of the economy has to be stopped, the deterioration of the balance and the increase of indebtedness have to be curbed, the development of the Hungarian economy has to be put on a modernization course that will establish the conditions for lasting economic growth. In the interest of this, we have to implement the reform of the state finances, we have to complete bank consolidation, and we have to put agriculture back on its feet. The state has to take an organizing role in recapturing the eastern markets and in developing the infrastructure. In the interest of the economy's sound development, privatization has to be placed on a new footing in which longer-term economic considerations, and leaders and employees interested in the future of the enterprise, would receive a more prominent role instead of the current bureaucratic control. In the interest of ensuring the country's external peace, we consider a balanced foreign policy necessary. In addition to getting closer to the European Union, we strive for balanced and good relations with all our neighbors, and for strengthening these relations. Our solidarity for the Hungarians living beyond the borders is part of our solidarity for the Hungarian nation and, at the same time, it is part of a future European system of protecting national minorities. 2. In the next four years, although we will do everything sensible we can to achieve them, we can already now see that we will only be able to achieve partial results on some points of our program. -- Unemployment cannot be ended because we are still to face the problems related to the structural change, however, there is a realistic chance to reduce it. -- The burdens of debt servicing will not be reduced because another peak of debts was created in the past four years, however, if we manage to improve our economy's ability to compete and its export performance, then the burdens will be better shared through the bigger turnover. -- Inflation cannot be reduced to a single-digit figure due to the delay in the reform of state administration and the again wide agrarian price gap, but inflationary pressures can be avoided and inflation can be pushed down to around 15 percent. Social Democratic Party of Hungary [MSZDP] Welfare care should provide a safe point for everyone who happens to be swept too far from the will of society through no fault of their own. The support and welfare system should be based on needs and the task is to draw this up and to implement it. In other words, the various provisions have to be separated (a hospital is not an old people's home), the support has to be targeted to the individual (rather than the family or the school or institution, it should be the person in need who receives the support and the right to dispose of it), the goal should be prevention and preparation for adjustment, and welfare care should be made part of the small communities. To change the social system, the current centralized and redistributive system of collecting the social revenue has to be broken down again. Changing the system of state finances is the first step. In the framework of this, we can implement the following: Lessening the centralization of tax revenue and its spending, separating the state finances from the budget, placing the government and the state-owned organizations under the rules of the private sphere -- rather than the state's power -- thus separating and requalifying them from the "tool of executive power" to the rank of participants on the market. We also have to thoroughly simplify the production and the collection system of incomes from taxes, duties, and of fiscal sources. In the course of reconstructing our society and the economy, the guiding principle is our linking to the European practice on an equal basis, in which the major task is to establish the institutional, group, and personal requirements of cooperation. The basic conflict lies between modernization and its rejection (conservation, return to the feudal estate), and this creates counter-movements that are even noticeable on a political level (yearning for the past, and so on). The structural change and the ensuing work mobility are not two different sides of the challenge of modernization, rather, they are the same phenomenon, and they only appear to be separate from the work's and the employee's point of view. In our position, it is obvious that the tasks we undertake should be adjusted to the market requirements rather than to our old abilities. However, this is only a matter of priorities rather than of bearing the burdens. [sentence as published] 2. In the interest of what has been said above, and in accordance with our priority system, we do not support, for example, the actions that are being conducted now and for whose maintenance there is much pressure. One such area is financing the deficit -- which resulted from the unsuitability and inability shown in solving the problem of international cooperation and foreign markets -- through convertible (or domestic) debts. Another is the budget support -- "consolidation" -- of losses and indebtedness of banks and large enterprises that resulted from unprofessional (state) management and private control. Finally, another such area is the diversion of tensions arising from the unresolved nature of social and interest coordination problems, state spending, and the unchanged distribution system to a political level. This is the subject and goal of a possible social contract, rather than the polishing of the representative and declaration system and statutes of various "forums." [sentence as published] Because this only creates the possibility for covering up the lack of social peace, rather than creating the road for social peace. We do not accept the moral burden of the repetitious mentioning of outdated ideas in politics, the promising of false stability in the economy, the beautifying "powdering" in the social situation, the cherishing of illusions (third road, separatist showing of being Hungarian, or rejection of world standards) and, all in all, provincialism and its twin sister, populism, with its superficiality, aggressiveness, and shunning of responsibility and tasks. The MSZDP will undertake to establish solidarity, justice, and equality of opportunity.
