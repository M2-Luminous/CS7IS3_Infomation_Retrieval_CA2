Austria Seeks Agreement With Switzerland by End of Year"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Brussels, 8 Feb (ATS) -- Austrian Public Economy and Transportation Minister Viktor Klima announced in Brussels on Tuesday [8 February] that Austria wants to sign an agreement on road transit traffic with Switzerland before the end of the year. This agreement will subject Swiss trucks transiting through Austria to the ecopoints [ecological points] system that exists for all European Union [EU] countries. A spokesman for the minister said that the number of ecopoints granted to Switzerland will be calculated on the basis of transportation statistics. He added that Austria expects the discussions with Switzerland that are due to begin soon to go smoothly. The conclusion of an agreement between Austria and Switzerland on transit traffic is one the Twelve's requirements before Austria can join the EU. Currently, the only trucks that are completely free to circulate in Austria are Swiss. They avoid both the ecopoints system, to which European Community trucks are subjected by application of the Austria-EC transit agreement, and the quota system which is the rule for other third countries. The Twelve consider that this situation discriminates against Community trucks and they want it brought to an end. While the Switzerland-EC transit agreement is aimed at protecting the environment and regulating transit traffic by applying the 28 tonne limit, the Austria-EC agreement established a system of ecopoints. The Twelve receive an annual amount of ecopoints which are used up as the trucks enter Austria and according to the pollution rating of the vehicles. Vienna Rejects Twelve's Other Proposals While it is ready to end this discrimination favoring Switzerland, on Tuesday Austria rejected the other EC demands concerning road traffic. Negotiations will continue at the ministerial level on 21 and 25 February. The first point of disagreement concerns the future of the transit agreement that came into effect a year ago. As far as Vienna is concerned, this agreement applies for the whole of its planned duration, that is until 2004, and is not to be abolished three years after Austria joins the EU as the EU claims. According to the Austrian government, the most important thing is to reach the objectives of the transit agreement, but these objectives -- the protection of the environment (reduction of pollution emissions by 60 percent) and the orientation of transport (creation of an effective alternative between road and rail) -- will not have been achieved after three years. The EU, however, maintains that no such bilateral agreement can continue to exist after the country has become a member. At most, its key points can be retained in a temporary arrangement for a limited duration. After that, a solution would have to be found at the Community level and this has yet to be debated. Traffic Diverted Because of Swiss Restrictions Vienna also refuses to lift its 38-tonne limit, which allows it to exert "a little pressure" in favor of rail. This means of dissuasion would disappear with the harmonization with European standards which already cater for an increase to 44 tonnes. To defend its position, Austria points out the restrictions imposed by Switzerland, namely the 28 tonne limit and the ban on night driving. These restrictions mean that heavy goods vehicles avoid the shortest route -- cutting through Switzerland -- and instead take a detour through France and Austria. Vienna calculates that 40 percent of the traffic transiting through Austria is therefore "diverted traffic."
