FR940930-2-00203 FR940930-2-00069 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;445 and 50&hyph;446] Texas Utilities Electric Co.; Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment to Facility Operating License, Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination, and Opportunity for a Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF&hyph;87 and NPF&hyph;89, for Comanche Peak Steam Electric Station (CPSES), Units 1 and 2, located in Somervell County, Texas, operated by Texas Utilities Electric Company (the licensee). The proposed amendment would change the technical specifications to review the 18-month surveillance requirements for certain emergency core cooling system, containment system, and plant systems to eliminate the restriction that these surveillances be performed during shutdown or during the refueling mode or cold shutdown. Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act) and the Commission's regulations. The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. These proposed technical specification changes delete the restrictions that only tests which are performed ``during shutdown'' or ``during REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' be used to comply with certain surveillance requirements. The tests of concern are equally valid whether they are performed during shutdown or if they are performed entirely or in part at power. ``Testing at power'' was never prohibited by the technical specifications although, for these surveillances, ``testing while shutdown'' was required. The testing which is performed at power is reviewed to ensure that the proper prerequisites are established, including the proper unit mode of operation and the proper circuit blocks. Significant portions of the testing needed to comply with these surveillance requirements, and in some cases the entire test, are already performed while at power as part of the test procedures which are used to comply with other surveillance requirements such as the Slave Relay Testing. In general, removing the ``during shutdown'' and ``during REFUELING MODE or COLD SHUTDOWN'' restrictions from these surveillance requirements will eliminate the need to reperform, while shutdown, those portions of the testing which are already routinely performed at power. Deleting such ``retest'' requirements does not reduce safety, cannot increase the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, and is more likely to reduce the probability of a transient by eliminating duplicative testing. In the future, it is possible that TU Electric may choose to perform additional portions of these tests at power. Since these portions are not being performed at power now, the net effect is not the deletion of a retest but a change in the required conditions for that portion of the test. Such a change would require a change in the test procedure and would only be allowed if technically and operationally acceptable and if the change did not constitute an unreviewed safety question per 10 CFR 50.59. These controls are adequate to ensure that any future changes in the test procedures as a result of these proposed technical specification changes will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated.
