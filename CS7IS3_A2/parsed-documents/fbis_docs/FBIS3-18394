Just when the Serbs, given an ultimatum, are complying and are withdrawing their heavy weapons from the besieged Sarajevo, they find themselves accused of "having violated the no-fly zone." However, such violations take place continuously. Therefore, yesterday's flights could be used only as a pretext for the strike. At the time when everybody is in agony and fears an expansion of the war in the Balkans with more general implications, they are dangerously playing with fire, which could undermine and upset the entire peace effort. It is obvious that the Americans want to promote their own solution within the framework of the "new order." The solution of missiles and the superpower's strength. So, it is reasonable that there is concern in all the capitals of the countries that are participating in the peace efforts, including Athens, which has additional reasons to be concerned since it is within the explosive zone. The solution to the drama of Bosnia will not be given by missiles and air raids but by the peace efforts, without any undermining actions under the table. Hope to God that there will be no continuation and escalation of tension after this incident. Hope to God that things are not led again into a deadlock and war entanglement. The "new order" has shown its face once again. It has shown that it does not hesitate to stir up tension without considering the consequences. It has shown that its basic argument at every peace dialogue is the persuasion of arms.
