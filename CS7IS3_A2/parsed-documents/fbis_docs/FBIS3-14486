[Al-Hasan] I delivered a speech at the beginning of the meeting. I explained Jordan's position on the peace process. I pointed to the efforts Jordan and His Majesty King Husayn made concerning the massacre of worshipers in the holy al-Ibrahimi Mosque during the blessed month of Ramadan. In the deliberations, I also pointed to the need to upgrade coordination among the Arab parties that are directly concerned with the negotiations, and the need to achieve Arab reconciliation in a way that leads to good Arab solidarity. [Al-Badri] Your Excellency: You met with the Egyptian prime minister this afternoon. Please give us a brief idea about this meeting. [Al-Hasan] I indeed had the honor of meeting with his excellency the Egyptian prime minister this afternoon. At the beginning of the meeting, I conveyed to him the greetings of His Excellency Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali. During the meeting, which the Jordanian ambassador in Cairo attended, we discussed a host of bilateral issues, led by convening the Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee, which, we hope, will hold a meeting in Amman next month. I also briefed his excellency the Egyptian prime minister on several Jordanian positions and issues, led by Jordan's position on, and adherence to, the peace process, as well as other issues linked to the siege on the Gulf of Aqaba we are suffering from, and the need to lift the siege on Jordan, which inflicts great damage to the Jordanian economy. This damage totals $300 million a year. Moreover, I briefed the prime minister on some other Arab, regional, and international issues. [Al-Badri] With regard to amending the Arab League's charter, which is a top priority on the 101st session's agenda in Cairo, would you please brief us on the general framework of such an amendment? [Al-Hasan] Before answering this question, I would also like to note that I met with His Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa yesterday as part of the continued bilateral consultations and coordination. With regard to amending the Arab League's charter, it has been agreed to link this issue to pan-Arab security and to delay discussing these two issues until there is a better Arab situation and until Arab reconciliation is achieved. We hope this reconciliation will be realized as soon as possible under the best circumstances.
