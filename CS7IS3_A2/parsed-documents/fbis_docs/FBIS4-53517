The insurance sector, which has been listed as one of the priority sectors along with government procurement and automobiles and auto parts, was "nearing agreement" during the negotiations in February, and this time, an agreement is considered to be highly probable if negotiations are resumed. The focal issue from now on will be how to handle the issue of delaying liberalization in the "third sector" insurance covering injuries, illnesses, nursing services, and so forth, where foreign insurance companies have a relative advantage. The Finance Ministry expresses "confidence in concluding the negotiations," and recently, a plan to "work for agreement by postponing" liberalization in the "third sector" has been rapidly gaining acceptance. During an 18 May speech before representatives of the insurance industry, Jim Foster, councilor (in charge of trade policy) at the U.S. Embassy's economic office, made a statement to the effect that: "Unlike automobiles and other sectors where private companies' cooperation is easy to come by, in the insurance sector, which is covered by numerous regulations, it is not appropriate to set objective criteria, such as market share or growth rate." This can be taken as a signal that the United States may not necessarily insist on numerical targets. Many in the industry have begun to speculate that the United States "has shifted to a softer attitude in insurance" (according to an industry source). The pending issues in this sector include: how to handle the "third sector," and how to correct the practice of contracting for insurance policies based on "keiretsu" relationships. Other U.S. demands, such as clarifying standards for granting licenses and product certification, flexibility in approving new products and premium rates, and introducing a "broker" system for recommending insurance companies for the clients' benefit, have already been included as voluntary Japanese Government measures in the "outline of external economic policy reforms" issued in late March. With regard to the "keiretsu" issue, Japan argues that "it is not proper for the government to meddle in private sector transactions," and "the United States is also showing a certain measure of understanding" (according to the Finance Ministry). For the above reasons, the focus is now being narrowed down to how to deal with "third sector" insurance, where AIU [American International Underwriters] Japan and other foreign companies are doing brisk business. Under the present plan for insurance system reform, life and nonlife insurance companies operating in Japan will be allowed to participate in this sector within two years. Threatened by this, U.S. companies complain that "deregulation in this sector is unfair." Since this demand to delay liberalization runs counter to the general trend of deregulation, Japan has been obviously distressed. The Finance Ministry, which is in charge of this issue, is cautious to state that "the negotiation process is in progress; we cannot show all our cards." On the other hand, the Insurance Council's report openly recommends that "schedule and method of implementation should take into consideration the position of foreign insurance companies." Senior Finance Ministry officials believe that "a pledge to foreign countries has to be fulfilled." It seems that Japan may be forced to compromise.
