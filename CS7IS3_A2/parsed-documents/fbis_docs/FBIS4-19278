It does not seem probable that Greece will become a significant link between East and West -- and the burden of responsibility for this state of affairs rests upon the Greek side. It took nothing less than last week's declaration by EC delegate Mr. Matutes to the effect that the Commission is indeed keen on the construction of an alternative road which will bypass Egnatia Odhos, for Greek authorities to recognize the construction of "our own" Egnatia Road as a most urgent matter. So slow has the Greek side been in acting to obtain incorporation of the Egnatia route into the trans-European networks that its fate is still languishing in indecision. It must also be noted that, in the context of discussions on this subject by the "Christofersen team," other member nations are strongly opposed to such an incorporation of the Egnatia. The construction -- which many sources consider already imminently probable -- of a "counter-Egnatia Road," will destroy Egnatia's privilege of being the exclusive carrier of West-bound goods from the East. The construction of a route connecting Varna with Dirrachion, which all our northern neighbors are energetically aiming for, will attract a significant percentage of transport activity, thus turning Egnatia into a minor route of minor significance. This is bound to happen even when Egnatia's inclusion in the trans-European transport system is fully assured. In the race of the European nations to exploit the political and economic opportunities now being created by the unification of "Old Continent" networks, our country is unprepared and short of breath. Nor is this inability to participate advantageously in the trans-European networks limited to transportation. Having been too slow to act, Greece is no longer capable of securing the passage of basic telecommunications and energy lines through its territory. In particular, any possibility for telephone networks seems to be definitively lost, since the basic axis linking East and West through the Balkans will have to pass north of our border. Moreover, the country is facing a serious danger of becoming marginalized with respect to energy networks as well. The responsibility for this emerging situation lies to a very large extent on the Greek side, not only because Greece acted too slowly in regard to networks passing through it, but also, and most significantly, because it did not prepare itself to enter this united market. The previous government remained unaware of how important the unification of trans-European networks was for the political and economic life of Greece. It therefore failed to cultivate its opportunities for participation. The present government, likewise, seemed to be taken by surprise at the rapidity of developments and our neighbors' more fruitful efforts in this domain. It is accurate to say that, since transportation, energy, and telecommunications networks are the primary means for Greece to preserve its ties with the other nations of the European Union, our country has a vital interest in their development. As has been mentioned, Greece's inadequate preparation for participating in the trans-European networks is the primary reason for its inability to develop the opportunity to its advantage. The individual networks marked for inclusion in the overall unification program of trans-European systems are railways, roads, telecommunications, electricity, and natural gas. To date, Greek efforts along any of these lines have given only disappointing results. Natural Gas The natural gas pipeline which meets the corresponding Bulgarian one at the border is the only link presently projected between our country and any other corresponding trans-European network. An older proposal to provide Skopje with Russian natural gas piped through Greece has now been abandoned: our neighbor is in the process of finalizing the investments which will allow it to import gas through Bulgaria. The possibility of a link-up with Albania which would allow it to get Russian gas through Greece remains viable. According to reliable sources, such a link-up is still under consideration, and the Community seems to be in favor of it. The fact that southern Albania exhibits significant industrial activity -- which in turn implies the presence of potential consumers of gas -- makes it financially advantageous to provide our neighbor with gas from Greece since costly investments to construct conduits of great length within Albania would not be necessary. Of course, if this proposal goes through, it will require not only Greek investment capital to bring the pipeline to the Greco-Albanian border, but also the modification of energy-related policies to assure the consumption of natural gas by large-scale consumers in northwestern Greece. Only in this manner will the profitability of the project be safeguarded. Railroads To truly implement the European Union, it is necessary to connect the individual national railroads to form a single, continuous, high-speed network, about 30,000 km long. (Speeds of 200-300 km/hr have already been achieved in many cases.) Construction of this high-speed European network is neither planned nor undertaken centrally. Instead, the national railroad companies are individually responsible for the planning and construction of each national network, to be carried out in conformity with certain basic agreements applying to all. Two Greek railroad lines have been incorporated into this network: that of Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni (which includes the detour Larissa-Volos), and that of Athens-Corinth-Patra. Any activities undertaken to date in order to further the creation of a Greek high-speed network have been woefully inadequate and create a most disappointing picture of the Greek railroads. This lackadaisical attitude towards the development of the rail links in Greece is indeed nothing less than astonishing. Especially so since the obstacles that non-EC countries at times set up in order to hamper our transit to Europe present us with a motivation for finding and using mixed transportation solutions combining, for example, railway transport with boats or trucks. It is worth noting that in modern harbors, mixed transit of this sort makes up the greater part of all transportation activity. Available statistics indicate that it constitutes 40 percent of all movement at Le Havre, 60 percent at Hamburg, and 70 percent at Bremen. An estimated 400,000 railroad cars go through the Straits of Messina at Sicily every year, while in Denmark the Danlink line -- a collaborative effort among Denmark, Sweden, and Germany -- moves a total of 2 million tons per year. A Hope for Greece: The Egnatia Road The state of the highway network in Greece is characterized by the inadequacy of the roads connecting western and northwestern Greece with the eastern, central, and northern parts of the country, by the seasonal interruptions of many connections, and by the low level of safety on the roads. In spite of these conditions, the percentage of appropriations allocated for a number of years to both the national and regional road systems has been desperately inadequate. Characteristically, since the completion, in 1970, of the national highways Athens-Thessaloniki, Athens-Corinth-Patra, Andirrion-Ioannina, and of the northern network of Crete, no projects of similar importance have been accomplished. The subsequent works of Patra-Pirgos, Thessaloniki-Kavala, and Corinth-Tripolis are not comparable to the works of the 1970's. Aspirations concerning Greece's participation in trans-European transport systems do not extend beyond visions of the Egnatia Odhos, while hopes for road improvement and the construction of basic highway networks are left hanging upon the notorious "Delors II package." The principal works projected by the Package are the following: - The Egnatia Odhos which will consist of a highway length of 400 km and will incorporate 200 km of existing national roadways, bringing the total to 600 km. - The national highway of Patra-Athens-Thessaloniki-Eidomeni. - The road system of northern Crete. - The western Mediterranean system of Ioannina-Andirrio-Rio-Patra-Pirgos-Kalamata. - The system of Corinth-Tripoli-Kalamata (constituting supplementary works). Most of these projects are still only on paper. The section from Yliki to Katerini, to which 460 billion drachmae had been allotted, absorbed only 5 billion in 1993 -- an amount identical to that absorbed by the section of the Egnatia Odhos from Igoumenitsa to Kavala, which had had 500 billion allotted to it. The section from Andirrio to Igoumenitsa -- which had been budgeted at 120 billion -- absorbed last year only 2 billion drachmae. The Delay A 10-year delay in the construction of roads connecting eastern with western Greece, and especially in the construction of the Egnatia, is responsible for the serious inefficiency of our transport networks connecting us to Europe. The situation is much aggravated by the war in former Yugoslavia. Telecommunications Arc Beyond the Border Forecasts concerning the possibility that Greece may participate in trans-European telecommunications networks are not encouraging. The hope that Greece might play the role of a telecommunications link within the wider Balkans and the Middle East seems altogether unrealizable. Recently it was learned that the European Commission is studying an fiber optic system that will connect Italy and Turkey by passing through Skopje and Bulgaria. In this manner a "telecommunications arc" extending, on the one hand, into the countries of the former Soviet Union, and on the other, toward the Turco-Cypriot pseudonation, will be created beyond our northern border. Electricity The possibility of Greece connecting with European electricity networks is gloomily slim. Of the three countries with which we share a border to the north, Albania does not have a connection with Europe to date, Greece's connection through former Yugoslavia has been cut off because of the war, and a connection through Bulgaria is not feasible due to the special characteristics of its own grid. This means that at present, Greece is completely cut off from the electricity networks of West Europe. The problem becomes aggravated because of the shortage of electric energy which Greece currently faces and which, under certain circumstances, makes it mandatory to import electricity. The underwater cable which will link the Greek electricity grid with Italy has been registered as one of the trans-European networks. In spite of the initial optimism over this prospect, however, the advantages of the connection appear to be extremely limited. To begin with, the Community considers this investment to be only part of a larger package which includes a similar connection between Greece and Turkey, in anticipation of Turkey's eventual participation in the unified electrical networks of Europe. Acting as an intermediary between Turkey and Europe could prove to be politically and financially advantageous for our country, yet only on condition that this tripartite connection of Turkey, Greece, and Italy be the primary, if not the only, such connection. It has recently been learned that a similar project to connect Turkey with European sources of electrical energy by going through our northern neighbors is now being worked out. In the context of this project, an agreement to link Albania and Italy by underwater cable has already been signed. This investment, moreover, will cost much less than the corresponding Greco-Italian cable, because of the shorter distance and the shallower waters between those two countries. The new line under consideration will connect Turkey with Italy by going through Bulgaria-Skopje-Albania. Thus, even in the case of electrical networks, Greece is being marginalized. And this marginalization becomes more sharply felt thanks to the electrical shortage that Greece faces at present. Put differently, the danger exists that Greece will not only not function as the intermediary between Italy and Turkey, but that the Greco-Turkish network will be used only for importing electrical energy from our neighbor in order to cover our own shortage. In a similar way the underwater cable between Greece and Italy will probably be used by the Public Power Corporation [DEH] for imports from the West European countries.
