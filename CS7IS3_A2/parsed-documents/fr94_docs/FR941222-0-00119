FR941222-0-00119 FR941222-0-00018 6. ``Other Species'' TAC The FMP specifies that amounts for the ``other species'' category are calculated as 5 percent of the combined TACs for target species. The GOA-wide ``other species'' TAC is calculated as 15,535 mt, which is 5 percent of the sum of combined TACs for the target species. 7. Preliminary Halibut PSC Mortality Limits Under §672.20(f), annual Pacific halibut PSC mortality limits are established for trawl and hook-and-line gear and may be established for pot gear. At its September 1994 meeting, the Council recommended that, for 1995, NMFS re-establish 1994 PSC limits of 2,000 mt and 750 mt for the trawl and hook-and-line gear fisheries, respectively, with 10 mt of the hook-and-line limit allocated to the DSR fishery in the Southeast Outside District and the remainder to other hook-and-line gear fisheries. These interim specifications exempt pot gear from halibut limits for 1994, as proposed by the Council. In 1994, NMFS approved a rule that authorizes separate apportionments of the trawl halibut bycatch mortality limit between trawl fisheries for deep-water and shallow-water species (59 FR 38132, July 27, 1994). These apportionments are divided seasonally to avoid seasonally high halibut bycatch rates. Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS preliminarily concurs in the Council's 1995 recommendations and assigns 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively, as interim limits. While these limits would reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they would not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear, implementation of the IFQ program, and changes in the season start date for some fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery. 8. Preliminary Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits Under §672.20(f)(2)(iii), NMFS preliminarily allocates seasonal halibut PSC limits based on recommendations from the Council. The Council recommended the same seasonal allocation of PSC limits for the 1995 fishing year as those in effect during the 1994 fishing year. The publication of the final 1994 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth for 1994. Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 5. Regulations specify that any overages or shortfalls in PSC limits will be accounted for within the 1995 season. The Council did not recommend changes in the seasonal apportionments for the hook-and-line gear fisheries from those specified in 1994; however, NMFS notes that the opening date of the sablefish fishery is scheduled to change from May 18, in 1994, to March 1, in 1995, under the IFQ program. This change and the Council's proposed exemption of the sablefish fishery from the 1995 PSC limit may prompt the Council to alter its recommendation for seasonal apportionments at its December 1994 meeting. The Pacific halibut PSC limit for hook-and-line gear is allocated to the demersal shelf rockfish (DSR) fishery and fisheries other than DSR.
