The National Coordinating Council believes that SDS's participation in parliament's work would be imperative only in case it discusses the future of Lyuben Berov's cabinet, the Electoral Act, the Judiciary Organization Act, or the state emblem. Under the decisions of the latest national conference of the coalition in May, the decisions concerning its strategy and tactics lie with the National Coordinating Council and the parliamentary SDS should conform. The latter has not been attending the plenary sittings for two weeks now, with the only exception of last week's debate on the Judiciary Organization Bill. Mr. Dimitrov said that at today's meeting the National Coordinating Council found the boycott had yielded results: "The parliamentary majority is quite confused and decisions are being made without the constitutionally required quorum." The latter fact Mr. Dimitrov described as "disgraceful" and "arbitrary." The National Coordinating Council also decided to develop "a detailed scheme to make the presence of the National Coordinating Council, MP's and leaders of the SDS felt throughout the country."
