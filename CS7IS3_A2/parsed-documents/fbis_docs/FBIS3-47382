"We have no information on the concerned letters and we only found out about them just from reading newspapers," H. Fournier, chief ICRC representative in Indonesia, told THE JAKARTA POST. Xanana, who is serving a 20-year jail term at the Cipinang Correctional Institution, reportedly wrote letters to Portugal and the International Court of Justice pleading for their intervention and demanding a new trial by the world court. The letters, whose existence was first disclosed by the Portuguese press, have been the subject of an investigation by the Indonesian authorities. Director General for Correctional Institutions Baharuddin Lopa said the letters were believed to have been sent by Xanana through his mother and an ICRC official who visited him at Cipinang last month. Fournier said he had received no letters from Xanana's mother and other family members on a visit to the prison between December 8 and December 11, 1993. "The family visit was under supervision of concerned authorities at the prison and several officials of the Indonesian Red Cross," he said. He said it was true that the ICRC had jointly organized the visit to East Timorese detainees at the prison with the local Red Cross office, but that it knew nothing about the letters. He said he had also clarified the matter with the Indonesian authorities to their entire satisfaction. Armed Forces Commander General Feisal Tanjung said last week that he believed the letters to be genuine, but did not rule out the possibility that they had been written by someone other than Xanana.
