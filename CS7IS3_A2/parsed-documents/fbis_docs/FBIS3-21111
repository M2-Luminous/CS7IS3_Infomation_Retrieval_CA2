As new aircraft programs become thin on the ground, Sextant Avionique is making the logical shift into military and civil modernization markets. So far, the French equipment maker has been fairly successful in the civil realm, notably with its new Enhanced Vision Systems piloting display technology. EVS aims to improve the poor-visibility landing capability of old aircraft, not all of whose autopilots perform up to requirements. But Sextant's attempts to capture a share of the military market have stalled, for lack of both a clear strategy and opportunity. The equipment maker's product line, for instance, does not feature mission electronic systems (radar, navigation/attack systems), which are a key element in modernizing interception or ground-attack aircraft, the stars of the military aircraft retrofitting market. Sextant's international marketing head Jose Sarnito divides the military retrofitting market into five categories: basic trainer aircraft; advanced trainer aircraft; air-to-ground attack aircraft; multipurpose aircraft; and, at the top of the echelon, multipurpose aircraft with night-flight capability. There is a wide array of equipment to be updated in each of these categories. Customers will want new navigation and display instruments, usually culled from general aviation equipment catalogs, for basic trainer planes. In addition, advanced trainers will have to be equipped with a headup display, multipurpose screens, and an accurate navigational system, that is, with specifically military products. The third category, ground attack planes, introduces the need for such mission equipment as a laser telemeter, possibly a laser designation pod, and in some cases even a helmet sight to reduce the pilot's defense reaction time. Finally, the fourth category, multipurpose aircraft, requires radar, while the fifth calls for infrared devices for night attack capability. Jose Sarnito considers advanced trainer planes (AlphaJet, Hawks, etc.) to be the most promising market segment. Sextant has a broad line of display and navigation products for advanced trainers, and can integrate their equipment. Lower down the product line, customers look for the best price on initiation aircraft, and take care of integrating equipment themselves. Higher up the line are operational aircraft, where the cost and technical weight of mission electronics become the overwhelming factor. Sextant does not aspire to market leadership in this niche, leaving it to its partner Thomson-CSF. Moreover, its big French competitor Sagem already has a firm foothold in the mission electronics market. Jose Sarnito believes Sextant has a card to play in former East-bloc countries. "The governments of those countries," he explains, "are trying to preserve their cold-war-era industrial capability and pilot operational ability at the lowest possible cost." Their approach, whether in Poland, Czechoslovakia, or Russia, is to support new trainer projects that adapt Western avionics to locally-made airframes, which they will eventually convert into light fighter craft. Inspired by British Aerospace's success with the Hawk line, Poland's PZL took this approach with its M-93s and M-95s, which are versions of the Iryda I-22 with new engines and equipment. So did Mikoyan with its MiG-AT and Czechoslovakia's Aerovodochody with its L-159, a version extrapolated from the L-59 and said to have an added radar. Joint Venture Project Sextant has decided to enter the market for the long term. "Our goal," explains Jose Sarnito, "is to imitate Allied Signal or the other big American equipment manufacturers. We want to develop ties with local distributors, set up shop in country, and team up with local industries to transfer technology or market manufacturing licenses." Sextant Avionique is said to be discussing a possible three-way joint venture with Polish and Czech equipment makers to pursue those goals. Sextant's technical line involves a complete flight electronics system christened Topflight, from which customers can select a list of equipment based on specific project needs. Topflight features the one-piece headup display "Smart", liquid-crystal head-in-the-middle color displays, a set of computers that incorporates mission control and symbol generation functions, an anemobarometric device, and conventional emergency instrumentation. Depending on the navigational accuracy desired, customers can choose between the Stratus inertial measurement unit (with a Pixyz, three-axis, self-contained gyrolaser) developed for the Tiger helicopter, or the Totem gyrolaser navigational system that is currently being manufactured in large numbers to renovate the Transall. Finally, Sextant is also offering the Topstar military GPS receiver, with or without decoding, that it is delivering on Mirage 2000 Ds. "To capture modernization markets," explains Jose Sarnito once again, "a company must always be able to offer off-the-shelf solutions. The sums involved do not cover the cost of new developments. And the first requirement of customers is always an accurate navigational system." Sextant's liquid-crystal multipurpose displays have just been chosen by the Bangalore Aeronautics Establishment (India) to equip prototypes of the future light combat aircraft (LCA). Though the French equipment maker has its sights set on the more lucrative avionics integration or chief-contractor projects getting off the ground in east Europe, this is still an encouraging sign. In the meantime, however, its competitor Sagem has again managed to land most squarely on its feet: it has been selected by the Warsaw Aeronautics Institute to build the M-93 demonstrator.
