However, in talking to this newspaper he chose a formulation that does not correspond to what the leadership of the "Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania" (DFDR) expects of him. Iliescu said that there were "delicate moments" in Romania after World War II. Germans and Romania got into "difficulties" at that time. Many were deported or expropriated. The current Romanian leadership rejects "these discriminatory measures." Iliescu added that, since the end of the dictatorship, Germans are no longer being discriminated in Romania. The current difficulties of the country are general and affect all nationalities. Anyone who emigrates today does that mainly for material reasons and not because Germans are discriminated against in Romania. In Romania politicians of both the parties close to the government and the opposition keep repeating how much the country regrets the emigration of the German minority. DFDR Chairman Philippi called Iliescu's comments on the deportations and expropriations of the postwar period "too general." According to him, Romanian Germans can regain trust in their state only if, apart from the injustices under which all citizens suffered, Iliescu also recognizes those that were imposed on the Germans in particular. Philippi says he expects Iliescu to "solemnly" recognize the excesses of the state against the German ethnic group -- similar to what Czech President Havel did in the past. In January 1945, about 70,000 Romanian Germans were arrested by Romanian police and Romanian military and extradited to the Soviet Union for years of forced labor. More than 10,000 died during the transports and in the Soviet labor camps. The Romanian Germans also accuse the Romanian state of having carried out general expropriations at the beginning of the communist dictatorship, which hit the German minority particularly hard. Germany supports the demand of the DFDR that Romania should officially recognize the discrimination. Horst Waffenschmidt (Christian Democratic Union), parliamentary state secretary in the Interior Ministry and the Federal Government's commissioner for resettlers, who is currently visiting the Romanian capital and the most important settlement areas of the Romanian Germans, broached the desire for an official statement during a meeting with Iliescu in the president's palace of Cotroceni in Bucharest. After the meeting Iliescu commented on this by saying that the desires of the Romanian Germans exclusively affect the relationship of the Romanian state with its citizens. Waffenschmidt pointed out to Iliescu that Germany has spent more than 111 million German marks [DM] since 1990 to help the Germans in Romania. In 1994, another DM11 million are supposed to be spent for this purpose. This help also benefits the "neighboring surroundings" of the Germans in Romania. The Federal Government wants to contribute to having Germans and Romanians coexist peacefully. However, it is expected that Romania abolish the customs duties that are currently levied on German relief supplies. In addition, television must transmit more German broadcasts. After the meeting, Iliescu announced that the Romanian Government will reexamine the customs regulations.
