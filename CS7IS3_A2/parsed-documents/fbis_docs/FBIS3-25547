According to Tshisekedi's government, the incursions are allegedly being carried out with the complicity of Marshal Mobutu's Special Division. This has caused a sudden rise in tension in this region. Here is Christian Obadi Bangi, the deputy minister of external relations in Tshisekedi's government, who comments on the military maneuvers in the region. [Begin Bangi recording] The legal government deplores this military cooperation between the Zairian Armed Forces and units of the Sudanese Government Army. This cooperation, which typifies this association of evildoers, must be condemned by the international community. The government notes that soldiers of the Zairian Armed Forces visited the districts of (Nasco), Koya, (Mori Boye), and Yambio in southern Sudan. Escorted by their Sudanese counterparts, the Zairian soldiers looted livestock -- cattle, goats, and sheep -- in the zones under the control of southern Sudanese People's Liberation Army. In turn, the Sudanese soldiers were authorized to penetrate into Zairian territory at Iri, (Botiama), Malembo, Owele, Rumu, (Kargai di Baze) and (Kpori) in the Ituri District. They stole foodstuffs from businessmen in the Haut Zaire Province and kidnapped young girls to Sudan under the escort of their accomplices from the Zairian Special Presidential Division. The legal transitional government of the Republic of Zaire vehemently condemns this barbarous behavior and calls on the UN High Commission for Human Rights to form an international commission of inquiry to establish the responsibility of each side in this case.
