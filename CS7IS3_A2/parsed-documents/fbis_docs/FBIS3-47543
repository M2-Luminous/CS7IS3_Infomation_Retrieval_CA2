Agreement had been reached because the U.S. side had indicated it basically accepted the action program suggested by the Japanese side at the unofficial talks that started in Tokyo at the beginning of the week. The action program looks to introduce a general competitive bidding system for large-scale public works projects beginning fiscal 1994. Under the program foreign companies will be treated on equal terms as Japanese companies. The action program will be officially approved by the cabinet meeting scheduled for 18 January. The two countries have also agreed to exchange data on the number and cost of projects for which orders have been given to foreign companies, in an attempt to measure the degree of market opening. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has indicated it will support the imposition of sanctions against Japan if no accord is reached by 20 January. However, with agreement now reached, it has become certain that sanctions can be avoided. According to the action program agreed on by two countries the scale of projects to be sponsored by the central government, and for which the general competition bidding system will be introduced, will be set at more than 4.5 million SDR's (special drawing rights, approximately 700 million yen). The level has been set at 15 million SDR's [about 2.5 billion yen] for projects sponsored by local governments, including prefectures and special municipalities, and the 84 state-run corporations government, including Eastern Japan JR [Japan Railways], Japan Highway Public Corporation, and NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone].
