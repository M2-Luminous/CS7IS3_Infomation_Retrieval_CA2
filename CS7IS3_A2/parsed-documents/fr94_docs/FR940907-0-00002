FR940907-0-00002 FR940907-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 1137 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;13] Milk in the Eastern Colorado Marketing Area; Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document suspends certain performance standards of the Eastern Colorado Federal milk marketing order. The action was proposed by Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., a cooperative association that supplies milk for the market's fluid needs. The suspension will make it easier for handlers to qualify milk for pool status and prevent uneconomic milk movements that otherwise would be required to maintain pool status for milk of producers who have been historically associated with the market. EFFECTIVE DATE: The suspension to ยง1137.7 is effective from September 1, 1994 through February 28, 1995. The suspensions to ยง1137.12 is effective from September 1, 1994 through August 31, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Clifford M. Carman, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;9368. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued June 23, 1994; published June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33455). The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers who have been historically associated with this market will continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Eastern Colorado marketing area. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on June 29, 1994 (59 FR 33455) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions of the order. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. One comment supporting the proposed action was filed. No opposing views were received. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that the following provisions of the order do not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act: 1. For the months of September 1994 through February 1995: In the second sentence of ยง1137.7(b), the words ``plant which has qualified as a'' and ``of March through August''; and
