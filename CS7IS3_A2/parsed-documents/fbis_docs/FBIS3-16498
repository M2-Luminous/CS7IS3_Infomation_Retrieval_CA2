The main difference between the present Constitution and the one adopted in 1978 lies in the fact that it envisions a change in the state structure -- Belarus becomes a presidential republic. According to the new constitution, the Republic of Belarus is declared to be: a unitary, democratic, social, law-governed state. Man is considered the supreme value of society and the state. Belarus sets the aim of making its territory non-nuclear and the state neutral. The president of the republic is the head of executive power. The parliament is reduced from 360 to 260 members. It remains semiprofessional, i.e. some of the deputies work on a professional basis in permanent commissions and the others combine their duties as MPs with other work. The Constitution enters into effect from the moment of being published. One month after that the republic's Constitutional Court is to be set up. [passage omitted]
