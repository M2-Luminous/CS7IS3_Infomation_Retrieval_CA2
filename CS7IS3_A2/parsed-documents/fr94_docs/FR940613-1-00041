Executive Order 12866 B. Regulatory Flexibility Act C. Paperwork Reduction Act I. Background EPA is proposing to establish regulatory criteria specifying which RCRA Subtitle I requirements are applicable to a secured creditor. Section 9003(h)(9) of RCRA exempts from the definition of ``owner,'' for purposes of section 9003(h) _EPA Response Program for Petroleum, those persons who, without participating in the management of the UST or UST system, and who are not otherwise engaged in petroleum production, refining, and marketing, maintain indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest. Those most affected by this ``security interest exemption'' include private lending institutions or other persons that guarantee loans secured by real estate containing an UST or UST system, or that acquire title to, or other indicia of ownership in, a contaminated UST or UST system. 1 However, the security interest exemption is not limited solely to lending institutions; it potentially applies to any person whose indicia of ownership in an UST or UST system is maintained primarily to protect a security interest. 1 Under the laws of some states, an interest in real property may include an interest in USTs or UST systems located on that property. See Sunnybrook Realty Co. Inc. v. State of New York, Kesbec, Inc. v. State of New York, Claim Nos. 32844, 33125, 15 Misc. 2d 739; 182 N.Y.S. 2d 983. Of course, the loan documents may specifically include or exclude USTs as collateral securing the obligation. The RCRA subtitle I security interest exemption not only affects secured creditors but also UST and UST system owners who seek capital through the private lending market. Today's proposed rule will provide a regulatory exemption from corrective action regulatory requirements for those persons who provide secured financing to UST and UST system owners. EPA expects this rule, in conjunction with the statutory exemption in section section 9003(h)(9), to encourage the extension of credit to credit-worthy UST owners. At present, EPA believes that concerns over environmental liability are making a significant number of lenders reluctant to make loans to otherwise credit-worthy owners and operators of USTs. The free flow of credit to UST owners (many of whom are small entities that may rely on secured financing mechanisms for capital) is expected to assist UST owners in meeting their obligations to upgrade, maintain, or otherwise comply with RCRA subtitle I and other environmental requirements. Conversely, the lack of such capital may adversely affect the ability of an UST owner to meet its obligations under Subtitle I, with concomitant adverse environmental impacts from USTs and UST systems that are out of compliance due to the lack of financing for the UST owner and operator. (For a more detailed discussion, please refer to the Regulatory Background Document for this proposed rule, located in the OUST Docket at 401 M Street, SW., room 2616, Washington, DC 20460.) The Agency is also concerned that if otherwise credit-worthy UST owners and operators are unable to obtain financing to perform leak detection tests, or to upgrade or replace deficient tanks, the market for UST equipment could be adversely affected, thereby limiting the availability and/or affecting the cost of such equipment. In addition, a lack of adequate capital could produce a ripple effect which would cut across other portions of the UST-related industrial sector. Based on letters received from UST equipment manufacturers, EPA believes that this sector has suffered as a direct result of the capital squeeze on UST owners and operators. The Agency is further concerned that many UST equipment manufacturers may find it increasingly difficult to sustain their production of UST equipment. Unnecessary constrictions on the free flow of capital for UST compliance and improvements could force companies to abandon their production of UST equipment or to close altogether, and it may have adverse impacts on the environment by making the investment or development of new UST technological innovations more difficult. The preamble to this proposed rule is structured as follows: The following section briefly describes the UST program. This section is followed by a discussion of this proposed rule, which includes a description of the various options lenders may exercise both pre- and post-foreclosure with respect to regulatory compliance for a secured UST or UST system. Proposed regulatory text concludes this proposed rule. II. Description of the UST Regulatory Program Based on the Agency's study of the banking community's lending practices and discussions with representatives of both lenders and borrowers, EPA believes that the lending community in general is not particularly familiar with the UST statutory scheme and regulatory program. Because UST and UST systems are likely to be used as collateral in securing loans to borrowers, the Agency believes that it is appropriate and useful to briefly describe the UST program in the preamble of this proposed rule. The following discussion is general in nature and is intended to provide a framework for lenders or others to better understand the scope and intent of the program; it is not intended to be a substitute for the regulations themselves.
