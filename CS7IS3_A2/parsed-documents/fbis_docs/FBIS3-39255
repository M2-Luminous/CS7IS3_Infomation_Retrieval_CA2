There is, however, "still a great deal of detailed work and formulating to be done." Lambsdorf does not share the concern of several U.S. politicians who think that state subsidies to industry might be increased following the coming into force of the Geneva agreements. Yet, there "is a tendency toward promoting industry in all countries." Promotion of industry is in better hands with companies than with the state, which he considers "on the way to a republic governed by commisars," due to the great number of technological boards. Lambsdorff said that the annual World Economic Summits "should be abolished rather than continued in the existing form." Returning to smaller agendas and, thus, more intensive discussions would make sense. In the FDP politician's view, the way the United States treats Japan is "extremely wrong." Prime Minister Hosokawa's reform efforts could have an enormous influence on the economic situation, which would profit the United States. The pressures that U.S. trade policy frequently exerts are "the wrong approach." Trade relations can never be seen from a bilateral point of view, but they should always "be seen through multilateral eyes." Lambsdorff strongly criticized the United States and Europe's policy on the Balkans. He said Serb politicians are simply amused when once again there is talk of a NATO air strike, because "two days later the whole thing has been forgotten." At the moment, "Europe and the United States are making fools of themselves." Lambsdorff welcomed President Clinton's performance during his latest trip to Europe. "Europe must be interested in the U.S. President remaining capable to act and negotiate," the former FDP chairman said. On 10 February, Lambsdorff will give a talk on "Continuity or Change" in Washington, and on 14 November in New York, he will speak about "Germany's Economic Challenges."
