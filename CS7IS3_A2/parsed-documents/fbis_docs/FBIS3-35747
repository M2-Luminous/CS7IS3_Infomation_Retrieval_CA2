"Tajik opposition leaders supported by Afghan mujahideen do not abandon attempts to smuggle gunmen, arms and narcotics across the border," the commander said. Russian border guards thwart their actions virtually every day." "The past day was no exception," Chechulin continued. Troops at the Pyandzh border section frustrated, on Saturday, an attempt to smuggle weapons and drugs across the border. Gunmen and narcotics were seized as a result of efficient actions by Russian border guards. The commander noted that militants use caches more often now to smuggle arms. For instance, troops at the Moscovskiy border section spotted a cache with great quantities of mines and ammunition for firearms.
