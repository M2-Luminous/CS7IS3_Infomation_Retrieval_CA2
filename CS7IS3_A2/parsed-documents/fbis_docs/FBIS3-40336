After forming a quasi-crystal cylinder, now carbon 60 has given birth to a polymer capable of scratching diamond, currently the hardest known material. By placing a pinch of carbon 60 powder between two diamond dies and twisting them, a noncrystalline, semitransparent derivative is obtained that is not diamond but which probably marks the beginning of a new class of ultrahard materials. The result of joint French-Russian work (French chemists from Orsay, Tours, and the ENS [teacher training school] working with Russian researchers from the Vereshchagin [name as published] Institute), this compound could have industrial applications in the manufacture of tools for oil well drilling and diamond working. It must, however, be possible to obtain sufficient quantities of the substance.
