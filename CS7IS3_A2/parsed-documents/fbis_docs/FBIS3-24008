Its essence is quite simple. We voters--it is explained--are no longer human beings, but rather zombies, resulting from a "psychological weapon" used by the CIA. The mass media, which have been taken over by this American agency, are being used in a hostile manner to "subdue their own people.." Let's cite some quotations. "We have become the subjects of a refined and subtle experiment which is unprecedented in its scope," writes M. Khmelenok in NOVYNY HORODNYANSHCHYNY. "What is being done is a persistent attempt--lasting for almost two years now--to `restructure' the mode of thinking of 90 percent of our country's population: to turn upside down the moral principles and spiritual values that have been handed down from one generation to the next, to make black look like white and evil look like good. Everything bright and shining is ridiculed and trampled into the dirt. What is being forged here is the `freedom' to steal, to play clever tricks, to be degraded, duped, and `not to figure things out'." The author of this quite lengthy article, unfortunately, did not find enough space to cite even one argument in support of his verbose and pessimistic assessments. And it seems to me that he did not want to do this because it would have been so hard for him. Well then, it is certainly vain and useless to speak about finding on the staffs of Chernihiv's local newspapers a single editor-agent of the CIA. And this is something more akin to the propaganda of "villains, corrupt persons, extortioners and bandits, traitors and ignorant persons." All this is nothing more or less than the ideogically misguided fantasies of dreamers, whom it is quite easy to forgive for their nostalgic longing for the old days, when the lacquered Brezhnevist truth lulled people's hearts. Moreover, we can agree with at least one point made by M. Khmelenko: The ideological manipulation of the voters as if they were zombies is genuinely evident nowadays in the election campiagn. In whose interests is this being done? Let's analyze certain publications. The state press with certain exceptions (the rayon-level newspapers of Meni, Bobrovytsi, Bakhmacha, and Ichni, as well as the oblast-level DESNYANSKA PRAVDA), in my opinion, has consistently worked from issue to issue against Ukrainian independence. This is felt particularly just prior to the elections. M. Tush, the first secretary of the CPU [Ukrainian Communist Party] Kulykivskiy Raykom and a candidate for the office of people's deputy, has published more than 10 articles and works in verse, the contents of which can be basically boiled down to the following: "Give my Fatherland new birth," and "The shining little star soars again over the Desna. The soul quickens with the abundant colors of spring. Shchors will smile upon us again, and Lenin will awake from his sleep." And in subsequent issues of the rayon-level newspaper he echoes the political songs of H. Leheyd: "How we were in the Union. We were harnessed togther to a single plow. We have begun to live independently, and we are constantly clashing." The copious rayon-level press boringly sets out such conclusions and headlines as the following: "My hapless Ukraine" (NIZHYNSKYY VISNYK), "Only in a powerful Union" (PROMIN ZHOVTNYA), "How did we lose our life?" (NOVYNY HORODNYANSHCHYNY), "How we were in the Union" (POLISKA PRAVDA), and so on and so forth. One gets the impression that the people of the Chernihiv region, like soulless zombies, are having the following ideas pounded into their heads: How unfortunate, helpless, foolish, simple-minded, and inept you are! And all this is because of independence! It is clear that there is no alternative idea to this. Nor is there any reflective thought given as to how life in Ukraine could be made better. And so the following premeditated, directorial thought has been implanted in the voters' collective subconscious: We are such an inept people. Brothers, let's gather under the protection of Moscow! Let's vote for the candidates who have programs specially along those lines. Of course, all this is presented as the voice of the people. But it has been taken directly from the written program of the Ukrainian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is now on sale for 1300 karbovantsy at any newsstand in the Chernihiv region. The adherents of the only "true teaching of Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin" view their own future only in the storehouse of the USSR, which will again "support national-liberation movements in the colonies of imperialism," as a result of which the world capitalist system" will not emerge "from its own present-day crisis, and socialist revolutions will occur in most of the capitalist countries." The "zombie" effect has manifested itself particularly during the days when the election campaign is gathering speed. As if following the gesture of an orchestra conductor, LENINSKIY SHLYAKH, POLISKA PRAVDA, and other newspapers at the very same time in February published the joint statement by the leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Peasant Party: P. Symonenko, O. Moroz, and S. Dovgan respectively. According to this statement, the blame for all of Ukraine's troubles falls upon Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party. It was upon their demands that the "pro-Rukh" L. Kravchuk and I. Plyushch appointed to the "storehouse of the oblast- and rayon-level structures of state administration" "functionaries of these political organizations to key positions of power and authority." Having read all the above, for whom should the voter cast his or her ballot? Of course, not for the "ruling" Rukh people, and--I suppose--not for the communists (among the people it seems that there is still a virulent allergy to raykoms, party activists, and the like). Our degraded people--wearied by political statements, promises, and economic stagnation--will vote, first and foremost, for people of action, for people who can get things done. They could be called the Expeditors (with a capital letter) of the election district. It is already clear that in the Ripkinskyy Election District No 449 victory will be gained by A. Dron, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee on Housing and Communal Affairs. There are few persons who know for what and how he voted during the present parliament, but three Polisian rayons are almost completed converted to gas. That is a fact--a reality. And people know about that. And, therefore, he is now the main newspaper hero of the three rayons in this election district. An analogous situation has also evolved in other districts. As I was informed by one of the leading officials of the oblast-level state administration, in January the oblast authorities felt themselves under some unprecedented pressure from Kiev. They were openly offered large-scale credits, off-budget financing in great amounts, and even petroleum products. For seats in the parliament! These are not good-quality principles on the basis of which life can be improved throughout Ukraine. But it is precisely such things that the voters are demanding; their evaluational criteria have been distorted by an obvious system of propaganda.
