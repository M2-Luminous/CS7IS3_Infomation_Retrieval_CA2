FR941102-1-00091 FR941102-1-00018 For the purpose of computing a handler's obligation for producer milk, the market administrator shall determine for each month the value of milk of each handler described in §1030.9 (a), (b), and (c), as follows: (a) Calculate the following values: (1) Multiply the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class I as determined pursuant to §1030.44(c) by the Class I differential price for the month; (2) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the total hundredweight of producer milk in Class II as determined pursuant to §1030.44(c) by the Class II differential price for the month; (3) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the hundredweight of skim milk in Class I as determined pursuant to §1030.44(a) by the skim milk price; (4) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to §1030.44(a) by the average protein content of producer skim milk received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of protein by the protein price; and (5) Add an amount obtained by multiplying the pounds of skim milk in Class II and Class III as determined pursuant to §1030.44(a) by the average other solids content of producer skim milk received by the handler, and multiplying the resulting pounds of other solids by the other solids price; * * * * * (f) Add the amount obtained from multiplying the Class I differential price applicable at the location of the nearest unregulated supply plants from which an equivalent volume was received by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to §1030.43(d) and §1030.44(a)(7)(i) and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to §1030.44(a)(11) and the corresponding steps of §1030.44(b), excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order; * * * * * 6. Section 1030.61 is amended by revising the section heading, introductory text, and paragraph (a) to read as follows: §1030.61 Producer price differential. For each month the market administrator shall compute a producer price differential per hundredweight for Zone 1. If the unreserved cash balance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the computation is less than 2 cents per hundredweight of producer milk on all reports, the report of any handler who has not made the payments required pursuant to §1030.71 for the preceding month shall not be included in the computation of the producer price differential. The report of such handler shall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until he has made full payment of outstanding monthly obligations. Subject to the aforementioned conditions, the market administrator shall compute the producer price differential in the following manner: (a) Combine into one total for all handlers: (1) The values computed pursuant to §1030.60 (a)(1), (a)(2) and (b) through (k) for all handlers; (2) Add values computed pursuant to §1030.60 (a)(3), (a)(4), and (a)(5) and subtract the values obtained by multiplying the handlers' total pounds of protein and total pounds of other solids contained in such milk by their respective prices; and (3) Subtract the value obtained by multiplying the difference between the Class III price and the Class III&hyph;A price times the pounds of product determined pursuant to §1030.43(e); * * * * *
