Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612, The Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, seeking comment and information with respect to the Commissions's rules to require or permit LECs providing video dialtone to grant preferential access or rates to certain classes of video programmers, may directly impact entities that are small business entities, as defined in Section 602(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Granting certain small video programmers preferential access to or rates on the video dialtone platform can have a positive impact on those entities by facilitating their provision of video programming to subscribers. On the other hand, preferential access or rates for certain small entities may negatively impact those small entities that do not receive preferential treatment. 16.
