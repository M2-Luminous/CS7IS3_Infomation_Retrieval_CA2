Instead of burdening their economies with additional ambitious projects, countries of the region focussed instead on sustaining their previous year's accomplishments in the areas of confidence and investment. The optimism generated by the resolution of the Kuwait crisis in 1991 continued to prevail. The Arab states also reduced their borrowing and focussed on attracting international investors. The report added that 1993 brought with it more recognition of the need to administer economic conditions with a more reasoned and studied approach if they are to be sustained in the long-term. The report, issued by the Arab Banking Corporation, pointed out that foreign economic developments greatly impacted the Arab world in 1993. Recession in Europe, which is the major market for Arab non-mineral exports, and the general softening of oil prices, contributed a measure of moderation to economic developments in the region. Other exporting countries, especially phosphates producers, suffered the consequences of reduced world demand. But the producers of minerals chose not to succumb to that negative actuality and, instead, adopted effective marketing strategies in their major markets, not merely to maintain market-shares but also to expand them. Those strategies were successful to a degree and are expected to remain in place beyond 1993, since several of those producer countries enjoy the lowest production costs in the world. The report noted that future difficulties in 1994 will relate to maintaining the rate of investment at a time when returns are low on investments needed to expand the goods-producing sectors and supporting industries [as published] which have been considered important elements of the development strategies of Arab governments since the end of the Kuwait crisis. It pointed out that even though the Arab states, by offering a number of incentives, succeeded in 1991 in attracting private domestic and foreign investments to additional economic sectors, those states found it most difficult to attain their goals in the state-owned sectors that they place at the top of their priorities. The Corporation noted that most of the states that suffered that predicament had enough borrowing power in 1993 to tap domestic and regional capital markets for the funds needed to finance their projects. Even though this was exactly what some of them did in 1991 and 1992, they chose to exercise that option as little as possible in 1993. [The Corporation] further stated in its report that, instead of borrowing, the countries concerned found it an easier strategy in the long run to concentrate their efforts on attracting international partners to major projects and on selling stock in other [enterprises]. Those strategies achieved a degree of success in 1993, but a number of countries faced the problem of raising enough domestic capital to equal the amounts obtained from foreign sources for the implementation of new development projects. The Corporation said it was regrettable that Arab capital markets were lagging in development and that they did not become operational at the right time, especially that such markets will be an important source of minimum low-risk capital. It added that, although incomplete or undeveloped at present, many Arab capital markets did well in 1993, renewing confidence in the direction of local and regional economies amid expectations of future expansion. The report revealed that, thanks to government-imposed financial controls, the Arab financial sector also enjoyed the benefit of expanding local economies due to several factors including low demand on that sector by public-sector enterprises. There was more freedom in a large number of countries in setting interest rates for deposits and loans. A reduction in interest rate controls was necessary to guarantee continued availability to the private sector of the additional funds offered by banks and others' financial institutions. But the aforementioned facilities were accompanied by extremely strict controls on banks concerning risk measurements in order to guarantee their compliance with international standards and to bolster the competitive positions of domestic institutions. The report pointed out that the financial sectors in a number of countries have undergone changes introduced by radical reform programs, some of which have been in effect for years while the others were only recently introduced with support from the Privatization Fund, whose programs received a new push in 1993. The agricultural sector, which has also benefitted from reform programs in recent years, remains a function of meteorological conditions. It managed adequate production in most of the Arab states, even though rainfall in certain areas was below their requirements. That sector's output, however, was not sufficient to change their agricultural trade deficits. In order to lessen dependence on the weather, huge investments were necessarily maintained in irrigation and damming projects with support from regional and multi-national institutions. The tourism sector settled back in 1993 after sharp expansion in 1992. The report added that conditions in certain Arab states remain desperate, having shown no sign of improvement year after year. Those countries, lacking any noteworthy developments in 1993, continued to be recipients of Arab and international aid in order to keep them from further deterioration. Aid tied to projects or to trade with the rest of Arab countries, especially from individual Arab states and from development funds, was an important component of the investment programs implemented by those nations in 1993; as was the case with similar aid extended since the late 1970s.
