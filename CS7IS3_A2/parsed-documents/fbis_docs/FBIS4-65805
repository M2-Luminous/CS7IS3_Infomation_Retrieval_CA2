The liberals have proved themselves to be a reliable factor, Kinkel said following a group meeting of his party in the Berlin Reichstag today. The FDP acted responsibly in its key role in the election of the federal president. The SPD [Social Democratic Party] candidate, Rau, enjoyed his high regard, Kinkel continued. At the same time, he strongly criticized SPD comments suggesting the FDP was no longer needed. "I do not like aggressive noises of this kind; we will not let ourselves be blackmailed by the SPD." The FDP was free to decide for whom it wanted to vote. Asked to comment on the discussion about a direct election of the head of state, Kinkel said this could be discussed. However, it had to be considered whether this should also apply to other representatives. Kinkel admitted that he was personally opposed to direct election by the people. Asked whether the FDP has a favorite candidate for the new president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Kinkel said he did not wish to comment but already has a favorite.
