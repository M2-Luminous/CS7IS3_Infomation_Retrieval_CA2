Oriol, an engineer and president of the organizing committee, told PRENSA LATINA that the meeting will include conferences and seminars by renowned personalities, such as Enrico Turrini, the vice president of the Eurosolar group. Turrini will speak about the environment, independence, and democracy. Besides the investigative presentations, there will be several symposiums and round tables on photo voltage power, converting solar energy into heat, solar energy, the environment, and solar and aeolian energy architecture; there will also be a technological exhibit. Cuba is looking at alternate energy sources to address the acute energy crisis it is currently experiencing, after the disappearance of the USSR, which was once its main supplier of fuel oil. A world conference on biomass energy generation, development, and the environment will be held in Havana in January of 1995. Eurosolar, UNESCO, and the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE), among other organizations interested in promoting sustainable energy generation, will sponsor this gathering as well.
