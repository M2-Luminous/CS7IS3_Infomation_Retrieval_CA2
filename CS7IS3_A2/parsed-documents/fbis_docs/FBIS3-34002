Can you explain to us the progress that has been achieved so far? ['Arafat] True, we have almost reached a final agreement during my meeting with Mr. Peres in Davos and we are very close to signing an agreement which can be called the Davos agreement. The Israelis, however, need a few more days before ratifying the agreement. I will meet again with Mr. Peres and [Israeli Prime Minister] Mr. Rabin in Cairo. [Cochlaine] What about control over the border crossing points with Jordan and access to the Dead Sea? ['Arafat] We discussed these topics at length and we are now discussing the details. I cannot say anything further at this point. [Cochlaine] You made concessions, for instance, over the size of the self-rule area around Jericho--from 340 square km to 55 square km. Are you willing to make further concessions? ['Arafat] I reject the term "concessions" because the achievement of peace is more important than anything else. That is why I speak about "the peace of the brave." We will implement everything that was agreed upon with the Israelis. Similar negotiations were held between Algeria and France in the early 1960's and between South Africa's President Frederick de Klerk and my friend, Nelson Mandela. [Cochlaine] Do you think the Israelis will withdraw from Gaza and Jericho on 13 April as agreed in the timetable of the peace agreement that was signed in 13 September 1993? ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will respect the agreement and redeploy their forces in the territories according to plan. [Cochlaine] Will there be elections in July? ['Arafat] I hope the Israelis will not postpone them. Rabin had stated that there are no sacred dates, but our position is that the agreements which were signed must be respected and implemented. [Cochlaine] What role will the elected council play in comparison with that of the Palestinian National Authority? Will there be two government agencies competing with each other? ['Arafat] The Palestinian National Authority is a permanent body that was set up by a Palestine National Council [PNC] resolution in 1974, while the council will be convened for legislative elections. [Cochlaine] Does that mean that the council will comprise PNC members living in the occupied territories? ['Arafat] Certainly. [Cochlaine] Late last year, a delegation of 118 PLO members came to Tunis and handed you a letter, criticizing the PLO's undemocratic practices and your single-handedness. What is your comment on this? ['Arafat] The mere fact that these people were allowed to level these accusations and criticisms shows that the PLO is a democratic institution. Would they cling to democracy in any other organization? We are proud of the fact that we have established democracy within the PLO, even when our struggle was in full swing. This accomplishment is unprecedented. [Cochlaine] Presidents Bill Clinton and Hafiz al-Asad met in Geneva on 16 January. Do you believe that Israel can conduct peace negotiations on two tracks; that is, with you and with the Syrians, at the same time? ['Arafat] Why not? Israel headed for the Madrid and Washington negotiations, fully aware that there is no alternative to a peace agreement between the Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East. The negotiations on both tracks are heading in the same direction. At any rate, the PLO's ties with Syria are good. Only 10 days ago, I took part in the funeral of Basil, President Hafiz al-Asad's eldest son, who died in a tragic incident. I also keep in mind the Arab meetings held in Washington, which will bring us closer to Arab unity. [Cochlaine] You have recently met with King Fahd in Saudi Arabia. You have described your meeting with the Saudi monarch as cordial. Is that all there is to this meeting? ['Arafat] Our talks were cordial and constructive. I am grateful to King Fahd for the efforts he has made to achieve peace in the Middle East. I am also grateful to him for the support he is extending to the Palestinian people, the Palestine question, and Arab Jerusalem. [Cochlaine] What role do you envisage for Switzerland as a mediator in the Middle East conflict? ['Arafat] We appreciate the constructive role being undertaken by Switzerland, which is maintaining good relations with the Palestinians and Israelis alike, with the Arabs in general, with the United States, with Russia, and with the Western European Union. Although Norway was active in the Middle East peace negotiations last year, the Swiss Confederation has always played a distinctive role in Middle East affairs. [Cochlaine] Do you think that you can benefit from the so-called Swiss model with regard to political cooperation once federal ties are established between Jordan and the Palestinians? ['Arafat] You cannot export your unique model of coexistence among various linguistic and ethnic groups. I wish this was possible. Nonetheless, the Swiss model of coexistence will be helpful to us in the Middle East.
