FR940513-0-00135 FR940513-0-00034 General service fluorescent lamps provide lighting through a system known as a luminaire. Under EPCA, the term ``luminaire'' means a complete lighting unit consisting of a fluorescent lamp or lamps, together with parts designed to distribute the light, to position and protect the lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply through a ballast. 42 U.S.C.A. 6291(29)(F) (West Supp. 1993). Compact fluorescent lamps also provide lighting through a system. For compact fluorescent lamps, the system includes the fluorescent lamp and a ballast. Some compact fluorescent lamps are sold for use with separate ballasts. The lamp labeling rules, however, cover only those defined as medium base compact fluorescent lamps, i.e., those that have an integral ballast and medium screw base. Incandescent lamps also have medium screw bases. They provide lighting by heating an internal filament to incandescence by an electric current, and can be used, for example, in table or floor lamp fixtures or in ceiling or wall fixtures. Medium base (integrally ballasted) compact fluorescent lamps are meant for use as replacements for incandescent lamps in these applications. Increasing the efficiency of a lighting system that currently uses incandescent lamps can be accomplished by selecting a more efficient incandescent lamp, such as a more efficient halogen incandescent lamp, or a more efficient medium base compact fluorescent lamp. To the extent the efficiency of general service fluorescent lighting systems can be increased, it can be accomplished by increasing the efficiency of the lamp, the ballast or the luminaire, or a combination of those separate parts. In designing the disclosure requirements for these different lamp types, therefore, the Commission has considered the effect of the minimum energy efficiency standards specified by EPCA on the lamps that will remain on the market after the standards become effective, and how best to provide purchasers with the information necessary for them to select the most efficient lamps that meet their requirements. Several comments stated generally that any labeling requirements for lamps should meet one or more of the following standards: Simple, uniform, comprehensible, cost-effective and based on readily available information. 44 In response to a question in the NPR, some comments favored different types of disclosures based on the category of purchaser_residential or commercial. One comment, however, specifically stated that the disclosures should be the same for both categories. 45 Most industry members supported a ``bifurcated'' approach to labeling (discussed in detail below), with a requirement for detailed disclosures of performance characteristics on packaging for general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps and a requirement for disclosure of only an encircled ``E'' on packaging for general service incandescent reflector lamps and general service fluorescent lamps. 46 Several other comments, however, favored requiring the same detailed disclosures of performance characteristics on the packaging of all the lamp types covered by the labeling rules. 47 44 GE, G&hyph;2, 4&hyph;5, (Tr.), 106; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 10&hyph;11; Osram, G&hyph;4, 2; IES (Tr.), 62; MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 1; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 1. 45 See 58 FR at 60158.

Two of the three categories of lamps covered by the labeling rules have medium size, screw-in bases that fit into standard screw-in lamp receptacles. 48 These are: General service incandescent (reflector and nonreflector) lamps, and medium base compact fluorescent lamps. The method of connection to the power source is the same for these types of lamps, and the Commission is prescribing similar labeling requirements for them. The Commission discusses the comments on the proposals for general service incandescent (nonreflector) lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps and the labeling rule requirements for them together in Part IV.C, below. The Commission discusses the comments on, and the requirements for, general service incandescent reflector lamps in Part IV.D, below. The comments and final requirements respecting the fourth type of lamp_general service fluorescent lamps_are described in Part IV.E, below. 48 The third category, general service fluorescent lamps, are not screwed into lamp receptacles, but have prongs at either end of the lamp tube or receptacles for prongs that are at either end of the lamp fixture. C. Disclosures for Medium Base General Service Incandescent (Nonreflector) Lamps and Compact Fluorescent Lamps Virtually all the comments recommended that the Commission require some version of the basic disclosures that the Commission proposed in the NPR for both general service incandescent (nonreflector) lamps and medium base compact fluorescent lamps. 49 The disclosures the Commission is requiring, each of which is discussed separately below, are: design voltage (if other than 120 volts), energy used (in terms of watts), light output (in average initial lumens), average laboratory life (in hours), number of items in the package (if more than one), and a supplemental disclosure, consisting of an advisory statement. 50 Because the comments usually discussed recommendations regarding the disclosures for these two types of medium screwbase lamps together, and because these lamps are generally interchangeable, the Commission discusses the comments and the final disclosure requirements for these types of medium screw base lamps together in this section. 49 58 FR at 60154&hyph;55. 50 See 16 CFR 305.11(e), 305.14(d) in Text of Amendments, below.
