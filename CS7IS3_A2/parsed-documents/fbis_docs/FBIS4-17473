Ukrainian Republican Party Chairman Mykhaylo Horyn said this at a news conference devoted to the results of the party's extraordinary congress. The Ukrainian Republican Party leader stressed that the elections should take place after a new Ukrainian constitution or a law on power is adopted. At the same time Mykhaylo Horyn emphasized that, as postponing the elections is problematical, the [party] congress gave the Ukrainian Republican Party leadership the right to take a stand on its attitude to contenders for the post of president of Ukraine.
