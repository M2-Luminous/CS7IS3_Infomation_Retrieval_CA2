Staroverov; place and date not given: "Sevastopol and the Fleet Are Indivisible"] [Text] [Staroverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, how do you assess the current situation in Sevastopol? [Semenov] The situation in the city remains very tense. First of all, this is explained by the still undetermined status of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol. A recent meeting between Russian and Ukrainian military delegations in our city devoted to the Black Sea Fleet issue did not produce any positive results. On the contrary, they were a step backward. The reason is that the Ukrainian side, in my mind, adopted a destructive position and, in fact, avoided the Moscow agreement on resolving the Black Sea Fleet issue step-by-step. Nevertheless, the signature of Ukrainian President Leonid M. Kravchuk is on this pact. Participants in the recent session of the Sevastopol City Executive Council have assessed the situation in the city. They have decisively denounced the discord in relations between the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the Black Sea Fleet. In our opinion, this situation was triggered by the indecisiveness and inconsistency of the moves by top leaders in Ukraine and Russia to resolve the Black Sea Fleet issue, and their ignoring of proposals from the Sevastopol City Council, the Crimean Supreme Soviet, and the Crimean president. [Statoverov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, you and Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov did not participate in this meeting between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations. [Semenov] To my regret, you are correct. Two seats at the negotiating table were reserved for us. However, Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy categorically opposed our participation in the talks. He explained his position by discussing purely military-technical issues. Of course, this was a lame excuse. [Statoverov] What was the real reason then? [Semenov] The negotiations reached a deadlock not on the issue of dividing ships but on the location of the base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian Navy. This directly addresses the core interests of all residents of Sevastopol and Crimea. The position of the Sevastopol City Council and me, as its chairman, is exact and explicit. We support the Russian and Ukrainian presidents' decision on the impossibility of the further joint stationing of two fleets at the same base and issuing a proposal to the Ukrainian Navy to move its headquarters and other facilities to places other than Sevastopol. Our position is clear: Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet are indivisible. For more than two centuries, they shared their history, traditions, and goals. [Statoverov] There is no more important issue for us, as Sevastopol residents, than the clarification of the status of our native city. On 26 June, when Ukrainian local administration elections are held, we will conduct a poll of our residents. The question will be as follows: Do you support the status of Sevastopol as the primary Black Sea base for Russia, as proceeding from the Russian-Ukrainian Protocol of 3 September 1993? The text of the Massandra pact will be printed on the back of the ballot paper. [Semenov] The location of the Russian Black Sea Fleet means the resolution of socioeconomic issues for residents of Sevastopol and Crimea... [Statoverov] Of course. Currently, we are witnessing a sharp drop in production. Many enterprises have no means even to pay wages to their workers. Hidden unemployment is growing. Currently, one in every three employed people is on unpaid leave or is working part-time. Regular lack of energy resources also adds to the overall social tension. Or, for example, the city budget. The total sum of our expenditures adopted by the Ukrainian Supreme Council stands only at 873 billion karbovanetses. We need an additional five or six such budgets to live at 1993 levels. Currently, our city cannot live at its own expense. At the same time, new prospects would open for us if the Russian Black Sea Fleet base was located in Sevastopol. This will provide us with guaranteed wages, resolve the issues of unemployment, housing construction, health care, and culture. Finally, this will have an impact on the development of the spiritual culture of society, bringing up the young generation on the heroic traditions of the Russian Fleet. This gives us the opportunity to establish direct economic relations between Sevastopol -- the chief Russian Black Sea Fleet base -- and Russian cities and regions. By the way, we have already established contacts with the Southern Rayon in Moscow and Krasnogvardeyskiy Rayon in St. Petersburg. [Semenov] Viktor Mikhaylovich, the second round of talks on the Black Sea Fleet have been scheduled. What would you wish its participants? [Statoverov] I would like that the Black Sea Fleet issue be resolved as soon as possible. I would emphasize one more idea: The definition of the status of Sevastopol is a prerogative of the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, however, I cannot agree that this issue can be resolved without the participation of the Crimean Supreme Soviet and president, as well as the Sevastopol City Council. The residents of Sevastopol hold out hope that common sense will prevail over political ambitions, and the negotiations will be held in the immediate future. I would like to finish our interview with words from the appeal issued by the Sevastopol City Council to the fraternal peoples of Russia and Ukraine: "The Black Sea Fleet should belong to Russia!" "The Black Sea Fleet Base should be located in Sevastopol!"
