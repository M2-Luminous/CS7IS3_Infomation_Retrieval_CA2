The second in command in the United States simply confirmed the overtures made by the former and current U.S. ambassadors to Argentina, Terence Todman and James Cheek respectively. There is a broad consensus of opinion in the country on the need for a new patents law to replace Act No. 111, enacted in 1864, which has been in effect without interruption since then. This act acknowledges inventors' rights, with the exception of pharmaceutical products. The growing globalization of the world economy over the last two decades has led the majority of countries to align their legislation, albeit differently, with the system that acknowledges that the holder of a patent has ample production and marketing rights for his or her invention. On the extremes of this controversy, it is argued, on the one hand, that the right of intellectual property constitutes the hub of a free society and that the right to capitalize on the profitability of an invention is the best stimulus for doing research. On the other hand, it is affirmed that besides all the risks that every monopoly entails, patents should not be applicable to pharmaceutical products -- as a superior good, like public health, is at stake here -- because otherwise their prices will inexorably go up. To this one should add arguments aimed at protecting the domestic industry in this area. The executive branch sent a bill to the Senate on patents and royalties [modelos de utilidad], which is under discussion in the upper chamber together with the bills that Senators Ricardo Lafferriere [Radical Civic Union-Entre Rios Province], Gabriel Romero Feris [Corrientes Autonomist Party-Corrientes Province], and Federico Storani [Radical Civic Union-Cordoba Province] submitted on that subject. It is my considered opinion that the new law ought to acknowledge the right of the patent holder, including those applied for pharmaceutical products, thus leaving behind a legislation enacted 130 years ago. Clear limits should be established so as to stave off the possibility of the inventor having monopolistic control. In my view, the law ought to establish the principle of granting licenses without authorization by the patent holder in exchange for acknowledging an economic value in favor of the inventor, estimated at a fixed percentage of the selling price of the product. (Royalty which should be approximately 5 percent of the final consumer price.) Obviously, the state must play the undelegated role of being in charge of quality control during production and continue monitoring it until the product is marketed. Once this law is enacted, there should be a transition period after which the law will be fully effective and will cover pharmaceutical products, like the case in practically all the countries that passed similar laws. This will enable the gradual accommodation of the national industry to new market conditions once the new legislation comes into force. In order to do so, one has to bear in mind the degree of development of the pharmaceutical industry, which covers 60 percent of the domestic demand and exports significant volumes. The new legal text ought to stipulate that the law is not to be retroactive. The products that are already on the market will therefore be outside the scope of this new law. This brief presentation includes the necessary elements to draft the new law. The rights of the patent holder are acknowledged; the holder will receive a return that is proportional to the degree of market penetration of his product; the risk of monopolies is eliminated; the medicines supply is guaranteed; the possibility of excessive markups is ruled out; and Argentine laboratories are given the possibility of adapting themselves to future competitive conditions on the market. It is inexplicable that there should be those who suggest that this law can be enacted in the forthcoming weeks. Argentina signed, together with another 116 countries including the United States, the final act of the Uruguay Round of GATT in Geneva last 15 December, after seven years of negotiations. This act devotes a specific chapter to patents. The final regulation of this issue will be made public in Morocco in April. The agreement establishes that when signatory countries introduce new legislation on patents, they must include an acknowledgement of the inventor's rights and may institute antimonopolistic mechanisms through mandatory licenses. The agreement, moreover, enables governments to establish a transition period that may extend up to 10 years and declare that the legislation not be retroactive for products that are protected by patent. In sum, it leaves a lot of leeway for drafting a law like the one that was previously put together. Therefore, it is by no means opportune for Congress to pass a new law on patents without first having ratified the GATT agreement. This, however, does not prevent Senate committees from approving their respective reports. The country will surely have a new law on industrial patents once both chambers of Congress conclude their work and the GATT agreement is ratified. All this should be done within the framework of the total independence the legislative branch enjoys in decisionmaking in any republican system.
