Zagreb--On Thursday, the government's Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees sent a letter to foreign embassies in the Republic of Croatia and to the media repeating the warning that it is at the limit of its abilities in caring for all the refugees, especially those who continue to arrive. "Once again we call on all international bodies, governments and government bodies, and the international political community to halt ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to help the Croatian state to care adequately for the approximately half a million displaced persons and refugees," the letter states. The letter recalls that two weeks ago the office similarly warned of an intensification and continuation of quiet ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia, which the Serb authorities have been conducting for two years now, but which they have been intensifying in recent months. "We were prompted to send out this letter," it goes on, "by the increasingly frequent and ever-larger convoys with new refugees of non-Serb nationality from Banja Luka, Prijedor, Kotor Varos, Prnjavor, and Derventa, who seek refuge from violence in Croatia." The latest such convoy, which arrived in Croatia with 600 new Muslim and Croat refugees on Tuesday, 31 May through the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] checkpoint at Dragalic near Nova Gradiska, motivated the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees to "warn about the same problem for the umpteenth time--ethnic cleansing in western Bosnia and the arrival of an increasing number of refugees in Croatia, and the inability of Croatia to care for all these people under current conditions." "Especially worrisome is the fact that this convoy was again organized by the Serb authorities in Bosnia, through their Serbian Red Cross, literally deporting these people," the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees emphasizes. The letter also alleges that some of the people on the convoy had entry or transit permits for Croatia, but that there are indications that some of those permits were forged. The majority of the people arrived with only a little clothing, and around 200 of them sought assistance from the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees the very next day. "On Wednesday and Thursday, they were assigned mostly to the Gasinci refugee center near Djakovo, which meant that we were forced to overfill the already inadequate living quarters. We must note that neither the office nor any international body knew about the arrival of this convoy," the letter emphasizes. "Based on the number of new refugees, the latest convoy is an indication that the arrival of the remaining Croats and Muslims from that part of Bosnia can be expected shortly. That would complete the ethnic cleansing of western Bosnia, and Croatia would be inundated with new refugees," according to the assessment of the Office for Displaced Persons and Refugees. The office again warned that there are no new structures for organized housing and that the only solution is to house them in structures that are already overcrowded. In addition, an increasing number of hitherto privately housed displaced persons and refugees--of whom there are around 400,000--are seeking organized housing.
