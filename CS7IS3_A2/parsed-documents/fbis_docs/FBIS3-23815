They have been limited here, however, to a reprint of Tim Kelsey's article "British Mercenaries in the Azerbaijan War" in the newspaper THE INDEPENDENT. Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent became aware of additional facts. In conversation with the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, Thomas Yang, Great Britain's ambassador to Baku, denied any military contacts whatsoever between the United Kingdom and Azerbaijan. It is known, however, that Thomas Yang was present at talks between British officials and the Azerbaijan military. Major Steven Harrison, military attache of Great Britain in Russia and simultaneously the acting chief military representative in embassies of the United Kingdom in several republics of the former USSR, met several times in December 1993 with Azerbaijan's Minister of Defense Mammedrafi Mamedov. Harrison confirmed to OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's correspondent the existence of plans for participation by the British military in the Karabakh conflict, but refused to provide any more detailed commentary. British official circles are closing their eyes to attempts of businessmen behind the scenes to arrange arms shipments to Azerbaijan and provide highly qualified military specialists to the national army. The British Foreign Office admits to the existence of plans to send mercenaries to Azerbaijan from Foggy Albion but vehemently denies participation in any dealing. As Mrs. MacFail, press secretary of the British mission in Moscow, stated to the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent, the British Government may not hinder mercenaries from traveling to Azerbaijan insofar as freedom of movement is a high-priority right of British citizens. Acting as intermediaries between the Azerbaijan military department and British "wild geese"--who are supposed to be in Azerbaijan in the near future and participate in the Armenia-Azerbaijan war on the side of Baku--are British and Turkish businessmen. A key role is being played by 68-year-old Lord Erskine of Rarrick, who resides in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Lord Erskine is entered on diplomatic listings of the British Foreign Office as a first secretary. For his intermediary services Erskine receives many millions in honoraria from the Cyprus firm, Summit Ltd., registered in Great Britain. This consortium has already facilitated the acquisition of British and American arms by the Azerbaijan defense department in circumvention of the existing UN embargo on arms shipments into the zone of the Karabakh conflict. A certain Mustafa Mutlu is working together with Erskine, supporting contacts in Baku on the governmental level. Our OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from trustworthy sources in Azerbaijan that that country's leadership is also supporting close contacts with American military circles. According to unconfirmed sources, the first party of American advisers is already on location in Azerbaijan. The activity of Western businessmen striving to influence the outcome of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan can be explained by the fact that large-scale oil deposits have been discovered on the Caspian shelf along the coast of Azerbaijan. This is also attracting giants of the oil business to the region--British Petroleum, Amoco, Pennzoil, and others. The consortium which has been formed will soon begin the development of off-shore oil fields. Neither Azerbaijan nor its neighbor Russia has the appropriate technologies which would enable independent extraction of this oil, and the problem of transportation of crude oil has still not been resolved. One plan calls for the passage of a pipeline across Turkish territory to the Mediterranean coast. A new oil refinery is already being built in Izmir. Thus Azerbaijan could soon enter the world market with respect to the black gold. However, during the visit of Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller to Moscow in November 1993, the Russian side proposed its own version--laying the pipeline across Russian territory to the shores of the Black Sea. In rendering assistance to Azerbaijan, the West is making the outcome of the war independent of Russian military assistance to the sides in conflict. It is easy to predict what will follow: Baku will be inclined to make a decision that removes Russia from participation in the oil project of the century.
