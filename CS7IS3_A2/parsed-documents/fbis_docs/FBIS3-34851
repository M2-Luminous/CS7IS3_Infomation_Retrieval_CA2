The Islamic State of Afghanistan, as the center of the gathering of real mojahedin, is defending the results of the jihad. And the mojahedin continue to sacrifice themselves in continuing their holy jihad to eliminate the last remnants of the foreigners' hirelings like the infamous Karmal-Dostam group. But Golboddin Hekmatyar, the known wheeler-dealer of the period of jihad, has, in alliance with Parcham and Khalq, the two factions of the Communist Party, started a rebellion against the mojahedin of Afghanistan and the Islamic State. Golboddin, on the one hand by his coalition with the so-called National Movement, which is headed by nation-seller Karmal, has embarked on the killing of the people of Kabul. On the other hand with the atheist Tanay [exiled former defense minister under Najibollah] he gathered around him the band of Khalqis and instructed him to embark on the establishment of the so-called peace movement outside Afghanistan. It is not without a reason that at the time of the attack by Karmal-Golboddin-Dostam and on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan, once again the communist Shahnawaz Tanay raises his voice, and in cooperation with Golboddin he expresses his opposition to all jihadi leaders and Afghan mojahedin. This shows that to reach his sinister goals, Golboddin is serving as an instrument for the reunion of Khalqis and Parchamis. But for the mojahedin the fifth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet occupier from Afghanistan serves as a strong motive for the consolidation of the jihad's trenches against the defeated communists of Khalq and Parcham and their ill-nature. The heroic affirmative response of all jihadi organizations to the holy jihad against the Karmal-Dostam militia reflects this fact. The situation of the country and the coordination of the jihadi organizations to crush the Karmal-Dostum militia show that the mojahed Afghan nation is determined to completely eliminate from the Islamic State the twin movements of Tanay and Dostam on the sixth anniversary of the escape of the Soviet forces. And Golboddin who against the wishes of all mojahedin of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party] has formed an unholy alliance with them will not have a better fate than them.
