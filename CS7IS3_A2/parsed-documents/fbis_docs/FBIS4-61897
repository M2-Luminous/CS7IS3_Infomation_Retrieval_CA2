The bill, which Kama said needs taking back as immature, is aimed toward establishing rules for the legal prosecution of activists of serial executions and mass deportations carried out in Estonia after the Soviet takeover in 1940, during World War II and the following almost decade of violent suppression by Stalin's regime. The legislation was submitted by the parliamentary commission for investigation into the activities of the KGB and other foreign secret services in Estonia. Kama said the parliamentary commission had submitted a "raw version" of the Justice Ministry's bill which the ministry had just turned over to other departments for coordination. Although Estonia has joined the respective international conventions, it so far lacks legislation of its own to allow to start criminal proceedings against persons suspected of such crimes, the minister said. The bill is now expected to be discussed by the legislative body as early as this week. MP [member of parliament] Enn Tarto, a former political prisoner who heads the parliament's KGB commission, has told reporters his commission has got evidence against a number of persons who could be convicted for war crimes. "We have turned over to the State Prosecutor's Office materials and documents about persons who organized and carried out the June 13 and July 1-4, 1941, and March 25-28, 1945, mass deportations and the 1951 deportation of members of non-majority Christian denominations," Tarto said. "The prosecutor's office turned these materials over to the Defense Police, who refused to start a criminal case. Now the materials have been sent back to the State Prosecutor's Office and the whole case hangs in the air," he added.
