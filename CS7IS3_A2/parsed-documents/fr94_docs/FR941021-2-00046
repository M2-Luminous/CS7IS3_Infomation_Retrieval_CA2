FR941021-2-00046 FR941021-2-00036 Implementation of Special Refund Procedures AGENCY: Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy ACTION: Notice of Implementation of Special Refund Procedures SUMMARY: The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) announces the procedures for disbursement of the total amount of $2,226,782.70 in crude oil overcharges obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order that Mt. Airy Refining Company (Mt. Airy) and its former shareholders, William P. Boswell, W. Luke Boswell, Lindsay B. McLean, David P. Boswell, P. Wilson Boswell II and Ellen W. Boswell, entered into with DOE on November 14, 1990. Case No. LEF&hyph;0121. OHA has determined that the funds will be distributed in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Thomas L. Wieker, Deputy Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals, 1000 Independence Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20585, (202) 586&hyph;2400. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(c), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Decision and Order set out below. The Decision sets forth the procedures that DOE has formulated to distribute the total amount of $2,226,782.70 obtained under the terms of a Consent Order that DOE entered into with Mt. Airy Refining Company and its former shareholders on November 14, 1990. The Consent Order settles claims by DOE that Mt. Airy had violated reporting provisions of the Mandatory Petroleum Allocation Regulations and the Administrative Procedures and Sanctions Regulations with regard to its sale of crude oil. OHA will distribute the Mt. Airy Consent Order funds in accordance with DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases (the MSRP). 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the Federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states are distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers are based on the total volume of petroleum products purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury. Because the June 30, 1994, deadline for crude oil refund applications has passed, no new applications from purchasers of refined petroleum products will be accepted for these funds. Instead, the share allocated to these purchasers will be added to the general crude oil overcharge pool used for direct restitution. Dated: October 14, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
