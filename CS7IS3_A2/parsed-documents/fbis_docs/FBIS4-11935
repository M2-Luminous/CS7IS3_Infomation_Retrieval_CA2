The broadcast, monitored here, said the attack came on the eve of a planned visit by a special United Nations peace mission led by Mahmoud Mestiri. The UN team is to leave Islamabad for Kabul Saturday for talks with Rabbani, his rival, Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, and other factional leaders to explore ways of ending 13 weeks of fighting for control of Kabul. The radio, controlled by Rabbani loyalists, blamed the attack on Hekmatyar and his military ally, Abdoul Rashid Dostam, leader of the Uzbek militia, and said it came despite their pledge to hold a temporary ceasefire from dawn Friday to facilitate the UN visit. The radio said people were killed and wounded but it gave no figures. No confirmation was immediately available from the rival side.
