Akashi also announced meetings with the Moslem-Croat delegation and with Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic on Wednesday. This means that a plenary session will again not be held on Wednesday, in all probability. Akashi confirmed to reporters that Bosnian Serbs had accepted a four-month ceasefire as proposed in a declaration adopted by the contact group for Bosnia-Herzegovina in Geneva on May 13. The latest Moslem proposal for a ceasefire is four weeks plus four weeks, Akashi said, but did not elaborate on the stand of the U.N., which is the mediator in the peace talks, regarding these proposals.
