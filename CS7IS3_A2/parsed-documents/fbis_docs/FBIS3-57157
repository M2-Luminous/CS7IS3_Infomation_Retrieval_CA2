The two experts spoke of not wanting to help the Russian government further because "the Prime Minister-declared aims are entirely out of line with our personal views." They fear that with the arrival of the new Russian government, the situation will exacerbate following further inflation, already among the world's highest. Pointing to austerity measures carried out by Estonia, Latvia and Poland, which succeeded in curbing inflation, Oslund and Sachs expressed the hope for a successful reform in Russia. They also spoke of wanting to work on a personal basis with reform supporters and a new generation of Russian pro-market economists. To avoid a diversion from the course of reforms, the new government ought to include competent people not lobbyists such as Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Oslund told Interfax. Oslund and Sachs have worked for the Russian government since 1991.
