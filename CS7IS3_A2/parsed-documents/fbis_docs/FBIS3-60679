NODONG SINMUN today says that his utterances soon after he got into office revealed his true color as the same warhawk as his predecessor Keisuke Nakanishi and his anti-DPRK attitude. The news analyst says: As far as the socalled ``nuclear issue'' of the DPRK is concerned, it is not a problem into which the Japanese reactionaries are not supposed at should poke their nose. [sentence as received] The nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula must be solved through negotiation between the United States, the party responsible for it, and the DPRK. Lurking behind Japan's imprudent fuss is a sinister intention to use the fiction of ``nuclear threat'' from the DPRK as a pretext for its own nuclear armament and a shield to divert elsewhere the arrow of international criticism of its nuclear armament. The ``missile issue'' of the DPRK over which Aichi raised an outcry presents no problem at all. It is entirely natural that we should take a self-defensive measure when the situation on the Korean peninsula has been strained and brought to the brink of war by the hostile forces. It is self-evident that this poses no ``threat'' to Japan and cannot be decried. Japan, however, has decided to develop a missile defence system jointly with the United States with a shrill cry over the ``missile issue'' of the DPRK, as if something big had happened, and is intensifying arms buildup more openly. We will never tolerate this.
