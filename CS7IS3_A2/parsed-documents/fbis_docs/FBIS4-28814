"Prime Minister Hata is considering putting an end to a fray to alleviate all the troubles (surrounding Japan's war reparation) by taking the opportunity on the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II," the official said on condition of anonymity. Hata plans to resolve controversies involving redress for former "comfort women," who were forced into prostitution by Japan's Imperial Army before and during World War II, and Japan's confiscation of postal savings of Taiwanese citizens then under Japanese rule, he said. Unpaid money that includes the postal savings deposited by Taiwanese before and during World War II total 452.4 million yen, according to a government estimate. In a related development, Hata became the first Japanese prime minister to meet with Korean and Philippine comfort women Thursday [9 June]. The unofficial meeting was arranged in a Diet corridor. Hata also wants to arrange for a Diet resolution that Japan will not invade other countries again and for various official projects and ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary, he said. However, Japan remains reluctant to make any individual reparation payments or to take "actions that could be a substitute for the reparation," the official said.
