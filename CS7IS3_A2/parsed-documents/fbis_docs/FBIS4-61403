This decision was adopted at the prime minister's meeting with a large group of editors of national and regional newspapers. It was also determined at the meeting that the distribution of the resources allocated by the state will be carried out by a public council made up of leaders of central and local media under the Russian Federation Committee on the Press. During the meeting there was a thorough discussion of the situation and problems of the central and regional press and the need for financial support for the majority of publications, especially in economically weak regions. The basic provisions of a draft Russian Federation law on state support for the mass media were also discussed. Viktor Chernomyrdin briefed the chief editors in detail on the situation in the national economy and the government's economic policy. In the course of the discussion the chief editors received the maximum information necessary to them not only for their daily work, but for an unbiased view of the state of affairs in the country. This gives them the opportunity to look more critically at the established view that the government supposedly lacks understanding of the problems of the press. The government regards the press not only as the "Fourth Estate," but as the "number one" sector, to whose situation it intends always to pay the keenest attention. Today we publish a transcript (abbreviated) of Government Chairman V.S. Chernomyrdin's concluding speech at the meeting with editors. [Chernomyrdin] So where are we now? That is almost a philosophical question. We are going through a difficult period in the economy. Throughout the year 1993 people were threatening us with all kinds of cataclysms, and they are threatening us now, trying to rock the boat at any price. I must say that this no longer works with the government. We do not do everything right, not everything works out for us, but I wish to say again that our government is now operating as a single organism, it has acquired the shape of the kind of government that the Russian state should have. That process -- I have never said this before -- took 18 months. And in very difficult conditions. You name it, we had it. But now, as long as people do not distract us and keep nudging us, and let us get on with our work, I have grounds for optimism. There is no vacillation in the government. That does not mean that everyone is living, so to speak, in perfect harmony, that it is all unanimous. I would not accept that situation, when one person says something and everyone else nods. We have been through that before, we have seen it before. On the contrary, this is a government in which every member has his own opinion, his own view of matters, these are people who are united by their concern for the state, people who understand what is required of them, what they must do, and how they should do it. The government apparatus, for all its shortcomings, is also beginning to gain strength and experience. I am sure, therefore, that the difficulties that have still to be overcome are within our government's power. A few words about economic affairs in general. The results give me no particular reason to boast or to reassure myself, or you. Because the situation is complex. The decline in production is continuing, and has not yet been stopped. That is our main affliction today. Questions of nonpayments are interwoven with these problems. In general, however, the financial system is beginning to stabilize. First and foremost, we have succeeded in curbing inflation. With the exception of January, we have reached a stable level and are maintaining it. Yet do you remember how people said that we could not do it, that we would not be able to? Anyone would think someone else was going to do it on our behalf. We are keeping and will keep inflation within the limits indicated in the government program in August 1993. We do not today set the goal of reducing inflation to zero. And we are criticized for that. I do not agree with this criticism. You could reduce inflation to zero quickly. If you stopped everything else: factories, plants, transport. That is intolerable! It simply means ruin for the country. It is no use pressing and squeezing so hard that all production processes stop completely. We are in a period in which it is necessary to keep a very sensitive finger on the pulse. It is well known that factories are coming to a halt and plants are stopping work. The worst thing is that enterprises are closing that should not be closing, enterprises the country needs, with modern technology and essential output. But there are others that not only should, but simply must be closed. We no longer need so much of what the defense industry produces. We make mines; for three years now no one has wanted them; yet the shoe factory next door is on the brink of stoppage. So what is more important to us today? We do not need all these mines, yet we make them, because those people would be out on the streets otherwise. And there are so many plants like that in Russia! They were intended for the entire Soviet Union, which, at the time, stood against the whole world. And today, Russia is suffering because of this. Here the time factor plays an enormous role in many ways. It took a year for the Omsk tank plant to start producing tractors, when they wanted to do it in three months. No way. It turns out that a tank is easier to make than a tractor for a farmer. They can't do it, they don't know how. The ones they did make might as well be made of gold. One defense plant, for instance, made a pumping jack -- not a single oilman wanted one. Because they made it to their own standards and put in components which made it three times the price of any imported model. Nobody bought them, and nobody will! The consumer does not want these jacks, and that means the country does not want them. It is madness to operate on the principle of "at any price." Those days are gone. But some managers have still not grasped that fact, they expect to beg or extort the money, they expect to be given money from the treasury. They will not get it! If they go on like that, what they will get is bankruptcy. Can we get by without bankruptcies? No. I would like to go into this particularly. Bankruptcy is being used deliberately to intimidate people. Who is intimidating them, and why? Who is trying to trivialize the matter and present it crudely -- the gates are locked and the workers are outside the gates? When an enterprise goes bankrupt, as a rule privileged conditions apply to it: It is exempted from taxes and dues, for a certain period it is, in effect, given financial support so that it can go over to a new form of production. We have many enterprises that were built many years ago and have already operated for 30-40 years. Some need knocking down completely and rebuilding from scratch, others need to replace their technology and equipment, others again should be combined with similar enterprises. There is opposition. Why? Because, with bankruptcy, there is, without fail, a change of management. And this instills such fear in the managers that they are prepared to goad their own people into opposition, as long as nothing is changed. Is a rescue service needed? Of course. And that means that funds for which provision is made in the budget will go to support those enterprises without which the national economy simply cannot function. We have some enterprises which are, so to speak, "one of a kind," which everyone needs. We incorporate special items in the budget for such enterprises, and there are funds which should work for their support. I am saying all this because, after all, we are not likely to be able to stop the decline in production this year. The rate of decline must be halted, the trend must be broken. So we will channel all our resources and reserves into this, both intellectual and material. What is the most important thing today? Investments. You could say that for two years we have all but stopped investing in the naational economy. And without that, we will never get anywhere. Hard as it may be, even if it means tightening our belts still further, investment processes must be revitalized. It is therefore important to get this across to people, to explain that Russia cannot survive without new, up-to-date technologies. To this day some enterprises are still working to fill the warehouses, and there are a good many of them. What is the investment process? It is not only capital investments, not merely increased production capacities, although that is sometimes necessary too. It is also the updating of the machine tool pool, of equipment and technologies, it is thorough processing of raw materials and other materials. It is output quality. And, of course, it is competitiveness on the world market. About rural problems. We are now making adjustments to the budget and increasing resources for the development of the agro-industrial complex, because there is no alternative. Things have always been difficult in the countryside, but today they are more difficult than ever. Therefore let us channel some of our resources -- even bypassing credits, that is, basically, giving interest-free subsidies -- into supporting the agrarian sphere at this stage. It is not enough to declare that we will not buy grain from the West, we still have to produce it ourselves. And not only grain. Therefore more attention must be paid to rural people. They cannot be made into scapegoats. It is too serious a matter. Often people try to blame everything on them, to argue that the agro-industrial complex is a bottomless pit in the national economy. But we were the ones who put them in that position. So let us rectify those conditions. A question that is of concern to everyone is -- where are we, in fact. As I understand it, and as calculations show, we have reached the low point in the crisis decline. But we can now feel the firm ground beneath our feet. Now we must find our balance correctly and use this ground as a jumping-off point so as to start to climb again. And we are capable of doing this, because even today Russia retains a very considerable potential. Even today it is by no means a poor country. We are gradually paying off our debts, for the second year now we are not asking anyone for anything, we just want Russia to enjoy conditions on the world market that are not humiliating, but equal, as for any other state. You remember, 24 billion [dollars] was mentioned, and then more than 40 billion.... We have not received much yet -- $3 billion. And we are going to receive 3 billion more. But these are all credits, this is not some kind of nonrepayable aid, it is debts which will have to be repaid. So this is not, so to speak, the secret of happiness. The main condition which we uphold everywhere is that we should not be kept in the lobby of the world market, like poor relations. We have something to offer in trade, we have competitive output. And this does not only mean raw materials! We have metal, metal products, machine tools, developments in space programs, in atomic power engineering, in nuclear matters, where we can compete. But we are being held back. They are still setting conditions, for instance, for us to enter the European Community, and that means that in effect they are discriminating against us. We can and should operate on equal terms, so as to pay our way and solve our own problems. And this would only make matters easier for our partners, too. Why am I saying this? We are not poor, and we produce quite a lot, even given this rate of decline. We are shutting down oil wells, but we have enough fuel. We could produce more output. But what are we to do with it? We could produce more metal, but we cannot sell it. We could offer a different fuel, nuclear fuel -- we just cannot produce as much as we could sell. We have to stop production units, and that means accelerating the recession. Military plants are closing down -- there are problems everywhere on the weapons market. They give us nice big smiles, but when it comes to the crunch, suddenly there are thousands of reasons for not allowing us access to the Western market. Now, about money. Say what you like, the ruble has held its ground. Maybe this is not so noticeable for us, but if you compare it with what is happening in the neighboring CIS countries, you can see that our tough line has produced and is producing results. People are no longer running away from the ruble. For the first time we have seen from State Committee for Statistics figures and from bank statistics that people have started accumulating rubles, saving them. I have explained this before, maybe I am repeating myself. You could relax the financial pressure, ease up on the monetary and credit policy, print more money, add to the enterprises' circulating capital, and settle accounts, but then we will once again be presenting an intoxicating picture of running on the spot, supporting everyone indiscriminately. And we do not want all that! We do not want a feeble and mediocre country -- that is what some people refuse to understand, as they try to push us back into the old quagmire of universal parasitism and lack of responsibility. Of course Russia should have an effective defense complex, it should have a modern industry up to world standards, producing output that is competitive on any market. Russia cannot, by virtue of its history and its very nature, be an underdeveloped country willing to be fed by others. Therefore we can no longer have a feeble policy: that of giving to everyone and supporting everyone. But it is not enough simply to understand that, it must be brought home to people, explained to them. Maybe we do not talk about this enough, but it is the main issue today. Here the role and position of the press is particularly important. You journalists, better than anyone else, understand and feel the country's pulse, the people's mood. Try to explain what is most important -- we must all unite. I think the Treaty on Social Accord will take effect, but much will still have to be done for the accord to be realized, for it not to remain only on paper. The country must unite and achieve accord. It is not discord we need now, but cohesion. A problem of statewide significance is the struggle against crime. The federal program on this topic, which was recently approved by the president, must be fulfilled. We are trying to provide everything that the program stipulates in the budget. And we must give the maximum, because the people no longer understand us. The fact that you cannot walk the streets, that you cannot travel by train, that you cannot go on the subway -- this is simply impermissible. The state's role here is paramount. Of course, it is not all just up to the law enforcement organs. This is a scourge that we must all deal with together, and the press too must play a more active part. Much depends on you. It is no use shying away from it now, a lack of restraint in the press and permissiveness in life cannot be tolerated. You must criticize, you must argue, but you must not insult or offend people just for fun, for the sake of a fine turn of phrase. This annoys people and tears society apart. Sometimes you read things and wonder: Is nothing sacred any more? Anyone would think we were not living in the same country. This is what must be left behind, you can do it, you know how. I think all you have to do is try. The government will meet with media workers and leaders -- I promise you that. You must know more, you must have the information. You must see how the government operates, so that you can put us straight when necessary. You can do that too, you know how. Of course it is upsetting to see needy people, the plight of pensioners and war veterans is distressing. But we will support the veterans and the low-paid, we will pull up the living standards of the needy. This is not unfounded populism. Our rate of income is already above the rate of inflation. Today we are beginning here to break the negative trends that characterized the country's development over the last two or three years. And we will break them, but it needs patience, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the children, so that they do not find themselves in a humiliating position. Hard times have fallen to our lot, we must bear it and we must respond. Let us grit our teeth, and things will be easier for all the people. And we will come through. We cannot fail to come through. We do not have the right. And I will not accept any other viewpoint today.
