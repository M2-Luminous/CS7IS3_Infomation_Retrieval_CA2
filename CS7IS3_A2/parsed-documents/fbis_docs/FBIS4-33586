During the ceremony, the Army promoted 140 new officers. Gaviria said in his speech "this ceremony holds a special meaning for me, as it is the last chance I will have to address you and share a moment such as this. Through the School for Cadets we honor the Armed Forces as the guardians of democracy and human rights." The president briefly summarized the government's strategy for strengthening the public forces and justice system. He said new recourses, such as the new constitutional guarantee procedure [tutela] and others recently put into effect by the Prosecutor General's Office and the People's Prosecutor [Defensoria del Pueblo] demonstrate the government's pro-human rights efforts. "Application of international humanitarian law, as expressed specifically in the Constitution, and the country's resulting obligation to abide by such laws are other encouraging signs in the quest for respect for human rights." Gaviria said the two stages of the government's national strategy against violence have sought to strengthen justice, fight impunity, and pave the way for democratic participation. "Of course, the high crime rate," Gaviria said, "the degree of impunity, and the current level of poverty are factors that worry the community in general, especially the government." The president concluded by praising the Armed Forces and their individual commanders for their work during the elections on 29 May.
