Victor Nataniel Narciso, vice president of the association of former Angolan students in Cuba, has urged the United States to lift the economic and commercial blockade imposed on the island for more than three decades. He said this blockade is the main cause of the complex economic situation in Cuba. A baseball game was played yesterday as part of the celebration, between members of the Cuban diplomatic mission and members of the Angolan association. This game is considered historical as the first match of this nature played in Angola.
