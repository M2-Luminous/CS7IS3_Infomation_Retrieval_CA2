The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said its estimate showed that the price of rice purchased by the government from growers was 15 times higher than that of rice imported from Thailand, compared with 11 times in the preceding year. The calculation was made at the yen's average exchange rate against the dollar for the first nine months of 1993 of 112.22 yen per dollar, up 14.43 yen over the year before, the ministry said. The ministry said the government's purchase price of domestic rice in 1993 was unchanged from the year before at about 210,000 yen per ton, compared with about 14,000 yen for Thai rice, down 5,000 yen from the preceding year, and about 26,000 yen for U.S. rice, down 4,000 yen. At the retail level, the average price of domestic rice for the January-October period of 1993 stood at 384 yen per kilogram, up 10 yen over the year before due to a poor harvest. In the same period, the ministry said, the retail price of Thai rice dropped 9 yen from the year before to 48 yen per kilogram while that of U.S. rice was down 19 yen at 128 yen.
