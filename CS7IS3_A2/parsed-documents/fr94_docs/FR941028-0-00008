FR941028-0-00008 FR941028-0-00003 Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. §39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;20&hyph;07␣PTC Aerospace: Amendment 39&hyph;9035. Docket 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;12. Applicability: PTC Aerospace Model 91700 passenger oxygen system, installed in PTC Aerospace Model 881, 940, and 950 seats, installed on McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;10 series aircraft. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the passenger oxygen system to activate, accomplish the following: (a) Within 15 months after the effective date of this AD, or the next seat removal, whichever occurs first, verify the proper configuration and functioning of the passenger oxygen system in accordance with PTC Aerospace Service Bulletin No. 25&hyph;1233, Revision E, dated April 15, 1994, as follows: (1) Remove the seat bottom cushion and open the oxygen housing assembly door, Part Number (P/N) 91626, to expose the oxygen canister and lower firing system. On the Model 950 seats, remove fastening screws of the center console, P/N 98154, and rotate the console forward in addition to removing the cushion. (2) Install an oxygen canister safety cap, Tri-Star P/N CD3, or Scott P/N 36425, to prevent discharging of the oxygen canister. (3) Remove the cable release assembly, P/N 91601. Verify that the assembly is the correct length (10.25 inches plus or minus .25 inch), that the release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, is free of burrs and notches, and that the nylon cord is not worn and is free of any burn damage. If any discrepancies are found, replace with a serviceable unit. (4) Verify installation of the correct pin release bracket, P/N 91602&hyph;1. A correct bracket has its plastic grommet located vertically above the oxygen canister release sleeve. If the bracket is found to be misaligned, replace it with a correct bracket. Replace the white plastic grommet with a new black plastic grommet, P/N 122326, securing it with Devo 44044 cyanoacrylate adhesive or equivalent. The grommet is correctly positioned when the grommet slot is aligned with the pin release bracket slot. (5) Reassemble the cable release assembly with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Adjust and tighten the jam nuts, P/N H12292, to obtain a gap between the cable actuating lever, P/N 91599&hyph;1 or ^2, and cable actuating lever stop, P/N 87310&hyph;3, within .03 inch and .25 inch. Verify that the nylon cord will not contact the oxygen canister in the assembled configuration and that the cable release pin will release from the oxygen canister with a tension of one pound or less. If any discrepancies are found, replace the cable release assembly with a serviceable unit. (6) Remove the oxygen masks from the seat back housing. Compress the actuator assembly spring, P/N H13341, and install a bushing, P/N 121836&hyph;1, oriented so that the spring seats in the bushing's counterbore. (7) Reassemble the oxygen system components with the safety cap on the oxygen canister. Verify that the oxygen system functions properly by verifying that the lanyard assembly release pin, P/N 91587&hyph;1, releases from the oxygen canister when the masks are pulled from the seat back housing. If any discrepancies are found, replace the oxygen system with a serviceable unit. (b) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Boston Aircraft Certification Office.
