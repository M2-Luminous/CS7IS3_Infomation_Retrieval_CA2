FBIS4-16474 "drsov074_c_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-074 Daily Report 17 Apr 1994 Federal Assembly Isakov Confident on Endorsement Isakov Confident on Endorsement LD1704141394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1230 GMT 17 Apr 94 LD1704141394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] The Chairman of the State Duma's committee on legislation and legal reform Vladimir Isakov (Agrarian faction) told Interfax the Duma would be sure to endorse a draft bill on the compulsory ratification of plans to enter NATO's Partnership for Peace [PFP] program. Last week Isakov, who authored the draft bill, found that the Russian constitution allowed the State Duma to map out Russia's line in international affairs. Earlier, only the president was privileged to plan foreign policy moves. On behalf of his faction Isakov came out with two foreign policy bills -- on the ratification of plans to join the Partnership for Peace program and on the lifting of economic sanctions against Serbia. Isakov told Interfax that practically no factions and groups in the State Duma opposed the idea of compulsory ratification. Even the Russia's Choice faction, which integrated, among others, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, saw the pro's and contra's of the Russian integration into the program and was willing to play the NATO card in its own interests. The endorsement of a foreign policy bill would set a serious precedent and that was what put the reformist factions Russia's Choice and Yabloko on the alert. Nonetheless, Isakov hoped the national interests would prevail. So far, Isakov said, the President and his Foreign Minister saw the parliament's role in foreign policy-making as insignificant. The bombing raid on Serb positions in Bosnia, rather than the political lineup in Russia, motivated the decision to put off plans to join the NATO program. Isakov saw the attack on Serb positions as a blow on Yeltsin, Kozyrev and the whole of Russia.
