The newspapers also highlight President Yeltsin's visit to Germany which begins today. "Russia and Germany are entering a new phase in relations," according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "No Russian soldiers will remain stationed in Germany as of this year. Their send-off will be an event of great importance both for Germany and for Russia. The format of the ceremony will be in the focus of talks between Yeltsin and Kohl. The Weimar Syndrome, for which Russia is often being rebuked because of its reluctance to agree to a farewell ceremony in the city of Goethe and Schiller, is not likely to be broached during the talks," the newspaper says. The newspaper predicts success to the Russian president's visit and points out that even "the unpleasant point related to restitution is unlikely to overcloud the talks". PRAVDA ventures in this respect that "Kohl and Yeltsin during their meeting in Bonn are to take the final decision on the ceremony of withdrawal of the Russian troops. Of course, the United States, Britain and France are Germany's long-standing NATO partners, who, following the blockade of 1948-1949 and the building of the Berlin wall, became "Berlin's defenders" against the communist menace". But the question now is about summing up the final results of the war, in which these three powers were Russia's allies, and not about Germany's gratitude to the Americans and the British for the airlifts of food to West Berlin". As concerns the possible return to Germany of the collection of the Gotha Library, PRAVDA says "the most important thing in this respect is the creation of a precedent. It is not really important what Russia is going to give away this time -- a royal collection, a collection of paintings or the Kuril Islands. As soon as precedent is there, new and unpredictable claims may arise, just as several countries are already claiming the famous "Schliemann's gold". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a headline "Russian Have Armed the Yemenis to the Teeth and Are Now Washing Their Hands" under which it analyses the causes of the civil war in that country. The hand of Moscow, or rather its absence, pushed Yemen to its present political and economic crisis. When it abandon Yemen after pumping hundreds of millions of dollars in it, the Kremlin decided that Russia does not have any special interests in the south Arabian Peninsula". The newspaper stresses that "it is now clear that no peace can be established but through a political dialogue. Even if the northerners capture the main strategic targets, the southerners will probably retreat to the desert or the mountains, and the war, judging from the country's history, might continue for decades". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) comments on the same and adds that "unfortunately, there is little hope for a prompt ending to the military actions". "Both the south and the north are swamped with guns, which number at least 30 million pieces," the newspaper says. "The heavy guns were delivered in plenty by the former Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. Both the southerners and the northerners know how to use these guns as may of them were trained in Russian military schools and academies". ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an analysis of the situation before the Russian-Chechen negotiations. According to Russian Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray, the negotiations will begin quite soon. The delegation from the Russian Federation has worked out a position of its own and is ready to get down to work," ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI announces. RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is critical of the past and the future of privatisation in the country. "It is now obvious that not only the disabled but also able-bodied Russians have a chance of joining in the process of redistribution of property," the newspaper writes. "The continuing impoverishment of the population and the devaluation of labour in recent months have finally undercut any possibility for wage-labourers to participate in the division of property". TRUD publishes an interview with State Duma deputies Mikhail Mityukov and Vladimir Isakov about the law-making process in the lower chamber of the Russian parliament.
