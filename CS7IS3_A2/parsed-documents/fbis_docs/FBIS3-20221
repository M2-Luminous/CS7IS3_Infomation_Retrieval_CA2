The prime minister made it absolutely clear that Greece considers Cyrus Vance's mission to be particularly significant and has submitted its well-known and specific proposals within this framework. The prime minister also noted the special responsibility of the EU and its members not to encourage [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's intransigence directly or indirectly. He said there is obviously no legal approach on the issue within the framework of the Maastricht Treaty and in no case would it downgrade the political aspect of the issue which is connected to the country's security and stability in the greater region. The spokesman's statement concludes: The political dimension of the issue constitutes an adequate legal basis for the Greek measures against Skopje both at an international and community law level.
