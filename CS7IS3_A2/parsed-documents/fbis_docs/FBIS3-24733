Mr Mlambo was speaking in Transkei, where he was trying to defuse dissatisfaction of some PAC leaders and members over the announcement of the suspension of the organisation's armed struggle. SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio news quoted Mr Mlambo as saying the PAC's policy until now had been that the bullet would not be abandoned before the ballot was secured. Three PAC members, including Publicity and Information Secretary Waters Toboti, remain suspended after voicing disagreement over the suspension of the armed struggle.
