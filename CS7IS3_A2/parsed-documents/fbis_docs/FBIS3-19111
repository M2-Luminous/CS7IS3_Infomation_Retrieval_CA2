In the statement Berlusconi will insist that the charges levelled against Pubitalia are nothing more than "a house of cards. There are no skeletons in our closet," he quipped this evening. "At the most one might find a couple of crutches," he continued. Then, getting more serious, Berlusconi said that the rules must apply to all, and that that went for public ministers as well, "who should respect these rules even more than the others." Six persons, including the chairman and two managers of Publitalia, were reported by a Berlusconi channel Wednesday as being the objects of preventive detention requests in a case of alleged false invoices to cover a 6.5 billion lire kickback in the world record transfer of soccer star Gianluigi Lentini for an official 18 billion lire from Torino to AC Milan 18 months ago. Revealing the names of Publitalia chairman Marcello Dell'Utri, Publitalia managers Valerio Gerardelli and Romano Luzzi, and "three external managers, a husband and wife named Onorabile and a certain Lecci," the flagship Fininvest Canale 5 news [TG5] admitted that it was "probably breaking the law" but stressed its intention was not to alert the named persons to take flight. "An unprecedented political attack...old and absolutely risible cases that could be cleared up in five minutes but are turned by the media into a looming dragnet," was the immediate comment of Berlusconi, the Fininvest owner, who stepped down from the helm of his media-to-retail empire when he took the political field with his Forza Italia (Go Italy) movement to beat the left in the March 27-28 elections. At a press conference today Berlusconi claimed that within the Clean Hands pool of magistrates there were those who sought justice and those who played politics. Meanwhile Justice Minister Giovanni Conso has opened an investigation into the leaking of the names of those Fininvest managers to be served warrants, names which were made public by TG5 before the preliminary judge in the case arrived at any decision in the matter. Meanwhile, it was learned here this evening that Berlusconi and Adriano Galliani, respectively president and managing director of the professional First Division soccer team, Milano, could, within the next few days, be called before Milan judges looking into the transfer of Gianluigi Lentini from Torino to the Milano team. The former head of the Torino team, Gianmauro Borsano, gave testimony today.
