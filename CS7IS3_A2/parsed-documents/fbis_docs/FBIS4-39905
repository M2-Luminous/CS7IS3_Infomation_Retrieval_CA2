He told a news conference in Moscow that the decision made by U.S. parliamentarians could have a negative impact on the Bosnian talks. Lukin said he intended to propose that representatives of the U.S. and Russian parliamentary committees on international affairs meet in order to discuss the situation. However, next week the State Duma will consider at the second reading the draft law on the unilateral lifting of sanctions against the rump Yugoslavia by Russia.
