FBIS4-56275 "drlat084_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-084 Daily Report 24 Mar 1994 Venezuela Governor Elections, Removal Law Reforms Viewed Governor Elections, Removal Law Reforms Viewed AD, COPEI Support Proposal 94SM0324A Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 18 Section 2 94SM0324A Caracas EL UNIVERSAL Spanish CSO [Text] Accion Democratica [Democratic Action] and the COPEI [Social Christian Party] have expressed their support for state governors who are seeking amendments to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors. They believe that the Supreme Court of Justice should be the body charged with removing elected governors for well-considered reasons. This statement of position was made by the leaders of each of these political parties who met separately with the Board of Directors of the Association of Governors of Venezuela, presided over by Henrique Salas Romer, governor of the State of Carabobo; Francisco Ron Sandoval, governor of the State of Tachira; Carlos Tablante, governor of the State of Aragua; and Arnaldo Arocha, governor of the State of Miranda. Salas Romer indicated that the meetings were very encouraging and that there was substantial, mutual support by the governors for each other. In principle, by continuing the process of political conversations at the highest level the irresponsibility which has been reflected in some legislative assemblies will be discouraged as well as the pressures which have been applied to political parties to come out against elected, regional governors, without serious reasons for doing that. He said that the governors were satisfied that there is every intention to support a proposal for an amendment of this law as a matter of some urgency, "which would not make it impossible for legislative assemblies to remove a governor for serious reasons but which would set out the conditions under which this might be done." He emphasized that the fundamental point of reference of any democratic system should be maintained, that is, that only the people can remove a person who has been elected by the people's will, unless a sufficiently serious situation should arise and the courts intervene to condemn a person involved in misappropriation of funds or any other wrongful act affecting public resources. Luis Alfaro Ucero, secretary general of Democratic Action, indicated that his party may propose an amendment to the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors because he believes that this is a very serious problem. This is a view which he shares with the national leadership of Democratic Action. We should consider the idea that removing a governor should not be done for merely circumstantial reasons, or on the basis of considerations which are political in character. Rather, a step of this kind must be very well supported and must have been studied and analyzed with the greatest seriousness. We must try to think more of the national interest, rather than the private interests of the political parties. He pointed out that if it is constitutionally possible to amend the law, we, for our part, will cooperate, and with pleasure, in that sense. At the offices of the Social Christian Party the delegation from the Association of State Governors of Venezuela was received by Jose Curiel, the secretary general, and by Orlando Contreras Pulido, the deputy secretary general. Curiel indicated that in the view of the Social Christian Party it is very important to bring stability to the Venezuelan political system. It is not good for the country to have a situation like the present one in which, with a political majority and for reasons of only secondary importance, a governor may be removed from office. Curiel added: "It is necessary to provide stability to the political system and amend the Law on the Election and Removal of Governors in a legal way in order to achieve that objective. If there is a serious situation affecting a state governor, this matter could be raised before the Supreme Court of Justice."
