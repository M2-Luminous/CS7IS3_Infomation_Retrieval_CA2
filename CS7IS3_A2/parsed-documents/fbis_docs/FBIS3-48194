Yi sent an aide to Beijing on Jan. 7 to arrange meetings with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, but the aide failed to get a schedule fixed, according to the official. "I've heard that Yi's aide returned home on Monday and explained the results of his trip to Beijing to Yi," the official said.
