FBIS4-562 "drafr071_e_94002" FBIS-AFR-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 EAST AFRICA Burkina Faso Kabore Refutes Rumors of 15-Percent Salary Increase Kabore Refutes Rumors of 15-Percent Salary Increase AB1104152094 Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina Radio in French 0630 GMT 11 Apr 94 AB1104152094 Ouagadougou Radiodiffusion Nationale du Burkina Radio French BFN [Text] Head of Government Roch Marc Christian Kabore on 9 April publicly announced the counter proposals made by the labor unions in response to the government's 5 April proposals. The issue that has set a lot of tongues wagging is certainly that of salary increase, heightened by rumors of a hypothetical 15-percent increase said to have been authorized by the World Bank and the IMF. This has once again sparked off the debate over whether or not to believe the government, which has been telling the whole world that budgetary constraints resulting from the structural adjustment program do not enable it to significantly increase salaries. Prime Minister Kabore refutes these rumors and also gives some facts on the sales tax the government is levying on fuel. [Begin Kabore recording] We have been hearing here and there that the World Bank and the IMF have authorized the government to increase salaries by 15 percent and that it is refusing to do so, in the hope that by bullying workers it could get them to accept its proposals. I would like to dispel any doubts on the matter, which I believe was reported by JEUNE AFRIQUE news magazine which I would say is not a negotiator between these institutions and our country. I would also like to reaffirm that at no time was Burkina Faso authorized, under the current program, to effect a 15-percent salary increase. It is therefore important for us to dispel such doubts since the rumors being circulated could cause some confusion among workers and Burkinabe in general. We need to remove all such doubts on the matter. The other problem is that when people look at the price structure they accuse the government of levying too many taxes, especially in regard to fuel and a certain number of items. I would simply like to draw everyone's attention to the fact that the basic revenue -- the 6 billion we have been talking about -- constitutes earnings generated from taxes levied on various products. Thus, logically speaking, if we (?invest) 126 billion, in light of the taxes we are collecting today, it is obvious that if we reduce the value of these taxes, we would actually be reducing the state's revenue and it would therefore be unreasonable to demand salary increases.
