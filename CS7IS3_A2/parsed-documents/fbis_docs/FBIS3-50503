The signing of the act was made in the Coat of Arms Hall of the Interior Ministry by Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf, Labor Minister Armando Caro Figueroa, and Chubut Vice Governor Jorge Aubia on behalf of Governor Carlos Maestro, who is on leave. With the admission of Chubut to the Fiscal Pact, according to the act signed tonight, there is a balance in favor of the province of a little over 57 million pesos, which corresponds to a credit balance of 61 million pesos and to a debt with the nation of 4 million pesos. The agreement also "resolved once and for all many claims and trials involving the nation and the province" through the signing of the act "for the reorganization of the financial situation between the state and the Province of Chubut." This is how the government was able to get the support of one of the provinces opposed to the Fiscal Pact. Cordoba and Catamarca Provinces may also join the initiative. In addition to these two provinces, the others that still remain to sign the agreement proposed by the government are Rio Negro and Santa Cruz Provinces. Minister Ruckauf expressed optimism that when the meeting of the governors with President Carlos Menem is held next January in Chapadmallal "all the provinces will have joined the Fiscal Pact."
