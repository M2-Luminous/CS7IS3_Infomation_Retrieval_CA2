FBIS4-29542 "dreas118_d_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 South Korea Recent Moves, `Threats' by DPRK Reviewed Recent Moves, `Threats' by DPRK Reviewed SK1806031294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0302 GMT 18 Jun 94 SK1806031294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- The North Koreans continue making threats against the South, claiming current inter-Korean relations are on "the eve of war" and blustering that "South Korea will be melted away." Such intimidating remarks against the South appear aimed at two things -- solidifying the Kim Il-song-Kim Chong-il leadership and demonstrating to the world the North's preparedness for any emergencies. Threatening that Seoul would taste "the flame of war," North Korea has created a war environment to calm the people's mounting discontent with the worsening economy and unite them firmly behind "great leader" Kim Il-song and "dear leader" Kim Chong-il. Blaming South Korea and the United States for the tension that is fueling the possibility of war, Pyongyang asserts that the South and the Americans are plotting to invade North Korea on the pretext of the nuclear dispute. Saying they will never yield to pressure from the globe's most powerful nation, the North Koreans want to show their chuche (self-reliance) ideology to the world while trying to ease international pressure for sanctions and buy the time needed to develop nuclear arms. The North Korean people's discontent with their deteriorating economy poses a grave danger to the leadership of the Kims, who may try to overcome the problem through armed conflict, North Korea watchers here say. The North earlier refused to permit full international inspections of its nuclear facilities and ruptured inter-Korean dialogue by threatening to wage war. North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam uttered a typical threat against the South during a recent visit to Ukraine: "South Korea should know that if a war breaks out, it would be melted way, going to rack and ruin and an eventual end." Such intimidation was repeated in a statement issued by the Committee for Peaceful Unification of the Fatherland on June 6 and again during Ambassador Son Song-pil's press conference in Moscow on June 8. Threats were also made in many commentaries carried by North Korea's propaganda organs. The NODONG SINMUN, the official newspaper of the Workers' (communist) Party, blustered in an editorial in the June 13 edition that if war broke out on the Korean peninsula, the South would not be safe, according to NAEWOE Press, the official North Korea watcher here. Along with uttering threats against the South, North Korea is constantly eulogizing Kim Chong-il, calling him "an unrivaled military commander." Its propaganda organs claim Kim Chong-il predicted not only an early end to the Persian Gulf war but U.N. economic sanctions against Pyongyang. North Korea's threats against the South may be intended to establish firm unity among its people. But in view of the fact that the intimidation comes from the highest levels, with even senior foreign service officials uttering threats, and that North Korea is in a war environment, such bluster may mean "a realistic danger" hangs over the Korean peninsula, analysts say.
