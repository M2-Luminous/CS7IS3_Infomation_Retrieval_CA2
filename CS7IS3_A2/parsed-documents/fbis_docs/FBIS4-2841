According to a survey made public by the ministry, 132 of the companies said they have plans to invest in Vietnam, 83 want to go into the Philippines, and 56 are aiming for Indonesian expansion. The Industrial Development Bureau said those businesses interested in investing in the three countries are largely from the electronics, machinery, yacht-building, plastics, and foodstuffs industries. And aiming to further promote trade and economic ties with those countries, the bureau said it has set up several ad-hoc groups to provide the latest trade information on the countries to local businesses. Additionally, the industrial development and investment center under the Economics Ministry will hold intensive week-long seminars for local investors, starting April 20, focusing on the investment climates in the three countries, along with information regarding government incentives on offer from those countries and relevant regulations. Opinions and suggestions aired by local businessmen at the seminars will be collected and compiled by the government as a guide to future policy-making, the bureau added.
