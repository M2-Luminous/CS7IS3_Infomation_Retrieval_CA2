This is not a new question. It now takes on a degree of relevance in keeping with the concern felt by Socialists worried by the stagnation in the opinion polls of the European list headed by their first secretary, embarrassed by the clearly announced opposition between Francois Mitterrand and Michel Rocard on the Bosnian issue. The PSF first secretary's most lukewarm supporters have no hesitation in saying that they now only meet "despairing" members ready to envisage any solution to overcome "this looming disaster." `Nothing Is Settled' Bernard Tapie's name is no longer mentioned but that of Jacques Delors [EU Commission president] still is, with popularity ratings to support it, and that of Jack Lang [former culture minister], who has kept a very low profile since he has occupied seventh place on the Rocard list. "There will be a debate in the PSF," they predict. "How could the first secretary lead a presidential campaign when he cannot lead a European campaign, and fails to create the slightest dynamism? With a view to the municipal elections, the main deputies," they assert, "will no longer accept the inevitability of Rocard's candidacy." Those who most obstinately defend the mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine merely detect an entirely understandable "perplexity," the consequences of which should not be exaggerated. Especially in view of the fact, they add, that the removal of the "Europe Begins at Sarajevo" list proves Michel Rocard "correct in practice," although it does not end the debate between those who think that the PSF first secretary has distanced himself too much from the head of state and those who think he was right to defend the solitary position adopted by his party on 20 April "as a matter of honor." With 12 days to go before the election, they do not want to give up. "Nothing is settled," they say, refusing to attach too much importance to the latest snapping jaws of "a few old Mitterrandist crocodiles" or to the "alarmist reactions of rather uncommitted spectators." The official campaign which is starting will, they think, make it possible to clarify the choices, to simplify the rules of the game. And when some pass harsh judgment on the first television debate between Dominique Baudis and Michel Rocard on Sunday, they see it as a successful initial confrontation between a "politician" and a "man of convictions" who succeeded in defending his plan. The others, who are neither fierce opponents nor unconditional supporters, prefer to say nothing. By their own admission, they feel "trapped." They have chosen to support Michel Rocard, and it is too late to change their minds: "Doubt has returned but we cannot afford to have a new crisis on our hands," they explain. "Whatever the issue, we must handle it calmly." This does not prevent them, in the privacy of Rue Solferino [PSF headquarters], from deploring this "pointless tension" with Francois Mitterrand when the rumors on the Elysee's [office of the president] maneuvers in support of Bernard Tapie had scarcely died down. Their criticisms do not relate to the content of the statements made by the PSF first secretary when faced with Bernard-Henri Levy, but to the method adopted. Michel Rocard's presence at the Mutualite, where the intellectuals booed Francois Mitterrand's name, is not deemed to be very clever. "Fabius," one of the former first secretary's aides remarked, "has disagreed with Francois Mitterrand twice recently -- on Bosnia and on the expansion of the EC -- but has done so in an effort to implement party thinking, not trying to dissociate himself from the head of state at all costs." In the same way as they criticize Michel Rocard for allowing himself to be locked into a debate between Mitterrand and the Socialists once again, for blurring the "Right-Left divide" on which his campaign should be focused, they regret a certain lack of pugnacity on the part of the first secretary which cannot help the men on his list or Socialist statements. "But at least," they point out, "when we have disagreements with Michel Rocard, we have the tact not to display them publicly." As is always the case, the criticisms of Michel Rocard are inconsistent. The same people who yesterday criticized him for following Francois Mitterrand too closely are now accusing him of trying to sever the link too suddenly. The same people who yesterday were sarcastic about his big bang, now criticize him for not now going far enough in this effort to reshape the Left and for clinging too much to the Socialist tradition. The same people who yesterday urged him to take a more attacking line, now despair at seeing him stand out. Reacting to this new assault and to this strategy of "blocking," the PSF first secretary says that he is immune to it and reaffirms that "nothing" will make him abandon the presidential race. It is not so much that he hopes for a dazzling score which would, as his entourage hopes, "silence all those who are speculating on a defeat." He still has very little room to maneuver. Attraction He knows this and has no illusions, although he thinks that the current opinion polls cannot be reliable. On the other hand, he thinks that the political scene after the European elections will be clarified, with Jean-Pierre Chevenement failing to achieve the 5-percent threshold and Bernard Tapie not standing up for long in face of his judges. "His opponents will then be clearly identified," one of his close advisers said, "it will be time for him to join the presidential campaign, to go out to meet the French people after completing his term as party leader. He will be able to demonstrate his individuality, as he has started to do on the Bosnia issue," he added. Not everybody shares this optimism. Although they do not fear an all-out offensive by the leaders of the former PSF factions after 12 June, they expect an explosion of uncontrolled initiatives against a man who, they say, will not have demonstrated that he has real power of attraction.
