In this, the first in a series of articles to be published by ZAVODSKAYA LABORATORIYA on the mechanics of deformation of materials with shape memory in the thermoelastic region, the researchers address the problem of creating a generalized thermomechanical diagram of alloys with shape memory, i.e., _s_[.sub]R[/] = f(_e_[.sub]S[/]), which describes the relationship between, on the one hand, reactive stresses generated during the formation of a structure as a result of thermomechanical recovery and, on the other, the magnitude of a given deformation of incomplete recovery. The researchers point out that the return stresses in a structural element with shape memory are not a function of the means through which the return process is effected; rather they are determined solely by the type and magnitude of deformation of incomplete recovery during contact with the joined part. A generalized thermomechanical diagram obtained under conditions of absolutely rigid resistance turns out to be a universal curve of deformation that describes the process of the thermomechanical return of a structural element for an entire range of a deformation.
