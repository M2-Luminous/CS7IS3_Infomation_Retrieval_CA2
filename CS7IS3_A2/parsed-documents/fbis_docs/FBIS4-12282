Addressing a three-day meeting on Jerusalem which ended at the King 'Abdallah Mosque Wednesday, Prince Hasan said scholars also had the duty to clarify Islam's positive relations with the Christians throughout the ages. The meeting coincided with preparations by some people (in the west) to observe the 3,000th year of "founding" Jerusalem, Prince Hasan said. "We have to discuss and prove by science and research that Jerusalem existed before David and after him," the Crown Prince said. "We do not talk about this in mere rhetorics or in an emotional manner. We seek to remind the world of the historic eras which are linked together starting from the Cannanites and the other Arabs," the Crown Prince said in an address to the 40 scholars gathered at Basman Palace. "I wanted to talk to you today about what we can call divine sovereignty over Jerusalem that does not conflict with political sovereignty. I would like to point out that divine sovereignty derives its dignity and esteem from its value and from the morals of the faithful who believe in it," Prince Hasan said. "In this context, we can only express pride in the Al al-Bayt University, which is due to embark on the experiment of setting up an institute for Christian studies," he noted. "We hope this institute, (the first of its kind in the region), would yield good results because we believe that the time has come for the world to realise that this nation has always been oriented towards promoting culture," the Crown Prince said. Addressing the delegates, Prince Hasan said: "You have to enhance the concept of the holiness of the city of Jerusalem and promote dialogue among the religions and reaffirm the status of the Holy City for the Christians and Muslims. "We are facing a historic moment entitled `survival of the more competent' in expression and best in presenting reason in dialogue. I believe that the media in particular have a role to play but without much rhetorics and excessive emotions. "We have to conduct a dialogue that caters to the spirit of the modern age and we have to be aware of our rights and highlight them. "Our dialogue could be emotional, but it should have reason and responsibility, especially as we mourn our martyrs who fell in the Hebron massacre. We have to direct our reason and dialogue in a true and scientific manner away from selfishness and we should not allow weakness to be the sole method of expression because this would lead to counter-violence devoid of reason. "Through your courage and wisdom you can encourage people to resort to reason and positive thinking and can enhance the spirit of wisdom as we strive to remind the world of the greatness of Islam and the greatness of the Arab Muslim Christian project. Remember that Jerusalem is in need of your efforts under the current difficult circumstances." Several speakers among the delegates addressed the meeting, focusing on the importance of Christian-Islamic dialogue. Field Marshal 'Abd al-Rahman Siwar al-Dhahab of Sudan paid tribute to His Majesty King Husayn's devotion and dedication to safeguarding the holy places in Jerusalem. He noted that the King sold part of his personal property in order to finance the restoration of the holy sites in Jerusalem. The scholars who took part in the three-day meeting, organised by the general Islamic Congress for Jerusalem, issued a statement at the end of their conference denouncing American policies for their disregard of the international resolutions regarding Jerusalem. The statement condemned American policies, which "express Zionism's ambitions and intentions to seize the Holy City and make it the united capital of Israel." The statement also rejected the American stand vis-a-vis the Hebron massacre and Washington's "opposition to a resolution that would have condemned Israel's terrorism." It deplored Washington's retreat from the U.N. Security Council resolution that considered Jerusalem as part of the occupied territories and not a disputed land. The statement called on the Arab and Islamic countries to unify their rank and adopt a collective position with regard to "the issues of destiny, foremost of which the issue of Jerusalem." It called on the Arabs and Muslims to "defend Arab and islamic rights in the face of Zionism's expansionist and aggressive plots." The statement urged Muslims and Christians to "promote their dialogue, encourage tolerance and solidarity among the faithful and set up a special fund for the reconstruction of Jerusalem."
