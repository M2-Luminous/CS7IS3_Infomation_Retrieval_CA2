There were also 43 disappointed UN blue helmets from the 2d Unit from Flawinne aboard. Out of helpless anger over the murder of 10 companions on 7 April by the Rwandan army, some of them tore up or burned their blue helmets on the spot. "This was the most dangerous of the four missions I accomplished in Africa," Corporal Ronny Van Sey (39) of the 3d Unit from Tielen said. "When we arrived at Kigali, we went through several hours of suspense. The landing had been refused, and we knew from the French paratroopers that nine Rwandan antiaircraft batteries were positioned along the runway. We circled around for an hour or so, but there was no doubt about the assignment: To `protect' the Kigali airport by force, if necessary. We were heavily armed. I was in the first C-130 which landed in Kigali. The Rwandans understood that we meant business, and backed off." No Use The mortar attack on the airport Thursday [14 April] last week, was a second moment of suspense. "During the withdrawal toward Nairobi, mortars fell close to the hangar. One mortar fell right behind a C-130. My company covered their retreat. At such a moment, one falls back on one's training, and fires automatically. Afterwards, everything remained quiet. No shot was fired near the airport on Sunday. I don't think that the men who stayed behind to guard the control tower, will have any trouble. The Rwandans know that we won't be kicked around." "Horrible. Never again in these circumstances," UN blue helmet Hussein Benbouhout (27) shouted against the noise of the airplane engines. "Those 10 murdered paratroopers were friends. They gave their lives for a useless peacekeeping mission. They were powerless against a gang of murdering Rwandan soldiers. Insane. I never want to go through this again," he said. The sergeant of the 2d Unit from Flawinne hardly controlled his emotions. "We arrived at Kigali on 14 March. We guarded the cooperation assistants near the Don Bosco school, and prepared their evacuation. We drove through the city several times to pick up fellow Belgians. I was always in the first vehicle, because I have no family, no children. I am not scared to fight either, this is what I was trained for." He lashed out again: "But we were not allowed to shoot. We might just as well have left our weapons at Don Bosco. My heart was pounding at each roadblock. The blacks constantly pointed their guns at us. Some of them gestured that they would cut our throats with their machetes. We were only allowed to react in self-defense. Which is no use against a bullet in the back or a machete in your throat. Training is of no use then." "What can you do when you are surrounded by 50 blacks, when one of them presses the barrel of his gun against your chest? Three of us were guarding a Rwandan lawyer in Kigali. Five minutes after we left, he was slaughtered," Corporal Fabien Vanhee (30) of the 2d Unit from Flawinne said, shrugging his shoulders. This was my second mission in Africa. "All we could do, was watch people slaughter each other like animals," he said in a flat voice. Colonel Walter Balis (52) was liaison officer for the UN with the "rebels." "Fortunately, we lived under the permanent protection of the rebels. They protected us against the massacres of the presidential guard and of Interahamwe, a militia of former President Habyarimana's united party MRND [National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development]. We were hoping that the so-called rebels would conquer Kigali as quickly as possible, and end the `beastly actions.'"
