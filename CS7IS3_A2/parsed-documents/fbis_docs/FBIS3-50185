Experts from the Council of Europe, Miguel Martinez, the chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, as well as Max van der Stoel, of the High Commission of the Conference for European Security and Co-operation [CSCE], were especially interested in changes in the territorial division of Slovakia as well as our reform of state administration and self-administration. Did more fundamental proposals come out of these meetings, Prime Minister, by which the government would correct its existing intentions in this area? [Meciar] All three visits were important and each of them was different. The talks on territorial division, which were held at an expert level, in effect examined different variants of the proposals we had submitted and the objections that were envisioned to be raised by Hungarian political parties in the Council of Europe. I can say that the Slovak Government course was solidly based, and we shall submit all legislative proposals to the National Council by 30 June so that they can be approved. The territory of Slovakia will be divided on the basis as required by the administration of the given territory and not on an ethnical principle. The second visit, which was connected with the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Mr. Martinez, was significant in that we discussed rather global problems, global relations in Europe, and Slovakia came out very well, even more than very well out of that assessment. If the citizens could have heard what was said, this would have simply confused our criticics and those people who are engaged in propaganda against us, and they would have to creep back into their corner. Moreover, those talks provided an impetus for Slovakia to act in the pursuit of such relations in its own name and become substantially more active than before so that its voice could be heard substatially more loudly. It should cease to be the Czech Republic's twin and come out with its own independent proposals and initiative, which Europe needs. It also needs ideas from us because they are important and our perception of things, although different in some things, cannot be said to be bad because of this. The visit of the Commissioner van der Stoel in essense reacted to the ongoing process of a two-year inspection both in Hungary and Slovakia regarding the minorities issues. One proposal that came out of it was that a consultative body should be set up at which minorities issues would be continually discussed. A proposal on collective rights, however, did not come out of it. The talks did not touch on that subject. Therefore, all three visits were special in their own way. Each of them was positive in relation to Slovakia both in content and importance. [passage omitted] [Toman] Already deliberations of parliamentary committees have shown that discussion about two amendment bills on big privatization, the government one and the one put forward by a group of deputies for the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], will be among the most interesting points on the agenda of a January session of the Slovak parliament. [passage omitted] [Meciar] There is a diametrical difference between the SDL bill and the government bill. We do not intend to support the SDL bill becuase it is based on unrealistic assumptions. Above all, it is based on the assumption that there is strong capital market and a lot of money here--and the opposite is true. The National Bank of Slovakia does not intend to release those 20 billion [presumably Slovak korunas] spoken about in the context of privatization in 1994. Furthermore, the SDL bill does not take into account the fact that our territory is nationally mixed. Various nationalities live here, and various economic interests exist here. There is no longer any need to hide the fact that, according to the figures on privatization as of 30 June 1993, in the nationally mixed areas more than 50 percent of privatized assets were acquired by the Hungarian capital--almost the entire retail sphere, food industry, wholesale distribution. This is not good, and it can have political hidden meaning, too. This is why it is necessary to have also other entities present there. If the system changes proposed by the SDL are carried out, this would result in two undesirable facts. First, privatization assets would be accumulated in hands of a narrow circle of people. Second, the present reorganization would be destroyed and we would need to begin anew. [passage omitted] A compromise is possible because the SDL bill includes some rational elements of a technical nature that are acceptable to us. However, we got stuck in the last moment as the SDL demands the split of privatization minister post from the post of president of the Fund of National Property. [passage omitted] [Toman] In this context, opposition officials like to list your present posts, ranging from the chairman of the presidium of the Fund of National Property to privatization minister and to the post of prime minister of the government. Mr. Prime Minister, is this accumulation of posts inevitable? Isn't an appointment of privatization minister about to be announced? [Meciar] [passage omitted] The problem is not that I am currently holding the two posts. I am in fact putting things in order there. In substance, as moral and political authority was lacking to reveal the relations about the existence of which we were aware, I have found time to do this tidying up. It is now under way. [passage omitted] As far as a new privatization minister is concerned, I have known his name for a long time, and an agreement on him was reached several months ago. So far I have not put forward his nomination to the president only because the SDL bill proposes, among other things, to abolish the Privatization Ministry. Once this issue is clarified by a law adopted by the parliament, I will immediately put forward my nomination for privatization minister. I have never personally accumulated power. I accumulate responsibility, administrative duties, and I serve. It is totally alien to me to perceive my post as the post providing me with power. [passage omitted] [Toman] A week ago, Interior Ministers Jan Ruml and Jozef Tuchyna announced that their recommendation regarding open questions concerning the Slovak-Czech border would be that the hamlet of (Sidonia) in the village of Horne Srnie become part of the Czech Republic and, on the other hand, the hamlet of U Sabotu in the Moravian village of Javornik nad Velickou become part of the Slovak village Vrbovce. [passage omitted] [Meciar] As far as border changes are concerned, meetings of ministers are only consultations. I do not think we will manage to conclude the matter by the end of this year because the problem is more complicated inasmuch as it involves also the catchment area of the Morava river. [passage omitted] A decision on this matter can be made only by the National Council. I would like to confirm once again the pledge I made in the past that not a single square centimeter of the Slovak territory will be given away without being compensated for by a square centimeter from the Czech side and without an agreement of legislative bodies. The government will stick to this principle, strictly respecting not only the local self-administrative bodies but also other matters. [passage omitted]
