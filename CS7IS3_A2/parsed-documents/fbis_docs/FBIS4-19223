The financiers of this madness get their money partly from crime -- and Austria is playing an important role as a country where the crimes are being committed and as a switching station. Thus, for months members of the Task Force for Combating Organized Crime (EDOK) in the Interior Ministry, with the help of domestic and foreign security authorities, has been pursuing a gang of Serbs who have, so to speak, become heirs to the infamous "Yugoslav Mafia." Crimes, which usually are drowned in statistics, have suddenly became particularly important, because the perpetrators were able to afford luxurious life-styles because of break-ins, car smuggling, protection racketeering, drug trafficking, arms dealing, as well as pick-pocketing and robbery, but a large part of the money gained in this way was passed on to Belgrade -- to Serbian politicians and military, it has emerged from interrogations. Particularly coveted were "noncash means of payment": Since 1992, one of the bosses of the gang said, he had taken over about 1,500 bank and traveler cheques stolen all over Europe. Per month! Female couriers smuggled the loot across the international borders. Mafia experts in Milan forged the signatures and turned the cheques into money, using forged Serbian, Czech, and Italian personal documents. Just for this one branch, Zajim Sabanagic, 33, established special "acquisition" and "utilization structures," among others in Belgium, Germany, France, and Austria. His painstaking accounts of the criminal deals would have "been a credit for any bank" (an investigator). A total of 1,500 cheques (value about 3.5 million schillings) were recovered in one go. The damage (only in this field) is estimated to be at least 100 million schillings. An interesting detail gained from the interrogations: When the officials asked Sabanagic about his accounts, two of which were known through surveillance, he pretended not to know anything. "Then we will send the money that we found to Bosnia," the policemen bluffed. The Serb confessed and promised to help making good the damage with "his" assets. "We have managed to land the biggest blow so far against organized crime," enthused Walter Pretzner, head of EDOk, which was founded only a year ago. His summary of 35 arrests and 150 reports to the police: Crimes involving more than 20 million schillings have been solved. They include 20 cases of car smuggling, robberies (a bank robbery in Vienna as well as a brutal attack on German campers in France), and 40 break-ins in villas -- for instance the one in the villa of Vienna Court President Guenther Woratsch, when, among other things, a gun was stolen at Christmas 1992. In this connection, a search is under way for Ratko Bjelobaba, 36, who also cashed cheques, and Goran Sojic, 28. Inquiries sent to the Belgrade police have produced no results.
