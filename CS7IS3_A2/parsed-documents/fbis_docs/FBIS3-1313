In their communique, the heads of state of the five-nation commission decided at the end of their two-day summit to "immediately set up a joint security force with a clear mandate and logistic support." The leaders said that troops and material contribution to the force would be clearly defined. [passage omitted] The communique was signed by Presidents Sani Abacha of Nigeria, Idriss Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger and Felix Ange Patasse of the Central African Republic. Augustin Frederic Kodock, Cameroon's minister of state for planning and development, signed on behalf of Cameroonian President Paul Biya. They also approved a document prepared in collaboration with a French company, IGN-France, on the boundary demarcation of the basin, urging each country to "adopt it, in accordance with its national laws." The document is to be signed by each country before the commission's summit in 1995 in Ndjamena. The two-day summit was held amid heightened tension between Nigeria and Cameroon, both members states of the commission. Since the beginning of February they have been embroiled in a renewed dispute over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula located in the Gulf of Guinea, near south-eastern Nigeria. Efforts to convene a summit of Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha and Cameroonian President Paul Biya have failed. The heads of state in their communique reaffirmed their belief "in the ability of African nations to always amicably settle their occasional differences either through bilateral or regional fora." They also stressed the need for regular dialogue at heads of state and government level. Political observers in the Nigerian capital see both the signature of the communique by Cameroon and its decision to participate in the joint security force, to be stationed in Nigeria, as the beginning of a detente between the two neighbouring countries. Conference sources told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) that the dispute between the two countries featured in the 14-hour discussions held Wednesday through early Thursday, behind closed doors. The heads of state also reviewed a wide range of current issues including the forthcoming elections in South Africa, and the protracted wars in Angola, Burundi and Somalia. The leaders also decided to re-elect for a second three-year term the executive secretary of the commission, Abubakar Jauro of Nigeria.
