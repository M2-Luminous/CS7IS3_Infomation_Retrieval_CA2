On the airfield's runway he noted that friendly relations with Ukraine have not yet been enshrined in law. Neither he nor Leonid Kravchuk have not yet had any time for this owing to their own big and acute problems. But both presidents are stressing the importance of this treaty, which will certainly be signed. As regards recent events in the Crimea, Ter-Petrosyan had this to say: "God forbid that the Crimea turns into another Karabakh."
