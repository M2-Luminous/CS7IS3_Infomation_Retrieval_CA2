From a hotel in Miami I have Mr. Charles Rangel on the line, who will give an international news conference. Ana Margarita Gill will serve as interpreter for us and for Mr. Rangel. From Havana, good morning. [Gill] "Good morning, Mr. Rangel. We are calling you from Havana Cuba, and we would like to ask you about details concerning your projects to ease or establish free commerce between Cuba and the United States. [Rangel] "Well, as you know, the U.S. has always felt that Cuba with association with the Soviet Union represented a threat to our national security and as a result of that it established the embargo some 34 years ago. It is my opinion and that of many members of the Congress that that threat no longer exists if it existed at all and that the embargo should be removed. I had hearings on this bill, and we have had many people in the Congress to agree. And I think that with all the witnesses, there is an overwhelming belief that the purposes that existed for the embargo before do not exist now and that it should be removed. "The problems that we do have is that there are many people in the United States who believe that the rights of Cuban people to speak their minds and the terms of the type of government that they would have are held in jeopardy if they speak out against the Cuban Government. The Cuban Government, of course, says that this is not so, that people do have the opportunity to say anything that they want, and so, therefore, I think that now that we have established an area of differences that we also can establish an area of debate and that is exactly where we are at this moment. [Gill] "Thank you so much I will translate for a few seconds." He states that the embargo, or the blockade, is established due to relations between Cuba and the United States. At the present moment this situation has changed completely, and if there is an area of differences there should also be an area of dialogue and mutual exchange. [Cavada] The listeners would like to know about the future of your bill. What other steps would be followed because the Cuba people are interested in learning of this future. [Gill] "Mr. Rangel, which will be the next steps in Congress concerning the project? [Rangel] "Well, since there is an overwhelming feeling that the embargo has nothing to do with the security of the United States and since many of the business people believe that indeed the United States is losing as a result of not participating in trade with Cuba, as we have established with the North America Free Trade Agreement, then what remains is some concern about the type of government and the type of conditions that exist as relates to the human rights of the Cubans. Of course some of us believe, that support the bill, that the embargo has caused an undo hardship in terms of lack of food and medicine, in terms of the pain and suffering of the people in Cuba. So, when people have said that many Cubans have been arrested and placed in jail because their only crime was to speak out in support of democracy, other people have said that that is not so. "In my opinion, if that is not so and that is the only reason why we are not establishing trade and a normal relationship with Cuba so that we can enjoy each other's culture and education and advancements in medicine and of course in commerce, then it would seem that perhaps our government should start talking and remove what appears to be the only obstacle as relates [words indistinct]. [Gill] "Thank you so much Mr. Rangel." [Rangel] Good morning. [in Spanish] [Gill] Good morning. Let us summarize what he said. He said that, currently, there is an overwhelming feeling about the fact that U.S. security has nothing to do with Cuba and that much is being said about the alleged violation of human rights in Cuba. He says that there is no greater violation than the pain and suffering that the embargo or blockade is causing to our people. That the time has come for the United States and Cuba to enjoy each other's culture and education and that they should sit down to talk. In short, that is the message of Mr. Charles Rangel.
