That is why the so-called secret talks with the United States in London were enough to provoke the parliament. The provocation was logical in the sense that it was borne out of the deep national pride. Of course, secret talks have significance in diplomacy, but on these two issues a prudent Indian society demands absolute openness and full clarification. It is logical to ask as to when the parliament is in session, why it was not taken into confidence on such an important issue. When a newspaper one day suddenly revealed that the government has stopped the development program of `Agni' missile, the government springs into action and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao makes a statement in the parliament that this has not been done under anybody's pressure and the program is suspended only temporarily, but the answer, perhaps, satisfied no one. The same is true for the government's explanation of the secret talks. We do not consider the United States a villain, but it is neither a trustworthy friend or well-wisher of India. On the U.S. direction Russia banned the sale of cryogenic engine technique to India that has affected our missile development program. When Pakistan has received Chinese M-11 missiles and the U.S. F-16 fighter aircraft -- additional consignments are also being planned, stopping the missile program by any logic would be national suicide. Even though, this was the fourth round of secret talks with the United States and the subject of talks was the world disarmament, what was the reason for masking them in secrecy? And, why were the talks held in a third country? If the U.S. delegation had problems coming to New Delhi, the Indian delegation could have gone to the United States. Many other questions remain unanswered. The delegation members included those whose views generally favor India's signing of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. What does this fact indicate? Definitely there is something fishy about all this. Then again, the London talks took place in the background of the scheduled Rao-Clinton summit. There should be no doubt whatsoever that the United States wants total elimination of strategic weapons in South Asia. While U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Talbott is luring Pakistan into capping its nuclear program by promising F-16's, Washington has trapped India into multilateral or five plus two plus two [the five members of the UN Security Council, Japan, Germany, India and Pakistan] talks. Our participation in these talks will mean that we are approving the U.S. policies in South Asia. The government says that the talks have been held with the United States since 1992 for multilateral negotiations on disarmament. Okay, but why is India so eager for such multilateral talks? It is the government's duty to tell the parliament what has been discussed so far with the United States. It should also reiterate the commitment that no agreement will be reached on India's security and strategic interest that is not fully acceptable to the Indian people.
