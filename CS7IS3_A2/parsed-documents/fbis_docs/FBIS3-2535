A total of 28 delegates from Hong Kong will attend the NPC meeting. Zeng Xianzi, Wu Kangmin, Liao Yaozhu, all members of the Preliminary Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Hong Kong affairs advisers to the State Council, and Zheng Yaotang, a Hong Kong affairs adviser, were among the delegates who spoke to reporters. As NPC delegates from Hong Kong, each said the territory was their main issue of concern. Delegate Liao Yaozhu said the heart of the dispute between China and Britain over the Hong Kong political system lay in fulfilling international agreements, in linking up with the Hong Kong Basic Law, and in realizing a smooth transition for Hong Kong. Complete insincerity on the matter of cooperation and deliberate sabotage by Britain had led to the breakdown of Sino-British negotiations over arrangements for the 1994-1995 elections in Hong Kong. Delegate Zeng Xianzi said Hong Kong people should not harbor illusions and should become united. With strong backing from the motherland, Hong Kong's prosperity and stability would be ensured. Other delegates also expressed the hope that the Preliminary Work Organ for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would increase its work, vigorously prepare for China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and help ensure a smooth transition of Hong Kong. On the issue of reform and construction, delegates Zeng Xianzi and Wang Mingang said another major topic they would address at the NPC meeting was good handling of the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Zeng Xianzi said it was necessary to emphasize the Chinese character "jian kang" (healthy)," namely to stress increasing economic efficiency, if the people wanted to maintain sustained, stable, and healthy development of the economy. Carrying out reform well would lead to healthy development of the economy and a developed economy would lead to social stability. Many delegates also described as astounding China's economic development over 15 years of reform and opening up. As China was a big country with a huge population, development was still uneven. To achieve common development, it was hoped that the economically- developed regions would enhance cooperation with less-developed areas. On the issue of clean-administration building, delegates Wu Kangmin and Zheng Yaotang said the CPC Central Committee and the State Council had attached great importance to it, adopted many effective measures on anticorruption work, and achieved certain results. They hoped more efforts would be taken in this regard to establish anticorruption supervision and restraint mechanisms.
