He was in Seoul--the capital of South Korea--for a day, and then without a stopover in Vladivostok flew to another capital--Moscow, where he participated in the work of the supreme legislative chamber of the Russian parliament--the Federation Council. Immediately on his return from this long trip, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko met with our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent. [Oshchenko] You have emphasized many times that you select your foreign travel priorities in such a way as to avoid places where the Maritime Kray governor is invited mainly for representation. In other words, you go abroad only when there is an opportunity to solve some of the kray's problems with the help of foreign states or companies. What prompted you to go to Seoul? [Nazdratenko] Seoul was the site of the third annual joint conference of the Committee for Cooperation Between the Russian Far East and Siberia and the Republic of Korea and the Association for Cooperation Between the Republic of Korea and the Russian Far East and Siberia. I was invited as a chairman for the Russian side. Heads of administrations of practically all Siberian and Far Eastern territories, including ethnic entities, also participated in the conference. This conference was conducted on a very representative level; in essence, its task was to prepare Russian-South Korean economic projects, which will be discussed during the upcoming visit of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam to Moscow. Among the conference participants were the ministers of the most important ministries of South Korea--foreign affairs, labor, and industry. As the association's chairman from the Russian side, I delivered an extensive report. I will be honest--I did not write it myself, but specialists from the Maritime Kray administration's foreign economic services did a very professional job, and the report did not have even a hint of overstressing the special role of Maritime Kray. Although one has to admit the simple truth that today the Maritime Kray population, counting the military, numerically exceeds the population of Khabarovsk Kray, Kamchatka, Sakhalin, and Magadan Oblast taken together. Unfortunately, local interests were brought up at the meeting in Seoul, in particular, by Vladimir Saganov, chairman of the Republic of Buryatia's Council of Ministers, who announced the intention to conduct separate negotiations and sign separate agreements. I was compelled to remind all Russian participants of the conference in Seoul that there is one single Russian Federation, which has one president--Boris Yeltsin. And that agreements may be signed either with the president of Russia, or with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Not with a chairman of the Buryat council of ministers or a Maritime Kray governor... Of course, South Korea continues very active cooperation with Russia, despite the fact that foreign investment in our country is hampered by the existing imbalance between political, economic, and legal relations. Recall for instance the Hende-Svetlaya [as transliterated] company, and the 22-story South Korean business center currently under construction in the center of Vladivostok... These are concrete contributions to our economy. I hope that the meetings in Seoul and the work of our foreign economic relations specialists will allow us to expand this work with South Korean companies. First and foremost in the direction where Maritime Kray has the worst bottleneck: I mean, of course, power generation. For us, freight rates turn coal from other regions of Russia into gold. If we continue bringing coal from the outside, in the winter of 1994-95 a kilowatt-hour of electric power will cost 270 rubles [R]; this winter, which was very hard for industry, a kilowatt cost R40. Therefore, in searching for a solution we decided to open work on several coal deposits on kray territory. The idea is simple, although this is, of course, an emergency program: to strip open before winter several coal deposits--where stripping is about 2-4 meters. It would be good to get several Korean companies involved in construction of these strip mines. Although we do have a problem with respect to payment: The Koreans would like to get this coal as payment in kind, but we desperately need it ourselves. Still, I sensed that the Korean side is showing interest in working in Maritime Kray. Perhaps rich Maritime Kray companies can join this project--those that already have began to invest money in the kray economy, such as for instance AKFES (Mikhail Dalman) or Roliz (Sergey Darkin). They are building, and we are very grateful to them... [Oshchenko] What happened during your trip to Moscow? [Nazdratenko] I took part in the work of the Federation Council. Unfortunately, this work did not produce a lot of results. The Federation Council accomplished only one concrete thing: It accepted the budget message for the second quarter. Although the budget has some shortcomings, the main one being that the money does not get to the territories, it has good figures built into it. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that this is an interim document. Otherwise, the Federation Council got bogged down in a boring politicized intrigue, and this is very disappointing. The incident with the firing and resignation of General Procurator Kazannik is nothing more than the desire of the anti-president opposition to look for any pretext to hit Yeltsin. I was among those 68 deputies who voted for Kazannik's resignation; 74 voted against it. I said at the Federation Council that if the general procurator had read the Russian Constitution, he should know that it is the Federation Council that relieves him from the job. Why then did he write his resignation letter to the president and then disappear in Tomsk for a month and a half? Anybody who does not show up for work for a month and a half should be fired for absenteeism... The Federation Council spent two days discussing the problem of crime and its suppression, but did not adopt any real decisions. [Oshchenko] I assume that you certainly had some official meetings in Moscow on the subject of the situation with liquid radioactive waste storage in Bolshoy Kamen. Were you able to resolve anything? [Nazdratenko] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Ecology of the Russian Federation have prepared a document stating that dumping from the tanker cannot be done without the government's consent. Meanwhile, the tanker with liquid radioactive waste [LRW] may simply burst without asking permission from the government and Nazdratenko. I met with Minister of Foreign Affairs Kozyrev, and our positions on this matter are close: The money (whether from the Russian government or Japan, if the latter decides to help us) for LRW utilization must be used in Maritime Kray--not by some firm in Moscow which for some reason will solve our problems better than we can ourselves. I also met with Japan's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary in Moscow, and during this meeting emphasized once again the kray administration's extreme concern at the situation with tankers and our desire to quickly and safely resolve this problem--preferably with the participation of Japanese companies, which have already developed effective methods. We could solve this problem in 20 days, were it not for all these diplomatic games. The Japanese ambassador also told me that if his government does decide to allocate money, it will be only on the condition that the money goes to Maritime Kray. [Oshchenko] Recently rumors started spreading in Vladivostok that your lengthy trips to Moscow are not accidental and very soon you will leave "our city" with a promotion. Rumor has it that some government bulletin published a list of members of the future government, where you are listed as the minister of industry... [Nazdratenko] I am not going anywhere. This is what happened. PRAVITELSTVENNYY VESTNIK magazine published a preliminary list of members of the government, and my name was listed as one of the candidates. I talked to both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin and told them that I am not going anywhere. I have made a promise to work in Maritime Kray (for better or for worse is for the people to decide)... [Oshchenko] And you cannot be tempted by any job whatsoever? [Nazdratenko] No... I love Maritime Kray so much, and it is so important to make life better here that a bureaucratic career is not for me. I also want very much to remind kray residents: At the kray soviet session in May 1993 I told the deputies that for two more years we will retreat and move backwards under the pressure of crisis and ruin. At what speed is another question... We have not yet left the crisis behind us, and I simply cannot in clear conscience abandon Maritime Kray for Moscow high offices.
