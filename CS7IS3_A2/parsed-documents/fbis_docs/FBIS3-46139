Most will appear on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said Zhu Li, a spokesman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The others will be listed on US securities exchanges or in other countries. These large State-owned enterprises will mainly come from the field of energy, transportation and telecommunications. Some of them need capitals to conduct technical renovation, he said, To attract overseas investors, they must be profitable and have promising development potentiality. Zhu said new overseas-listed firms this year would not issue A shares in the domestic securities market. This is not expected to result in too much pressure on the domestic market, which has been complaining about the over-expansion of listed firms. China last year chose nine companies to be listed on the Hong Kong exchange. To date, six companies are actually listed on the Hong Kong exchange. They are Shanghai Petrochemical, Qingdao Brewery, Guangzhou Shipyard, Beiren Printing Machinery, Kunming Machine Tool, and Maanshan Iron and Steel. Another three are expected to be listed on the overseas market during the first half of this year. They are Dongfang Electric Company, Tianjin Bohai Chemical, and Jiangsu Yizheng Chemicals. The overseas listing of domestic firms is an effective way to raise foreign capital, it helps Chinese firms transform their operations into real shareholding firms . Before they enter the international market, domestic firms have to change their accounting system to meet international standards. And they usually get help from foreign banks, securities firms, law firms and accounting firms. To ensure smooth sailing of the new overseas listings, CSRC and Hong Kong Stock Exchange will jointly sponsor a seminar in Wuhan, Hubei Province, on Wednesday. Some related institutions will introduce the procedures of listing in Hong Kong. And the already-listed firms will explain their experiences. Earlier this month, CSRC Chairman Liu Hongru and the head of he Hong Kong exchange went to he United States and Britain to talk about the Hong Kong and mainland securities market. In another development, CSRC yesterday published a circular to standardize the annual financial reports of listed companies.
