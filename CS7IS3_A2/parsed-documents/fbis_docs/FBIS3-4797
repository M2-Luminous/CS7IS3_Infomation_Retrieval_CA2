The officials said they had stopped distribution of the rice because they have not yet finished inspecting it. As a result, wholesalers in the area have suffered a shortage of Chinese rice to include in a special standard-priced blend that was to be made available Tuesday. Some wholesalers have begun including the higher-priced United States rice in the blend, bearing the additional cost themselves. The Chinese rice was imported in January and forms part of the 700 tons allotted to Fukuoka Prefecture in western Japan. The discoloring was found in mid-February. The standard-priced rice in Fukuoka was to have contained 60 percent U.S. rice, 20 percent Chinese rice and 20 percent Thai rice, and sell at 3,191 yen per 10 kilograms.
