The source also accused the YSP of rejecting attempts to integrate the armed forces in order to achieve its own objective, which is to secede from the unitary state and return to party dictatorship over the six provinces in the south. The source stressed that there is no use here for any force or individual that tramples on democracy and constitutional legitimacy.
