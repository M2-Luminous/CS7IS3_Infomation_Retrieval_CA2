How can two sides be left, one of which is Israel with all the power, capabilities, and resources it possesses, and the other, the unarmed Palestinian people? [Abu-Sharif] The Declaration of Principles, which was signed in Washington, was signed at the White House in the presence of the United States, represented by its President and secretary of state, and other representatives of the world states, particularly the cosponsor of the peace conference that began in Madrid. Therefore, the U.S. and Russian responsibility here is clear. Undoubtedly, what the U.S. President had earlier said, to the effect that the United States is a full partner, gives the United States a moral, political, and practical responsibility to implement the Declaration of Principles and the plan to achieve peace in the region. We can explain the issue clearly as follows: If the Israeli Government really intends to achieve peace, then I see no logical reason for the Israeli Government to make out of the Jericho area or the crossings an obstacle to implementing the Gaza-Jericho First Plan. Based on this, I wish that the Israeli Government would take this into consideration, especially since confidence between the two sides is not entrenched, and because the plan to implement the Declaration of Principles is in itself a plan to bridge the gap of mistrust. I hope that the Israeli Government will not turn these points into obstacles because this is demoralizing and makes the Palestinians and Israelis lose hope in the possibility of achieving peace. However, if you want my personal opinion about what will happen afterwards, I say that the peace process will continue and all the current obstacles can be surmounted through calm negotiations free of tension and mistrust.
