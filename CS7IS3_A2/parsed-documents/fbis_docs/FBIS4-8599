Igman and Mt. Bjelasnica, after they had taken over VRS positions on the basis of the agreement of 30 July 1993, today withdrew to the area of Hrasnica and to Sarajevo airport as agreed upon between the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the UNPROFOR command in Sarajevo. The statement says that by withdrawing their units from these positions, UNPROFOR is enabling the Muslim forces that come from Sarajevo through a tunnel under the airport to attack VRS positions and Serb territory in Trnovo and on Rogoj, with the objective to link Gorazde and Sarajevo. These offensive actions--as well as those already taken from various locations against the plateau of Nisici--are aiding the Muslim offensive aimed at breaking up and conquering the territory of Serb Sarajevo. The actions coordinated between UNPROFOR and the so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina Army are aimed at forcing an energetic response from the VRS in the Sarajevo area, which would then be used as a pretext for the use of NATO air force against the Serb artillery positions around Sarajevo, which have been grouped and placed under UNPROFOR control, the statement says.
