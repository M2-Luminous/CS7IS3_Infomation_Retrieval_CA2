In a communique, Conacom states that what is immediately necessary is the overthrow of the Jonassaint government; General Cedras' early retirement, respecting the signature he put to the Governors Island agreement; and the return of President Aristide as soon as possible. Among other strategic actions, Conacom suggests holding meetings between President Aristide and the representatives of democratic political organizations for the purpose of expediting the application of the Governors Island agreement; meetings between the sectors that signed the New York pact, for the purpose of studying the pact's clauses; and meetings between representatives of democratic political organizations and the nation's various social sectors with a view to obtaining these sectors' support for these initiatives. Conacom firmly believes that applying those proposals courageously and without delay will allow us to spare the country a catastrophe, while guaranteeing a return to constitutional order, especially that of President Aristide, states this Conacom press release.
