The Clinton administration of the United States wants to introduce numerical targets, but Japan argues that this would lead to managed trade. Japan offers counterarguments but does not come up with anything to break the deadlock. It seems that both sides have been bogged down right at the beginning of the talks. If such a confrontation persists, there will be chaos in the post-cold war world economy. Now is the time to transcend such theoretical debate of free trade or managed trade, and get right on to more constructive discussions from a global viewpoint. Japan and the United States are supposed to reach agreement in the areas of automobiles and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February. Yet, U.S. negotiators claim that the talks "have not moved one inch forward" (according to Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Garten). Japanese negotiators also admit that both sides are merely repeating the points they have made at the beginning. Have the two countries come to a dead end? The perception gap between Japan and the United States seems to be growing all the time. The Clinton administration is apparently under the impression that "Japan, Inc.," with politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses all cooperating closely, still exists and functions. This can be seen from the U.S. attempt to set an import target for automobiles and auto parts, and rely on the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's administrative guidance [gyosei shido] to make the automobile industry comply. However, in Japan today, the validity of administrative guidance itself is being questioned. If the Clinton administration's demand is accommodated, this will run counter to the Hosokawa administration's policy of reforming the economic system into a more transparent one. On the other hand, since the Clinton administration came to power, there has been a stronger tie between the U.S. Government and the businesses. It seems that a "United States, Inc." is being created through the government's industrial policy. Under the new administration, a reversal in economic systems in Japan and the United States is taking place. "Mistaken Notions" and "Overconfidence" Just as the Clinton administration holds on to its mistaken notions, the Hosokawa administration clings to its amae. Japan is facing its worst economic recession in the postwar years. It also has to deal with political reform. Moreover, Prime Minister Hosokawa's personal relationship with President Clinton is good. It seems that the Hosokawa administration has the easygoing notion that even if it is not able to work on negotiations with the United States amid the difficult domestic situation, the United States would understand. However, the Clinton administration is trying to add momentum to its foreign economic strategy. After enacting the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and concluding the GATT multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round), it is now focusing on results in the Japan-U.S. framework talks. Another factor in the growing perception gap between the two countries is that, since the end of the cold war, the Western countries have lost the impelling reason to unite under the free economy ideology, and short-term economic interests of individual countries have come into serious conflict. Compared to the Japan-U.S. Structural Impediments Initiative talks, the framework talks have evidently been a venue for much greater assertiveness on both sides. This in itself is a sign that the negotiations are being conducted in the Western style. The problems is: While negotiations between the United States and the European countries, no matter how intense they may become, are still conducted with the tacit understanding that this is a game in a ring of shared values, the United Staes feels that negotiating with Japan is an entirely alien game. At this point, Kasumigaseki [the bureaucracy] is beginning to get tough, asserting "if there should be a breakdown in the negotiations, this cannot be helped." Behind this is the overconfident assumption that Japan-U.S. relations have matured to a degree comparable to U.S.-European relations. Negotiators on both side also have to take some of the responsibility. We are disappointed that Under Secretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers and Under Secretary of State Joan E. Spero, who have been quite popular among the Japanese economic circles as believers in free trade, insisted on setting numerical targets. The U.S. trade strategy, the idea of numerical targets, is being opposed by all major U.S. economists, including Professor William R. Cline, Nobel Prize winner for economics. Numerical targets are undoubtedly incompatible with the economists' theories. The defensive stance on the part of Japanese officials, which irritates U.S. negotiators so much, is also at fault. While Japanese officials in charge of economic affairs are sufficiently trained to argue back at their negotiating partners, they have not thought about the serious consequences a deadlock in the negotiations may bring on post-cold war Japan-U.S. relations as a whole. First, negotiators on both sides should go back to the agreement made between Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and President Clinton in July 1993. While some say this was an 11th-hour compromise made during the last days of the Liberal Democratic Party regime, it has to be respected, in any case, because an agreement is an agreement. That agreement says that Japan should aim at "fully meaningful" reduction of its current accounts surplus, and set certain "objective criteria" to gauge market opening in specific sectors. With regard to "objective criteria," the United States demands that the share of foreign products in the Japanese market should be comparable to their share in the other G-7 nations. It claims that this is not a target, but a basis for gauging the openness of the market. However, Japan, from its bitter experience with the Japan- U.S. semiconductor agreement, where market share percentages became the numerical target, remains suspicious. It continues to resist the setting of any criteria that may lead to numerical targets. Global Perspective Needed This is not a time for Japan to just keep on saying "no." If it thinks U.S. demands will lead to managed trade, it has to come up with concrete proposals to open the market which will not lead to managed trade. Now is the time to use our heads to come up not only with counterarguments, but also counterproposals. We also hope that the United States will modify its stance of being preoccupied with numbers. It should not be impatient to see immediate "results," but should seek more long-term results. It is also important that U.S. demands should be in line with efforts to make the Japanese economic system more transparent, and more open. The U.S. attempt to take advantage of Japanese administrative guidance in the automobile sector, and its demand in the insurance sector which virtually goes against the trend of liberalization are quite illogical. It is also questionable that the Clinton administration should allude to the revival of the Super 301 provision in connection with the framework talks. This runs counter to the agreement reached at the Uruguay Round to do away with unilateral trade measures. What is important for both Japan and the United States is to see things from the perspective of how the G-2 (Japan and the United States) should rehabilitate the post-cold war world economy. In a global economy where national boundaries do not exist for goods, money, and information, there is growing interdependence between companies of various nations, while, similarly, conficts tend to be more acute. There can be no stability in the world economy as long as the Japanese and U.S. Governments continue their confrontation. Japan and the United States have to transcend bilateralism to jointly manage the new post-Uruguay Round world economic system. This is not a time for confrontation and talking round in circles. It is high time to reconstruct a globally oriented Japan- U.S. relationship.
