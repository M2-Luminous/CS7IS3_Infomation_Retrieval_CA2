He said that the policy towards countries situated east of Poland should focus on developing good relations with those which were important from the viewpoint of Polish political and economic interests and Polish security. Olechowski stated that the countries of special interest to Poland were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova and Kazakhstan. "We want the climate of our relations with Russia to warm up," the minister told senators. He added that the desired openness and friendliness of relations with Russia would depend on whether Russia respected the strategic option of the Polish foreign policy, ie. Poland's striving to join the European Union, NATO and the Western European Union. Olechowski added that the neo-imperial option in Russian foreign policy had to be regarded as a real threat. He said the independence of Ukraine was of strategic importance for Poland. "We will act in favour of Ukraine's acquiring a position in international relations reflecting her potential," said the minister. Olechowski also voiced support for the process of uniting the west and the east and stressed that by taking part in the Partnership for Peace initiative Poland not only strove for NATO membership, but also wanted to cooperate with Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania. The minister announced Polish support for the development of market relations and democracy in the countries east of Poland. He said he would appoint a commissioner for eastern policy and propose that the government establish a council for eastern policy.
