The most important step was taken during the 1990 elections, and we are currently taking another giant step, because we are taking into account the 1991 elections when, during the First FSLN Congress, we voted for an entire slate of candidates to the National Directorate instead of voting individually. This situation sparked dissatisfaction. Now, for the first time, we have employed individual and secret votes, but we still lack democratic footing within the FSLN. This is shown by the articles that have been written since the results were released. Imagine if those companeros who lost the elections would have spoken at the Olof Palme Convention Center and would have expressed their support for the process after learning the results of the elections to choose the Sandinist Assembly, the National Directorate, the Secretariat General, and others. Would this not have been a superb and beautiful situation? In other words, they should have done the same thing we did when we lost the elections. We accepted our loss, because accepting our loss meant accepting the democratic process. We matched our words with deeds. We did everything democracy dictated. Should I have failed to be reelected, or if should things should have failed to turn out the way I wanted them, then would there be no democracy? I believe their attitude is merely an antidemocratic action that questions democratic logic. [Reporter] Commander, there seems to be leftist sectors that are pleased with the results of the FSLN Congress. They maintain that as a possible 1996 presidential candidate, you have a greater chance of winning than Sergio Ramirez does. Others, however, say you are more stigmatized than the renewal current because of your position in the 1980's. Do you have anything to say about this? [Ortega] We are not forming candidacies here. First, if we believe in polls, the fact is that polls fail to show Ramirez will register a higher preference rating than me. This is a fact. However, this is not the principle that candidacies are built on. The fact that I have a higher preference rating than other companeros such as Sergio Ramirez shows there has been consistency over the years. Nevertheless, it is false that I have a higher rating than Sergio Ramirez. [sentence as heard] One thing is the image we project to the population. There were occasions when Mrs. Chamorro registered higher. But it is another thing when it comes down to whom the people intend to vote for, and here Mrs. Chamorro loses ground. The same thing happens with Dr. Ramirez: He has a high profile, but he also loses ground in the number of people who intend to vote for him. I repeat that these are not parameters that will define the 1996 electoral slate. I believe the parameters will be determined by a national unity program and platform the FSLN must present to the Nicaraguan people. At that time, we will introduce capable people who will head the slate, thereby guaranteeing compliance with the national unity program. This is why we are attempting to reach an understanding, an agreement, and even an alliance with the many socioeconomic sectors of our nation. In other words, we want to strike an alliance with producers, businessmen, and workers. Here, we are talking about COSEP [Higher Council of Private Enterprise], which is a very powerful sector within Nicaraguan society. We are willing to broaden our negotiations and exchange of ideas with COSEP and to reach an agreement to strive for our country's stabilization to ensure that a future government will indeed have a national consensus -- a consensus among producers and workers. [Reporter] Commander, do you want to fire Carlos Fernando Chamorro? [Ortega] Excuse me? [Reporter] Do you want to fire Carlos Fernando Chamorro? [Ortega] He has worked for BARRICADA for 14 years. I believe the main issue at stake here is that no one should cling to a post. I believe no one should hold any position forever. There must be a willingness to renew and strengthen FSLN organizations. However, we are not promoting a policy of firing anyone, and we are not firing anyone. [Reporter] Are there any changes planned in the National Directorate? [Ortega] This is not a topic we are currently discussing within the National Directorate.
