FR940505-2-00159 FR940505-2-00113 ```Offense Statutory Maximum,' for the purposes of this guideline, refers to the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, not including any increase in that maximum term under a sentencing enhancement provision that applies because of the defendant's prior criminal record (such sentencing enhancement provisions are contained, for example, in 21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), (b)(1)(C), and (b)(1)(D)). For example, where the statutory maximum term of imprisonment under 21 U.S.C. §841(b)(1)(C) is increased from twenty years to thirty years because the defendant has one or more qualifying prior drug convictions, the `Offense Statutory Maximum' for the purposes of this guideline is twenty years and not thirty years.''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment defines the term ``offense statutory maximum'' in §4B1.1 to mean the statutory maximum prior to any enhancement based on prior criminal record (i.e., an enhancement of the statutory maximum sentence that itself was based upon the defendant's prior criminal record would not be used in determining the offense level under this guideline). This rule avoids unwarranted double counting as well as unwarranted disparity associated with variations in the exercise of prosecutional discretion in seeking enhanced penalties based on prior convictions. It is noted that when the instruction to the Commission that underlies §4B1.1 (28 U.S.C. 994(h)) was enacted by the Congress in 1984, the enhanced maximum sentences provided for recidivist drug offenders (e.g., under 21 U.S.C. 841) did not exist. 5. Amendment: The Commentary to §5G1.2 is amended in the fourth paragraph by deleting ``3D1.2'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``3D1.1'', and by inserting the following additional sentence at the end: ``Note, however, that even in the case of a consecutive term of imprisonment imposed under subsection (a), any term of supervised release imposed is to run concurrently with any other term of supervised release imposed. See 18 U.S.C. 3624(e).''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment revises the Commentary to §5G1.2 to clarify that the Commission's interpretation is that 18 U.S.C. 3624(e) requires multiple terms of supervised release to run concurrently in all cases. This interpretation is in accord with the view stated in United States v. Gullickson , 982 F.2d 1231, 1236 (8th Cir. 1993). In contrast, two courts of appeals have cited the current commentary as supporting the view that, notwithstanding the language in 18 U.S.C. 3624(e) stating that terms of supervised release run concurrently, a court may order that supervised release terms run consecutively under certain circumstances. See United States v. Shorthouse , 7 F.3d 149 (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Maxwell , 966 F.2d 545, 551 (10th Cir. 1992). 6. Amendment: The Introductory Commentary to Chapter Five, Part H, is amended in the second paragraph by inserting the following additional sentence at the end: ``Furthermore, although these factors are not ordinarily relevant to the determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range, they may be relevant to this determination in exceptional cases. See §5K2.0 (Grounds for Departure).''. Section 5K2.0 is amended by inserting the following additional paragraph as the fourth paragraph: ``An offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination if such characteristic or circumstance is present to an unusual degree and distinguishes the case from the `heartland' cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing.''. Section 5K2.0 is amended by inserting the following commentary at the end: Commentary The last paragraph of this policy statement sets forth the conditions under which an offender characteristic or other circumstance that is not ordinarily relevant to a departure from the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination. The Commission does not foreclose the possibility of an extraordinary case that, because of a combination of such characteristics or circumstances, differs significantly from the `heartland' cases covered by the guidelines in a way that is important to the statutory purposes of sentencing, even though none of the characteristics or circumstances individually distinguishes the case. However, the Commission believes that such cases will be extremely rare. In the absence of a characteristic or circumstance that distinguishes a case as sufficiently atypical to warrant a sentence different from that called for under the guidelines, a sentence outside the guideline range is not authorized. See 18 U.S.C. 3553(b). For example, dissatisfaction with the available sentencing range or a preference for a different sentence than that authorized by the guidelines is not an appropriate basis for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range.''. Reason for Amendment: This amendment provides guidance as to when an offender characteristic or other circumstance (or combination of such characteristics or circumstances) that is not ordinarily relevant to a determination of whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range may be relevant to this determination. Such guidance should enhance consistency in decisions regarding guideline departures. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10782 Filed 5&hyph;4&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE BAC2210&hyph;40&hyph;P
