This idea surfaced in an interview with Prime Minister Esko Aho (Center Party) in Center Party newspaper LALLI yesterday. It was not Aho but the interviewer who brought up the idea, and Aho replied that this is an alternative that has not been ruled out. "I have argued for an earlier date. Here I have been thinking chiefly about September, but now the delay with the decisions means that serious consideration is also being given to a later date." However, according to Aho, 13 November is the latest possible date, otherwise we will be much too close to the Eduskunta election. This takes place in March next year. Aho also thinks that a shared referendum day for Finland and Sweden -- "and why not Norway too" -- would underline the fact that the Nordic countries are in the same position and their decisions are interdependent. According to Aho, this would also have the positive effect of ruling out the domino effect -- so that the referendum result in one country will not influence public opinion in another where the referendum is held at a later date. Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto (Center Party) yesterday told agricultural journalists that he would prefer a referendum after the Swedish poll -- that is, after a date which, according to Aho, is the "last possible date."
