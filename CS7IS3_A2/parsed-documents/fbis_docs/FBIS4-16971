FBIS4-16971 "drsov077_m_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-077 Daily Report 20 Apr 1994 Tajikistan Opposition Leader Urges Provisional Government Opposition Leader Urges Provisional Government LD2004165394 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1347 GMT 20 Apr 94 LD2004165394 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] Leader of the Tajik opposition Akbar Turadjonzoda has stressed the need to create in Tajikistan a provisional government from among those who did not take part in the "internecine war." He was speaking in an INTERFAX interview after the first round of inter-Tajik talks ended in Moscow. The opposition does not seek power, the people should take a decision concerning who should rule on the basis of multi-party elections, said Turadjonzoda. "We stand for close ties with Russia, we understand and recognize its interests in Central Asian. No one can replace Russia as partner of Tajikistan, and Tajikistan cannot exist without Russia, he believes. The opposition leader said that during two-week talks in Moscow the two sides only elaborated the agenda and signed the communique on refugees which envisages their registration and UN aid. The next round of talks will be held in Islamabad (Pakistan) or Tehran (Iran). Turadjonzoda said that UN representatives proposed to start talks on 23-25 May. This, however, does not suit the opposition because this coincides with Moslem holidays. The talks will obviously begin later, he said. He said that difficulties on solving the problem of refugees are caused by the fact that Dushanbe is unable to provide full guarantees for them. Practically 50 per cent of Tajik families have suffered to some degree at the hands of the Dushanbe regime, he said. People do not want to return and live under this regime, said Turadjonzoda. He said that it is necessary to adopt a Tajik Constitution. Not now, as Dushanbe would like, but after the refugees return, he said. A civil war is going on in Tajikistan, a state of emergency imposed and political parties banned. It is impossible to hold elections and referendums under such conditions. This is humiliating for democracy, he said.
