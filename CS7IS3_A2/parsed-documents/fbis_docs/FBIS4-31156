In his view, the creation of the first zones will ensue toward the end of this year, following the appropriate legislative process. Alongside the so-called multifaceted zones, in which we will be particularly concerned to attract investors with large projects, we wish to have zones oriented toward certain specific areas of activity, the minister announced. It will not be the level of investment that is most significant, but the content--that is to say, the know-how, the technological value of the project, and so on. According to the head of the Industry Ministry, neither a lower nor a higher value threshold for investment capital is being set. On the other hand, the quality of the investment, the level of employment, and the ecological character of the investment will have a particular significance. As he revealed, the Mielec area is being considered, among others, inasmuch as it is one of the originators of this idea and an area that fought for it, and, in general, those areas in which there are concentrated large, unexploited assets; for instance, those for the reconstruction of the nuclear power station in Zarnowiec. According to the minister, there is considerable interest among foreign investors. The greatest number of offers comes from the United States. There are also many proposals from Germany, Italy, France, and the Polish capital.
