ITAR-TASS has learned from the Russian Foreign Ministry that while in Yugoslavia he intends to conduct talks on a Bosnian settlement. Vitaliy Churkin, the Russian president's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, will also take part in the talks. In an interview Andrey Kozyrev gave to INTERFAX before his departure, he noted that it was inadmissible that UN peacekeeping forces in Bosnia were becoming a target for attacks. In his view, harshest measures can be taken to defend them, including air strikes.
