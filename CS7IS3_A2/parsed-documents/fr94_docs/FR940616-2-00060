FR940616-2-00060 FR940616-2-00045 All of the identified segments are segments which were listed because of the presence of a fish consumption advisory for mercury or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The MPCA commented that the sole, or primary source of mercury or PCBs to these waterbodies is airborne deposition, and that where control of these sources is outside the State, the State is unable to develop a TMDL. These segments, therefore, are not appropriate candidates for TMDL development at this time. The USEPA agrees that technology based standards imposed under the Clean Air Act which affect sources external to the State of Minnesota may obviate the future need for TMDL development in these waterbodies. A separate list of these waterbody segments can be obtained by contacting the USEPA at the address provided above. It is important to note that not all waterbodies for which fish consumption advisories exist fall into the category discussed above. There are certain waterbodies with fish consumption advisories, and for which TMDLs have been, or can be successfully developed at this time. These are not included in the 245 waterbodies on which the MPCA provided comments. (5) Two other commenters believed that the proposed list is inadequate because it fails to identify all water quality limited segments within the State of Minnesota. Where the State has failed to do so, one of the commenters stated there is a mandatory duty to identify all water quality-limited segments, and include them on the list of waterbodies for which TMDL development is appropriate. The USEPA interprets section 303(d) to require the identification of water quality-limited waterbodies for which TMDLs are appropriate. Such identification is to be based on existing and readily available data (40 CFR 130.7(b)(5)); consequently, there are no requirements within the Statute for additional monitoring or analysis. Since 40 CFR 130.7(d)(1) requires the biennial submission of revised section 303(d) lists to the USEPA for approval, this provision recognizes, that information will become available in the future, which can be used to revise and update the decisions made under section 303(d). This provision supports the USEPA's position that current listings should be based on currently available information. The submission every 2 years of a section 303(d) list addresses this issue by allowing changes to the lists to reflect additional identification of impaired waterbodies, and allows for removal of waterbodies once standards are attained or TMDLs developed. Pursuant to section 305(b) of the CWA, States must prepare, on a biennial basis, a report to Congress which assesses the status of State waters. 40 CFR 130.7(b)(5) explicitly states that the section 305(b) report should be considered when developing the section 303(d) list. In preparation of the December 8, 1993, proposed list, Minnesota's 1992 305(b) report was extensively used. All waterbodies listed as impaired in Appendix 1 of that report were considered for listing. For reasons provided in the December 8, 1992, FR notice, specific comments received in response to that notice, and elsewhere in this notice some waterbodies that were listed as impaired in the Fiscal Year 1992 section 305(b) report were not included in today's list. (6) One commenter stated that even if the only available data are older than five years, if those data indicate water quality impairments, then the subject waterbodies should be listed on the section 303(d) list. Throughout its regulations and guidance the USEPA has consistently stated that all information should be used to develop a section 303(d) list. In using available information, however, it is imperative to consider its accuracy in order to assure that technically defensible determinations can be developed. The USEPA believes that data that are older than five years, or impairment assessments based on a subjective analysis, carry a large degree of uncertainty as to whether the impairment is still valid. As such information of this kind must be considered in light of all available information and cannot represent a prima facie basis for listing.
