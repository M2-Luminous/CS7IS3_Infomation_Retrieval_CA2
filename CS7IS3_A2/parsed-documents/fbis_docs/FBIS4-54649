[Szajer] Our strategy has been ready for a year, a strategy according to which a liberal center must be created in Hungary that can compete with the socialists and the conservatives from a position of power. A lot of things happened in one year and during the election campaign, but this strategy has stood the test of time. Thus, our predictions proved to be correct. [Pinter] The present Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] is not identical with the Fidesz of one year ago. In your view, where are the changes? [Szajer] First of all, our positions have changed. For a long time, the Hungarian public saw competition and confrontation between the coalition and the opposition parties. In the first months of 1993 one could already notice a decrease in the support of the current government parties and, thus, these forces will not achieve good results in the upcoming elections. A strong competition emerged among the opposition parties in the wake of this recognition. There were also internal causes behind this struggle. The Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] overcame its previous crisis and, as a result, it emerged as an offensive party. As for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], the public freed this party of the stigma of the post-communist party at about the same time. The revival of these two parties changed the internal relations between the opposition parties, and we can no longer start from the premise that the Fidesz is the only party that is constantly increasing its popularity. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Under what influence have you modified your views on national and religious matters in the past one year? [Szajer] I cannot agree with the statement formulated in this question, because the Fidesz has not changed its position regarding national and religious matters. However, under the effect of previous attacks, we definitely had to change our communication, namely we informed the public much more frequently and in much more detail about our views. During our congress held in April 1993, Viktor Orban openly declared that the Fidesz is a national-oriented liberal party. For a long time, we thought that national commitment is so natural for us that there is no need to mention it separately. From the very beginning, the fate of the Hungarian nation and of the ethnic Hungarian minority living beyond our borders has been an indivisible element of our policy. Many people made use of the fact that we refrained from constantly declaring this, and many people tried to create the impression that the Fidesz is not interested in these matters. We could no longer tolerate this, and we put adequate emphasis on our position. [passage omitted] [Pinter] What image does the cooperation of the Fidesz, the SZDSZ, the Agrarian Alliance, and the Liberal Civic Alliance Entrepreneurs' Party provide about the power of liberalism in Hungary? [Szajer] Liberalism enjoys public support and basis in Hungary. It also has a task in Hungary, because we have to carry out a modernization here that actually creates a liberal bourgeois democracy. There are obvious and firm differences between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ, but common interests are the basis of every cooperation between political parties, including the cooperation between the Fidesz and the SZDSZ. If we are unable to preserve the unity of the liberal coalition, this might threaten the implementation of our long-term plans. The current struggle will decide the determining power on the Hungarian political arena for years, or even for decades. The SZDSZ was the strong liberal party in 1990, and it failed to come up with a strong liberal alternative against the conservatives despite the weak left at the time. Given its increased power, the Fidesz has a considerable responsibility in 1994. If it fails to come up with a strong liberal alternative against the socialists despite the current weakness of the conservatives, liberalism will hardly become the power to determine the Hungarian policy in the long term. We must now become one of the constant and major players in the political rotation. [passage omitted] [Pinter] Dominance means a determining force in the political jargon, but not an exclusive force. In your opinion, could a liberal-dominant coalition emerge now, a coalition also including the socialists? [Szajer] Only if the socialist presence is totally insignificant. [Pinter] In your opinion, could such a coalition emerge after the elections? [Szajer] The election predictions do not show this. The socialists will most probably have more power than to agree to participate in such a coalition. Under these circumstances, the Fidesz does not regard the MSZP as a coalition partner. [Pinter] What if the SZDSZ does regard them as such? [Szajer] We cannot exclude this possibility either. However, in that case, no one should delude himself that he is a member of a so-called social-liberal coalition. In that case, a liberal party participates as a subordinate of a socialist-dominated government. During the change in the regime, the SZDSZ showed considerable firmness against the forces that are now making up the MSZP. SZDSZ members would probably find it rather difficult to accept such a change in direction. At its inception, the Fidesz was a strong anti-Communist party, but a civilized party that always took Hungary's future into consideration. We will definitely preserve this character of our party. If we gave up our intentions, we would become a valueless player in political life and we would morally disintegrate. We are not preparing for this; instead, we are preparing for a determining liberal role. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In your opinion, what are the prospects of the parties of the present coalition? [Szajer] They have a certain basis and, just as in 1990, they will again gather mainly votes on their lists. The Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] will make it into Parliament, but only Jozsef Torgyan's Smallholders' Party has a chance. The conservative pole has become weak and it will not play a considerable role. According to our predictions, the liberals will govern and the conservatives and the socialists will be in opposition. [passage omitted] [Pinter] In the case of a possible opposition role, how would the Fidesz assert its political responsibility? [Szajer] The entire political program of the Fidesz relies on the fact that the SZDSZ gets into power. If this fails to materialize, from the first moment of our new opposition status, we will start preparing for the next elections, namely for governing. Our party's logic will not change, only our possibilities for implementing our policy will be more limited. In the opposition, our task remains to show the citizens what we would do differently from the government. Therefore, we do not have to prepare specially for an opposition strategy. [Pinter] If you get into the government, what changes would you initiate in Parliament regarding the future relations with the opposition? [Szajer] One should not mix up the government party and opposition roles. We must cooperate closely with the opposition only on really all-national issues and issues regarding our constitutional order. The opposition should continue its task of clearly analyzing the government policy. [passage omitted]
