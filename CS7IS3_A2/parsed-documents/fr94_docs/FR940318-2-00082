FR940318-2-00082 FR940318-2-00064 H. Notification Under Executive Order 12372 This program is covered under Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs,'' and 45 CFR part 100, ``Intergovernmental Review of Department of Health and Human Services Programs and Activities.'' Under the Order, States may design their own processes for reviewing and commenting on proposed Federal assistance under covered programs. All States and Territories except Alaska, Alabama, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, American Samoa and Palau have elected to participate in the Executive Order (E.O.) process and have established Single Points of Contact (SPOCs). Applicants from these seventeen jurisdictions need take no action regarding E.O. 12372. Otherwise, applicants should contact their SPOCs as soon as possible to alert them of the prospective applications and to receive any necessary instructions. Applicants must submit any required material to the SPOCs as soon as possible so that the program office can obtain and review SPOC comments as part of the award process. It is imperative that the applicant submit all required materials, if any, to the SPOC and indicate the date of this submittal (or the date of contact if no submittal is required) on the Standard Form 424, item 16a. Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from this application deadline date to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards. SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official state process recommendations which they intend to trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule. When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services, Division of State Assistance, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447. A list of the Single Points of Contact for each State and Territory is included as Attachment A of this announcement. I. Paperwork Reduction Act Under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96&hyph;511, all Departments are required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting or record-keeping requirement inherent in a proposed or final rule, or program announcement. This program announcement contains information collection requirements in sections (F) and (G), which require that certain information must be provided in an annual report and as part of a grantee's application. We estimate that all of the information requirements for this program will take each grantee approximately 6 hours to complete. As there are 53 projected grantees, the total number of hours annually will be 318. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirement should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New Executive Office Building (room 308), Washington, DC, 20503, Attention: Desk Officer for the Administration for Children and Families. J. Certifications Applicants must comply with the required certifications found at Attachments B, C, and D, as follows: Pursuant to 45 CFR part 93, the Anti-Lobbying Certification and Disclosure Form must be signed and submitted with the application. If applicable, a standard form LLL, which discloses lobbying payments must be submitted. Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and Certification Regarding Debarment: The signature on the application by a Coalition official responsible for the administration of the program attests to the applicant's intent to comply with the Drug-Free Workplace Requirements and compliance with the Debarment Certification. The Drug-Free Workplace and Debarment Certifications do not have to be returned with the application.
