Getachew Mulat, 25, a native of the Ethiopian province of Gojan and a Coptic Christian, told authorities after he surrendered that he had been an Army officer under the regime of Mengistu Haile-Mariam and belonged to a rival clan of the ruling power in Addis Ababa. He accused the current regime of Zenawi Meli of being "a dictatorship that had stripped Ethiopians of their freedom." Getachew hijacked the Ethiopian Airlines flight 972 heading from Dakar to Addis Ababa, with stops in Bamako and Niamey, shortly after it took off Saturday at 8:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) and ordered it flown to Rome. Witnesses on board said he was armed with a switchblade but never threatened any of the 32 passengers and was calm throughout the entire episode. He repeatedly insisted on being flown to Rome, where there is a large Ethiopian community, and said he would surrender on landing. True to his word, Getachew gave himself up shortly after the plane touched down at Ciampino Airport near Rome at 3:30 a.m. (0230 GMT). Authorities said they allowed the aircraft to land as it only had enough fuel left for 10 more minutes of flying. Getachew was immediately taken in for questioning and was to be charged with hijacking. Addis Alam, the Ethiopian ambassador in Rome who spoke with Getachew, described him as a desperate man. "He claimed to have committed this act for political reasons and not as a militant act for a specific organisation," Addis said. Authorities who questioned Getachew said he appeared to be very religious and wore a wooden cross around his neck. They said he also carried several Copt religious books in his suitcase. Five Ethiopians, also seeking political asylum, hijacked an Ethiopian Airlines plane to Rome in August 1992. They were sentenced to four and a half years in prison. No one was hurt in the 1992 hijacking.
