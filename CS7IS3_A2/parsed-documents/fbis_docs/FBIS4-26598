Beijing is the political and cultural center of China as well as a center in which China contacts with foreign countries. To meet the demand of this nature, Beijing has built, over the past 40 years or so, some 10 million square meters of buildings for the use of administrative organs, foreign affairs offices, cultural and sports centers, scientific research institutes, and institutions of higher learning. Since the commencement of reform and opening up, Beijing has also built a number of modernized guesthouses, hotels, diplomatic apartments, and office buildings, that are mainly used to do business with and serve foreign firms and nationals. The building of these administrative, cultural, and international contacting facilities has strengthened the function as the capital, and, at the same time, promoted the development of the secondary and tertiary industries. From 1949 to 1993, Beijing's industrial output value rose from 170 million yuan to 125.6 billion yuan, and the volume of retail sales of commodities rose from 280 million yuan to 54.9 billion yuan, thus having greatly enhanced the economic strength of Beijing. Meanwhile, Beijing expanded the scope of the areas under its jurisdiction on five occasions, with the total area expanding from 707 square km to 16,800 square km and with the area of plan-covered urban districts developing to 1,040 square km. Beijing's permanent population increased from 4.14 million to 10.51 million, of which, the permanent population in urban areas increased from 1.76 million to 6.65 million. The total floor space of houses of various kinds increased from 20.50 million square meters to 220 million square meters, of which, the floor space of residences in urban areas increased from 13.54 million square meters to 115 million square meters. Cities are the carrier of economic and social development. The more rapidly the economy and society develop, the higher is the demand on urban construction. For a municipal government, a very important duty is to beef up urban construction with a view to providing conditions and service for the development of all professions and trades. Since urban construction touches upon a multitude of things and trades, it is necessary to give prominence to key trades and use them to bring along non-key ones. Viewing from the practice in the past and from the development in the future, we must, in the content of construction, accelerate the building of urban infrastructure and residences, and, in the links of work, successfully grasp urban planning and the reform of urban construction economic structure. Then, I want to give a brief speech on these four issues. 1. On the Issue of Firmly and Unswervingly Putting the Construction of Urban Infrastructure in the First Place of Urban Construction Urban infrastructure is the ordinary condition for the production of materials and for the livelihood of the people and is the foundation on which a city depends to exist and develop. If a plant is cut off from communications, posts and telecommunications, water, coal, electricity, gas, and heat facilities, its production will be in a state of chaos and even stop. If a family is cut off from these facilities, it will feel very inconvenient in livelihood and even be unable to lead a life. These facilities are even more frequently utilized and consumed by guesthouses, hotels, and shopping centers. A city will be at a standstill if it is cut off from these facilities for a short while and will be at a low ebb if being cut off from these facilities for a long period of time. In a certain period before the commencement of reform and opening up, Beijing failed to put the construction of urban infrastructure in a due place, and, therefore, it suffered, like other big, medium-sized, and small cities in the country, the shortages of communications, postal, and telecommunications facilities, the insufficient supply of water, electricity, gas, and heat, poor environmental conditions, and the low ability in guarding against natural calamities. Over the past 10 years or so since the implementation of the reform and open policies, Beijing has regarded the construction of urban infrastructural facilities as the primary task for urban construction. Over the past 14 years, Beijing has invested 29.3 billion yuan in fixed assets of urban infrastructural facilities, an increase of 270 percent over the figure in the past 30 years before 1979. A group of key basic transportation, postal and telecommunications, energy resource, water supply and drainage, environmental, and disaster-combating projects have been built. Although Beijing has rapidly developed the urban infrastructural facilities, it is still confronted with some difficulties. To be an internationally modernized large city, Beijing should rely on the diversion of water from south to north in order to ensure the supply of water for the urban areas, place hope on Shaanxi's natural gas supply in order to ensure the supply of gas for the urban areas, and vigorously develop underground railway tracks and light railway tracks in order to alleviate the traffic jams. A considerable number of capital must be spent in these huge projects. Thus, the burden is heavy. We have not found more feasible countermeasures for resolving some of the difficulties, such as central heat supply and garbage disposal. To this end, the construction of urban infrastructural facilities should be regarded as a priority in urban construction. We have to do so not only in the past and at present but also in the future. 2. On the Issue of Improving the Living Standards A stable life can set the people's minds at rest. When living in peace, the people can work in contentment. Only when the people live and work in peace and contentment will society be stable, there be a relaxed environment for reform, and the economic and social development ceaselessly be elevated to a new height. Therefore, Beijing has paid full attention to the construction of residential houses. Since the founding of the PRC, Beijing has built more than 100 million square meters of residential houses, accounting for more than 50 percent of the municipality's total houses. Particularly, since the implementation of the reform and open policies, the municipality has expanded the dynamics of developing new areas and rebuilding old towns. So, more than 5 million square meters of residential houses were built annually, and about 80,000 to 100,000 households moved to new houses every year. As of the end of 1993, there were 115 million square meters of urban residential houses, and the per capita land use areas reached 12.5 square meters. More than 90 percent of the households attained the level of "being seperately accommodated." In the past three years, the municipality completely solved the problems for the households with housing difficulties whose per capita housing area was less than 2 square meters. Through reconstruction of the houses in dangerous conditions, the municipality solved the housing problems for 56,000 households whose houses were in dangerous conditions. More than 70 percent of the houses are built with their own kitchens and toilets. The interior designs have been developed toward the orientation of "large living rooms, kitchens, rest rooms, small bedrooms, and more closets." Through overall development, the municipality has strengthened the construction of auxiliary facilities. Thus, the living environment has noticeably improved. But, the urban permanent population has increased by 4.89 million due to the rapid development of the urban areas in the municipality since the founding of the PRC. Along with the long-term implementation of the low-rent welfare housing system, nearly 200,000 households are still living in the conditions that per capita living space is less than 4 square meters, and more than 8 million square meters of dangerous and shabby houses are in urgent need of reconstruction. Some 100,000 urban permanent population will increase with each passing year in the future. So, the municipality's strained housing situation is extremely serious. The central authorities set forth the requirement for being comparatively well-off by 2000. The municipal party committee and government set forth the requirement for being fairly well-off three years ahead of schedule, including that for being fairly well-off in the housing conditions. There are three standards for being fairly well-off in the housing conditions. First, the per capita housing area reaches 14 square meters. Second, more than 80 percent of the houses are built with their own kitchens and toilets. Third, the problems that the per capita housing area is under 4 square meters should completely be solved, and the problems that the per capita housing areas are less than 5 or 6 square meters should partially be solved. It is more difficult to attain the third standard. The key to attaining this standard hinges on that whether or not the housing problems for the households with low and medium-level incomes can be solved. To this end, we should focus our efforts on grasping the following two tasks in the foreseeable future. First, we should carry out the project to provide comfortable houses. On the one hand, we should do a good job in registering and verifying the low and medium-income households which have housing difficulties, clarifying who and where they are and their number. On the other hand, work responsibilities should be assigned to every level of different departments and different areas to build and collect housing resources through five channels. Housing construction funds should be shared by the government, the work units, and individuals, with the government responsible for the 10 categories of local construction taxes and fees, individuals purchasing houses in line with the housing reform policies, and work units paying for the differential between the construction cost and the purchasing price. Meanwhile, it has been stipulated that development companies or housing construction units responsible for developing and building the houses to resolve people's housing difficulties and provide them with comfortable houses are not allowed to make profits. In spite of this, there are still some individuals and units who cannot afford to pay for the houses. In addition to the long-term mortgage loans and the housing construction loans provided to individuals and work units, respectively, we are studying the plans for resolving the housing difficulties of the second batch of households through adjustment. Second, we should speed up the renovation of dilapidated houses. Many low and medium-income households with housing difficulties are living in dilapidated housing areas with few houses and a poor living environment. As early as 1990, the municipal government put forward a principle to renovate the dilapidated houses, which called for shifting the housing construction focus from development of new areas to a combination of new area development with renovation of dilapidated houses; placing the leadership work for renovation of dilapidated houses mainly on district and county governments; and coordinating renovation of dilapidated houses with the development of new areas, with real estate business, with housing reform, and with the protection of the styles and features of the ancient capital. Over the past three years and more, 1.5 million square meters of dilapidated houses have been pulled down, and 2.16 million square meters of houses built to enable 56,000 households to move to new houses already or in the near future. The renovation has become more and more difficult, and continuous study is needed to solve new problems and put forward new countermeasures. If the urban plan is not further improved, it will be difficult to develop the essence and discard the dross of the old city. If construction of urban infrastructural facilities and key projects is not accelerated, it will be difficult to possess even the minimum conditions for the renovation. If reform and opening up are not expanded, it will be difficult to gain the land price differential through real estate business, to make the state, the work units, and individuals to share the burdens through housing reform, to draw in investment from abroad for our projects, and to raise funds for the renovation. 3. The Issue of Developing the "Leading" Role of the Urban Plan The healthy development and the fairly great achievements in Beijing's urban construction are attributed to a fairly mature and continuously improved overall urban construction plan. As early as 1950's, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, and other revolutionaries of the older generation gave instructions on many occasions on Beijing's construction, planning, development, and other major issues. Since the third plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping and other party and state leaders, the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, and the State Council have given explicit instructions on the principles for Beijing's construction. The State Council again officially approved the revised "Beijing overall urban construction plan" on 6 October 1993 and promulgated it for implementation on 21 February 1994. The new overall plan draws a trans-century grand blueprint of Beijing's urban construction and development of other undertakings and defines the target to be attained, namely to bring Beijing's social development and its overall economic as well as scientific and technological strength up to or surpass in some areas the levels of the capital cities of medium developed countries by 2010 so as to lay a solid foundation for building Beijing into a first-rate modern international city by the middle of the 21st century. The current task is implementation. For this, we should conduct propaganda and education to make the vast number of leading cadres and people in all walks of life clearly understand that the State Council's written reply and the new overall plan are the programmatic and authoritative documents on Beijing's construction and that it is necessary to embrace the idea of subordinating local interest to overall interest and immediate interest to long-term interest and to guide and promote the implementation of the overall plan in line with the needs of the socialist market economy. Meanwhile, legal, administrative, and economic means should be adopted to strengthen the management of the plan. Only in this way can we implement this scientific plan to the letter and enable it to play a leading role in guiding urban construction and management. 4. On the Issue of Accelerating the Reform of the Economic Systems Concerning Urban Construction As an organic body, cities have their objective operating mechanism. Therefore, there should be a set of economic systems concerning urban construction that are suitable for the mechanism of cities. Urban construction consumes a huge amount of money. From where does the money come? Under the planned economic system, the unified state allocations and collections were carried out, thus resulting in too much debts and cities being operated in an inefficient and disorderly manner. Under the market economic system, we should make great effort to gradually transit from the unified state allocations and collections to self-allocation and self-collection, to effect a favorable cycle of input and output, and to make cities have a complete and sound organism and reach an efficient and orderly state of operation. To realize this transition, we should, in the course of continuously carrying out various reforms in urban areas, strengthen the reform of economic systems concerning urban construction. The focus of this reform is to reform three systems and establish five markets. The first system that should be reformed is the urban infrastructure investment system. In the form of investment compensation, urban infrastructure can be divided into three categories: The first category is the compensation by society. This category of facilities, such as urban roads, rainwater drainage facilities, natural calamities prevention facilities, and urban green lands, cannot be calculated and their charges cannot be collected from users. Thus, the cost should be borne by the whole society through perfection of tax revenue systems. The other category is the compensation by markets. The facilities covered by this category include water, coal, electricity, gas, and heat supply facilities. The products provided by this category of facilities can all be calculated and thus the cost should be borne by consumers through the exchange at equal value on markets. Another category is the compound compensation. This category include public traffic means and sewage discharge and treatment facilities. The first investment in such facilities should be borne by society, while their regular operating expenses should be borne by markets. Touching upon tax revenue reform and pricing reform, the reforms in all categories of urban infrastructure will meet grave difficulties and it is impossible to accomplish them at one step. However, the later these systems are reformed, the graver the waste is, and the more losses the state will sustain. Only when the normal and stable investment sources are ensured for the above three categories of urban facilities, the banking credit can be brought into full play. With a long service life, urban basic facilities are built by one generation but will bring benefit to several generations. With the banking credit as the lever, the funds for building these facilities can be raised by one generation but be paid back by several generations. The second system that should be reformed is the land- use system. Only when we transfer land-use rights with compensation can we make the most of land resources, can we withdraw the profit gained from the grade difference of land, that originally belong to the government, and can we attain the goal that what is taken from the land is used in the interests of the city. No longer should we beg for food by holding a golden bowl in our hands. The third system that should be reformed is the housing system. In this reform, we should mainly depend on the efforts of the state and units, and then on the efforts of individuals. The best way is to sell public houses to workers and staff. This reform touches upon the interests and the renewal of concepts of numerous households and upon the reforms of financial system and wage system of enterprises, administrative units, and institutions. Thus, it goes without saying that there will be grave difficulties in this reform. However, without reform, there would be no way out. The five markets that should be established include the real estate market, the building materials and equipment market, the project bidding market, the building laborers markets, and the technological information market. At present, we should, on the one hand, strengthen the management function of the government and regulate the markets and should, on the other hand, perfect various rules and regulations and standardize markets. Particularly, we must make the real estate market more visible to the public and make known to the public all the transaction behaviors and transaction links. Otherwise, there is no end of trouble for the future. The above opinions are offered for your common discussion, and your comments are welcomed for those which are inappropriate.
