At the meeting attended by the rabble in charge of national security, the bastards recklessly found fault with us and babbled that they must increase the preparedness for immediate reaction to unconventional warfare, strengthen the total defense system involving the people, the government, and the military, and conduct exercises in a real combat situation for unconventional warfare to counter a so-called provocation. This is the repetition of the old tune of the preceding dictators and an intolerable challenge to us, who are persistently making efforts for peace in the country and its reunification. As everyone knows, traitors Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u, the previous dictators, talked about the so-called anti-espionage operations or someone else's provocations and loudly talked as if we would launch a southward invasion at once. The people of the world acknowledge that we have never launched a southward invasion and that threats of aggression come from the South to the North, not from the North to the South. The Kim Yong-sam regime, which calls itself a civilian government, repeats the old tune which has already been sung. This means the Kim Yong-sam regime is no different from the preceding military fascist dictatorships. Learning from the preceding dictators, it does so to justify its maneuvers to prepare for a war of northward invasion under the pretext of someone else's nonexistent provocation. All fellow countrymen in the North and South and abroad are filled with a resolve to make this year a year when they will achieve great national unity and open a new phase in the fatherland's reunification. They also expect that in step with the fellow countrymen's heightened ardor for reunification, North-South relations will be led to detente and peace. Meanwhile, through several rounds of contacts, the DPRK and the United States have removed a series of obstacles that had deadlocked DPRK-U.S. talks and achieved a breakthrough to make progress in the talks. When bright prospects have opened for peace in the country and its reunification, the Kim Yong-sam ring is using the old tune, which the preceding dictators chanted over and over again, as a means to aggravate North-South tensions and embarking on a road toward confrontation. From the very beginning of new year, the South Korean warmongers found fault with us and recklessly made bellicose remarks about immediate punishment or complete military preparedness. This is no accident. The Kim Yong-sam ring decided that strengthening the total defense system involving the people, the government, and the military and conducting exercises in a real combat situation for unconventional warfare will be the goal of the so-called anti- espionage operations this year. This means that it will conduct larger-scale war exercises this year. A few while ago, the South Korean puppets babbled that they would conduct a large-scale joint military exercise, a combination of the Ulchi and Focus Lens military exercises, with the United States in August in case they discontinue the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Facts show the Kim Yong-sam regime is a group of warmongers and an antinational group that follows the preceding military fascist groups' footsteps. The South Korean puppets are rushing toward confrontation and war, not national reconciliation and unity, this year. The reason is clear. The bastards are facing a serious crisis in their rule. The Kim Yong-sam ring has loudly babbled about reforms, talking as if they would do something. However, nothing has changed in South Korea. Rather, fascist suppression has been stepped up, a worse economic catastrophe and greater difficulties have been inflicted on the people. Not only the people's struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification but also the workers' strikes have been suppressed brutally, and as a result of the treacherous opening of the rice market, 6 million peasants, agriculture, and the overall economy are threatened with a catastrophe. Moreover, the Naktong and Han Rivers and other rivers have been contaminated, and, therefore, numerous people face difficulties in getting potable water. Therefore, the South Korean people call the Kim Yong-sam regime a civilian fascist or non-civilian regime and participate in the antigovernment struggle to overthrow the bastards. Flustered at this, the Kim Yong-sam ring is trying to divert the people's attention somewhere else by talking as if we would launch a southward aggression at once, thus, inspiring a sense of urgency. However, this is a foolish dream. No one will be deceived by the theory of threats of southward invasion, which has already been done before. The Kim Yong-sam ring's reckless war maneuvers will further inspire the South Korean people's resistance. The Kim Yong-sam ring must ponder over grave consequences from its reckless war maneuvers, act with discretion, and leave office without delay.
