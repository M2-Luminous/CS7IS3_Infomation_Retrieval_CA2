The most important document that the Western mass media refers to is based on former American spy Lester Coleman's allegations that since former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher implies in her book of memoirs that Libya is innocent, therefore Iran is the main culprit in the explosion. [passage omitted] In weaving their tale, the Western press also alleges that since the condenser on the time bomb used on the Pan American aircraft was similar to a condenser that was sold to East Germany by a Swiss company in 1985--three years before the Lockerbie explosion--and since Ahmad Jibril--whom they believe to be responsible for the crash--had good relations with East Germany, Iran, and Syria, therefore Tehran and Damascus are directly involved in the incident. [passage omitted] On the basis of Zionist propaganda, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria are the main elements behind the American plane crash; and according to this propaganda, the reason why Iran and Syria have not been prosecuted as the main culprits so far is because this has not been deemed politically advisable because the United States needed Syria in the war against Iraq and it now needs Syria to advance the Middle East peace plan. Therefore, this is why only Libya was the target of American anger and UN sanctions. [passage omitted] Political observers believe that the current propaganda is directly linked with the Islamic Republic's defense of the aspirations of the Palestinian people and that the fresh Zionist propaganda against Iran after a five-year silence should be discussed within the context of the intensification of the Palestinian people's struggles and the continuation of the Intifadah in the occupied territories. The United States and world Zionism have always considered Iran to be the main obstacle to the Middle East peace talks. Also, the United States considers its major regional policy to be the isolation of Iran and the portrayal of an ugly and harsh face of Iran so that the way can be paved for isolating Iran on the one hand and for perpetrating numerous crimes on the other, especially when one analyzes the downing of the Iranian passenger plane over the Persian Gulf. [passage omitted] Apparently the Americans intend to pave the way for more instigations in the region through the contrivance of their agents. But the American statesmen should not forget the disgrace they have suffered in Somalia.
