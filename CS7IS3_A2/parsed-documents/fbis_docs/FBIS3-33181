At the closing of 1993, Ciego de Avila Province had 12 biogas units in use and it is expected that they will increase that figure as part of the generalization of an initiative that is being implemented in that province. The biogas plants use leftovers obtained from sugar mills or cattle manure to produce methane gas which is used for cooking at work center cafeterias and homes, for lighting at dairy farms, as well as in the metallurgic industry. The largest biogas plant in Cuba was built on the island of Turiguano and it has the capacity of generating 2,000 cubic meters of methane gas per day through the process of fermenting the manure obtained from a nearby cattle ranch.
