FR940112-0-00069 FR940112-0-00020 We considered that the Conference Report language (which characterizes the first phase of implementation as embodying the existing policy) could justify continuing the current, all-inclusive policy for the day before admission, or even expanding it to apply to the second and third day before admission as well. This approach would not require identifying any services as being related to the admission and would not require separating out from the inpatient payment any of the services not related to the admission that are furnished on the day before admission (all services_regardless of whether the services are related to the admission_are currently included in the inpatient payment under the existing policy). This approach would also enhance the program savings to be realized from the 3-Day Payment Window provision, since it folds into the inpatient payment a greater range of preadmission services that, as a consequence, would not receive a separate payment under Part B. Finally, by maximizing the services to be included in the Part A payment for the subsequent admission, this approach would clearly be advantageous to beneficiaries who are eligible only for Part A; further, even beneficiaries who are eligible for both Parts A and B would be able to avoid incurring the Part B deductible and coinsurance charges to the maximum extent possible. However, we note that adopting such an all-inclusive approach for the second and third days before admission is contrary to the clear language of the new law, which is worded specifically in terms of ``other services related to the admission.'' Furthermore, we have determined that continuing this approach indefinitely even for the day before admission only would appear to be inconsistent with the new law's implementation provisions; unlike phases two and three, phase one contains both a starting date and an ending date. We believe this indicates that Congress intended for the existing, all-inclusive policy to remain in effect, but only during the finite period between those two dates. After considering these various factors, we have determined that services (other than diagnostic services) furnished on the second and third days before admission must be related to the admission in order to come under the 3-Day Payment Window provision. Further, we have determined that effective with services furnished on or after October 1, 1991 (upon the expiration of the first phase of implementation), this qualification will become applicable to non-diagnostic services furnished on the day before admission as well. We believe that this approach most accurately reflects the intent of the statutory language of the new provision. We realize that, under this approach, the payment made under Part A, which currently includes the cost of all non-diagnostic services furnished on the day before admission, will no longer include non-diagnostic services unless they are related to the admission. However, consistent with the Conference Report language set out above, we have to date made no DRG payment adjustments to reflect the effects of the 3-Day Payment Window provision. For purposes of this provision, we are defining ``other services related to the admission'' as those non-diagnostic services furnished in connection with the diagnosis (that is, the principal diagnosis) that requires the beneficiary to be admitted as an inpatient. We considered defining this term more broadly to include services furnished in connection with secondary diagnoses as well; however, secondary diagnoses can sometimes include complicating events that do not occur until after admission. Since the law specifies that this provision is to apply to services related to the inpatient ``admission'' (as opposed to the ensuing inpatient stay), we believe that it is more accurate to use only the principal diagnosis, as identifying those preadmission services that are related to the actual cause of admission. Further, the statutory language charges the Secretary with defining those non-diagnostic services that are regarded as ``related to the admission'' and, thus, are subject to the payment window. In effect, this gives the Secretary the authority to determine the scope of the payment window's applicability to non-diagnostic services. In this context, we have determined that ambulance services are not subject to the payment window, even when furnished during the preadmission period by the admitting hospital or by an entity that it wholly owns or operates. The House Budget Committee Report accompanying the payment window legislation explained that the underlying objective of this provision is ``* * * to curb further unbundling which has occurred since the introduction of the DRG payment system * * *'' (H.R. Budget Comm. Rep. No. 881, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 250 (1990).) As a Part B benefit, ambulance services (unlike patient transportation services furnished to inpatients) are not bundled with inpatient services and, thus, have not been subject to the actions taken to maximize payment under PPS, which prompted Congress's concern. Thus, we believe that ambulance services are distinct from the type of hospital services that Congress designed the payment window provision to address. Many hospitals that operate ambulance services do so at a loss. The hospitals continue to furnish the ambulance services primarily as a means of assuring access to hospital care for individuals who otherwise would be unable to reach hospitals. Subjecting hospitals that operate ambulance services to still greater fiscal constraints under the payment window provision could have a major adverse impact on their availability, particularly in remote rural areas. Therefore, in this rule, we are defining the preadmission services that are subject to the payment window provision as not including ambulance services.
