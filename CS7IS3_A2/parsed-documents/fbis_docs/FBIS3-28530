Speaking at the function, Mr Nguyen Ngoc Tran, chairman of the Central Board for Overseas Vietnamese said that about 180,000 Vietnamese overseas had returned to the homeland for Tet and for investment opportunities in 1993, compared to little more than 100,000 for the Tet of last year. He said that their activities to contribute to national renovation have become more and more practical and fruitful. By the end of 1993, overseas Vietnamese had 30 projects licensed by the Vietnamese Government capitalized at tens of millions of US dollars. They mostly deal with electronics, chemicals, tourism, services, agriculture, forestry, fishery and soft drinks. They also have contributed to the transfer of modern technology to the country in several fields. Many consultative ideas from overseas Vietnamese have been considered valuable by government offices in the fields of education and training, science and technology, finance, banking tourism and administration. After Tet, a number of overseas Vietnamese experts will return to the homeland to attend a conference on Vietnam's university education renovation with their colleagues here. According to Mr Tran, more than 2 million Vietnamese have settled in 70 countries. There are about 1 million in the United States, 200,000 in France, 150,000 in Canada, 130,000 in Australia and 85,000 in Germany. Around 400,000 of them have got university or post graduate degrees and some are holding key positions in many branches of sciences, technology and management. Overseas Vietnamese remittance to their families constitutes an important source of foreign exchange. Total import-export turnover of companies owned by overseas Vietnamese is estimated at around USD 4-6 million a year. In order to broaden the overseas Vietnamaese participation in economic and technical development programmes in the country, the government is preparing to establish an overseas Vietnamese bank, a centre of training and technology transfer staffed by overseas Vietnamese and also so form of non-governmental consultancy mechanism of overseas Vietnamese.
