A final decision on this will be made by the Rukh National Convention scheduled for 16 April. The incumbent President Leonid Kravchuk said originally that he would not run for presidency because he disagreed with the timing of the elections. He said that if a new parliament was not elected within the month while the president was engaged in an electoral campaign the country might find itself "without authorities." Another possible candidate, former prime minister Leonid Kuchma, intends to announce his decision later. Kravchuk won over 60 percent of the votes and Chornovil, nearly 28 percent in Ukraine's first presidential elections in December 1991. Kuchma did not run then.
