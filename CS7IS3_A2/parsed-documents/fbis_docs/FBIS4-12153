Speaking to journalists just after seeing off Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad, Mubarak said that he and President al-Asad discussed the Middle East peace process and examined ways of restoring Arab solidarity to its former state and resolving differences within the Arab family. Answering a question from MENA, President Mubarak said that his talks with President al-Asad also touched on the Yemeni crisis and the disputes between the north and the south. We also discussed the Libyan-Western crisis, he said. President Mubarak said: We talked in general about the issues of concern to the entire Arab world. Answering a question on whether the Egyptian-Syrian summit explored ways to end the crisis facing the current peace process, Mubarak said: We did not get into details, but I would like to say that we discussed the issue of peace, bearing in mind the recent meeting in Geneva between President al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton. President Mubarak added: I think that there was tremendous hope for the continuation of the peace talks, and then the incident in Hebron forestalled and complicated the process. President Mubarak expressed his full confidence that Syrian President al-Asad wants peace. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin shares this view and also wants peace, he added. President Mubarak expressed his hope that negotiations will resume in the last week of April in Washington. He said that he hoped there will be flexibility in the negotiations so that peace can be achieved this year without further delay. Asked by an Israeli television reporter if he had discussed the peace negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli track with the Syrian president, President Mubarak said: Yes, we talked about it. I would like to emphasize that President Hafiz al-Asad cares about peace and wants to reach a solution to the problem, a just and honorable solution. President Mubarak expressed his belief that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin is also following the same line and wants peace. President Mubarak added: I hope that there will be flexibility in the Arab-Israeli bilateral negotiations, which I believe will be resumed in the last week of April. He added: I hope they will reach a peace agreement before the end of this year. Asked if he means flexibility on the part of Israel, President Mubarak said: Actually, the flexibility must come from both sides, although more flexibility is needed from the Israeli side so that we can give momentum to the peace process. In this regard, President Mubarak emphasized that peace deserves every sacrifice because it means life to the peoples that enables them to live safely, cooperate, and come together. He added: Now, they do not come together because there is a problem that has existed for almost 50 years. We cannot expect to just push a button and have all parties come together and embrace. It takes time. Peace is important to every individual, whether an Israeli or an Arab. Asked about Syria's position on the Golan, President Mubarak said: The Golan is Syrian territory, and it is hard to ask Syria to give up an inch of the Golan. He added: I am not imposing this on Israel but I say what I believe; that is, peace must be in return for land, otherwise, the peace process will remain difficult. Asked about the current situation on the Israeli-Palestinian track, President Mubarak said: As you know, the Hebron incident has complicated things. But I believe that they have reached an agreement to secure the Hebron region and are now continuing the negotiations on how to implement the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles. I hope they will finish this quickly although some minor obstacles still exist, but I am confident they will overcome them. In response to another question if there are proposals to resolve the Syrian-Israeli problem, President Mubarak said: The matter is clear; the Syrian land must be returned, which would mean the return of peace, with some security measures that could be taken. The president referred to the Madrid conference for Middle East peace. He said: The conference has played its role. All parties have met and now everybody must get down to direct agreements among themselves. Asked whether a meeting between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin can help achieve a peace agreement, President Mubarak said: Such a meeting will help resolve problems. We have tried this several times. But the Syrians do not agree to such a high-level meeting at present. When they reach a peace agreement, such a meeting will not be a problem. On his upcoming visit to Japan and China sometime this month, President Mubarak said: We have good relations with China. There is great cooperation between us. Japan is an important country and cooperates with us. Japan has given economic aid to Egypt. We expect more cooperation during our visit. On the national dialogue committee, President Mubarak said: Once I return from China and Japan I will meet with the dialogue committee to draw up the bases for its work so that it will start its activity and adopt the necessary recommendations. On the date the committee will start its work, President Mubarak said that once the committee meets, the wheels will start turning. Asked whether he discussed with al-Asad the issue of [words indistinct] states that export terrorism, President Mubarak said: We did not discuss this problem. I hope all this will disappear. Let us concentrate on the peace process.
