"We (CIS countries -- IF) have efficient bilateral structures, but the strengthening of independence should not be interfered with by new tough structures. The CIS role should be enhanced, but without those structures, he said. We need to integrate but in a civilized way, he said. Asked about his attitude towards Nazarbayev's proposals on the creation of a Euro-Asian union, he said that the idea was not new. We should understand the very essence of the idea. One center should not be replaced by another one. If it is a matter of the creation of a new coordinating center, Turkmenistan is against. If a new structure will help strengthen independence and our relations, the idea should be analyzed, said Niyazov. He believes that it is premature to consider the idea of a Euro-Asian union. Niyazov said that partners should not be sought overseas. CIS partners and Russia are top priority partners for Turkmenistan. We are grateful to the Russian people that they helped our republic to achieve a cultural and other progress, he said.
