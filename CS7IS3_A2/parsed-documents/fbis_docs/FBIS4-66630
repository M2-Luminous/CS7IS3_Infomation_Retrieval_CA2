There are puppet masters behind the scenes who pull the strings of those extremists. The issue calls for men who discuss and debate the dangers that threaten Egypt and the challenges that face it. Their weapon would be intellect and they would have the ability to challenge destructive ideologies packaged in religious wrapping. This calls for political education, for raising citizen awareness of national causes, and for developing in everyone the spirit of joint action. Political parties, no matter their orientation, have responsibility for realizing that objective. The politicians whom MAYU approached emphasized that political education is capable of challenging the deviant minority and pointed out that reliance on instruction, rather than on indoctrination, would help contain the ideologies of those groups that are manipulated in the background against the interests of the motherland. Political awareness would prevent them from ensnaring new elements in their nets. Political Awareness Dr. Mufid Shihab, chancellor of Cairo University and president of the Consultative Council's Foreign Affairs and National Security Committee emphasized that political parties must act in the manner of a school to raise political cadres through political instruction programs and through true partisan practices. He explained: "Creating political cadres can only be accomplished by offering theoretical educational programs at party schools and by empowering youth leaders to assume responsibility at all levels. Any political party that lacks political cadres versed and active in political action, or that lacks schools or facilities for political instruction, would lose effectiveness among the rank and file." He added that the political education of youth, either within the parties, via the media of information, or through school and university programs, would create desired political awareness and keen understanding of national issues of various dimensions. It would also enhance patriotic sentiment and increase commitment to societal causes, thereby ending the apathy we note among most citizens, and especially youth. He pointed out that apathy aids and encourages the deviant minority to be influential with its operations and ideology, unchallenged by those who consciously reason and realize the threats posed by waves of terrorism. He added that this apathy of intellect and of challenge is the natural outcome of the absence of political awareness. The absence of political awareness is caused by the lack and deficiency of political education to which all the parties and concerned ministries must contribute, especially the ministries of Culture, Information, Awqaf, and Education. Gains Muhammad Kamal Sulayman, assistant secretary general of the Nationalist Party in Cairo, believes that "we are in dire need of institutions to prepare political leaders and political advocates who understand national issues and problems. Their job would be to explain and analyze the gains made by this motherland as well as defend and explain the various national issues that may elude many a simple person and which terrorist groups are the worst exploiters." He added that such a role should not be limited only to the Nationalist Party but should be assumed by all political parties in the field. He explained that youth training would generate a goodly number of political cadres who are able to debate and who are instilled with a nationalist ideology and capable of argument and resistance. Several gains would accrue to us as a result. First, the ability to win over the masses to join political parties, thereby ending the apathy and political vacuum that plague us. Second, create an inter-party climate of democratic debate, which would serve the interests of the motherland. He emphasized that we can, with lucid political instruction, create a generation capable of serving and defending the motherland should it be exposed to a threat such as that of terrorism. Those educated cadres would be capable of convincing the masses that such a threat really exists, utilizing their ability to debate extremist ideologies that undermine the public interest. The first precept of political education is to raise a generation instilled with the desire to defend and protect the motherland and equipped with the ability to differentiate between opposition to the government, if such a position is taken, and positions antithetic to the national interest, such as those taken by terrorist groups. Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id, secretary general of the National Progressive Unionist Grouping, said that "political advocates have not vanished altogether. Some are still playing their roles but others are hesitant as a result of threats that originate not only with the self-proclaimed Islamist terrorists but with certain newspapers that do not have the right idea on how to confront terrorism. That is why many of those with viewpoints to express lack the means of dissemination in the face of a flood of opposing publications that are well-printed and well-financed and consequently cheaper in price. The concept of energizing political activism requires solidarity among various intellectuals and writers who fight terrorism, and who sometimes go as far as countering some of the allegations propagated by terrorists. He explained that the development of political cadres requires reforming the educational process as well as cultural and informational curricula in order to rectify the general climate, blunt the edge of extremism in all our endeavors, and seek the creation of an intellectual climate characterized by understanding and the desire to approach, discuss, and debate all our problems without preconceived views. Should this become the attitude of opponents, or perceived opponents, among the forces that reject such terrorism and its originators, activists, propagators, and supporters--then that solidarity could provide those advocates with greater opportunities and endow them with stronger influence. Such solidarity would also reduce the prickliness of political parties because it would create for us activists who are enlightened and capable of influencing youths. Dr. Rif'at al-Sa'id believes that the '60s experience proved the ineffectiveness of the Youth Organization that had hoped to develop political awareness in young people. The organization's modus operandi was based on mere indoctrination, rendering its graduates mere parrots repeating what they heard with no effort to debate, discuss, modify what should be amended, or correct what should be corrected. The methodology, therefore, must be instruction and not indoctrination. The two concepts are worlds apart. Education opens the door to the mind and creates visions that enable their possessors to understand, espouse, amend, and develop as well as reject the ideologies proposed to them and therefore become the ones capable of influencing others. We Lack Mamduh Thabit Makki, member of the People's Assembly and vice president of the Federation of Egyptian Industries, said that "we lack what we might call political leaders or political cadres armed with a great deal of superior intellect and culture and extensive familiarity with political action techniques, and who also possess comprehensive awareness of societal conditions that would enable them to challenge many destructive ideologies and principles as well as the claims of those working against the interests of the motherland." He added that the intellectual development of political cadres should be accomplished through training institutions within the various parties in order to become familiar with the party's political ideology and be able to defend it and explain it to others. Party members should also be given an opportunity to progress through the various stages of preparing political thought, i.e., participate at all partisan levels. That is the way to develop generations capable of facing and convincing the masses, rather than letting the common citizen become fertile ground for the purveyors of destructive ideologies. Energizing Kamal Henry Badir, chairman of the People's Assembly's Committee for National Security, says that "responsibility for the political education of individuals rests primarily with political parties that must raise the consciousness of their individuals and members. That would require intensifying political action all the way down to hamlets and small partisan units and elevating [assigning more responsible roles] to those able to contribute and serve society and champion its causes. "Such political awareness could be developed through caravans of enlightenment, whose participants would include al-Azhar, the Mufti, the Ministry of Information, and individuals with influence on youth. They must make it clear to youth not only that terrorism is antithetic to all religions, and especially to Islam which urges mercy and compassion, but also that the motherland is hurt by terrorist actions and that strikes against tourists and foreigners burden the motherland with wide-ranging losses. Promoting Joint Action Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid, professor of political science at Cairo University, believes that the development of political awareness is a function of individual participation in social and political activity. This requires doing everything possible to promote joint action at all local and national levels, reexamining election laws and procedures, and removing the restrictions with which Cooperatives Law No. 32 of 1964 is replete. It would also require giving partisan and political forces more access to the information media, especially radio and television, in order to make citizens feel that political participation is of value in the sense that when the various authorities become responsive to people's wishes expressed in the information media, everyone would realize the value of participating. Dr. Mustafa Kamil al-Sayyid explained that the challenge to the phenomenon of terrorism should be all-inclusive because the causes underlying it are numerous and are political, economic, and ideological in nature. Dr. Jamal Zahran, professor of political science at Suez Canal University, believes that raising youth with a fair degree of comprehensive religious and political awareness is the best way to immunize them against sliding towards [falling into the trap of] extremist ideologies then resorting to violence as an expression of opinion. He added that such an education can be imparted through the information media and school curricula and through the example of good role models by educators and those in charge of political parties.
