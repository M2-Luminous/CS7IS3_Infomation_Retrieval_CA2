In an editorial the paper said the pressure of nuclear non-proliferation has always been put on small nations by big powers possessed of nuclear weapons. Noting that it is hard to understand why the United States is putting pressure only on North Korea, it charged that some forces in the United States, captivated by a sense of racial superiority, have created such a crisis. Asking what is the reason to conclude that North Korea poses threat to mankind, the paper said it is because there are fanatics in the United States that the United States is kicking up a row only against North Korea, though some countries have developed or are developing nuclear weapons.
