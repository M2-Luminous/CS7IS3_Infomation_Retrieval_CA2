Dusan Mihajlovic, the leader of New Democracy, does not wish for now to go into details. "Parliamentary life is a process, not an act; it is a skill, an interest, and reality and not a moral contest," he says at the beginning of the interview. Mihajlovic is, by his own definition, a "lawyer from Valjevo, on temporary work in Belgrade, and before that a scout and an explorer." He is remembered as a vice president of the Executive Council of Serbia (in 1990), as a politician who chaired the first roundtable of the government and the opposition in Serbia. New Democracy, until a recent separation of the delegate club of DEPOS, participated in the political life of Serbia, one could say, from the shadows. Today it is one of the parties that spurs certain controversies. [Rupar] What is the place of New Democracy on the political scene of Serbia? How do you comment on the comment that the party was founded by DEPOS and on the rumors that what is involved is a branch of the SPS? [Mihajlovic] New Democracy is one of the first registered political parties in Serbia. DEPOS did not give it birth, as it did to some other parties, but New Democracy is one of four equal founders of DEPOS. The rumors that it is a branch of the SPS are spread by precisely those who would themselves like to fall into the arms of the SPS. We have our own political program whose essence is local self-management and regionalism, surpassing conventional politics, and seeking the so-called third path. In general, we believe that without private ownership there is no true democracy. Until then, political life will be full of beautiful but empty talk, a lot of demagogy and struggling for power. This is why one could rather say that it is the SPS that is coming close to the views of New Democracy. [Rupar] What does that concretely mean? FMihajlovic] In a concrete situation, New Democracy implements its belief in the need for national and political compromise. It is more important for all of us to have a better life than to listen to malicious comments of idlers who like to judge everyone on everything except themselves and their acts. We are not accusing those leaders who talked with the president of the republic and who want a government of national unity. On the contrary, we believe that this is the only correct road. [Rupar] Under what conditions would New Democracy accept participation in the government; would you personally assume some of the functions? [Mihajlovic] New Democracy believes that the time of one-party rule, whether by the SPS or the opposition, is gone forever. We have to get used to coalition. The offer of the president of the republic to form a government of national unity with the program formulated by Mr. Avramovic is in accordance with the program of New Democracy and its real interests. The electoral result makes both the government and the opposition obligated to the agreement on the division of power and responsibility for the fate of its people. No trivial partisan or personal excuses can be a justification for fleeing from the responsibility to our voters. When are we going to be patriots if not now? As concerns my participation in the government, it is known that I have already been a vice president. That means that I am over that ambition, as well as over the phase of a desire for power. New Democracy is not a party contending for power, and I am happy that there are many better and smarter people than I who will carry this out in a better and more successful way. [Ruper] How do you assess relations within the opposition? What is it that prevents the establishment of a strong parliamentary democracy in Serbia? [Mihajlovic] We are still in the puberty phase in the development of democracy and parliamentarism. The government successfully controls the opposition. The majority of parties have not freed themselves of dissident habits, they know what they are against but not what they are for. Also, many do not understand the essence of politics, politics as a democratic struggle for power, and are not ready to accept the responsibility which comes along with participation in the parliament and the government. [Ruper] What are your relations with the Socialists? [Mihajlovic] They did not exist until the last negotiations in the parliament, although I am, of course, a personal friend of many people who, otherwise, are members of the SPS. Otherwise, I think that nobody wants to share power, and neither does the SPS. Power is shared only if one has to. And the present situation is good for both democracy and the people. [Ruper] What is your political prognosis? [Mihajlovic] I would not be involved in politics if I were not an optimist. I believe in peace, in the return to the international community, privatization, successful people. I will support successful forming of the government of national unity and the resolving of the problems that have accumulated. Are we going to succeed this time? This does not depend only on me. Blackmail and reducing problems to a personal level are not allowed. What would the government achieve if I were the only leader, and there were no others. It is a poor country that has only one leader.
