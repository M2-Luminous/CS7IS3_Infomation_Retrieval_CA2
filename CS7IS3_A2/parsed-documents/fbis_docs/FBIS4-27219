The sources said the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), the long- term credit bank, and Nippon Credit Bank are expected to cut the rate charged on loans to most-creditworthy customers by around 0.2 percentage point from the current 4.4 percent per annum. They said the cut in the rate, which affects capital spending, may help underpin the economy. The rate was boosted in February and March due to the slump of bond prices, but the market recovered thereafter, with the yield falling, buttressed by the Bank of Japan's eased credit stance. The yield of the May issue of bank debentures issued by the IBJ, the basis for the long-term prime rate, dropped to 3.24 percent Monday, against its coupon rate of 3.5 percent. The coupon rate of the bank debentures is revised when the gap between it and the yield widens more than 0.2 point. The long-term prime rate is set 0.9 point above the coupon rate of the debentures. The sources also said the housing loan rate charged by private banks, linked to the long-term prime rate, will be left unchanged, however, due to the small scale of the cut.
