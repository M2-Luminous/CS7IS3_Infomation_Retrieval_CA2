FBIS4-29295 "dreas117_j_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-117 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 Indonesia Minister Views Need for Restructuring Minister Views Need for Restructuring BK1706093394 Jakarta KOMPAS in Indonesian 6 Jun 94 p 2 BK1706093394 Jakarta KOMPAS Indonesian BFN [Text] Bandung, KOMPAS -- Indonesia needs to embark on numerous domestic economic restructuring in an effort to compete with the other Asia-Pacific countries. The restructuring should be carried out not only through the issuance of deregulation packages but through the compatibility of the economic structure aimed at upgrading its competitiveness and providing a resilient national economy. Speaking at the symposium on Reforms in the Asia-Pacific and Indonesia's Study on the Asia-Pacific at the Merdeka building in Bandung on 4 June, Finance Minister Mari'e Muhammed said, "We should absorb what is good." The other speakers were the head of the International Relations from CSIS, Drs. Bantarto Bandoro MA [Master of Arts], Drs. Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata MA and an economic observer, Dr. Shahrir. According to Mari'e, all matters pertaining to the national economy should be carried out with a view to fortifying Indonesia's competitiveness at the international level. This needs to be carried out because countries which are competitive are becoming stronger than Indonesia, such as the PRC, Vietnam and India -- all of them recently embarked on extensive economic restructuring. Mari'e said Indonesia should take full advantage of the opportunities which the Asia-Pacific region has to offer, particularly in trade activities, investments and exports. The glamorous economic era of the Atlantic countries has begun to decline and more countries are turning toward the Asia-Pacific region. Mari'e clarified that with the agreement reached at the Uruguay Round at the end of 1993, major changes and trends had occurred in the volume of international trade. This will bring about far-reaching implications and complications in connection with investments and international relations. The Asia-Pacific region is a dynamic region and its development is rapidly expanding. It has become the locomotive for global economic development. Mari'e added that currently the population of the Asia-Pacific region amounts to 40 percent of the total world population. The region's Gross Domestic Product, GDP, has reached 50 percent. According to Mari'e, the economic growth of the Asia-Pacific regional countries was recorded at an annual average of seven percent over the five consecutive years. This is a performance which had never been achieved by any region, including Europe. Touching on APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation], the finance minister said the grouping discussed the substance in greater depth. APEC would direct itself toward transforming the Asia-Pacific region into a region free from obstacles, paving the way for international trade and investment capital flows. Mari'e said the 17-member APEC forum was established in 1989 by the former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke. He said, "Even though the United States is currently experiencing an economic setback, APEC's development depends on the American interest." Meanwhile, Bob Sugeng Hadiwinata called for lesser dependency on on any cooperation forum which only makes rhetoric calls, and Indonesia should learn a lesson from the U.S.-Japan conflict and the collapse of the G-15 summit in New Delhi. Bob Sugeng also clarified that, in facing the problem of conflicting interests within APEC members, Indonesia is becoming more dependent on the global market. As such, it would be better for Indonesia to externalize its national economy by eliminating any sentimental or emotional rhetoric. Indonesia should avoid being too involved in any cooperation group which practises emotional solidarity. It should take a pragmatic approach by increasing its bargaining power at international forums. Probably, Indonesia should embark upon such a pragmatic approach in cooperation forums such as the APEC. Another economic observer, Shahrir, considered that by the year 2005, there would be a new world with free trade in which the Asia-Pacific region would be the nucleus for global trade. This depends on the APEC members capability of providing employment for their populace while maintaining a high economic growth rate.
