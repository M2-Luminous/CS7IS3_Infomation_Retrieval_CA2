EU Commission President Jacques Delors stated in Brussels on Friday [28 January] that the work of his authority will focus on a concept for a "greater Europe." These considerations also played a role at the Austrian-French forum that was held in the Vienna Town Hall on Friday at the invitation of Foreign Minister Mock and the City of Vienna. There Alain Lamassoure, French minister for European affairs, summarized the stage plan in the direction of pan-Europe: First the EU has to be increased to 16 members, so that Austria also belongs to it. Then four steps must follow: First, implementation of the Maastricht resolutions on foreign and security policy; second, subsidiarity; third, democratization; fourth, gradual integration of Central and East Europe. "We need a policy for the East," Lamassoure said. He wants to start the EU's policy for the East with an "engagement day," that is, a basic offer to the East European states that permits them to become members of the Community. This policy must be extended to Russia. In the transition period there will be a security problem, with which Austria will cope best by acceding to the Western European Union (WEU), toward which the East European states are also pushing their way. Everything else would be paradoxical, he said. [passage omitted]
