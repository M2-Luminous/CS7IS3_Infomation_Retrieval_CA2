He gave an exclusive interview to NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reporters in Tokyo. The president talked about the presidential election scheduled for April 1995. While he said: "I have not decided whether to run as a candidate," he also emphasized: "The reforms we implemented in the past four years have been very successful. The present regime has improved the life of the majority of Peruvian people. No political regime has been able to affect reforms in such a short period." He showed strong confidence in his reelection chances based on his record of successful reforms. This is Fujimori's fifth visit to Japan, including visits he made before becoming president. He is scheduled to hold talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 6 June. President Fujimori stressed: "We implemented several successful stabilization programs, including one on eradicating violence. If a weaker regime should come into power, it will be dangerous for Peru." Commenting on rumors that former UN Secretary General Javier Perez De Cuellar intends to run for the presidency, Fujimori limited himself to saying: "I know about that. I expect all sorts of people to announce their candidacy from now on." Discussing economic reforms, Fujimori pointed out that "we have almost resolved the debt issue; the inflation rate, which used to be 50 percent a month, is down to 1 percent." He also predicted: "Gross domestic product (GDP), which declined each year under past regimes, attained a growth of 7.5 percent in 1993, and will achieve a similar, or an even better growth rate in 1994." Regarding foreign investments, Fujimori complained that "Japanese investors are conservative, compared to U.S. or Spanish investors." He indicated he would again request investments from Japan during his meeting with Prime Minister Hata on 6 June. He also said: "We hope the Export-Import Bank of Japan and Overseas Cooperation Fund will increase their assistance for medium-scale investment projects." Regarding the unemployment issue, which has not seen any improvement, Fujimori claimed: "The solution depends on how successful we are in attracting foreign investments. If we are able to invite investments into Peru, which has rich natural resources, it will be possible to solve the problem of poverty." At present, the Fujimori government is being strongly criticized by the United States and other countries for violating human rights because many civilians have been killed during campaigns to exterminate leftist guerrillas; and a new constitution providing for the revival of the death sentence for terrorists was enacted in late 1993. Fujimori asserted: "Human rights have achieved remarkable improvement in Peru, compared to the past 10 years. When you talk about human rights, first, you have to respect the rights of the Peruvian people, and not those of the terrorists."
