Upon the UNA-UNSO's coming to power in Ukraine, Kravchuk will not just be held politically responsible for that, but he will be prosecuted as a criminal. The UNA-UNSO leaders also said that the Crimean elections were a result of a conspiracy by the Jews, who have always dreamed about autonomy in Crimea. In the nationalists' view, Israeli influence in Crimea will increase. (RATUSHA) [as published]
