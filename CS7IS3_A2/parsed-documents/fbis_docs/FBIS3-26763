Entrusted by the regional people's congress, Vice Chairman Wang Lequan delivered a report to the standing committee on the current economic situation and major reforms in 1994. He said: In 1993, under the guidance of the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines, Xinjiang strengthened the intensity of reform and overcame difficulties in achieving fairly good results in economic construction and other fields of endeavor. The regional economy has maintained a strong growth momentum; the gross regional product is expected to reach 37.7 billion yuan, about 10 percent more than 1992; and agriculture and animal husbandry have reaped their 16th consecutive year of harvests, while industrial production has come out of the predicament of slow growth and poor efficiency and begun to bounce back. Moreover, revenues have increased, the financial situation has further improved, progress has been made in developing foreign economic relations and trade, investment in fixed assets has increased steadily, and infrastructure construction has been further strengthened. He pointed out: Xinjiang's current political situation is good. The entire region has seen political stability, national unity, and steady progress in all fields of endeavor. While Xinjiang has been able to maintain a strong momentum for economic growth, problems and difficulties continue to exist in the regional economy. First, in agriculture, the investment in production growth rate has dropped and precluded long-term development. Second, in industry, the foundation remains weak: investment is inadequate for upgrading enterprises' technology, progress has been slow in readjusting production structure and product mix, and economic efficiency needs much improvement. Third, in finance, there is a serious shortage of capital; funds for capital construction cannot be allocated in time; and, as a result of debt chains, enterprises are facing a slow turnover of funds and are in serious shortage of working capital. Fourth, (?the pressure) on railway transport has continued. Fifth, irrational export product mix and the lack of cash in conducting trade have caused a decrease of exports. Sixth, price rises of commodities cannot be curbed. Wang Lequan also explained the progress in economic structural reform and the regional wage, housing, and price reforms; as well as the current situation in commodity prices and arrangements for price reform in 1994. The session heard a report by Su Yongguang, chairman of the regional planning commission, on drafting the 1994 regional plans; a report by (Gong Jinyou), director of the regional finance department, on the drafting of the 1994 regional budget; and a report by (Xie Haiping), deputy secretary general of the regional people's government, on handling motions submitted by the first session of the eighth regional people's congress. Turbayim, vice chairman of the regional people's congress standing committee, chaired the session. Chairman Amudun Niyaz and Vice Chairmen Xie Fuping, (Hujihan Hakomov), and (Amina Apar), of the regional people's Congress standing committee, attended the session.
