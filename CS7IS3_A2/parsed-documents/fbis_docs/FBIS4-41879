He told INTERFAX at a news-conference in Moscow that he had received this impression after a conversation with the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Grachev stressed that Russia would welcome an international peace force in the region "on any terms" and "even under any command." However, he said the UN is only ready to post more observers in the area rather than to carry out a large scale operation to disengage the Georgian and Abkhaz forces. He did not rule out the involvement of CIS troops in the operation, however only after a CIS summit in September. He doubted that any former Soviet republic could dispatch to the region of Georgian-Abkhaz confrontation a contingent as big as the Russian force. Commonwealth states, in his opinion, could send only small units, and the countries without armed forces of their own could support the peace-keeping operation with money. Grachev said the mission in Abkhazia has so far been going smoothly and strictly to schedule. All troops and military hardware intended for the operation have been brought into the region. Grachev estimated the Russian force at 2300 men.
