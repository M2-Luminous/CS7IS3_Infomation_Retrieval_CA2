"Such a conspicuous remark will certainly turn Croatian President Tudjman and his officials into even greater hawks and encourage them to attempt, as they say, to reintegrate Krajina into their constitutional and legal system by force if need be," Vojnica told Radio Jagodina. "This continuous pressure does not surprise us, just as we are not deluding ourselves that it will not become even more complex and even stronger," Vojnica said. He stressed that the EU is evidently in a hurry to promote its interests in this area before the United States does. "The EU has hinted at such a solution and has now announced it publicly, ignoring our right to self-determination on the basis of the UN Charter and the will of the Serb people expressed at the referendum. The Serbs decided not to live in Croatia because that state had erased them from its Constitution", Vojnica said. "The Serb people in Krajina have managed to defend themselves against their Croat neighbors and their overlords, and they will also defend their right to self-determination. They have elected their legitimate bodies of authority that will work in the interest of the people and will not back off from our basic demands," the RSK Assembly president said.
