Security Council on Thursday called on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to return to Bulgaria the convoy of barges, crew, and cargo (6,000 tonnes of oil are claimed to be in question) which arrived in the Serbian port of Prahovo on the Danube last weekend. News agencies have reported that the Bulgarian barges were hijacked by armed men and forced to go to Prahovo. The Security Council has prepared a statement in which it condemns what it calls an extremely dangerous act, but says that it is yet to be determined who was responsible for it. The council has, however, decided not to adopt the statement but instead to call on Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew and cargo. In a letter to the Security Council and later in a meeting with council president Jean-Bernard Merimee, Yugoslav Ambassador to the U.N. Dragomir Djokic stressed that Yugoslavia did not know of any hijacking and that the convoy of barges had normally arrived in Prahovo and undergone a routine check there. Djokic said that Bulgaria had informed Yugoslavia only after over 24 hours that the Han Kubrat tugboat had been hijacked and that Yugoslavia immediately took the necessary steps and opened an investigation. Djokic said that there were not only 21 crew members on board the tugboat, but also seven passengers, of whom five with Bulgarian passports which were in order, while two passengers had to be detained because their papers were not in order. Djokic has said that Merimee thanked the Yugoslav Government for the information it had provided so far and the assistance it had offered in the clearing up of the case, but set out that the Security Council expected Yugoslavia to return the barges, crew and cargo to Bulgaria by the beginning of next week.
