According to various estimates, the radioactive sensitivity of mollusks is a factor of 20-30 lower than in mammals. Consequently, the processes of radioactive adaptation in their populations may be governed by different rules. The study was done in the summer of 1991. Polluted samples were taken from the Pripyat River 15 km upstream from the Chernobyl plant. Control samples were obtained from the Krutynya River in Poland. Ground pollution levels and the content of radioactive isotopes (Cs, Sr) were analyzed. Adult mollusks were exposed to gamma radiation and observed. Two distinct mortality processes were found. This indicates the presence of two independent reactions to radiation with different mechanisms, each of which is fatal. The first occurs fairly rapidly, the second, more slowly. The Pripyat samples withstood the first phase better. In the second phase, the control samples fared better. Mollusks surviving the first phase produced viable eggs. The appearance of mutations is discussed. Figure 1; table 1; references 6 (Russian).
