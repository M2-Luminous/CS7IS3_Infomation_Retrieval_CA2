The two cases involved huge amounts of smuggled goods, and the circumstances of the crimes were vile. The first case also involved such offenses as offering and accepting bribes and bending the law for personal gain. Among the offenders were leading cadres of leadership bodies of party and government and law-enforcement departments, including the head of a commerce bureau, the political commissar of a border subbureau, a deputy head of a border brigade, and the secretary of a city CPC committee. Violations by those who know the law and are themselves in charge of carrying it out are incompatible with legal principles. Popular indignation will not be assuaged if they are not harshly punished in accordance with the law of the land. The serious way in which the two major smuggling cases was investigated and punished represents an achievement of the anticorruption drive. At the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out explicitly: "Party members, high- and middle-ranking cadres in particular, must heighten their awareness and set a good example by being honest and observing discipline. As for those corrupt elements, we must punish them in accordance with state laws and party discipline, no matter who they are. We must not tolerate or abet their wrongdoing." The Rushan city case was a serious instance of providing an armed escort for smuggling, in which the smugglers worked hand in glove with a handful of law-enforcement personnel and local cadres who offered assistance and who helped cover it up. The case in Zhuhai city was one of providing an armed escort for smuggling in which the smugglers worked in collusion with a law-enforcement official who abused his power for personal gain. From these two cases, we can see how rampant the crime of smuggling has become; from the severe punishment that the offenders in the two cases received, we can see the firm determination of the CPC Central Committee to tackle major cases in the anticorruption drive and the effective measures it has taken in this regard. Facts have shown that any violation of the law, regardless of who the perpetrator is and where it takes place, will be punished by the law. Any violator, even those who made contributions to reform and construction, must be prosecuted according to the law. All citizens are equal before the law -- this is the fundamental principle of the socialist legal system. Smuggling is a serious economic crime that eludes the state's administration of international trade and that illegally rakes in extraordinary profits. The crime of smuggling batters the domestic market, harms the development of national industries, obstructs normal international trade, disrupts the economic order, corrupts social conduct, contaminates the ranks of cadres, and tarnishes national sovereignty and dignity. For this reason, the crime of smuggling is a major political issue as well as a major economic issue. The fact that the crime of smuggling has, in spite of repeated injunctions, gone from bad to worse and even drawn in many leading cadres and law-enforcement personnel -- as has been amply demonstrated -- can be attributed to the mistaken understanding of some leading cadres, to the bad practice of protecting small-group interests in some localities and departments, and to the widespread corruption in some government and law-enforcement organs. Local protectionism and departmental cover-ups have served as, intentionally or not, "air raid shelters" or "umbrellas" for smuggling crimes. A handful of localities or departments put local or departmental interests above overall national interests by following the practice of "countering a central measure with a local one" to undermine the overall national interest. This is very wrong and will lead to dangers if it is allowed to develop unchecked. From the Rushan case, we can see that these offenders were not, as they themselves claimed, "dedicated heart and soul to the public interest" or that "no money went into their pockets." They are rather unclean and are guilty of, in addition to smuggling, a whole bunch of economic offenses including taking bribes. Past experience and lessons told us that we must set strict demands on cadres in accordance with party discipline and state laws, educate them on keeping the cardinal principles in mind, take the overall situation into account, and place the fundamental interests of the state and the people above everything else. Strictness embodies real care, while toleration will lead to the destruction of many cadres, which would mean losses far greater and more unfortunate than economic losses. Some people contend as if smuggling, whether carried out either openly or on the sly, should be tolerated in order to develop a socialist market economy. Some localities even come up with the ridiculous theory of "prosperity through smuggling." They are only finding excuses for smuggling. To develop a socialist market economy, we must have strict standards and a sound legal system. Moreover, we must also strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, safeguard the uniform implementation of the decrees of the central government, and ensure a normal order in economic operations and social life. Every country in the world without exception strictly bans and cracks down hard on smuggling. There has never been a country that has established a socialist market economy and that has accomplished an economic takeoff on the strength of smuggling. Just think, if we allow -- in the course of reform, opening up, and establishing a socialist market economy -- smuggling to run rampant and people to fatten themselves by undermining the interests of the state, then who will want to work honestly or engage in legitimate business? Which foreigner will then want to come here to set up factories or do business? The lesson to be learned from these two smuggling cases is profound and thought-provoking. In the important talks he gave when he visited the south in 1992, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "We should pay persistent attention to two tasks--the continuation of reform and opening and a crackdown on various crimes. Both tasks require tenacious efforts. The attack on various criminal activities and the elimination of a variety of hideous phenomena allow no leniency." As China has entered a new phase of economic restructuring -- a phase of combining a package of reforms with breakthroughs in key areas -- this year, it is of great significance to properly handle the relations between reform, development, and stability and to perform the various tasks well. Only when we attend to the two tasks with equally tenacious efforts will we be able to truly seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and ensure stability. Only then will we be able to ensure that the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will advance from victory to victory.
