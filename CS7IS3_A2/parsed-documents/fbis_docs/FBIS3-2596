On the eve of the NPC session, the abovementioned leader particularly stressed Deng Xiaoping's exposition that "stability must override everything." According to the authoritative source, the senior central leader recently talked especially about maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development in the national economy, and called on all party members, leading cadres in particular, to reach a common understanding on this issue, especially on the complete meaning of the words "sustained, rapid, and healthy." This senior leader said: The sustained, rapid, and healthy development is a dialectical unity. In the end, the economy will not be boosted if the development is rapid but not sustained and healthy. He added: In proposing the general tasks of "seizing opportunities, deepening reforms, opening wider to the outside world, promoting development, and maintaining stability" for 1994, somebody suggested changing the term "promoting development" to "accelerating development." Later, after repeated deliberation, it was not regarded as feasible to accelerate only the speed because, by doing so, an organic entity cannot be formed with the other aspects. Furthermore, the word "rapid" is contained in the expression "sustained, rapid, and healthy development" already, so the term "promoting development" was finally decided to be written in the 20-character general tasks. The central authorities called for leading cadres at all levels to correctly handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. It is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remark -- stability must override everything -- that counts. Without stability, nothing will be accomplished. For the entire party and society, stability must override everything. If we lack a stable situation, we simply have no way of developing the economy and carrying out the in-depth reform. Conversely, if the economy attains a sound development, there will be a more solid foundation for stability. How should we boost the economy? We must depend on the in-depth reform because, without it, we cannot build up a socialist market economy.
