He was asked about terms for Russia's acceptance of the Partnership for Peace program. In his words, there is a goal "to reach a special agreement with NATO, befitting the place and role of Russia in world and European affairs, its military power and nuclear status." "In general, we have been acting without haste. We have conducted consultations with CIS states, and now we are approaching the time when we need to sign a framework document," Yeltsin said. Russia, he continued, "has its own concept of cooperation in Europe. Its central element: CSCE as a priority common regional political forum and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as the leading mechanism of military and political partnership should coordinate activities of other structures, NATO included." Asked by INTERFAX's special correspondent Vyacheslav Terekhov, what lessons politicians should learn from that which the people of Russia went through last October, Yeltsin stressed the need "above all to ban violence and extremism and prevent ignoble agitation and disturbances." He believes that all possible efforts to forestall a tragedy similar to the events in Moscow on October 3-4 "must be for any politician in Russia the supreme goal and a must for both himself and his associates -- whatever their convictions may be." "Elections -- that's the way to reach political objectives, Yeltsin remarked. [quotation marks as received] Rebellions, uprisings, etc. Are outlawed as politically immoral. That's the first lesson from the October tragedy." In his opinion, this lesson "is just being learned, and with difficulty at that." As testimony of this, he referred to the preparation of an agreement on civic peace, "which more and more parties and organizations have been willing to join." "There is yet another lesson from those somber days -- the vital need to consolidate the state. No one must be allowed to ruin state buildings, assault TV premises, man armed detachments, etc. The state must safeguard its citizens against all that," Yeltsin said. "Regrettably, extremism then was curbed only at the last moment. And if those efforts had failed -- what streams of blood would have flown in Moscow and all over Russia?" Yeltsin remarked. In his words, there is now the essential minimum, above all the democratically adopted Constitution, to consolidate the state. As he noted, the Constitution "has put an end to dual power, has offered peaceful and civilized ways to resolve differences and has laid the basis for interaction between all sensible forces in Russia. "Sentiments in favor of searching for agreement are prevalent now, Yeltsin said. I see my task in making such concord a realty." Asked about his intention to nominate himself for a new presidential term, he described this question as "premature." On his chief task in the coming two years before presidential elections, Yeltsin said that there was nothing more important than to ensure stable relations "between full-fledged efficient branches of power -- executive, legislative, and judicial." In his words, there is a new climate of interaction evolving with the Federation Council and State Duma alike. "The dialogue is developing, Yeltsin noted. I will do all I can so that this constructive mood will strengthen, so that parliament can complete its entire term, so that the next scheduled elections are precisely that kind of elections and that they take place in the conditions of stability and a higher political culture." In Yeltsin's view, there is a second task linked to that -- to make Russia, "our Federation" more united over these two years. Having admitted that work to coordinate federative relations has at times been painful and tense, Yeltsin noted that "on the whole this process is under control not only centrally but regionally." "Over these two years we need to advance in earnest within the Commonwealth of Independent States and elsewhere, Yeltsin stressed. I do not want to talk in detail at this stage about our plans, this is a separate big topic. But I think in two years our states will be much closer towards each other. He called economics as third in his list of priorities. "All of us are now going through a grueling school. If we recall what the last 2-3 years have been, we can say with confidence that we have learned something," he said. Noting that only a tiny part of the experience gained in Russia through the centuries and subsequently destroyed has been returned so far, he stressed nonetheless that "this return is going on in increments." "The next two years will become exceedingly important in this respect, Yeltsin noted. "I hope that in time our economy's multiple ills will begin to disappear to the relief all of us."
