[Begin Qaddumi recording] In fact, yesterday's crime makes it impossible to think about the negotiations. Our delegations have been summoned from the committees and from the places where they hold negotiations. The issue now is not one of negotiations. It is a crime that has been committed against the Palestinian people, nay, against humanity. First, President Clinton should find a solution to this problem before he invites us for meetings to continue the negotiations. Ways and means must be forged to protect the Palestinian people. International resolutions must be adopted to condemn this heinous crime, in which scores were killed. The world must know that this state -- described as democratic -- is a false democracy. It is the source of anxiety and tension in the region, it is the hotbed of instability. Therefore, President Clinton should consider a solution to this problem before he invites us to such meetings. We are for peace and for the establishment of a just, durable peace. This crime has struck the peace process in the heart. This is because this is clear evidence that Israel does not want peace. [end recording] On the Palestinian side, Faruq Qaddumi said: [Begin Qaddumi recording] We have asked the UN Security Council to adopt resolutions to protect the Palestinian people. We are demanding international forces to stop these massacres. We definitely know the international group will not hesitate at all to adopt the most stringent measures. Measures that clearly prove that Israel wants peace must be adopted. First, measures must be taken against Israel and against the perpetrators of this crime against humanity. Before anything else, the international group must not only condemn this, but make available means of protection for the Palestinian people. [end recording]
