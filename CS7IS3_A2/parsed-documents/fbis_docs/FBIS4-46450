The man pushed an elderly woman to one side and shot Gavin Patrick McShane, 17, as he played a gaming machine. Two other people were also hit, one seriously. A witness who found the three victims said: "Apparently the gunman had pointed the weapon at the girl despatcher, but the gun jammed." The attack came as the Government continued to prepare its response to Sinn Fein's demand for clarification of the Downing Street peace declaration. But Seamus Mallon, the SDLP MP whose constituency offices are directly opposite the taxi firm, urged an early resumption of talks. He said: "If we have the courage of our own political convictions we should take that declaration and build upon it."
