The press report states that during the meeting it was agreed that from now on the government will use the criminal organization's financial resources for purposes other than subversive activities. [sentence as published] Fujimori, after asserting that he has not and will not hold a meeting with Guzman, said the report was "biased and ill intended" but did not refer to the media. Fujimori also confirmed that drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has been placed at the disposal of Dincote [National Counterterrorism Directorate] after it was established he had clear connections with terrorist groups, especially the Shining Path. He went on to immediately explain that that does not mean Dinandro [the Police Antidrug Division] will stop its investigations into drug trafficking. He said: "Investigations will continue simultaneously." [passage omitted]
