In a 20-minute meeting with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Vu Khoan thanked Japan for calling on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to expand its assistance to Indochina countries, including Vietnam, at last week's OECD meeting in Paris, foreign ministry officials said. Vu Khoan was quoted as telling Kakizawa that Vietnam is making preparations to join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). He did not specify any other Asia-Pacific groupings Vietnam is interested in joining, but Hanoi has expressed willingness to participate in the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the future, according to the officials. Kakizawa replied that Japan wants to help Vietnam take active part in the Asia-Pacific region and will continue to make efforts to expand OECD assistance to the region, the officials said. Turning to Vietnam's diplomatic relations, Vu Khoan told Kakizawa that ties with the United States are improving, with the two sides recently agreeing to set up liaison offices in each other's country. Vietnam's relations with China are also improving, although some problems remain, and Hanoi wants to solve those problems through negotiations, Vu Khoan was quoted as saying. Negotiations over several disputed land and sea boundaries, including the row over the Spratly Islands, have been under way since Vietnam and China reestablished diplomatic relations in 1991, but have failed to make much progress. Kakizawa welcomed Vietnam's recent economic and social developments and told Vu Khoan he hopes Hanoi will continue making efforts to normalize relations with China and the U.S., the officials said. Kakizawa and Vu Khoan agreed to cooperate in implementing Japan's economic cooperation with Vietnam, they said.
