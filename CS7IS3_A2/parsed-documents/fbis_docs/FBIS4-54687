This is stated in a communique from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center. After stopping the French humanitarian convoy, the chetniks took the drivers and the convoy escorts to Hotel Srbija, and parked the trucks in front of it. The operation to plant the ammunition in the trucks was organized by Miso Mijatovic, chief of the chetnik security services in Ilidza. He supervised the following members of the aggressor's military police: Sasa Rodnik, Captain Branislav, Dragan Draskovic, Boban Djurkovic, Gavro Grubacic, and Zoran Subotic, who brought the ammunition from a military warehouse in Luzani, and planted it the same evening among the humanitarian packages. In the morning the trucks were inspected in front of the organizer and the members of the humanitarian convoy, while the SRNA TV team was already on the scene, who filmed and later broadcast the alleged discovery of the crates with the ammunition. This is contained in the statement by the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Press Center.
