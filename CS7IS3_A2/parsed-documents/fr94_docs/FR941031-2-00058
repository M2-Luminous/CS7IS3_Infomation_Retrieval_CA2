FR941031-2-00058 FR941031-2-00044 Office of Science Education and Technical Information Energy Research Financial Assistance Program Notice 95&hyph;06: Experimental Program To Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) AGENCY: U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice inviting grant applications. SUMMARY: The Office of Science Education and Technical Information (ET) of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), in keeping with its energy-related mission to assist in strengthening the Nation's human resource infrastructure through the support of science, engineering, and mathematics education at all levels of education, announces its interest in receiving applications from eligible States for the support of the DOE/EPSCoR Program. The purpose of the DOE/EPSCoR Program is to enhance the capabilities of designated States to conduct nationally competitive energy-related research and to develop science and engineering manpower in energy-related areas to meet current and future needs in those areas. Subject to availability of funds, approximately $7 million will be available for awards under the DOE/EPSCoR Program in FY 1995 for collaborative research and manpower development in energy-related science and engineering disciplines. DATES: Applications under this Notice should be received by 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, January 25, 1995. ADDRESSES: Application materials are available from the Office of Science Education and Technical Information, ET&hyph;31, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. Telephone requests for application materials may be made by calling (202) 586&hyph;8949. The completed applications referencing Program Notice 95&hyph;06 must be submitted to: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, room F&hyph;220, Washington, D.C. 20585, ATTN: Program Notice 95&hyph;06. The following address must be used when submitting applications by U.S. Postal Service Express mail, any commercial mail delivery service, or when hand carried by the applicant: U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Research, Acquisition and Assistance Management Division, ER&hyph;64, 19901 Germantown Road, Germantown, MD 20784.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Senate report accompanying the FY 1995 Energy and Water Development Appropriation Bill (S. Rep. No. 484, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess., pg. 90) recommended that $7 million be committed to continuing the DOE/EPSCoR Program. In accordance with 10 CFR 600.7(b)(1), and to continue to enhance the competitiveness of states and territories identified for participation in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the National Science Foundation (NSF), DOE has decided to continue to restrict eligibility to the following states and territory: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wyoming, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Awards issued under this Notice will implement plans formulated under the previously awarded DOE/EPSCoR planning grants. New awards will provide funding for state management and coordination, human resource development activities, and research collaboration including student research activities. Approximately two to three new awards will be issued for a two-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million each for activities described above. In addition, DOE anticipates providing support for three to four renewal awards for projects begun under the DOE/EPSCoR initiative in FY 1993. Renewal awards will be issued for a one-year period and up to a maximum of $1.25 million. Any remaining balance of the estimated $7 million will be used to award funds to enable unsuccessful DOE/EPSCoR state committees to upgrade and refine state energy-related plans. In addition, as a tangible measure of an applicant's commitment to the objectives of the DOE/EPSCoR Program, cost-sharing on a one-to-one ratio is a requirement of this program. Therefore, each application submitted requesting support from DOE under this Notice must provide, from non-Federal funds, an amount equal to the amount awarded by the DOE; i.e. for every dollar provided by DOE, the recipient must provide a dollar from non-Federal sources for the project. General information about development and submission of applications, eligibility, limitations, evaluation, and selection processes, and other policies and procedures are contained in the Application Guide for the Office of Energy Research Financial Assistance Program and in 10 CFR part 605. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number of this program is 81.049. Issued in Washington, D.C., on October 20, 1994. William A. Lewis, Jr., Director, Office of University and Science Education. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26917 Filed 10&hyph;28&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;P
