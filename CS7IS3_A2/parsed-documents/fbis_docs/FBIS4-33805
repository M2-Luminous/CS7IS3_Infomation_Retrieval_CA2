"The final decision will have to be made by each individual, however," the source said. Today, the government of Ottawa joined the U.S. position by announcing that flights from Canada to Haiti will be suspended as of 25 June. The source added that the embassy had expressed a similar position twice in the past two years but that numerous Canadians, some of whom had been living in Haiti for 30 or 40 years, had elected to stay. According to the embassy, 2,400 Canadians, most of them holding double nationality, live in Haiti. These people include some 300 male and female religious teachers, most of whom come from Quebec province.
