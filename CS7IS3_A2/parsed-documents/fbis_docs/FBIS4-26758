It is, however, difficult to realize an overall bumper harvest of crops for the entire year. Agricultural production across the country should not be treated lightly. There are so many difficulties for the autumn grain cultivation judging from the current situation. First, the land under cultivation of grains continues to decline which makes it difficult a gain of crop harvest. Second, natural disasters are rather serious with grave drought in northern part and in some areas of southwestern China. Serious impacts are seen on cultivation of dry crop of maize and on the planting of summer paddy in these areas. South China and the southern part of the Yangtze River were hit by rainstorms which have already resulted in heavy damage to agricultural production. Third, the planting of cotton suffered natural disasters in spite of the fact that the area under cultivation of cotton increased to some extent. It is rather difficult to realize the planned yield of cotton planting. Meanwhile, rising prices for chemical fertilizer and pesticide due to short supply this year added more difficulties to agricultural production. The ministry appealed to various places to pay much more attention to agricultural production for the entire year. The sowing for summer grain crops is now underway in southern and northern parts and efforts should be painstakingly made in order to ensure a yield of crops. Time should not be lost in planting summer crops. Cultivated acreage should be expanded and multiple cropping should be tried in a bid to increase the crop yield. Drought condition as well as floods and waterlogging have to be promptly dealt with in order to make crop cultivation possible with an eventual aim of having a good harvest of grains for the whole year.
