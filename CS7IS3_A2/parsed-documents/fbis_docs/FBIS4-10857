These two rules are strictly observed by the more than 40 Russian professors and researchers who have settled in Brazil in the past two years. Their contracts were financed by funds established by the National Research Council (CNPQ). It took them a short time to adapt to the daily routine of Brazilian universities, and to leave behind the fear that the job was more than a short experiment by half a dozen spotted cats. They are feeling better, and it seems they have forgotten the meaning of the word goska -- the feeling of missing something or someone -- when they talk about the possibility of returning to Russia. They want to stay in the country as long as they can work here. The distance separating Brazil from a country where professors are paid with dignity is as big as the distance separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. In any case, you cannot possibly miss the routines you left behind when salaries were $80 per month. Physicist Grigoriy Surdutovich, 56, was one of the first to come to Brazil. He arrived in January 1992, pushed by the political instability and the drastic budget cuts for scientific activities in Russia. The decline forced salaries down drastically there. Despite the shortcomings, he believes in improving Brazilian research efforts. "The climate in Brazilian scientific circles today is similar to the one in my country 35 years ago," Surdutovich says. The scientist is studying the pressure of light on atoms at the Sao Paulo University (USP) in San Carlos. Artur Elfimov, 50, is the leader of a group of five Russian experts in plasma physics at the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ). He says: "If administrators really support the effort, the country could recover the time lost in various areas of knowledge." The education of the researchers is varied. Galina Pugatcheva and Anatoliy Gusev, of the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), are studying the anomalies of the Brazilian magnetic field. The phenomenon creates 50 percent more lightings in our atmosphere than in any other part of the planet. Another five Russian scientists, contracted to work at the State University of Northern Fluminense (UENF), which was inaugurated on 28 March in Campos, are interested in producing synthetic diamonds. According to UENF patron Senator Darcy Ribeiro (PDT-RJ) [Democratic Labor Party -- Rio de Janeiro], 15 researchers from the former Soviet Union will join the team in the near future. For many the "import" of Russian scientists means savings in time and money. "You need at least eight years of heavy investment to form a professional of this level, and the cost is never less than $200,000," Carlos Augusto Azevedo, head of the UERJ Quantum Electronics Department, says. "Besides, the results of their work do not take long to appear," Azevedo adds. "This immigration has already yielded optimum results," Oscar Hipolito, USP Physics and Chemistry Institute director, says. All this enthusiasm crashes against one obstacle, however: The law that forbids contracting foreigners as public officials. Rejected by the international community, this limitation has forced the Russian scientists to remain as visiting professors with salaries of $1,000 to $2,000 per month for periods of one to two years. Rectors and professors hide behind the constitutional principle of university autonomy to attack the ban. Their arguments worked in the recruitment of physicist Dmitriy Gitma by the USP in 1992, after he won a public competition. Gitma is, however, an exception. All other Russian researchers depend on a fund, and many of them accept an additional difficulty of teaching in Brazil: inflation. Physicist Irina Potapenko, of the UERJ, left Russia two years ago. Her salary is adjusted by the dollar exchange rate every three months, despite the disagreement of state public servants. "I live in a university apartment. Just the same, inflation makes salaries barely enough for a condominium and survival." Despite the fact that her salary is corroded by price increases, she admits to being satisfied with the work, and does not contemplate leaving the country. When the legal and economic difficulties are pointed out to her, she answers with the smile of a person who has already begun to know the Brazilian soul: "Take it easy; Brazil is ours," she says.
