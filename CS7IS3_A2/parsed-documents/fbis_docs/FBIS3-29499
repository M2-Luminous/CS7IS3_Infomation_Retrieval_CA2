Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada told a press conference Japan welcomes the fact that U.S. Congressman William Richardson was able to meet Suu Kyi as the first nonfamily member to do so since her house arrest in 1989. Terada quoted Richardson as saying Suu Kyi expressed a wish to hold high-level talks with SLORC and that the first secretary of SLORC also hinted at the possibility of such talks. "We naturally hope to see the dialogue take place and that it will be a step forward for an early solution of problems, including the release of Aung San Suu Kyi," he said. But he referred to a press briefing by SLORC on Tuesday in which it said Suu Kyi will be detained until next year, and said the Japanese Government would "regret this very much" if such is the case. Richardson, a Democrat from New Mexico, met Suu Kyi on February 14 and 15. Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy which won the national general election in May 1990, has been confined at her house in Yangon [Rangoon] since July 1989.
