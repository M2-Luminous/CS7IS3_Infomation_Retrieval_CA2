Mr Charat said the order followed his recent request to Laotian PM's Office Minister Phao Bounnaphon to open the checkpoints seven days a week. Laotian border immigration checkpoints with Thailand earlier opened from Monday to Saturday from 8 a.m to 5 p.m. and closed every Sunday, he said. This forced tourists from the Thai side who crossed the border on Saturday to come back the same day. Checkpoints which worked on Sunday would enable tourists to stay in Laos on Saturday night and return to Thailand the next day, he said. Laos has international immigration checkpoints with Thailand at Vientiane (opposite Nong Khai), Bokeo (opposite Chiang Khong district of Chiang Rai province) and Pakse (opposite Ubon Ratchathani province). These international checkpoints were ordered from February 16 to open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and temporary checkpoints were to open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a 50 baht charge per tourist, Mr Charat said.
