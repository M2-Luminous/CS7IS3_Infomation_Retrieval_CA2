He stressed "the National Army units had to involve in fierce defensive fighting and have managed to force the enemy out from the occupied populated localities". "In the first days of the new year they deterred the enemy's attack in the Adgam direction near the Agdam regional center seized in summer 1993. Successful counter-actions have resulted in the destruction of seven tanks and two apcs. More than 200 soldiers of the enemy were killed, several villages were taken under the national army control. There are no Armenian units in these villages, but they are under constant shelling which prevents the local population from returning home", he said. The defence minister estimated as protracted position fighting combat operations in the Azeri west, where the national army units have crossed the Murovdag Ridge between the Azeri south-west and north-west and continue to move towards the Kelbajar region occupied in April 1993. The situation in the Beylagan direction in the republic's south-west remains complicated, as the Azeris are holding the line against the attacking Armenian units. According to the recent reports, the situation has aggravated in the north-western border Kazakh region. The latter was put under rocket-artillery shelling from the Armenian Noyemberyan region on Monday, which resulted in considerable destructions and losses amongst civilians. The Azeris responded with the suppression of several fire nests on the adjoining territory. The general reported the capture of a major military storage of the enemy in the Geranboy region located outside Nagorno-Karabakh. According to him, the Armenians planed to use the storage's arms in another large-scale offensive inside Azerbaijan. The minister is convinced combat operations on Azeri territory could have been stopped long ago if no additional materiel and personnel were sent from Armenian territory almost every day. In January the Armenians moved reserves to the Agdam area, where they had had only advanced security element. As a result, the situation was considerably aggravated.
