The trade unionists striking last 3 February demanded that [the government] increase to 5.5 trillion zlotys [Z] its orders placed with the defense industry, provide funds for restructuring its enterprises, raise wages, offer reimbursement for the funds spent on maintaining readiness for wartime production during the years 1990-93 and for the equipment exported to the former USSR, and, last, that it reduce the number of countries to which it has embargoed arms shipments. ``Recent Sejm legislation has made it possible to operate defense-industry enterprises on the basis of laws governing joint-stock companies rather than state enterprises. At the same time, I wish to emphasize that the minister of industry and trade wants to execute on his own the provisions of the Law on the Privatization of State Enterprises rather than leave them to the minister of ownership transformations. That is because it is the duty of the latter minister to not just privatize but also, among other things, to sell enterprises [to private investors], whereas our minister is going to utilize the new law on ownership transformations at defense-industry plants in order to restructure these plants while, at the same time, retaining them under the control of the State Treasury. Now that this law was passed by a large majority in the Sejm, we at the ministry are preparing to utilize this instrument as effectively as possible immediately after it takes effect. ``Let me remind you that, in the past, we isolated a group of enterprises to be classified as arms-industry enterprises. The 26 such enterprises that have by now been partially converted to single-person Treasury companies [an intermediate stage of privatization] have been divided into enterprises manufacturing ammunition and classical weaponry, radioelectronic and optical equipment enterprises, aviation enterprises, and artillery and armor enterprises. The principal premises of the restructuring and development programs are to apply equally to all of these groups. ``Another instrument that we have already been effectively utilizing since last June is the conclusion of civil-law agreements between enterprises and companies, on the one hand, and the State Treasury, represented by the minister of industry, on the other, to offset the cost of maintaining unused productive and technological capacities of the arms industry. We have increased the industry's exports markedly--by as much as 40 percent compared with 1992--although I must regretfully admit that we have not yet reattained the 1989 level of our exports. We assume, however, that we shall break that record if not this year then the next, owing to the improving situation on the world markets. We also pay great attention to sponsoring the development of new civilian products; here the Committee for Scientific Research provides us with considerable support by funding 50 percent of the related targeted projects. ``By 31 March, the effects of the new law on the financial restructuring of banks and enterprises should become tangible. Some of our enterprises have been able to sign agreements under that law. We expect the worst-performing among defense-industry enterprises to sign such agreements with their creditors, which means that not only our ministry but also the banks will consider positively the possibilities for the restructuring and further management of that industry. ``We also have new declarations, new instruments that will be applied this year. At the ministry, we are trying to increase the number of government loan guarantees provided. Altogether, about Z25 trillion is earmarked in the budget for such guarantees, and, at its next meeting, the Council of Ministers will consider, among other things, providing such guarantees for the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant. Moreover, providing them also for the Hydral Transportation Equipment Plant in Wroclaw is currently under discussion at our ministry. Others, too, are helping us. Thus, the minister of foreign economic relations is trying to get more funds to spend on promoting [foreign sales of the products] of the four above-mentioned arms-industry groups. Hence, this also concerns interministerial cooperation in certain domains rather than cooperation among discrete enterprises. "In connection with the discussion of programs for social protection, the Sejm is currently considering a law on so-called preretirement benefits; that law will especially apply to arms-industry enterprises because they are located in regions of greatest unemployment. We shall not at the same time try to utilize the Z2 trillion allocated to us by the World Bank for the social protection of the employees of shut-down plants. Under our program, in classifying 31 enterprises as arms-industry ones, we were guided by the principle of mergers instead of shutdowns. Thus, none of these enterprises will be closed."
