President Wasmosy convened a meeting of Industry and Commerce Minister Ubaldo Scavone, Agriculture and Livestock Minister Raul Torres, Cadelpa President Roberto Antebi, and Oscar Aranda, of Inagrisa [Agricultural and Industrial Investments, Inc.] to discuss the situation. Following the announcement made by Scavone and Torres, Antebi rose to express his disagreement over the proceeding. "We accept the decision, but we do not share it," Antebi said, adding that the government did not respect the signed agreement. Antebi questioned the fact that the government made the decision "during the last minute of the game." Antebi said that last year the private sector was called in to bear the burden of solving the critical problem created by the picudo [cotton infecting insect] invasion. Besides, producers did not have any incentives to cultivate cotton. Cadelpa actively participated in promoting cotton production with seeds, raw materials, financial and technological support, and provided the necessary resources, Antebi said. The industrialist added that conditions then were very bad and that Cadelpa knowingly assumed the risk of fighting the picudo infection which at the time was calculated to have affected 50 percent of the land used for cotton cultivation. "It was necessary to take preventive measures and Cadelpa imported the best insecticides to fight the scourge and supplied them to producers at cost," Antebi said. Besides, Cadelpa contracted 18 foreign experts in the disease, 100 engineers, organized more than 1,000 meetings, trained 10,000 operators and as a result today peasants know how to treat the disease, Antebi explained. Antebi said that Cadelpa thinks the cotton industry is being used as a "scapegoat" because currently there are many other serious political problems. The industrialist said the decision will end up causing more damage to agricultural production in the future. "The money always goes where it is safe to invest. Nearly $120 million have been invested in agriculture and that is why the rules of the game should have been respected," Antebi said. "If there is no security for investments then who will invest in agriculture next year? We will see if the government, politicians, religious people, or who will be interested in investing in agriculture. The private sector will watch and if conditions are appropriate will participate, otherwise it will not," Antebi emphasized.
