FR941122-1-00005 FR941122-1-00001 Under current rules at 7 CFR 277.15 of Food Stamp Program regulations, State agencies are required to submit a fraud control plan prior to receiving the enhanced funding. A plan is not currently required under the regulations for standard fraud funding. In Fiscal Year 1993, all State agencies submitted or extended their current fraud control plans and all State agencies received enhanced fraud funding. The Department is proposing to retain the requirement for a fraud control plan. The Department believes a fraud control plan is an important management tool in combatting fraud and an important component of the State agency's Plan of Operation. Further, because program benefits are fully funded by the Department, the Department has an interest in seeing that State agencies develop and implement an effective fraud control plan. However, the Department is proposing to drop the other specific requirements in §277.15 (e.g., job title of Investigator, separate claims units, etc.) that pertain solely to enhanced funding for fraud control activity. Fraud control activity performed either by investigators or certification workers would be eligible for 50 percent funding. The Department is also proposing to change the timing of the submission of the fraud control plan. Under current rules the Fraud Plan is submitted annually to FNS as an attachment to the FNS&hyph;366B, Program Activity Statement, 45 days after the end of the State's fiscal year. For most States which operate on a July 1 to June 30 fiscal year, this created an August 15 deadline for the fraud control plan. The Department is proposing a new §272.2(e)(10) which would create a uniform due date of August 15th for all State agencies, regardless of their State fiscal year. The change will ensure that the fraud control plan is submitted prior to the start of the Federal fiscal year to which it applies, and it links submission of the fraud control plan with the submission of the Budget Projection Statement which is also due August 15. The Department believes the planning and budgeting of program activity should be linked since significant changes in planned activity may also mean changes in Federal funding. The Department is proposing to make conforming amendments to §272.2(a), (c)(3), and (e)(3). The Department further proposes to remove §277.15 and incorporate the retained provisions elsewhere in the regulations. As noted above, the Department intends to retain the fraud control plan requirements in §277.15(c) by incorporating these requirements into the Plan of Operation requirements at 7 CFR 272.2(d). The Department is also proposing to make conforming amendments to §272.2(a)(2), (c)(3), and (d)(1), as appropriate, related to the due date of the plan and the relocation of the submission procedure from (c)(3) to (e)(10). The Department is not proposing to create new requirements for the fraud control plan but to extend the current requirements and change the due date for this plan. The Department is proposing to reserve section 277.15 for future use. Because the Department is proposing to move the fraud control plan submission requirement to §272.2(d)(1)(xi), the current submission requirement in §272.2(c)(3)(i) is being deleted. The deletion of paragraph (i) requires redesignating §272.2(c)(3)(ii) as §272.2(c)(3). Although the wording must be changed slightly to accomodate the restructuring of the paragraph, the requirements in the current §272.2(c)(3)(ii) for submission of certain interagency agreements are unchanged. The Department also intends to incorporate the provision regarding the funding rate for investigations of retail or wholesale food concerns currently found in §277.15(f)(2), with a slight modification for clarity, into a new paragraph (e) of §277.4.
