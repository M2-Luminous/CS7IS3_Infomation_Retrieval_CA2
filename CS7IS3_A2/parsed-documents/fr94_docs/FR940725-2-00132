ACTION: Notice of determination by NHTSA that nonconforming 1993 Mercedes-Benz 200E passenger cars are eligible for importation. SUMMARY: This notice announces the determination by NHTSA that 1993 Mercedes-Benz 200E passenger cars not originally manufactured to comply with all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards are eligible for importation into the United States because they are substantially similar to a vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified by its manufacturer as complying with the safety standards (the 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300E), and they are capable of being readily modified to conform to the standards. DATE: The determination is effective July 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ted Bayler, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, NHTSA (202&hyph;366&hyph;5306). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under 49 U.S.C. ยง30141(a)(1)(A) (formerly section 108(c)(3)(A)(i) of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (the Act)), a motor vehicle that was not originally manufactured to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards shall be refused admission into the United States unless NHTSA has determined that the motor vehicle is substantially similar to a motor vehicle originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, certified under 49 U.S.C. ยง30115 (formerly section 114 of the Act), and of the same model year as the model of the motor vehicle to be compared, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Petitions for eligibility determinations may be submitted by either manufacturers or importers who have registered with NHTSA pursuant to 49 CFR Part 592. As specified in 49 CFR 593.7, NHTSA publishes notice in the Federal Register of each petition that it receives, and affords interested persons an opportunity to comment on the petition. At the close of the comment period, NHTSA determines, on the basis of the petition and any comments that it has received, whether the vehicle is eligible for importation. The agency then publishes this determination in the Federal Register . Champagne Imports, Inc. of Lansdale, Pennsylvania (Registered Importer R&hyph;90&hyph;009) petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1993 Mercedes-Benz 200E passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. NHTSA published notice of the petition on May 25, 1994 (59 FR 27107) to afford an opportunity for public comment. The reader is referred to that notice for a thorough description of the petition. No comments were received in response to the notice. Based on its review of the information submitted by the petitioner, NHTSA has determined to grant the petition. Vehicle Eligibility Number for Subject Vehicles The importer of a vehicle admissible under any final determination must indicate on the form HS&hyph;7 accompanying entry the appropriate vehicle eligibility number indicating that the vehicle is eligible for entry. VSP 75 is the vehicle eligibility number assigned to vehicles admissible under this notice of final determination. Final Determination Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing, NHTSA hereby determines that a 1993 Mercedes-Benz 200E (Model ID 124.019) is substantially similar to a 1993 Mercedes-Benz 300E originally manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States and certified under section 114 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, and is capable of being readily modified to conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.
