Ulises Rosales del Toro, chief of the General Staff; and Division Gen. Ramon Espinosa Martin, head of the Eastern Army, in attendance. Council members and first secretaries of the party from the six provinces that form part of the Eastern Army were also in attendance. Party officials from Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus were present as special guests. During the first part of the event, participants heard a detailed report, presented by Brigadier Gen. Urbelino Betancourt, head of the General Staff of the Eastern Army, on the energy potential of the Eastern Army. The report disclosed its capacity and considerable potential, based on its reduction in consumption of conventional fuel, which reached 77 percent in comparison to 1989; while with electricity, it used 50 percent less, without affecting fulfillment of combat preparation programs, equipment conservation, ammunition savings, and a considerable increase in food production. The increased use of fuel-saving devices and methods, such as windmills, biogas processors [digestores], solar energy, bagasse, sugarcane straw, and firewood as alternate sources; and the use of animal power in various activities; the use of magnetizers, direct fuel emulsifiers for service and combat vehicles, and the use of efficient stoves are realities that were verified by those who attended this extraordinary military council of the Eastern Army, which focuses on the organizational measures being carried out, with the goal of securing the instruction process of the troops under conditions very close to option zero. The meeting held with combatants of a great tank unit selected as one of the best in the whole FAR, allowed them to see the operation of a classroom complex specializing in tanks, infantry, and communications. It was here, where Raul and those who are accompanying him received many demonstrations on the overall state of the troops, target practice with tanks using lever mechanisms and stabilizers, in which variations in terrain and moveable targets create a sensation of a real offensive movement by these machines. The overcoming of obstacles, activity on the practice range, and mastery in camouflage are objectives of the combat preparation that can be seen, along with solutions to substitute or adapt means and equipment for conservation in view of the lack of some essential elements in defensive preparations. Combatants pedal to make the communication stations work. Workshops that repair and manufacture parts continue operating without fuel. Industrial electric energy continues operating through the initiatives of workers, which makes them worthy of an outstanding position in the country. Transparent shingles are used on warehouses, variants for nonmotorized transportation are elements that contribute to the savings in this great unit. The final stop on the tour was at the medical facility, which is the pride of the Eastern Army because it is the best of its type in the FAR, and where more than 135 formulations of herbal remedies are manufactured. There is a high use of acupuncture and a great quantity of medical equipment that operates without conventional energy. This great tank unit, which has maintained its vanguard performance for four years in a row, has not neglected the production of alternative materials based on Roman cement for the construction of housing and fortifications, the production of feed and phytopharmaceuticals [fitofarmacos] that were previously imported and are used in the poultry and pork farming they have developed, or increased possibilities of producing freshwater fish in recently built small tanks and dams. An impromptu meeting set the tone for congratulating the members of the tank unit on the occasion of their day, and the day honoring the Bay of Pigs. Division Gen. Ulises Rosales del Toro spoke to those present. [Begin Rosales recording] On behalf of the minister, the generals, and the leaders who accompany us, all of whom will be with you for two days participating in the military council of the Eastern Army, we wish to congratulate you on this day. [end recording] Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba, head of the political directorate of the FAR, a tank driver during the Bay of Pigs, also spoke to the soldiers. [Begin Lopez recording] On this day, we salute all members of tank units and ask that they outshine the tank units from the Bay of Pigs. [end recording] Afterwards, an accurate demonstration was held by a group of combatants of the unit, who confidently battled enemy targets as any other of the 100,000 experts and marksmen of the FAR would do, and who are ready to act under the concept of the people's war. This extraordinary military council of the Eastern Army with its activities continues to demonstrate with specific facts how our combatants, dressed in their olive green uniforms, do not fold their arms and are not intimidated by the current material obstacles. To the contrary, they arm themselves with new initiatives, elevating themselves to the level that this moment demands. Above all, each day they perfect their fighting capabilities.
