Radio piloting equipment will be installed on retained stocks of F-104J fighter planes retired from active service in 1985. The cost of refitting the F-104's will come to about Â¥600 million per plane and six planes have been ordered for Fiscal Year 1993 (FY-93). The production of F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft by MHI's Aircraft Division has peaked and the firm's sales can be expected to be further reduced by slower growth in the budget for front-line armaments. MHI hopes to make up for the decline in its work on new planes by publicizing its pioletless-aircraft technology to win orders to refit a total of around 20 aircraft. In 1990, MHI delivered to the Defense Agency two F-104's that it had refitted with pilotless technology. The two planes were, however, designed to also allow piloted flight; the two planes were intended to collect various kinds of data on pilotless flight and could be described as being at the experimental stage. The F104 was once a masterpiece said to be "the ultimate in manned flight," but refitting it with pilotless technology was difficult and took time because, among other things, the plane's landing speed is fast since it becomes unstable at slow speeds. MHI resolved the technical problems in experiments that it conducted up to FY92 and received orders for six planes in FY93, so it's beginning full-fledged refittings in order to convert the planes to completely pilotless aircraft at its Nagoya Aerospace Systems Komaki South Plant (located in Toyoyama Township, Aichi Prefecture). MHI plans to have all the planes delivered by the beginning of FY93. The Defense Agency has kept in stock 20 or more F-104's that it has not disposed of by disassembly, and MHI believes that there will be a demand for refitting them as pilotless aircraft beginning in FY94. In addition to being able to fly on a pre-programmed course the pilotless planes will be able to be controlled by radio while monitoring it by television from the ground. Moreover, if the pilotless planes go beyond the range that they can receive radio signals they will automatically return to skies within radio reception. The Air Self-Defense Forces plan to utilize the refitted F-104's as target aircraft in training around Iwo Jima. Currently MHI is mainly occupied with such tasks as producing F-15 interceptor-fighter aircraft under license for the Air Self-Defense Forces and sharing the production of the civilian passenger plane Boeing 777. The production of F-15's has already peaked and the production of civilian passenger planes has slumped due to the world-wide recession in the airline industry. MHI hopes to receive refitting-work orders as a way of maintaining sales until the next-generation FSX fighter begins to be mass-produced.
