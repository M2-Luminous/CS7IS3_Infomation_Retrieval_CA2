FR940428-2-00134 FR940428-2-00063 If approved, Rule 1014(g)(i) will entitle the specialist to an enhanced participation on parity trades by being counted as two crowd participants in certain circumstances (``enhanced parity split participation''). First, the contra side order must be for more than five contracts. Secondly, the enhanced participation may not disadvantage a customer order that is also on parity. Third, the enhanced specialist participation will not be applicable to all option classes. It will be applicable for all option classes that are listed after the rule becomes effective and for 50% of each specialist unit's listed issues at the time the rule becomes effective. In this regard, each specialist's registered issues will be divided into quartiles based on the most recent quarterly customer contract volume. The specialist will be able to choose half of his issues in each volume quartile rounded so that the aggregate number chosen does not exceed 50% of the total number of issues in all four quartiles. The specialist will be required to submit this list to the Allocation, Evaluation and Securities Committee (``AES Committee'') for its review and approval. This list, once submitted and approved by the AES Committee, will be in effect for the entire one-year period of the pilot program. The Phlx also proposes to adopt Phlx Rule 509 to empower the AES Committee to oversee each specialist's performance with respect to the enhanced participation privilege. A standing subcommittee of the AES Committee entitled the ``Quality of Markets Subcommittee'' (``Subcommittee'') will be created to review each specialist's performance on a quarterly basis to assure that four conditions are being satisfied by a specialist who receives the benefit of the enhanced parity splits in his trading crowd. First, the specialist must demonstrate that he is the lead market maker in the trading crowd measured by his transacting more contracts in an option class than any ROT in that issue over the review period. The second criterion authorizes the Subcommittee to review whether the specialist has provided the Phlx with adequate market share in options which are multiply traded. In this respect, the Subcommittee will determine whether the Phlx has transacted at least 10% of the aggregate customer volume in an issue that is traded by all five options exchange, at least 15% where four exchanges trade the issue, at least 20% where three exchanges trade the issue, and at least 25% where only one other exchange trades the issue. Although this is a measure of the total customer volume executed on the Exchange rather than solely by the specialist, in the competition for multiply traded issues, the Exchange believes the specialist is a key party responsible for marketing the issue to upstairs firms, updating markets, and maintaining the limit order book. A specialist who performs these functions will, the Exchange believes, assist the Exchange in increasing order flow. The third criterion is one that is already in place. Rule 515 specifies that an option specialist unit must attain at least a score of five on its quarterly specialist evaluation. A specialist who does not receive a five on his evaluation may be considered to have performed adequately enough to maintain his specialist privileges under Rule 515, but may lose his enhanced participation privileges under proposed Rule 509 until he increases his score. The final criterion authorizes the Subcommittee to consider whether a pattern of weakness has been demonstrated by such things as frequent floor official rulings with respect to any particular options class or crowd and/or by written customer complaints being received by the Exchange or Subcommittee regarding the specialist in any particular options class.
