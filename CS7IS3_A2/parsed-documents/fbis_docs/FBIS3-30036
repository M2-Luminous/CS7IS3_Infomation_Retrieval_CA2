It is now preparing sanctions against Japan. Put simply, the U.S. Government complaint, and that of the private company involved, Motorola, is that while a U.S. company has succeeded in entering the market, its market share is too small. They profess particularly strong dissatisfaction with the fact that, in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and Central Japan, the biggest markets for mobile phones, Motorola is overwhelmingly disadvantaged by rival Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation's (NTT) system, and they claim this constitutes breaking the promise made in 1989. There is a reason for the Motorola system's minimal share in the above areas. In 1987, the mobile phone market, which used to be monopolized by NTT, was opened, and the Cellular Telephone Group (affiliated with DDI Corporation) and Teleway Japan Corporation (later IDO) joined the market. At that time, due to government policy which forbade more than two companies operating in any one area, NTT was permitted to operate nationwide, IDO in the metropolitan area and Central Japan, and the Cellular Group in the other service areas. IDO actually started its service under the Motorola system in November 1991, although it had already begun an NTT-system service in late 1988. There was, therefore, a time lag of about three years and capital investment in the Motorola system cannot be compared with that in the NTT system. The NTT-system service can be offered to an area covering 94 percent of the Japanese population, while the Motorola system can only service an area covering 60 percent of the population. In terms of the number of mobile phone units contracted, the Motorola system accounts for only 10,000 terminals, compared to the NTT system's overwhelming 310,000 sets. The United States sees the failure to set up from the start a mobile phone company servicing the whole country under the Motorola system, and IDO's delay in actually operating the Motorola system, even after it was adopted, as deliberate moves on the part of Japan to obstruct the opening of the market. An outright purchase system [as opposed to the existing lease system] for mobile phone terminals will be introduced next April, as will a digital service. At a time when the market is expected to expand vigorously, whatever the reasons put forward by the Japanese, the United States seems to have become increasingly irritated by the fact its serious disadvantage in market share compared to the NTT system may prove a decisive setback in future business operations. The Japanese side reportedly plans to increase Motorola-system relay stations by 130 in the next two or three years, allowing the Motorola-system service to grow to the same level as the NTT-system service. We do not intend to say we cannot understand why the United States is irritated. Nevertheless, the attitude of the U.S. Government is unreasonable in urging Japanese private companies to accept its demands and ignore business profitability. For example, the United States has demanded that 130 relay stations be established in fiscal year 1994 and that Japan procure 225,000 Motorola-made terminals. The current mobile phone issue seems typical of the Clinton administration's political strategy, and was deliberately raised to coincide with the summit meeting between the two countries as well as negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. Although the Japanese Government needs to take positive steps to dispel U.S. misunderstanding, it should not overreact to the issue. Both sides should stay calm, and the issue should be settled through dialogue at the private sector level. Excessive government intervention will only increase confusion.
