FR941028-2-00226 FR941028-2-00110 The Secretary estimates that at least 75 percent of available funds will be used to support model projects in schools, and 25 percent of available funds will support technical assistance and dissemination projects. For the first priority involving model programs, the Secretary proposes to direct financial assistance to projects that primarily benefit urban or rural areas that have been designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities in accordance with Section 1391 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993. Background on Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Program The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program is a critical element of the Administration's community revitalization strategy. The program is the first step in rebuilding communities in America's poverty-stricken inner cities and rural heartlands. It is designed to empower people and communities by inspiring Americans to work together to create jobs and opportunity. Under this program, the Federal government will designate up to nine areas as Empowerment Zones and up to 95 areas as Enterprise Communities in accordance with Internal Revenue Code section 1311, as amended by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). To be eligible for designation, an area must be nominated by one or more local governments and the State or States in which it is located or by a State-Chartered Economic Development Corporation. A nominated area must be one of pervasive poverty, unemployment, and general distress, and must have a poverty rate of not less than the level specified in section 1392 of the Internal Revenue Code. In the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program communities are invited to submit strategic plans that comprehensively address how the community would link economic development with education and training as well as how community development, public safety, human services, and environmental initiatives will together support sustainable communities. Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities will be designated by the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) based on the quality of their strategic plans. Designated areas will receive Federal grant funds and substantial tax benefits and will have access to other Federal programs. (For additional information on the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Community program contact HUD at 1&hyph;800&hyph;998&hyph;9999.) The Department of Education is supporting the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative in a variety of ways. It is encouraging Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities to use funds they already receive from Department of Education programs (including Chapter 1 of Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, the Adult Education Act, and the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act) to support the comprehensive vision of their strategic plans. In addition, the Department of Education intends to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in a number of discretionary grant programs that are well suited for inclusion in a comprehensive approach to economic and community development. In addition to the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education program described in this notice, the Department intends to give preferences to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities in the Urban Community Service program, National Workplace Literacy program, the Rehabilitation Act Projects with Industry program, the Rehabilitation Act Special Demonstration Projects program, the Parent Training program, and the Early Childhood Education program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and a variety of discretionary programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Notices concerning those programs will be published at a later date. The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community initiative and the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program share some common features. Both programs are concerned with the educational advancement of students caught in high-poverty communities. Under the Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program, at least one-half of the grants in any given year must serve students who are economically disadvantaged, limited English proficient or who have disabilities.
