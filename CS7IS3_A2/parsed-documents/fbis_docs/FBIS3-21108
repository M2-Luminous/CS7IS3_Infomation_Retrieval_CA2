According to a company spokesperson, Cisi is getting rid of a structure defined on the basis of tasks and is preparing to restructure its organization on the basis of its customers' market sectors. As a result, Cisi Ingenierie, Cisi Transtec and Cisi Telematique (excluding the part that is being reattached to Athesa France, Cisi's and Bull's joint subsidiary in facilities management) are going to merge into a single company. That will depend on Cisi SA, the financial holding company that is supposed to head up the group's overseas subsidiaries, as well as Athesa France. This restructuring is supposed to impart dynamism to Cisi activity (FF70 million in losses in 1992 on a turnover of FF1.5 billion) and accelerate structural savings. Shuffling the workforce at Rungis is also on the agenda.
