The political essay says it is a miracle of miracles that Yi In-mo could return alive from South Korea where he had been detained for 43 years, undergoing all sorts of indescribable outrages and appeasement by fascist hangmen throughout his 34 years in prison in particular. He has been able to take the course of his life to a paradise from the "hell", overcoming innumerable trying difficulties because he has fought and won with his iron faith and will, says the essay. When we say about his faith and will, we cannot but think of his mental support, the basic factor of it, the essay says, and goes on: It was his belief that victory was sure to come as long as there a the great general, that the bosom of the general was a true cradle of life for all his soldiers and that a bright future of the revolution and the Reunification of the country and prosperity of the nation lay in following the road indicated by the general. It was his unquestioned trust in the illustrious leader that enabled him to enjoy respect and love of all the people as the incarnation of faith and will, the highest honour ever granted to the revolutionaries in the world. "Our party remembers Comrade Yi In-mo, the incarnation of faith and will" -- these words written in person by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il before Yi In-mo returned to the bosom of the homeland reflect his trust in a soldier who was suffering in South Korea and contain his iron will and determination to bring him home to a paradise under whatever circumstances. Our general Kim Chong-il did not forget even a moment about the fate of a soldier but took all steps for his repatriation, although he was busy leading the whole party, all the people and the army to victory, shoulding the burden of all important work decisive of the destiny of the whole nation and of world peace and security. On March 19, ten days after a semi-war state was proclaimed, when a touch-and-go situation was created in which a war might break out any moment, an old soldier, a veteran party member who had already been sentenced to death by the enemy returned to the northern half of the country, all alone, making a breakthrough in the wall of division. Indeed, in the mind of our general Kim Chong-il are all his soldiers, the whole nation, and he is in the minds of our people, our nation. For this close bonds of kinship the dear leader is regarded as the mental support of all his soldiers. Referring to the highest honour and happiness Yi In-mo has experienced in the last one year since his return to the northern half of the country, the political essay goes on: Comrade Yi In-mo was awarded "Order of Kim Il-song", the highest honour of the DPRK, and the medal of Hero of the Republic and even his bronze statue was erected at his hometown thanks to the broadminded benevolence of the great general Kim Chong-il. The bosom of the great general Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a cradle of life without which all our soldiers cannot live even a moment, the bosom of the mother always dear to their hearts and a benevolent bosom which brings socialist life into full bloom. The great general's benevolence gives the worth of life and pleasure not only to comrade Yi In-mo but to all the people of the country.
