Orlando said over the weekend that he envisaged immediate forms of cooperation in the fields of food, machine tools, metalworking and woodworking. Thai industrialists will be taking part in Italian trade fairs and will make use of Italy's experience in professional training at intermediate levels. During his visit, Orlando met with Thai business leaders and with the deputy ministers for foreign trade and for industry. The CONFINDUSTRIA delegation included bankers as well as industrialists. Italian exports to Thailand markedly increased in 1993, reaching the sum of 1.4 trillion lire (833 million dollars). Furthermore, the direct presence of Italian industry in the fields of steel, energy, installations and construction has deepened. In fact, Thailand is ever more strongly seen as a focal point of growing importance in terms of Italian economic activities towards Indochina.
