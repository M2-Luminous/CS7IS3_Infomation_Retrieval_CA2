According to reliable sources, he believes some correctional changes are necessary to give new impetus to the sectors that are not functioning well and to deal with the problem of lack of coordination within the government. According to the same sources, the prime minister intends to give a portfolio to Dhimitrios Tsovolas and replace Education Minister Dhimitrios Fatouros. He is also considering whether he should remove Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros Pangalos during the shuffle or after the expiration of the Greek European Union presidency in July. The situation at the top of the National Economy Ministry will remain unchanged unless Finance Minister Yeoryios Yennimatas decides to move up to the government's vice presidency or resign. In this case, his replacement will be either Bhouttos, Vaitsos, or Pottakis.
