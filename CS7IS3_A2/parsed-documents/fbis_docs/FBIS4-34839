Sources attending the meetings told EL OBSERVADOR that some members reported that many developed countries are not fulfilling their commitments to liberalize trade as agreed at the end of the Uruguay round of GATT talks in April. During the meeting members reproached each other for their attitude during and after the Uruguay round of talks. The sources added that during the Cairns Group meeting in Montevideo on 19 and 20 May, some delegates claimed to have reliable information on unfair trade practices, which were thought to have been overcome but which are still being used. Representatives of agricultural country agreed that the failure to fulfill GATT agreements hurt the agricultural countries that do not subsidize their products. Representatives agreed on the need to follow developments in order to guarantee respect for international agreements. "The clause referring to subsidies for producers must be supervised carefully. We must follow its implementation closely to prevent its use against our interests," the Brazilian delegate said during the secret meeting. He added: "I have very clear information that some countries will not fulfill their commitment to the Uruguay round of GATT talks because their budgets will be affected. This is very dangerous and we must be very careful." Various speakers had similar complaints. They all agreed "to follow" developments within the economic policies of other blocs, seeking to detect failures to fulfill their agreements in the area of agriculture. The Argentine representative said "we must become a thorn in the side of Brussels, Washington, and Tokyo; if we do not, the Cairns Group could become a bureaucratic mess and disappear. We must pack our bags, go there, and needle them." The Uruguayan delegation indicated that "the schedules for implementing the commitments of the Marrakech Declaration do not coincide with our timetable," warning that "the implementation of the Uruguay Round commitments must not be postponed." The private sessions of the Cairn Group ministers meeting did not run in perfect harmony even though an attempt was made to present a united front. Argentina took advantage of the situation to criticize members of the group that indulge in the practice of subsidies. The innuendo was directed mainly at Brazil and Canada with whom Argentina had a controversy regarding the trading of wheat. The meeting's most tense moment came when Australian Trade Minister Bob McMullan, who presided the sessions, implicitly acknowledged that Australia had individually negotiated agricultural matters with the United States and the EU [European Union] without informing other Cairns Group members. The situation is serious because Australia exercised the Group's presidency during the Uruguay Round. An Argentine petition to include in the agenda a common strategy regarding a common agricultural policy motivated McMullan's acknowledgement. McMullan, notably perturbed, admitted that the document was Australia's, but indicated that his country was still negotiating with the United States and Europe and did not want the Cairns Group to follow it up if the proposal did not have a chance of being successful. The topic was not discussed any more during the meeting but several South American diplomats later commented that McMullan's answer suggested a deceitful form of conduct by Australia and highlighted the lack of a total cohesion within the group. During the final secret session, the Australian representative recommended that the delegations should exhibit an image of internal consensus and imply that the Cairns Group obtained concrete achievements during the Uruguay Round.
