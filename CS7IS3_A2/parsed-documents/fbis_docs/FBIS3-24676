Tokyo Debating Controversial Trade Performance Targets SUMMARY Elements within the Japanese Government appear to be engaged in a search for a way to defuse trade tensions with the United States by finding a qualified definition of trade performance targets that is acceptable to both Tokyo and Washington. Speedy consensus on this issue is not likely, however, as recent comments in favor of qualified targets by a powerful political leader and a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) bureaucrat involved in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations immediately met with resistance from within the ruling coalition and the bureaucracy, suggesting that Tokyo remains divided on the issue. END SUMMARY Ichiro Ozawa, Secretary General of the Shinseito, one of the key political parties in the ruling Japanese coalition government, and Koichiro Matsuura, Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Affairs, recently floated what appeared to be trial balloons suggesting the Japan should set some sort of voluntary, non- binding targets to reduce its trade surplus and improve its import performance. According to the 23 February Mainichi Shimbun and a 23 February Kyodo report, Ozawa, one of the most influential politicians in Japan, told foreign correspondents on 22 February that Japan should set "endeavor targets for Japan's effort to promote market opening" provided that the United States agreed not to impose sanctions if Tokyo failed to meet the targets. The Japanese press reports have so far not provided further details about the exact nature of the targets Ozawa has in mind. Matsuura, one of the key figures in the U.S.-Japan framework negotiations, floated a proposal that may differ somewhat in concept from Ozawa's, focusing on macroeconomic targets rather than on criteria for measuring market opening in specific sectors. According to a 21 February Kyodo report, Matsuura suggested in a 21 February speech that Tokyo should set a voluntary target to cut the ratio of its global current account surplus in fiscal 1994. He reportedly stated that the surplus be cut from the current 3.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.8 percent of gross domestic target--a figure he said would help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States. However, according to Kyodo, Matsuura also said that Japan and the United States were unlikely to reach an agreement on the definition of "objective criteria" to measure foreign access to Japanese markets, as stipulated in the July, 1993 agreement establishing the framework talks. Ozawa's and Matsuura's comments immediately provoked statements of support and opposition from within both the ruling coalition and the bureaucracy, suggesting there is as yet no consensus on even a compromise position on the issue of targets within the Japanese government. According to a 23 February Kyodo report, an unidentified "government source" indicated that there was some support within Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's government for Ozawa's proposal, stating that it was "one idea" being floated to defuse trade tensions with the United States. The source reportedly added that it was important that the targets be "nonbinding." Another unidentified source told the 22 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun that there was some support within the government for Matsuura's idea of setting a target for the reduction of Japan's current account surplus, and that Japanese delegates "may make a statement to that effect" at the conference of G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors on 26 February "if asked." Like Ozawa, the source also stressed that this target must not be considered binding. He stated that Tokyo "cannot take full responsibility for failure to achieve the goal," whose success, he argued, would be affected not only by Tokyo's efforts but by U.S. and European economic policies. While not commenting directly on Ozawa's or Matsuura's proposals, other senior government leaders have suggested that they might support strong measures to defuse tensions with the United States. Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumagai, a close associate of Ozawa, reportedly told a news conference on 22 February that the impasse in the framework negotiations "requires a political decision" and "cannot be left to bureaucrats." According to a 22 February Kyodo report, he urged the government to take both microeconomic and macroeconomic measures to resolve the bilateral trade dispute. Tokyo may also be hearing from Japanese diplomats in the United States that Prime Minister Hosokawa's plan to draw up various measures to relax regulations governing imports and to open Japanese markets may not be acceptable to Washington. A 22 February Kyodo report quoted an unnamed Japanese diplomat in Washington stating that he did not think the plan would be "sufficient." Government Opposition There also appears to remain considerable opposition to the concept of setting any sort of targets, particularly within in powerful Ministry of Finance (MOF), which has proven to have considerable leverage with the coalition government in the past on such issues as tax reform. The 22 February Nihon Keizai Shimbun quoted an unidentified government source as stating that MOF is against Matsuura's idea of making a "public commitment" to reduce Japan's current account surplus, arguing that Japan's ability to follow through on such a commitment would be affected by circumstances beyond its control, such as policies and developments in other countries. In addition, Manae Kubota, director general of the Economic Planning Agency and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, the largest party in the ruling coalition, has spoken out against Matsuura's proposal, citing arguments similar to those made by MOF. On 22 February, she reportedly told a press conference that Japan could not commit itself to reducing its current account surplus to a certain percentage of GDP because the current account surplus was affected by such factors as fluctuations in exchange rates and developments in other countries. According to a 22 February Kyodo report, she stated that the Japanese Government would do better to focus its efforts on its current plans to examine specific measures it can take to further open its markets, such as deregulation, trade and investment promotion, stricter antitrust enforcement, and clearer procedures for government procurement. Initial press reporting on Ozawa's comments suggests that they, too, have generated some opposition. According to the 23 February Mainichi Shimbun, officials involved in the framework negotiations--presumably senior bureaucrats--are opposed to Ozawa's suggestion that nonbinding targets be set, arguing that any targets will inevitably be viewed as a formal commitment. Business Community Divisions Like the government, the Japanese business community appears to be divided over the issue of setting targets. There appears to be some support within the business community for Matsuura's idea of setting macroeconomic targets, but less for setting targets for imports by specific trade sectors. On 21 February, Masaru Hayami, chairman of one of Japan's leading business organizations, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), reportedly stated that Japan should set a target to reduce the ratio of Japan's current account surplus to its GDP (Kyodo, 21 February). Hayami has spoken out in favor of such macroeconomic targets in the past. In an article in the 17 October 1993 Mainichi Shimbun, he wrote that Japan should set a "flexible goal" to reduce its current account surplus to around 2 percent of GDP in order to prevent Japan's economic relations with the United States and other countries from deteriorating and to keep the yen from appreciating further--a development that would hurt Japan's export-oriented industries. He added, however, that he was "absolutely opposed" to setting targets for specific sectors, describing this as "managed trade." Other major business leaders also remain opposed to setting targets for specific sectors. On 23 February, Yutaka Kume, chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturer's Association and chairman of Nissan Motor Corporation reportedly stated that the automobile industry was opposed to setting objective criteria to measure the openness of Japanese markets. According to a 23 February Kyodo report, Kume told a press conference that "some" Japanese automobile companies would be willing to provide figures for the amount of automobile parts they purchase each year, but that they would not project how much they would buy in the future, because such projections would be regarded by the United States as a commitment. Outlook While Ozawa's and Matsuura's comments indicate that there is high level support in Japan for finding a solution to the dispute with the United States over objective criteria, the continued opposition to the setting of targets in such influential sections of the government as the Ministry of Finance suggests that it may be some time before the Japanese Government reaches a consensus on the issue. Although Ozawa has been instrumental in resolving some trade disputes with the United States in the past, his support or the support of other influential political figures for one side of particularly contentious issues has not necessarily always translated into immediate action. For example, Ozawa, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, and former vice president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party Shin Kanemaru all came out in favor of the opening of Japan's rice market in November 1991. Even though Takeshita and Kanemaru were the most influential figures in the ruling party at the time, it took two more years for Japan to make a decision on opening its rice market. Pressure for a resolution of tensions with the United States will most likely force a more rapid decision on the target issue. However, in the near term, Japan will probably attempt to defuse tensions with an approach which is less controversial domestically and easier to control, by focusing on Prime Minister Hosokawa's current plans to draw up measures to relax regulations affecting imports, clarify government procurement procedures, and strengthen the enforcement of antitrust legislation.
