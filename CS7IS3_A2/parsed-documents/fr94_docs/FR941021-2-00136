FR941021-2-00136 FR941021-2-00089 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34848; File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;39] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the American Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to the Listing and Trading of Banking Industry Portfolio Indexed Term Notes October 17, 1994. I. Introduction On September 22, 1994, the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and trade Indexed Term Notes (``Notes''), the return on which is based upon a static portfolio of banking industry securities (``Banking Industry Portfolio''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on October 4, 1994. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on October 11, 1994. 4 This order approves the proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34723 (September 27, 1994), 59 FR 50631 (October 4, 1994). 4 In Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, the Exchange proposes to remove Crestar Financial Corp from the Banking Industry Portfolio and replace it with Citizens Bancorp (Md.). See Letter from Claire McGrath, Managing Director and Special Counsel, Amex, to Michael Walinskas, Branch Chief, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated October 11, 1994. II. Description of the Proposal Under Section 107 of the Amex Company Guide (``Guide''), the Exchange may approve for listing and trading securities which cannot be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, or warrants. 5 The Amex now proposes to list for trading, under Section 107A of the Guide, Notes whose value is based in whole or in part on a static index composed of twenty actively-traded bank stocks. 6 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27753 (March 1, 1990), 55 FR 8626 (March 8, 1990). 6 The specific components of the Banking Industry Portfolio are: Bancorp Hawaii, Inc.; Barnett Banks, Inc.; Baybanks, Inc.; Citizens Bancorp (Md.); City National Corp.; Corestates Financial; First American Corp.; First Chicago Corp.; Hibernia Corp.; Mercantile Bancorp; Michigan National; Midlantic Corp.; North Fork Bancorp; Provident Bankshares; Summit Bancorp; U.S. Bancorp; UJB Financial Corp.; Union Planters Corp.; UST Corp.; and Vermont Financial Services. The Notes are non-convertible debt securities of Lehman Brothers, Inc. (``Lehman Brothers'') and will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 107A of the Guide. 7 Although the specific maturity date will not be established until immediately prior to the time of the offering, the Notes will provide for maturity within a period of not less than one nor more than seven years from the date of issue. The Notes provide for a single payment at maturity, and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value;'' provided, however, that: (1) the amount payable at maturity will not be less than 90% of the principal amount of the Notes; and (2) the issuer may place a cap on the amount to be paid on the Notes at maturity. 8 The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Banking Industry Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices the Notes for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the closing prices of the Banking Industry Portfolio securities for a specified number of days prior to maturity of the Notes. 9 The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity. 10 7 Specifically, the Notes must have: (1) a minimum public distribution of one million trading units; (2) a minimum of 400 holders; (3) an aggregate market value of at least $4 million; and (4) a term of at least one year. Additionally, the issuer of the Notes ( i.e. , Lehman Brothers) must have assets of at least $100 million, stockholders' equity of at least $10 million, and pre-tax income of at least $750,000 in the last fiscal year or in two of the three prior fiscal years. As an alternative to these financial criteria, the issuer must have either: (1) assets in excess of $200 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $10 million; or (2) assets in excess of $100 million and stockholders' equity in excess of $20 million. 8 For example, Lehman Brothers could place a cap on the amount to be received at maturity as a stated percentage of the issuance price, e.g. , 150% of the issuance price. Alternatively, a cap could be in the form of a participation rate whereby a holder of the Notes would participate in a stated percentage of the total percentage change between the Ending Portfolio Value and the Original Portfolio Value, e.g. , 80% of the total appreciation of the Banking Industry Portfolio during the term of the Notes. The Commission notes that these examples are by way of illustration, not of limitation, as to how a cap on the amount to be paid to holders of the Notes at maturity could be constructed by Lehman Brothers. 9 Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal the average of the closing prices for the Banking Industry Portfolio securities for the first 10 of the last 20 trading days prior to maturity of the Notes. Telephone conversation between Benjamin Krause, Senior Vice President, Capital Markets Group, Amex, and Brad Ritter, Senior Counsel, OMS, Division, Commission, on October 11, 1994. 10 The Banking Industry Portfolio Notes will entitle a holder at maturity to receive not less than 90% of the original issue price for the Notes. Additionally, holders of the Notes may not receive the full amount of the change between the Ending Portfolio Value and the Original Portfolio Value.
