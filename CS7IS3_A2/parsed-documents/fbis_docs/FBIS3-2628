The Chinese side may reject excessive demands made by foreign parties. The source told this reporter yesterday that an official in charge of the State Council had personally taken up the matter involving a hydropower plant, a Sino-foreign joint venture in Zhuhai. He instructed that the foreign party's request for an 18 percent return on investment must not be accepted. Later, the foreign party lowered the return on investment to less than 15 percent, which was accepted by the Chinese side. However, the State Council pointed out that the case should not be taken as a precedent. The source pointed out: "In recent years, localities have tried by every means to develop Sino-foreign joint power projects on a large scale. More than 300 letters of intent and agreements have been signed over the past three years. However, only a limited number of projects eventually have proved successful." He continued by saying that some provinces and cities were overanxious for quick results, accepting the harsh terms proposed by foreign parties, including high rates of return on investment. This case has aroused attention of the State Council. Owing to a lack of experience during the initial period of attracting foreign investment in power projects, some southern provinces accepted the request by a Hong Kong company for a 50 percent return on investment and for fixing the price of coal at 90 yuan per ton for a long term. According to the source, the State Council, in principle, has set the return on investment for foreign parties in Sino-foreign power project ventures at 11-12 percent. If the foreign party makes excessive demands, the Chinese side may reject the request. China's total installed capacity was 167 billion kw by the end of 1993, and 840 billion kw of electricity was generated during the year. Of this, 671.5 billion kw was generated by thermal power plants, 127 billion kw by hydropower plants, and 1.5 billion kw by nuclear power plants. Last year China invested 52.2 billion yuan in power construction, newly adding installed capacity of 12 billion kwh. The state plans to invest 6 million yuan [as published] this year and the newly installed capacity should be higher than that in the previous year. He continued by saying that the per capita consumption of electricity in mainland China is 600 kwh, while the figure is over 5,000 kwh in the United States and over 2,000 kwh in Hong Kong, Japan, and Britain. To meet the standard of intermediate-level developing countries, where the per capita consumption of electricity is 1,000 kwh, he said, China will have to increase its installed capacity to 1.2 billion kwh. To vigorously develop power construction in the future, the source said, China will pay equal attention to thermal, hydropower, and nuclear power. At present, China is now selecting sites along the coast for building nuclear power plants. He continued by saying that high growth has been registered in China's economy and industry. For this reason, it is imperative to develop energy. On the premise of rationality and mutual benefit, China is willing to cooperate with investors from all countries to build more power plants in China. He pointed out that progress has been smooth for the Zhuhai power plant, built by Zhuhai in cooperation with Hong Kong's Cheung Kong and other corporations. A number of large thermal power plants will be open to foreign investment, and tenders will be invited from all countries very soon.
