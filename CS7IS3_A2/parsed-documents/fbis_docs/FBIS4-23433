The former guerillas went to MK headquarters in Johannesburg and told their seniors that they would not go back until their grievances were addressed. There are also claims that tension is simmering between MK and the predominately white senior officers of the SANDF over the non-appointment of black generals into the army as part of the integration process. A colonel in the SANDF told journalists in Pretoria that although it was expected that MK commander Siphiwe Nyanda would be made a general, "he is simply not qualified to be one". MK is believed to have submitted about 17 names of its veteran soldiers who, in their view, qualified for the most senior army ranks. The names are said to have been rejected by the largely white SANDF officers who asked MK to reduce the list to seven. According to MK sources trouble started when they complained about the predominantly white command structures which they said violated the evaluation rules that were agreed upon at the Joint Monitoring Coordinating Committee, set up to evaluate those suitable to serve in the new force. The last straw was when the MK cadres mysteriously contracted diarrhoea after eating food which was prepared by the catering army staff at the camp. The allegations were denied by the army spokesman Major Nick Sendall, who referred to a press conference held on Thursday by the Chief of SANDF, General Georg Meiring, in which he said the current ranks held by white officers would be treated as temporary until the integration process had been completed. Sendall said only Parliament had the prerogative to appoint generals.
