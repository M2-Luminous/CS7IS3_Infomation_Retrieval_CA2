Hu and Sofia Wu] [Text] Washington, May 13 (CNA) -- The second round of Taipei-Washington talks concerning Taiwan's bid to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) ended here Friday [13 May] with few results. Sheu Ke-sheng, Taiwan's vice economic affairs minister and chief negotiator to the talks, said the United States was generally satisfied with Taiwan's commodity inspection and quarantine system as well as its measures to protect intellectual property rights, prevent dumping and minimize export subsidies. The U.S., however, as dissatisfied with Taiwan's wine and tobacco monopoly system, car import restrictions and tariff reduction plans, demanding that Taiwan enforce bigger tariff cuts on a number of industrial and agricultural products, Sheu said. During the talks, Taiwan promised to further liberalize its import trade. Starting July 1, [word indistinct) products will be allowed to enter Taiwan freely with the exception of those on a "negative list," Sheu said. The U.S. demanded Taiwan remove its decades-old wine and tobacco monopoly system before it enters GATT. "If we fail to make progress on this old issue, the U.S. might withhold its support for our GATT bid," Sheu noted. American delegates were also concerned about Taiwan's "area restrictions" on car imports and its plan to raise license fees for large automobiles. The U.S. was also dissatisfied with Taiwan's high commodity tax rates on autos. It also wanted Taiwan to remove all non-tariff protective measures for agricultural products, including subsidies for rice farmers, Sheu said. During the two-day talks, the U.S. submitted to the Taiwan delegation a list of service industries which it wants Taiwan to open to foreign investment. "We'll discuss the issue in the next round of talks," Sheu said. The U.S. further suggested that bilateral discussions on a government procurement agreement be conducted soon if Taipei wants to join GATT by the end of this year. Taiwan originally planned to begin talks on the issue one year after it became a GATT member. The two sides agreed to begin discussions on the signing of a special exchange rate agreement in June, Sheu said. As Taiwan is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, it must sign such pacts with GATT contracting parties before it joins GATT. Sheu said the two sides may hold a third round of talks on GATT issues in June. He and his 33-member mission will leave for Geneva Saturday to attend the fifth meeting of the GATT working party screening Taiwan's GATT membership application. While in Geneva, the Taiwan delegation will also hold bilateral tariff concession talks with several countries, including Canada, Japan and Switzerland. Taiwan, which was admitted as a GATT observer in September 1992, is expected to become a full member by the end of this year.
