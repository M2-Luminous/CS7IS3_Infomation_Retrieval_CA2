FR940803-0-00030 FR940803-0-00012 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 91&hyph;CE&hyph;76&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8992; AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14 R1] Airworthiness Directives: Beech Aircraft Corporation Models B300 and B300C Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment revises AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14, which currently requires incorporating revised takeoff and climb performance charts into the FAA Approved Airplane Flight Manual and Pilot's Operating Handbook (AFM/POH) on Beech Aircraft Corporation (Beech) Models B300 and B300C airplanes. Beech has started incorporating these takeoff and climb requirements into the AFM/POH of airplanes manufactured since issuance of AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14. This action limits the applicability to only those airplanes without these takeoff and climb requirements incorporated into the AFM/POH at production. The actions specified by this AD are intended to ensure that the affected airplanes achieve required minimum takeoff and climb performance for each approved combination of takeoff configuration, weight, pressure altitude, and temperature. DATES: Effective September 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of February 20, 1992. ADDRESSES: Copies of the AFM/POH revision that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Bennett L. Sorensen, Flight Test Pilot, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, 1801 Airport Road, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4165; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain Beech Models B300 and B300C airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 16, 1994 (59 FR 12205). The action proposed to revise AD 91&hyph;20&hyph;14 and continue to require incorporating revised takeoff and climb performance charts, B2 revision, part number 130&hyph;590031&hyph;1, dated September 1991, into the AFM/POH, but would exclude those airplanes incorporating the takeoff and climb requirements at manufacture. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were received on the proposed rule or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public.
