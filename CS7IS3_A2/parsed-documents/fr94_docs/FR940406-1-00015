FR940406-1-00015 FR940406-1-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;4] Proposed Modification of Class E Airspace; Freeport, IL AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: This notice proposes to modify the Class E airspace near Freeport, IL, to accommodate a new Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway 06 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) and a new Localizer (LOC) Runway 24 SIAP to Albertus Airport, Freeport, IL. Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this proposal is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. DATES: Comments must be received on or before May 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments on the proposal in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, AGL&hyph;7, Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;AGL&hyph;4, East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018.

The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class E airspace near Freeport, IL, to accommodate a new NDB Runway 06 SIAP and a new LOC Runway 24 SIAP to Albertus Airport, Freeport, IL. This modification would increase the Class E airspace area radius from 6.4 miles to 6.5 miles. Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended affect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order. The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_ (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) Is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) Does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). The Proposed Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.

The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of the Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6005␣Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth. * * * * * AGL IL E5 Freeport, IL [Revised] Freeport, Albertus Airport, IL (lat. 42 ○14 ’48 ’ ’N., long. 89 ○34 ’55 ’W.)
