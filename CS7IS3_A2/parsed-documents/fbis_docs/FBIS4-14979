Our colleague Menzere Sadiqova reports: [Begin recording] [Sadiqova] At the very time when the ecological (?balance) has already been gravely disrupted, no state can remain indifferent to an attempt by a neighboring country to use nuclear power. Therefore, the agreement signed between Armenia and Russia on the reopening of the Metsamor nuclear power plant has raised serious concerns. The reopening of the nuclear plant, which poses a danger not only to the Caucasus but also to all Caspian Sea countries and which was built to operate for a limited duration, will cause radioactive waste to travel through Azerbaijan and then to the Caspian Sea via rivers. The reopening of this plant, which was planned to withstand a seven-point earthquake on the Richter Scale but is located in a seismic region susceptible to 9-point earthquakes, might amplify the tectonic processes in the Caspian Sea and cause yet another Chernobyl tragedy at the very time when the level of the Caspian Sea is rising. Arif Mansurov, chairman of the Azerbaijan State Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, provided detailed information on these issues during the news conference. He assessed this decision by Armenia and Russia as a lever for political pressure. In his statement, Academician Eldar Balayev, president of the republic's Academy of Sciences, said that the Metsamor nuclear plant generates more than 14,00O waste [measurement not specified] each year and added that there are many Armenian nuclear experts working in various nuclear centers; the reopening of this plant might enable them to gather in Metsamor in the future and allow them to make use of atomic power for nonpeaceful purposes. The news conference was held in Russian and English because foreign reporters were also taking part. We are currently in a state of war with Armenia. Do you think that by reopening the nuclear plant they could make use of it for military purposes? [Mansurov] At present, Armenian politicians are in a bind and could resort to anything. They could also make use of the waste from the nuclear power plant. [end recording]
