FR940512-2-00015 FR940512-2-00008 Respondents argue that the changes to the list of signatories demonstrate the effectiveness and inclusiveness of compliance measures established by respondents to assure fulfillment of their obligations under the agreement. Respondents contend that requiring all those who happen to appear on the list of signatories as of the period of review to demonstrate their compliance with the terms of the agreement for a period of five consecutive years imposes an impossible standard, especially in the case where a company was newly established during the five-year review period. Furthermore, respondents state that the 15 original signatories have accounted for at least 85 percent of Costa Rican exports of subject merchandise to the United States throughout the life of the agreement. Respondents argue that the Tile from Mexico case, referred to by petitioner, dealt with partial revocation of a countervailing duty order and is therefore irrelevant to the current case. Respondents contend that the language of ยง355.25(a)(2), ``at the time of revocation,'' refers to the current period of review upon which the determination to terminate is based. Respondents argue that following petitioner's interpretation would involve the parties in an endless cycle of ongoing review that the termination provisions are intended to avoid. Department's Position: We disagree with petitioner. We recognize that ยง355.25(a)(2)(i) appears to require that, in order for the Department to terminate a suspended investigation, ``[a]ll producers or exporters covered at the time of revocation'' must not have ``applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise for a period of at least five consecutive years.'' As explained below, however, the Department has determined that the strict reading advocated by the petitioner is not required by either the statute or the Department's regulations, and would not be in accordance with the terms of the agreement suspending the investigation in the present proceeding. Specifically, section 704(b) of the Tariff Act provides that the Department may suspend a countervailing duty investigation ``if the government of the country in which the subsidy practice is alleged to occur agrees, or exporters who account for substantially all of the imports '' of the subject merchandise agree, ``to eliminate the subsidy completely or to offset completely the amount of the net subsidy'' within the appropriate period of time. 19 U.S.C. 1671c(b) (emphasis added). The statutory language has not been changed since 1987, when the suspension agreement in this case was entered into. By regulation, the Department has defined ``substantially all'' of the merchandise in this context as meaning ``exporters that have accounted for not less than 85 percent by value or volume of the merchandise during the period for which the Department is measuring benefits in the investigation or such other period that the [Department] considers representative.'' 9 CFR 355.18(c). The regulations only require the addition of new exporters in the event that the existing signatory exporters no longer account for substantially all of the merchandise. 19 CFR 355.19(c). Consequently, for purposes of terminating a suspended investigation under 355.25(a)(2)(i), all that is required is that the same exporters who have accounted for 85 percent of the merchandise for a period of five consecutive years have not applied for or received any net subsidy on the merchandise during that period.
