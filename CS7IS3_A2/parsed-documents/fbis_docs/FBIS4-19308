This was shown by a poll of the Linz opinion research institute, Spectra, which was published on Thursday [14 April]. According to Spectra, the share of EU supporters increased from 43 to 48 percent at time the negotiations were concluded. However, with 26 percent, the number of EU opponents did not change. Thus, according to the opinion researchers, the new votes for the EU come from the group of the undecided (currently only 26 percent). Thirty percent of the (1,000) interviewees assessed the result that had been brought home by the Austrian negotiating team as a clear success. For 37 percent, only a "medium success" was achieved. About 20 percent are "less" or "not at all satisfied."
