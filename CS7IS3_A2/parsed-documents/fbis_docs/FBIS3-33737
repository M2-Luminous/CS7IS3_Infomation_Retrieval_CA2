Their mood contrasted with the earlier heady prediction of PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat that a deal would be signed "very soon" on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Jericho and the Gaza Strip. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had also said all major problems had been settled and an accord could be concluded within 10 days as a followup to the broad autonomy agreement signed in September. But PLO officials said later that the Israelis had gone back on issues they thought were resolved. "Nothing is settled. There is no agreement," said one senior official, who asked not to be named. They said that 'Arafat would have a third meeting Sunday night with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is due to leave for the United States in the early morning hours of Monday. The discussions began Saturday with three major points outstanding: manning of international border crossings, the size of the Jericho autonomous area and the security of Jewish settlers. Musa said the two sides agreed on the deployment of Israeli border guards, who would keep a discreet presence at frontier posts. But Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said there was no agreement on the size of the Jericho autonomous area and there was no word on the question of security for the settlers.
