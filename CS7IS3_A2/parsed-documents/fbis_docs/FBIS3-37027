However, he emphasized that Ukraine did not intend to back down from the earlier agreement with the UN concerning an increase in Ukraine's military presence in the former Yugoslavia by 3 times its current number within the scope of UN peacemaking forces. The Ukrainian parliament decided to increase the personnel of the Ukrainian battalion within the UN forces in Sarajevo from 400 to 1,220 people in late 1993.
