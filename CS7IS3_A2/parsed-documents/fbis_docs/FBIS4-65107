He declined to give any further details. He was in fact answering a question from a deputy on the situation in Algeria, and on the arrest last Friday [6 May] of an Algerian in possession of weapons in France. In fact, in Pasqua's view, the best way of avoiding this export of terrorism is to support the Algerian Government in its effort to put an end to the crisis: [Pasqua] Algeria is an independent, sovereign state, faced with terrorist action in which, unfortunately, about a dozen of our nationals have been victims. The Algerian Government should provide itself with the means to restrict these terrorist actions and to fight them. It is applying itself to this matter. It is not for us to intervene in Algeria's internal affairs. Our country's interest, the interest of France, and, in general terms, of Europe -- which cannot fail to take an interest in what is happening on the other side of the Mediterranean -- is to see a democratic solution found to the situation in Algeria, and to see peace prevail throughout this territory once more. This is the reason why the French Government wishes to encourage the efforts of the Algerian Government along the path of a peaceful search for this solution.
