Demirel gave information about his trip to Ukraine and Moldova and he expressed his views on foreign policy issues in his news conference in Kishinev. Demirel rejected the claims that the Cyprus issue was in a deadlock, saying there would be a reasonable solution. "What is the deadlock in Cyprus? Is there a Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)? Has it a flag? It has. What will be done with Ghali's report? Will this situation disappear? The flag and soil are wanted from you. We gave neither. What is being sought after? A federation with two societies. Will the dispute be solved if you bring together two different nations in the same crucible?" Demirel concluded. He pointed out that the Western countries recognized the Greek Cypriot administration as being the whole of Cyprus and stressed that this was unjust and wrong. One hundred fifty thousand people have been isolated on an island in the Mediterranean, Demirel said. "This is against humanity. Several countries act as if Turkey invaded the island. Turkey had the responsibility to protect the peace and did it. If it had not done so, would it be better? The United Nations work has had no result. Both soil and flag are wanted. You cannot offer such a solution to anybody. It is possible to find a reasonable solution which will be accepted by the Turkish people and the TRNC." Demirel pointed out that Turkey was one of the very first countries to recognize Ukraine and Moldova's independence. "Now, we are looking for cooperation with them," he said. Demirel disclosed that the situation of the Gagauz Turks and Tartars had been discussed during his visit. The Crimean Tartars and Gagauz have to be given more importance on Turkey's agenda, he said. Demirel characterized the treatment of the Tartars as a shame for humanity and said their resettlement on their land was of concern to Turkey. Ottomans and Tartars were together in all victories, Demirel said. "Nobody should take this as an offense. This is our humanitarian department. Nobody should be uneasy about our cooperation with Moldova and Ukraine. Our relations with Russia are good. Our bilateral relations will not create hostility with a third country. Our goal is to make the Black Sea a sea of peace." Demirel also announced that Turkey would build residences in Crimea for Tartars with the $100 million credit from the Europe Reconstruction Fund. He pointed out that Turkey was helping Bosnia-Herzegovina, northern Iraq and Azerbaijan and Moldova and Ukraine should be added to this list. "This is the concept. Turkey has to be interested if it is to be an important state. Turkey has a historical responsibility. These problems are all the heritage of our past. We cannot say (who cares about the Ottomans). These people speak fluent Turkish. They preserved their traditions. Turkey has to show interest in Turks who are living outside of Turkey," he concluded. While responding to a question, Demirel disclosed that Turkey was implementing a policy of friendship. "This visit has caused repercussions in the foreign press. Turkey is implementing an independent and free foreign policy and it is Turkey's right," Demirel stressed. He also said that there was instability in northern Iraq. Stressing the importance of Iraq's territorial integrity, Demirel said. "If Iraq disintegrates, the problem in the Middle East will not end in 450 years." In answering a journalist's question, he said that a 3,500 strong tribe that had been cooperating with the PKK (outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party) had gone to northern Iraq. They went after the security forces' successful operations against the separatist organization, and the security forces did not open fire on them. Demirel said: "They had a guilt complex. They are obeying the PKK's orders. They have camps over there. They (the PKK) are trying to create a civilian belt around them." Russia Is Not a Threat Moreover, Demirel said that he would not accept that Russia is a threat to Turkey. Demirel received Stepan Topal, the leader of the Gagauz Turks, his deputy Peter Buzaci and Parliament Speaker Mikail Kendigelen on Friday. After the reception, Demirel participated in the ceremony of the opening of the Turkish Embassy's temporary building in Kishinev with his Moldovan counterpart Mircea Snegur. The two leaders held a joint news conference after they signed eight accords in various fields. During a news conference a journalist asked Demirel if Russia was a subject of threat or cooperation. Demirel disclosed that the talks with Moldova were aimed to serve peace and welfare in the region. "The two countries are not preparing a plan or threat to a third country. Escalation of cooperation between countries is an advantage to everybody. Russia is our neighbor. I have signed the agreement of friendship and cooperation with Yeltsin. There is no relation between the accords that we signed today and Russia and threat," Demirel noted. Snegur said he agreed with Demirel on this subject and noted that the talks would escalate the cooperation between the two countries. Demirel also disclosed that Turkey would provide $35 million worth of credit to Moldova to develop the southern part of the country, which is mainly inhabited by Gagauz Turks. Turkey and Moldova signed accords of friendship and cooperation, land transportation, civil aviation, agriculture, culture, to struggle against international drug trafficking, terrorism and to struggle against organized crime.
