A large crowd of the city's notables, headed by al-Qunaytirah Governor Dr. Walid al-Buz, received the delegation. The governor welcomed the delegation at the main reception hall in the Governorate Building. He reviewed the geographic and living conditions in the two parts of the Golan Heights [the Syrian and Israeli-controlled parts]. He also talked about the concept of peace from the Syrian viewpoint. [Al-Qunaytirah Governor Walid al-Buz] Syria is working for the sake of a just and comprehensive peace. The banners for that kind of peace have been raised by the president on several occasions. The president has declared that kind of peace as a stated policy for Syria and for all the Arabs; the just and comprehensive peace on all Arab fronts; the peace that would restore rights and return the land; the peace of the brave; the peace of the knights; the peace that will give each what is rightfully his; the peace that can survive and last; the peace that will guarantee the interests of all within the framework of international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. [Kabahah] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, Knesset member and head of the delegation, delivered a speech thanking the hosts for their hospitality and said that peace can only be achieved by ending the occupation of all Arab territories occupied in 1967 and by recognizing the legitimate rights of peoples in the region. He also said the desired peace is the peace of the brave, as His Excellency President Hafiz al-Asad has said. [Darawshah] ...the brave that guarantees the recognition of rights for all peoples. [Kabahah] The delegation toured neighborhoods in the destroyed city. The head of delegation, Darawshah, and Knesset member al-Sani' planted a tree at the al-Qunaytirah World Visitors Garden on behalf of the delegation. My colleague Muhammad Sharif is joining me now and he will talk about the Syrian media's focus on the delegation's visit. [Sharif] In fact, the delegation has drawn much of the attention of the media, including the radio, television, and local and foreign newspapers here in Syria. Journalists are accompanying and following the delegation members everywhere. The attention they have been given has been prominent on the Syrian radio and television. The news of the delegation, as well as the interviews with Knesset Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, the head of delegation, and Knesset Member Talab al-Sani', have occupied a prominent position in the newscasts. The journalists also took interest in their fellow journalists and conducted interviews with them. They were keen to ask questions about Israeli politics and party affairs. Papers issued here today highlighted the delegation's visit on their front pages and published pictures of the delegation members. Papers also highlighted the celebrations marking the 8 March Revolution, which brought the Ba'th Party to power in Syrian 33 years ago. They also highlighted the speech President Hafiz al-Asad made last night. This was the first speech to be made by the president since the death of his son, Basil. Members of the delegation are being received warmly everywhere by the Syrian citizens, who are fully aware of the delegation's visit and who are following with interest the delegation's visits, activities, and meetings. The meetings between some of the delegation members and their relatives or people from their hometowns who live in Damascus, for the first time in over 40 years, were really touching. Many Palestinians have flocked to the hotel to inquire about their relatives and kinsfolk in their hometowns. [Kabahah] Tomorrow, Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad is expected to meet with the delegation members, who will offer condolences on the death of his son, Basil. Other meetings are expected to be held with other public figures in Syria. Muhammad Sharif and Qaysar Kabahah from Damascus.
