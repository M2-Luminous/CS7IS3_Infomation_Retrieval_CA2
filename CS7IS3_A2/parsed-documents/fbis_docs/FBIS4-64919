This was the comment from Roberto Maroni, the Northern League's number two, who is certain to be the next deputy prime minister and very likely to be the next justice minister. "We are pleased," he added, "because we have achieved everything that we decided at Pontida [League rally venue] to demand. Our representation in the government team will be strong, concrete, and consistent with our fundamental pledges, namely, federalism and economic liberalism. Certain difficulties will still have to be overcome, but we are confident that the prime minister-designate will find the best solution among those that have been agreed. The government formation process is therefore almost over." Francesco Speroni, leader of the League's Senate caucus, is of a very different, indeed the opposite, opinion. He said: "Nothing is clear any more. I think that everything is being called into question again. In that case, how can we know whether or not we are pleased? I can see the strangest things happening. I hope that there is not some kind of trick concealed behind them. It seems to me that the only real problem was the Interior Ministry: [Judge] Di Pietro's refusal calls the entire agreement into question. I cannot say whether, and, if so, when, the government will be formed. Berlusconi wanted to be the magician; now it is up to him to pull the rabbit out of the hat. So for the present I am adopting a wait-and-see stance and I can't hide my concerns." Roberto Maroni was at his home in Varese, after a long night which ended with his go-ahead to Berlusconi. His remarks gave no hint of enthusiasm; they merely hinted at the realization that whatever needed to be done has been done. Political Balance He added: "Our position can be judged in two ways: either as a sense of responsibility with regard to the country, or as some kind of surrender, an attitude of submission. Of course, I identify with the former assessment and I consider the latter totally short-sighted. I stress that, irrespective of the Interior Ministry, we can feel pleased." Maroni was reserved in his assessment of the government: "Berlusconi has to choose among several overlapping possibilities. It is like a jigsaw puzzle. Whichever of them is chosen, they all guarantee our position." Bossi's deputy rejected as groundless the assertion that the League will be "scaled down": "One Christian Democrat told me that our influence is less than that envisaged by the Cencelli manual [the rules of spoils system]. If he says so, it is doubtless true. But that pleases me: It shows indisputably that our rationale was the exact opposite of that of the parties of the old regime, and it confirms the correctness of what has always been our approach -- that is, to join the government in order to carry out a program clearly, not merely for the purpose of gaining power. We did not want any `business' ministries. We will not discuss the relative importance of individual ministries, those with or without a portfolio. Our commitment is a political one. The League wants institutional reform, it wants the birth of local government, it wants federalism. And it wants a system of economic liberalism that will put privatization at the top of the agenda." Maroni said absolutely nothing about the division of the ministries among the parties and about the people that will be appointed to them: "Primary and secondary possibilities have been put forward. Names have been put forward, and we have pledged not to name them." A Plain `No Comment' This reserve was not broken even by rumors such as those that emerged following Di Pietro's refusal, according to which magistrates Piercamillo Davigo or Francesco Di Maggio will be interior minister. There was a plain "no comment" with regard to the possibility of Lamberto Dini's becoming treasury minister. And what about the Justice Ministry? Maroni said: "I am flattered and pleased by the fact that my name has been mentioned in connection with this important position. I have stated my willingness: The final decision lies with the prime minister-designate." The League's second-in-command had few doubts about the time scale: "If Berlusconi works Sunday, too, the list of ministers could be ready as early as Monday afternoon [9 May], Tuesday at the latest. We are on vacation now. The prime minister-designate has all the means available to complete the process." Then the list will be assessed by the alliance partners: "The choices," Maroni said, "will be made from among the approved options so there will be no surprises. Apart from the fact that the Constitution so requires, it is normal for the head of the government to have the last word, in other words, for him to choose -- from among those indicated and who have been approved -- the individuals with whom he believes he can work best, who have most affinity with him. I am very confident; the government will be formed." So is there no anxiety about the rumors that Berlusconi intends to postpone the presentation of his cabinet by a few days? "I repeat," Maroni concluded, "that the prime minister-designate has all he needs in order to form the government, and if he postpones it by a few days, it means that he is taking a little time to reach the best solution."
