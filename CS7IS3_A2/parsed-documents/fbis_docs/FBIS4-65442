Just like other SPD chancellor candidates before him, Scharping values the confidential "tete-a-tete talks" at the Political Club of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. Everyone of any importance among German entrepreneurs on account of name, rank, and turnover, attends these talks. No wonder Scharping was upset when Hans Peter Stihl criticized the SPD's economic program. "But we showed you what we wanted just as we showed other leading German industrial personalities," said Scharping in a letter to Hans Peter Stihl, chairman of the Association of German Trade and Industry [DIHT] For Stihl was also a participant in the confidential talks. There were further rounds of talks with the industrial associations, the Employers Association, the Automobile Industry Association, and the Chemical Industry Association. On the SPD side, regular participants included Scharping's economic and financial expert, Oskar Lafontaine, and other members of the Program Commission, as well as experts from the SPD faction. "We had the impression that the gentlemen from industry were positively impressed by the changes in SPD policy, away from thinking in terms of a welfare state toward more growth, employment, and a labor market," recalls one participant in the talks. Someone had said that the SPD did not want to increase the tax burden, but nevertheless it was important to limit the supplementary levy to higher incomes to boost domestic demand. "We also told Herr Stihl that we do not want to burden smaller entrepreneurs with bigger taxes," it was said. But this is exactly what the DIHT chairman is accusing the SPD of wanting to do. The interlocutors did not hide their disappointment with the government's policies, especially those of the economics minister. The industrial representatives thanked Lafontaine for preserving the regressive tax levy in the Bundesrat. Representatives of the German industrial associations complained that the chancellor was displaying excessive euphoria about the economic upturn. These cozy tete-a-tete talks are now being followed by criticism from the DIHT and the German industrial associations. Inside the SPD, people remember a saying by former Minister Karl Schiller whereby the highest accolade the SPD can expect from industry is a lack of criticism of the SPD.
