Negotiators for the three parties emerged after little more than an hour of talks, saying there had been no movement on key constitutional and electoral issues. The breakdown could mean a boycott of the April poll by the Freedom Alliance's major component, the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP], as well as the Afrikaner rightwing. Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said the election would in all likelihood be promulgated on Wednesday, allowing two days for the resolution of differences. Negotiators, however, felt this was unlikely and a general mood of despondency characterised the talks breakdown. Monday night's meeting came up against two issues which the ANC said were non-negotiable. These were the single ballot system for the April election and complete autonomy for regional constitutions. The ANC's National Executive Committee is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss a package put to the meeting by the alliance. IFP Central Committee member Walter Felgate said there was little chance of a breakthrough. He said ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa had said during the meeting that he thought there was a slim chance of changes leading to a multi-party settlement. Mr Felgate said the FA would await the ANC's response to its package. Mr Meyer said the election would go ahead without those parties who wanted to boycott it. He said government was satisfied it had moved sufficiently over the last 10 days. "The ANC and the Freedom Alliance can't find each other. Unless they change their positions in the next 48 hours, there's not going to be much progress on the way forward." He said government believed the issues could still be resolved. Mr Meyer added government was satisfied with the constitution and satisfied it had met the demands of the alliance. For this reason, the election could go ahead, he said. Mr Meyer noted it was important all parties participate in the election with a view to gaining support for their ideas. "There is no way they can play a role if they do not take part in the election." Monday night's talks took place after a weekend in which both the IFP and the Afrikaner Volksfront [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] militantly rejected participation in elections. The Monday night meeting was considered a final attempt to reach agreement after three previous meetings the week before had failed to bring the parties closer.
