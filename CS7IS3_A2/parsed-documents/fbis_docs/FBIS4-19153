The current financial squeeze in this country has put them in a difficult position. Swedish exporters have been taken by surprise. Their old dependable Chinese customers, including those who used to pay in advance, are no longer able to settle their payments. No Currency "What is happening now is not due to any inability or reluctance to pay on the part of the Chinese companies. The reason is that the banks refuse to grant them foreign currency. That is why they cannot pay for what they import," Bo Backstrom, new head of the Export Council's representation in China, said. His advice to Swedish exporters is: "Do not export anything before you have established a letter of credit. And do this before the goods are shipped from Sweden." Only Local Currency Today all Chinese importers have to go to one of the 10 state-designated banks in obtain to get foreign currency. Previously they could go to so-called trade centers to obtain Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC), the special "foreigners' currency," but this was abolished at the beginning of the year. Today, there is only the local currency, renminbi [as published], and hard currencies are scarce at the remaining exchange centers. The overheated Chinese economy and the tight financial policy have left the banks with only a strict control function. They have to ensure that the products imported are really essential and belong to priority categories. "It is only when the Chinese company requests a letter of credit that the bank reviews its chances of obtaining foreign currency for imports," Bo Backstrom said. Free Exchange Rate Sweden's exports to China almost doubled in 1993, reaching a value of nearly 4.9 billion Kronor. China is the 16th largest importer of Swedish goods. The abolition of the "foreigners' currency" is a first step toward a convertible currency and, gradually, a free exchange rate in China.
