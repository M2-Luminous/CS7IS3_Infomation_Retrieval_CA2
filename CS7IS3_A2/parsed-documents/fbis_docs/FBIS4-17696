Belarus was among those who suffered most from the consequences. Is all that already forgotten and over? [Morkovskiy] Twenty-two percent of our territory is still radioactively contaminated. One-fifth of the Belarusian population lives there. An area of the size of your Saarland cannot be used; 130,000 people were resettled. We had to build new apartments, outpatients' departments, schools, and whole cities. The program is being continued. Belarus is spending 12 percent of its state budget on the elimination of the consequences of Chernobyl. And that is after eight years! I do not think that one can say that we have forgotten Chernobyl. [Ostermann] Nevertheless, many affected persons are complaining about a lack of support; 45,000 Belarusians are still living in highly contaminated areas. [Morkovskiy] Not all of them want to leave. In May 1986, one week after the catastrophe, I myself organized the first evacuations in the rural district of Narovlya. At that time, we were not properly briefed ourselves, and the people did not believe in the danger and wanted to stay. Then they nailed up their doors and windows with boards and said: We will come back in three weeks. Out of the 320,000 inhabitants of the district, 12,000 still live there, although half of the district is still part of the "prohibited zone" with a radiation of more than 15 curie per square km and everyone has the right to free resettlement. This also applies to the city of Narovlya itself, where 12,000 people lived before. Out of the 7,000 inhabitants who stayed there, only 1,000 applied for resettlement. The others wanted to stay. [Ostermann] Former helpers after the catastrophe and radiation victims are threatening a hunger strike, in order to draw attention to their disastrous situation, among them there are also Belarusians. Are all of them to blame themselves? [Morkovskiy] I have not heard anything of that. Perhaps you are right that the situation is deteriorating. I also belong to the categories of liquidators. The diseases from which I am suffering need not come from radiation. They may also be due to the nervous strain that was so great in all those years. One looks at oneself and asks oneself: How come? In a poor country there are many problems, also without Chernobyl. [Ostermann] Nor can you say that to a mother whose child has increased levels of radioactive iodine in its thyroid nor to a person suffering from cancer who has to wait for treatment for months. [Morkovskiy] Many things were planned, but the money is lacking. In 1989, the Soviet Parliament adopted a program for the elimination of the consequences, but the Soviet Union does not exist any longer. Today, the means that are available to us suffice just for a quarter of the planned measures. If we were to implement everything, we would have to spend half of our state budget. This would ruin us. [Ostermann] Does this mean that the other republics abandoned the program? [Morkovskiy] Ukraine refrains from helping us in any way, although an agreement provided for it. Last year, Russia supported us with 8.5 billion rubles. We bought medicine and medical equipment with the money. [Ostermann] Russia and Ukraine have again taken a fancy to nuclear power. Moscow is planning new nuclear reactors, Kiev does not switch off Chernobyl despite numerous incidents. What does Belarus think of it? [Morkovskiy] If some have the advantages and some the damage, one comes to different opinions. Two-thirds of the areas that were contaminated in the Soviet Union at that time are in Belarus. Chernobyl is in Ukraine and supplies the Ukrainians with electricity. Our parliament called for the shutdown of the power plant in a resolution. From our point of view, this is probably justified. [Ostermann] Kiev argues that it cannot afford to switch it off. [Morkovskiy] Perhaps it is better to be a little afraid than to die of cold and hunger. This cannot be definitely said, there are pros and cons. In Belarus the situation is clear: We do not have nuclear power plants, but we have the consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe. And nuclear power plants are everywhere at our borders -- in Smolensk, Chernobyl, near Rivne and Ignalina. [Ostermann] Western experts remembered Chernobyl punctually on the anniversary of the catastrophe and they are warning against a new catastrophe. Are you alarmed? [Morkovskiy] I think that there would not have been an explosion if rules had not been violated at that time. Irresponsibility and the violation of norms led to it. However, I am an agronomist, not a nuclear physicist. There should be projects that are completely safe. In this way, however, the danger to the people remains. Therefore, one must never forget what happened here.
