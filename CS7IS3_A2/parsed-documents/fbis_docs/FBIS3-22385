The draft notes that in some cases funds may have been wasted because the opinions of developing countries were not fully taken into account when funds were distributed. It says membership of the assessment body should reflect opinion among all countries concerned, including developing ones. Japan contributes funds to the GEF and the sources said the government is likely to accept most of the provisions of the draft. The GEF began operations in 1990 to provide grants for assisting developing countries to protect the global environment, including combating global warming and pollution of international waters, and for transferring environmentally benign technology. Responsibility for implementing the GEF is shared by the United Nations Development Program, the UN Environment Program and the World Bank. But many developing countries have criticized GEF operations, prompting agreement at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro that it be restructured. Participating countries have also agreed that the facility's current total funding of 800 million dollars be increased to 2 billion dollars. The draft suggests that the voting system also take into account developing countries' wishes with a dual vote system consisting of a "one country-one vote" system combined with a second-round vote, with votes weighted depending on the amount of funds contributed. The final draft will be debated at a March 14-16 meeting of countries concerned in Geneva.
