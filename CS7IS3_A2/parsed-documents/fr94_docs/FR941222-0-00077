ACTION: Correcting amendments. SUMMARY: This document contains three corrections to the amendments to the hazard communication final rule, which were published February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126). EFFECTIVE DATE: December 22, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. James F. Foster, Office of Information and Consumer Affairs, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N3647, Washington, DC 20210; telephone (202) 219&hyph;8151. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Amendments to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) were published on February 9, 1994 (59 FR 6126). The modified final rule included a number of minor changes and technical amendments to further clarify the requirements of the HCS published August 24, 1987 (52 FR 31852). The amendments included a new exemption to the standard's requirements. Section (b)(6)(ii) intended to exempt any hazardous substance as such term is defined by the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq. ), only when subject to comprehensive regulations issued under the Act by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Need for Correction The language of the CERCLA exemption was patterned after the language of the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) exemption that precedes it. However, this has led to possible misinterpretation because CERCLA, unlike RCRA, regulates many chemicals in the limited circumstances of remedial and removal actions and does not pervasively regulate those chemicals. It was OSHA's intent to exempt CERCLA-listed chemicals only in circumstances where they are fully regulated by EPA, making OSHA's HCS requirements duplicative. Consequently, OSHA is correcting the language to make this clear. The new language states that the exemption applies to any hazardous substance as that term is defined by CERCLA when the hazardous substance is the focus of remedial or removal action being conducted under CERCLA in accordance with EPA regulations. This document also corrects a typographical error in section (c) of the standard and eliminates a confusing clause.
