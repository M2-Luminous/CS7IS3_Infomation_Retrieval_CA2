Should the North Atlantic Alliance be extended to the East? How can the security interests of the Eastern Europeans and the Russians be taken into consideration equally? What roles should organizations such as the European Union, the Western European Union [WEU], the CSCE, and the NATO Cooperation Council [NACC] play in this connection? With the contribution of Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU ends a series of discussions that includes articles by national and international politicians and scientists on this issue: It has become a hackneyed phrase to say that Europe is living in a decisive period of its history. Still, particularly today, this statement is more true than ever before. Major events are taking place in both Western and Eastern Europe. With the European Union, which is preparing for the accession of new members, integration has reached a new stage. Russia has freed itself of the remnants of the Soviet political system and is now entering a stage of parliamentary democracy, which rests on a stable, solid constitutional basis. A big step toward economic integration has been made within the CIS by signing the agreement on economic community. However, it is obvious that the efforts to create a democratic Europe as one united entity are falling behind tendencies toward a fragmentation of our continent and the emergence of new dangers and threats. Which of these developments will gain the upper hand depends to a great extent on the decisions that have to be made by the responsible European politicians at the NATO summit and the CSCE summit in Budapest this year. An ill-chosen peace structure for Europe can become a burden for all Europeans just like a bad design for a house and can itself become the reason for frictions and conflicts, similarly to what happened in the past through the Versailles Treaty. We must not repeat the mistakes of our forefathers. By what objectives should the general security system, which has to be created by the Europeans, be guided? What criteria should it fulfill? What paths can be pursued for its implementation? The Trap of Simple and Quick Solutions There is no lack of simple solutions for Europe's security problems that appear superficially efficient. In short, one can say that they essentially consist of the extension of Western institutions, whose existence was justified in the Cold War era, to the countries of Eastern Europe and to Russia. Here the main attention goes to the quickest possible integration of the Central European countries into Western military-political structures. These recommendations are based on two myths that are regarded by their advocates as axioms of current European policy. First, the thesis of a "security vacuum" in Central Europe, of a "gray area," which almost inevitably becomes the site for Russian-German rivalries or falls into the sphere of Russian expansion. Second, the thesis of "Russia's move toward a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent parliamentary election. The solution is produced by taking these two statements together: NATO should protect the countries of Central Europe against the inevitable thrust from the east. The "guard house on the Rhine" should thus be shifted to the banks of the Bug. This request is substantiated by references to the West's "moral obligation" toward the young democracies in the region and by reflections about the "natural geopolitical interests" of the Western nations themselves. In my opinion, this approach replaces the ability to spot dangers, which is essential for any politician, with a strategy that does not only assume the "worst scenario" but even provokes it. One can seriously speak of a "security vacuum" in Central and Eastern Europe only if one claims and predicts with equal seriousness the existence of hostile security-political blocks in Europe, in whatever form, and the continued existence of hostility between the East and the West. Put differently: To support the thesis of a "security vacuum" means to deny the essence of the all-European process, which is expressed in the Paris Charter: the unity of the democratic peoples of Europe. This would be the biggest declaration of bankruptcy of all of European politics, which, despite seemingly insurmountable difficulties, tore down the Berlin Wall, brought German unity, and led to the collapse of the totalitarian monsters of the 20th century. Instead of moving forward, one is making a panic step backwards by at least half a century. The "security vacuum" is bound to restore rivalries between Moscow and Berlin in Central Europe. Yet, this would be a step backwards, dictated by fears and the ignorance of what has been achieved. Today there are two major democratic states in Europe -- the Russian Federation and the FRG, two partners that cooperate politically and economically and are united through a bilateral treaty and through their participation in the CSCE process. To pave the way for a confrontation between these two states in any "gray area" would mean to challenge German-Russian partnership as the greatest feat of the current Europe and to undermine the foundation of European stability. In the strategy of the "worst scenario," one can see the inertia both in the interpretation of the "threat from the East" and the appropriate counter-recipe. If the worst of all scenarios is predicted -- the renewal of Russian imperialism -- then one must not start from an attack of "Soviet tanks" against the East, but one must start from the repetition of the Yugoslav drama in the former Soviet Union. The consequence would be millions of refugees, disasters in the major industrial complexes, and the danger of a use of tactical nuclear arms. What could NATO do in such a situation for the protection of its eastern members? The cloud of the various Chernobyls would certainly be enough for all of Europe. The "guard house on the Bug" would not have the necessary power to help anyone at all. Yet, it is exactly such an overhasty extension of NATO that might provoke this worst case scenarios. It would serve the extremists in Russia as a strong argument for a revival of the Russian empire and for resistance against the "attack from the West." Hence, the strategy of the "worst scenario" is particularly dangerous because it includes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The Russian Factor for European Security Fears of a new "threat from the east" may be dispelled mainly through a strategy of partnership with democratic Russia, which has embarked on the path toward a law-governed state and the market economy. Those who speak of an "aggressive" Russian policy in Europe cannot produce a single shred of evidence, apart from statements by some Russian politicians who do not have any influence on the determination of the course of the government of this country. In real life, one can usually speak of an aggressive foreign policy only when a country declares the conquest of other countries as its objective, pursues an offensive military doctrine, and supports an ideology to this effect. These criteria do not apply to the Russia of today. The Russian president's foreign policy has proven that we want to achieve our country's interests as a nation state through partnership and not through confrontation with the world around us. This objective is supported by our democratic constitution. Russia does not have any territorial claims against any country in the world, including countries in Central and Eastern Europe. According to Russia's new military doctrine, our armed forces serve the sole purpose of defending our country and our allies and of peacemaking efforts in line with Russia's international obligations. As a military power, Russia is limited to the quantity necessary for defense, as established by the treaty on conventional disarmament in Europe and the START I and START II Treaties. All military activities are predictable and have been laid bare within the framework of the applicable agreements on confidence-building measures. Speaking of a "Russian threat" under these circumstances means to deliberately twist facts. The success of right-wing nationalist forces in the recently held parliamentary election is not a symptom for a pathological decay of Russian society but a vaccine for a healthy organism, which, of course, leads to an increased temperature. There cannot be a deep fertile ground for really pro-fascist conditions in Russia, which did more for the defeat of fascism in World War II than any other country in the world. The people did not caste their votes for a "campaign against the West" or for an "advance toward the warm seas," and neither for the renewal of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp by force. They voted against the ambitions and the self-complacency of some reformers, against their inability to explain the people the objectives of the reform in a simple language that people can understand, and against lacking social protection of the population, and an insufficient struggle against crime. Comparisons with the Germany of 1933, which are now popular, are only acceptable to mobilize forces for the defense of Russian democracy, but not to establish the allegedly inevitable fate, its defeat. The Russian democrats have started to draw the necessary conclusions from the sobering lesson of the parliamentary election. The reform program will clearly be revised in favor of strengthening social measures. We are determined to fight against crime without any mercy. Yet there is no and there will not be any flirting with right-wing extremism. We reject any overt or covert form of extremism, aggressive nationalism, and fascism. The West must also draw its conclusions from the election success of Zhirninovkiy's Liberal Democratic Party. Our partners must revise their tone and accents in the dialogue with Russia. Constant preaching and criticism are inappropriate for talks with Moscow. Partnership is hardly reconcilable with proposals that we should either accept or reject as a whole without being granted the right to revise them with a view to our own interests. Such attempts are sometimes being made when it comes to evaluating the Yugoslavia conflict or the situation in Libya and Iraq. It is precisely now that Russia must have a stronger feeling of support from abroad for its reform policy. What is essential is a clear, well-developed strategy for cooperation between Russia and its democratic partners in the West. At the moment, in many respects, we remain at the level of a generally correct "idea of partnership" (Russia and the West are partners because they belong to the democratic community of states), but our actions are based on decisions of the moment. When Russia made its entrance on the international stage as an independent state, this approach was the only one possible. However, this stage is now over. We need new strategic formulas and mechanisms for their implementation that fully correspond to the present quality of our relations. What is most important is that the cooperation that Russia was promised in Tokyo must be put into practice without reservations. Europe does not need a strategy in which Russia's return to imperialism forms, as it were, a "built-in" component, but a system-shaping strategy that promotes the unity of all the democratic states in Europe. Partnership for a United Europe At the end of the 1940's, Western politicians were able to find a genuine strategic answer to the great problems of their times -- the rebuilding of Western Europe and the resistance against Stalin's expansionist policies. Adequate mechanisms were set up in good time, including the foundation of the European Community and NATO. Here we are talking not about dismantling well-proven mechanisms, but about adjusting them to the new realities and drawing them into a truly all-European system of security and cooperation. In creating a new architecture for Europe, one has to pay urgent attention to a number of criteria, including the following: -- A balanced, gradual approach to the creation of the European security system. Here, "shock diplomacy" methods and policies of accomplished facts are excluded. The Russian side supports thorough consultations between all interested parties. We are conducting such a dialogue in the runup to the NATO summit with partners in the North Atlantic Alliance, in Central Europe, and with neutral states. -- Openness of regional organizations and institutions as a surety for a successful adjustment to the new European realities. Russia has no right to stipulate who and who may not join NATO. However, we do have the right to proceed on the assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into account the special features of an unavoidably long transition period and -- if one looks even further into the future -- will emphasize the point, enshrined in NATO's articles, that states that NATO remains open for any democratic European or Atlantic state to become a member. It should not be excluded from the outset that Russia will apply for NATO membership at some time in the future. It is important to ensure an effective and equal partnership in a period a general change and adaptation to one another. -- The guarantee of an equal level of security for all European states. In Europe, "first and second-class security," "gray areas," and "special spheres of influence" are just as unacceptable as "isolated regions" and a "cordon sanitaire." -- The treaty-based foundation of European security, as it has emerged, must be preserved. This also concerns the treaty for final settlement in relation to Germany. -- Exclusion of territorial claims between European states. Are the intentions of certain Baltic states to join NATO compatible with territorial demands against their neighbors? The chief goals of our proposed strategy for partnership at the political level and in the field of security should be the following: First, development of Euro-Atlantic cooperation. The transformation of the CSCE into a political organization for the entire region and of the NACC into an autonomous organization for military-political cooperation but one closely linked to the CSCE. Their aim must be to coordinate the efforts of NATO, the WEU, and the CIS in strengthening international security, acting to strengthen peace, and providing genuine protection for the rights of national, linguistic, and other minorities in Europe. I regard the declaration adopted at the CSCE conference in Rome on combating aggressive nationalism as a significant step in this direction. As far as the NACC is concerned, one should not regard it as an anteroom for NATO according to the "NATO plus" formula, but as envisaged when it was originally set up, as a independent instrument of equal partnership between one-time enemies for the building of a new Europe. Proposals for expanding NACC to include neutral European states and to form a compact secretariat for the Cooperation Council are of considerable interest. The NACC itself must direct its work toward developing cooperation in the security field, in military planning, arms conversion, and maintaining peace. Second, the creation of a system of overlapping security guarantees between the states of Western and Eastern Europe. The closer the states are intertwined with one another, the stronger the network of their relations will be. For this reason, should one not consider, for example, creating a security network of mutually complementary treaties in the security field between Germany and Poland and Poland and Germany? Corresponding treaties could also be proposed for other states in the region. Third, I welcome the proposals made by my German colleague Klaus Kinkel concerning concluding an agreement for cooperation and consultations between NATO, on one side, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine, on the other. It would be useful to set up a communications channel between NATO and the CIS. Fourth, increasing the ability of the European states to ensure peace. For the time being, frankly speaking, the East and the West have as yet found no joint [solidarische] answer to the challenge posed by the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union. In the meantime, these conflicts are developing into a big European security problem. Our partners should effectively support the efforts of Russia, which is carrying the main burden of ensuring peace in the post-Soviet area. The establishment of a voluntary fund for supporting the efforts to guarantee peace in the CIS is now on the agenda of the day. NACC can provide practical support (such as financial aid in training personnel for peacekeeping operations). Fifth, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe. It is a mistake to regard the strategic missiles dispute between Russia and Ukraine as one aspect of the division of the Soviet legacy. This is a matter of preventing a contravention of the nuclear weapon nonproliferation regulations and affects the interests of the whole of Europe. Our partners in NATO supported the Russian position at NACC's meeting in Brussels when they rejected Kiev's attempts to represent the decisions of the Supreme Soviet as a ratification of the START I Treaty. The strategy of the European partnership must provide a strong incentive for strict observance of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The economic elements of the partnership deserve special mention. Their essence lies in the transition from isolated, chronically delayed support programs to including Russia in the international division of labor on an equal, nondiscriminatory basis and in providing Russia with access to European markets. In many respects, the fields for action that I have mentioned have connections with the proposals that my colleagues from many European countries have put forward in recent months. The dialogue concerning a security partnership for Europe is already gaining intensity. I hope that the NATO summit will further this development in a useful way through its balanced and farsighted decisions. Russia is a responsible and committed partner for the members of the North Atlantic Alliance in the development of such a strategy.
