Jafri] [Text] Pakistan's latest note on Indian annexed Kashmir covers all the major issues and calls for the most urgent attention with the utmost earnestness. This communication handed over to New Delhi yesterday is a model of clarity, logic and reason. Inevitably, the core issue of Kashmir tops the agenda presented by Pakistan. If there is a sincere desire to restore peace and tranquillity to [words indistinct] state under Indian military occupation, Pakistan recommends four steps to be taken by India. First, face and accept the fact that the people of Kashmir under Indian control just would not accept it anymore. Second, the active and operational presence of over half a million crack Indian Army troops militates against the remotest possibility of peace. Third, the massive repression of civilian population is unacceptable not only to its direct victims, but also to world conscience. And fourth, reckless violation of the Line of Control keeps tension at an intolerable level. It is for India and India alone to act to remove the clearly defined problems. These problems have their origins in New Delhi and New Delhi has to act to retrieve the situation, which is getting more and more complicated by the minute. Those who would expect to effectively divert world attention from Indian military action and [word indistinct] rise in abuse of human rights ought to realize now that that (?trick) just did not work. India must change its direction and abandon the line which would only lead it into a sea of trouble. Pakistan has taken up India's favorite theme of confidence-building measures. The six non-papers which the Indian Foreign Office had presented to Pakistan have been dealt with in detail in Islamabad note. About confidence-building, Pakistan points out the first and also the most convincing step in that direction would be a fair balance of forces in the subcontinent. It has recalled that this is what the United Nations defined as a prerequisite in its resolutions dating back to 1947. It made the best confidence-building strategy then; it does so now. Pakistan and India should move toward hammering out a fair formula for balance of conventional forces and nonproliferation of the same. The Pakistan Foreign Office fails to understand what exactly is the connotation of India's suggestion for an agreement of nonuse of nuclear capability against each other. This doesn't make a great deal of sense because Pakistan cannot promise not to use nuclear capability because it doesn't have it. And it has not proposed to acquire it. So, that is that about nonuse of nuclear capability in the subcontinent. [sentence as heard] What Pakistan and the world community cannot forget however is that India is a nuclear power and if there is to be any promise about nonuse of nuclear capability in the subcontinent, it is for India to volunteer a categorical renunciation in this context. On the Siachen flash point, Pakistan points out that India has made an incursion in the frozen [word indistinct] in disregard of the Shimla Agreement. The issue can be solved tomorrow if India traces its steps back to the appropriate point. The Sir Creek issue should cause no headache if only India would agree to refer it in an impartial international arbitration. As for the Wular Barrage issue, Islamabad has made note of the disappointing fact that India's non-paper does not address the real issue. But Pakistan is ever-willing to join talks with India on the subject as indeed on any subject of mutual interests and concern. Pakistan emphasizes the fact that it agreed to wait for the non-papers which the Indian foreign secretary promised to provide during the secretary-level talks earlier this year. It was felt then in Islamabad that the non-paper's promise was to circumvent substantial talks on the core issue which is the future of Kashmiris under Indian control and military action. And it turns out to be exactly that the non-papers registered no progress on any issue. Waiting for them has put talks on the real issue back by so many weeks. Pakistan would like India to persuade itself that the facts of the situation in occupied Kashmir have now reached a point where they are unalterable no matter how much of military power and its deployment is resorted to. *
