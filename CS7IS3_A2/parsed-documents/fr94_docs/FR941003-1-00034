(4) > (6) < Issues. A concise statement of the issues presented for review. (5) > (7) < Grouping of Claims. For each ground of rejection which appellant contests and which applies to more than one claim, it will be presumed that the rejected claims > shall < stand or fall together > with the broadest claim, and only the broadest claim will be considered by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences < unless: > (i) < a statement is included that the rejected claims do not stand or fall together, and > (ii) < in the appropriate part or parts of the argument under subparagraph > (c) (8) < (c) (6) of this section appellant presents reasons as to why appellant considers the rejected claims to be separately patentable > from the broadest claim. Merely pointing out what a claim covers is not an argument as to why the claim is separately patentable from the broadest claim < . (6) > (8) < Argument. The contentions of the appellant with respect to each of the issues presented for review in subparagraph > (c) (6) < (c) (4) of this section, and the basis therefor, with citations of the authorities, statutes, and parts of the record relied on. Each issue should be treated under a separate heading. * * * * * (v) For any rejection other than those referred to in paragraphs > (c) (8) (i) < (6) (6) (i) to (iv) of this section, the argument shall specify the errors in the rejection and the specific limitations in the rejected claims, if appropriate, or other reasons, which cause the rejection to be in error. (7) > (9) < Appendix . An appendix containing a copy of the claims involved in the appeal. (d) If a brief is filed which does not comply with all the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the appellant will be notified of the reasons for non-compliance and provided with a period of one month within which to file an amended brief. If the appellant does not file an amended brief during the one-month period, or files an amended brief which does not overcome all the reasons from non-compliance stated in the notification, the appeal will > stand < be dismissed. 4. Section 1.601 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraphs (f), (g), (j), (k), (l), and (q) and adding a new paragraph (r) to read as follows: ยง1.601 Scope of rules, definitions. * * * * * (f) A count defines the interfering subject matter between (1) two or more applications or (2) one or more applications and one or more patents. > A count should be broad enough to encompass the broadest corresponding patentable claim of each of the parties. A count may not be so broad as to be unpatentable over the prior art. < When there is more than one count, each count shall define a separate patentable invention. Any claim of an application or patent which > that is designated to < correspond s to a count is a claim involved in the interference within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 135(a). A claim of a patent or application > designated to correspond to a count that < which is identical to a count is said to ``correspond exactly'' to the count. A claim of a patent or application > designated to correspond to a count that < which is not identical to a count , but which defines the same patentable invention as the count, is said to ``correspond substantially'' to the count. When a count is broader in scope than all claims which correspond to the count, the count is a ``phantom count.'' A phantom count is not patentable to any party > unpatentable to all parties under the written description requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 < . (g) The effective filing date of an application or a patent is the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the application or patent under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, > 121, < or 365 > or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application. The effective filing date of a patent is the filing date of an earlier application accorded to the patent under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c) or, if no benefit is accorded, the filing date of the application which issued as the patent. < * * * * * (j) An interference-in-fact exists when at least one claim of a party which > that < corresponds to a count and at least one claim of an opponent which > that < corresponds to the count define the same patentable invention. (k) A lead attorney or agent is a registered attorney or agent of record who is primarily responsible for prosecuting an interference on behalf of a party and is the attorney or agent whom an > administrative patent judge < examiner-in-chief may contact to set times and take other action in the interference.
