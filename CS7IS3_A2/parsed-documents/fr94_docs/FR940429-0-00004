FR940429-0-00004 FR940429-0-00002 The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.

Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent inadvertent deployment of a thrust reverser during flight, which could result in a significant reduction in the controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 60 days or 150 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs first: Perform a detailed visual inspection of the thrust reverser drive mechanism to detect wear and abrasion and to ensure the security of the attachment of the actuator to its drive links, of the drive links to the thrust reverser structure, and of the ends of the drive link and link hinges; in accordance with paragraph 2.B. of Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. (b) At intervals not to exceed 150 hours time-in-service after accomplishing the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD, and whenever any stang fairing is removed for any reason: Perform a detailed visual inspection of the thrust reverser system to ensure its integrity, as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD. (1) If the stang fairing seals are intact: Inspect the visible driver links, idler links, and attachment bolts to the thrust reverser doors, in accordance with paragraph 2.D.(1) of Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancy found during this inspection, in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. Note 1: The stang fairings need not be removed during this inspection. (2) If any stang fairing has been disturbed or if the inspection seal is broken: Inspect the appropriate mechanism in accordance with paragraph 2.D.(2) of Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994. Prior to further flight, correct any discrepancy found, in accordance with procedures described in the airplane maintenance manual. (c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 2: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (e) The inspections shall be done in accordance with Raytheon Corporate Jets Service Bulletin SB 78&hyph;12, dated January 24, 1994.
