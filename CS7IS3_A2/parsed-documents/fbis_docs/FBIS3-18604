Andreatta again highlighted that the Greek decision -- in retaliation against Macedonia's declaration of independence under a name Greece says signals territorial ambitions on the northern Greek province of the same name -- was "a violation of precise European Union regulations." All EU members except Greece have recognised the former Yugoslav republic as Macedonia. He also stressed that "certain countries, including Macedonia" have suffered unduly from the embargo, and that it was necessary to "step in with some form of compensation." For this reason, Andreatta said, studies had begun on a road project linking Valona, Sofia and Istanbul. Andreatta ended his reply to the Greece-Macedonia question by saying that "if Greece has put itself in an awkward position," it "cannot count on implicit European solidarity; our position is clear on that."
