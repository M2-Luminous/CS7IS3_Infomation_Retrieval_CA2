According to this official, the contract to export the submarines was concluded at the North Korean Consulate in Nakhodka. He also revealed that Russia's export company is the (Dariol) Company, which sells submarines by salvaging the ones that have sunk in the Far East area or that are being kept by submerging them at sea. The (Dariol) Company received permission to export the submarines in accordance with the plan to reduce the Pacific Fleet's weapons. However, permission must be officially received by the central government to export the submarines as they are, without changing the structure of the vessels. The TOKYO SHIMBUN reported that, therefore, an alternate method will be used. A Russian vessel will tow the submarines to the North Korean side.
