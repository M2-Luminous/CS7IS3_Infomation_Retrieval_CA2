He commented: "There is obvious protection for drug trafficking rings given by the various federal, state, and municipal police forces. Therefore, despite the official stories to the contrary, that activity has increased." He claimed to have made charges to this effect on repeated occasions, but said that they were not heeded because there was no will to attack the problem, since "people in high places are implicated in this crime." The legislator noted that the rise in drug trafficking is well known, as shown by the constant executions of "narcos" in several of the state's towns. He added that the problem is alarming, but admitted that Tamaulipas society is by now used to living with violence, caused mainly by drug traffickers on the border. He declared that the complicity between police and "narcos" is an age-old situation, contributing to the wealth of many policemen, particularly that of State and Federal Judicial Police [PJF] assigned to the area. He concluded by saying: "It is incongruous that PJE [State Judicial Police] agents earning a monthly salary of 1,200 new pesos should own residences and late model vehicles." Today, the mayor of Abasolo, Juvenal Ramirez Lucio, claimed that drug traffickers have established an air route in the municipalities of Jimenez, Soto la Marina, and Abasolo for transporting narcotics to the United States. He added that the Attorney General's Office (PGR) had, nevertheless, minimized the situation. He indicated that small planes often fly at low altitudes over the region to avoid being detected by the authorities; an activity that has proven alarming to the area's residents. He explained that reports of this have been given to the PGR representative on various occasions, the response being a promise to conduct operations in the area. He commented: "As mayors, all we ask of them is air surveillance, and that they notify us when they intend to arrest someone living in an Indian community, to avoid frightening the people." He added that the settlers' fear was heightened even more two months ago, when a drug trafficking ring kidnapped two young residents whom it suspected of having appropriated a cocaine shipment dropped from a plane in flight that was being pursued by the PGR. He noted that the peasants were brutally tortured, to the extent of causing the death of one, while the other was severely injured. He explained that the peasants, especially those in the community of La Esperanza, the largest in Abasolo, often find on their plots of land electrical equipment that has been dropped from planes in full flight, carrying contraband to the country's interior. He said that the route is used in both directions, because some also follow it to transport "fayuca" [smuggled goods for street vending], although the most disturbing use is for drug trafficking. It should be mentioned that, according to police reports, during the past four years four small planes carrying drugs from Colombia have crashed in those municipalities. In one case, the "narcos" managed to escape with a ton of cocaine, which they concealed on a farm in this town, where it was later discovered by the PJF.
