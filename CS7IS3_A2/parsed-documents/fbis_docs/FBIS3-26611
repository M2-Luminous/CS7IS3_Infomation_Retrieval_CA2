David Clinton, brother [as received] of U.S. President Clinton, said earlier after a visit to Shanghai: "Shanghai is a charming metropolis; no wonder so many American firms and enterprises are investing in Shanghai or seeking cooperation with it." German Chancellor Kohl, who visited Shanghai recently, predicted that Shanghai was going to one of the world's noted cities. Foreigners' praises of Shanghai are not unfounded. In the last few years, the Shanghai Bund and Puxi District have established 10 great exchanges in securities, metals, coal, agricultural materials, petroleum, the chemical industry, grains and oil-bearing crops, automobiles, building materials, and technology -- rapidly turning Shanghai from a regional into a national market, which saw a total turnover of 1 trillion yuan in 1993. In the newly developed Pudong District, called by West Germans the "world's largest work site," hundreds of buildings have sprouted up over two or three years, turning Pudong into a new industrial district in Shanghai. Shanghai authorities have decided to make six major moves in financial structural reforms this year: First, to vigorously foster and develop a financial market system, with emphasis on the foreign exchange, currency, gold, securities, and insurance markets. Second, to push ahead with efforts to commercialize banks so as to allow the separation of policy-dictated questions from commercial financial affairs in the four great specialized banks, and to steadily pursue an asset-liability ratio and risk management. Third, to continue expanding the opening up of financial institutions and the introduction of more foreign counterparts. There are now in Shanghai 26 foreign banks from 11 countries or regions, most of them making profits. This year Shanghai will try to attract more investment from foreign financial institutions. Fourth, to continuously expand both the scope and the range of financial businesses. This year will see the starting of off-shore loan business, home mortgaging, and so on. Fifth, to accelerate progress toward electronic finance; build a Shanghai credit card network, so that one credit card will be good throughout the city; and meanwhile, to put the bill clearing and exchange system on an electronic footing. Sixth, the make the People's Bank function as a Central Bank, thus strengthening macroregulation and control. These moves undoubtedly will turn Shanghai into a national financial center. Mao Yingliang, director of the Shanghai People's Bank, stated that apart from functioning as a national foreign exchange swap center, the Shanghai Securities Exchange now has been confirmed in its status as a national center; meanwhile it also is becoming a national capital and monetary discount center, rapidly moving marketization. The most noteworthy thing is that the Shanghai municipal authorities are preparing a series of moves to rebuild the bund into a financial thoroughfare. In old times, the Shanghai Bund used to be a financial center. The 112 tall bank buildings are still there. Many of them used to be quite famous in the Far East and world, such as the cluster of buildings characterized by the American Bank and Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank buildings, which had been dubbed an "expo on modern architecture." Owing to political changes, starting from the 1950's, some of these bank buildings were turned into government offices or residential buildings, schools, or factories. To regain the Bund's erstwhile status as a financial center, the authorities have decided to restore those buildings still meeting the basic needs of financial institutions to their former roles. According to reports, the Shanghai Municipal Government building in the Bund, which used to house the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, recently has been put up for sale by open bidding, with a minimum price of $150 million, which has attracted the interest of many big domestic and foreign banks. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank has submitted its price offer. The highest bidder reportedly is a certain mainland bank. It seems that Shanghai is on its way to becoming a New York Wall Street. As the Shanghai Municipality's leading role in China's economic development increases, the rebuilding of the Shanghai Bund into a financial center becomes increasingly urgent.
