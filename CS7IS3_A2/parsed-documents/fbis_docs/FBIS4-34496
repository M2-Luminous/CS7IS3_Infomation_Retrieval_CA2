The boat, named "Roxanna," with registration number AK212-212, was intercepted in front of the Dominican Port of Manzanillo, close to the Haitian border, in the Dominican Republic's northwestern region. The vessel was delivered to the Dominican Navy at the Puerto Plata dock in the Dominican Atlantic Coast, where two other Haitian vessels are being held. The ship was transporting wheat flour, vegetable oil, rice, other food products, and some textiles. The crew members -- the exact number was not specified -- are being interrogated in Puerto Plata by Dominican authorities, who have strengthened the embargo -- on the economy, oil, and weapons -- declared in a UN resolution to force the Haitian military leaders to surrender power and to permit the return of deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
