FR940722-1-00005 FR940722-1-00004 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;51&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes, that currently requires inspection of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking, and repair, if necessary. This action would require installation of a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap, and follow-on inspections. This proposal is prompted by reports of additional cracking found in the current inspection area. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent propagation of cracks in the subject area, which could compromise the structural integrity of the airplane. DATES: Comments must be received by October 11, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;51&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

A report summarizing each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;51&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;51&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056. Discussion On September 25, 1991, the FAA issued AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05, amendment 39&hyph;8052 (56 FR 50650, October 8, 1991), which is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. That AD requires repetitive inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and the wing trailing edge access door sill, and repair of any cracking found. That action was prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang on four Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes. This cracking was found during an inspection conducted in accordance with the Supplemental Inspection Document (SID) program; that program was required to be implemented by AD 89&hyph;22&hyph;10, amendment 39&hyph;6330 (54 FR 42291, October 16, 1989). The requirements of AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05 are intended to prevent fatigue cracking in the subject area. Such cracking, if not detected and corrected in a timely manner, could compromise the structural integrity of the airplane. Since the issuance of that AD, there have been 10 additional reports of fatigue cracks found in the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang. Such cracking presents the same unsafe condition as addressed by the existing AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05. Additionally, since the issuance of that AD, the manufacturer has developed a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing edge access door sill that is intended to minimize the possibility of cracking in these areas. The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123, Revision 1, dated June 8, 1993, which contains procedures for conducting various inspections to detect fatigue cracking of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill, and procedures for repairing any cracking found. This revised service bulletin is essentially identical to the original version, which was referenced in AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05 as the appropriate source of service information. The only relevant changes are a revised listing of current operators of affected airplanes, and the inclusion of additional repair options. The FAA has also reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123, dated June 8, 1993, that describes procedures for installing a crack preventative modification of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang and wing trailing edge access door sill. This modification entails replacing Taper-Lok fasteners with straight titanium fasteners, and cold working the holes in the wing rear spar lower cap forward and aft tangs between stations X ors =430.000 and X ors =410.000. Accomplishment of this modification will minimize the possibility of fatigue cracking in the subject areas. Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would supersede AD 91&hyph;21&hyph;05 to continue to require repetitive inspections of the wing rear spar lower cap aft tang fastener and the wing trailing edge access door sill to detect fatigue cracking, and repair of any cracking found. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with either the original or revised version of McDonnell Douglas Alert Service Bulletin A57&hyph;123. This proposed AD would also require the eventual installation of the crack preventative modification. Once this modification is accomplished, repetitive post-modification inspections would be required after the accumulation of a certain number of landings. These actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with McDonnell Douglas Service Bulletin 57&hyph;123.
