They arrived at the Mais Gate Airport at about 1800 GMT. Sen. Larosiliere says he wishes to continue his work to unblock the country's current crisis and says he will return to his office in parliament after resting up from his stay in the United States. He says he wants to work for the reconciliation of all of Haiti's sons. [passage omitted] [Begin recording, in Creole] [unidentified reporter] Sen. Larosiliere, you know your name has been mentioned as a possible Haitian prime minister. Are you still willing to accept this post? [Larosiliere] Listen, brother, I tell you well: I am always ready to go exactly where my duty calls me, but this is not what I went to settle in the United States. I went there to find a way to get my country out of the present situation. Sen. Larosiliere will work so that whoever is chosen as prime minister can be ratified and succeed, provided he can do the job. Being prime minister is not Sen. Larosiliere's main objective. Not at all. I have three more years to spend as a senator of the Republic. But as I told you, I will always be wherever my duty requires me to be. [passage omitted] [end recording]
