(j) The nineteenth character must be a check digit calculated as follows: (1) On line A of Figure 181.25(j) enter the first eighteen characters of the HIN. (2) On line B enter the value of each character in the HIN. (3) Multiply each number in line B by its corresponding number in line C for each of the eighteen digits and enter the product of each of these separate computations in the appropriate spaces in line D. (4) Add all the numbers recorded in line D together. (5) Divide the final sum by the number, 10. The remainder of this division is the check digit, the nineteenth character in the HIN. If the remainder is zero, the nineteenth character is 0. BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;C E:GRAPHICSEP06MY94.000 BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;14&hyph;C
