People continue to be killed, displaced, arrested, and raped in the war there. Nevertheless, and I do agree with the foreign minister here, there are now chances for a political solution. What has made me cautiously optimistic are the positive change in the situation of Sarajevo, on the one hand, and, the reopening of Tuzla Airport, on the other; and finally also the fact that Croats and Bosnians have agreed on a joint federation. This agreement might become the starting point for the restoration of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Yet, Ladies and Gentlemen, this is only realistic if it will, ultimately, be possible to include the Bosnians Serbs in this process, too. However, this does not seem likely at the moment. Nevertheless, I am cautiously optimistic today, because, for one thing, the Russians are apparently constructively participating in the efforts to achieve a peaceful solution. I have said apparently because it is indeed not very easy to understand Russian foreign policy against the background of the insecurities in domestic policy. The most differing statements have been made in connection with Yugoslavia, even from the ranks of the Russian Government. Still Russia's role, which has been positive to date, should be honored. I think it is wise to continue to include the Russians in the political process. [applause] On the other hand, it is evident that America's determination has increased. The Americans are today quite obviously ready to intervene more actively than in the past -- politically and militarily. Before, they were conspicuously reluctant to act because -- as I think quite rightly -- they regarded the conflict in the former Yugoslavia first and foremost as a European problem. Yet, the Europeans were unable to achieve a European solution to the problem. Foreign minister, without wanting explicitly to criticize anybody, my assessment of Europe's role is far more negative than yours. I do not want to go as far as claiming -- which is also being done, and not only in FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE -- that through their kind of conflict management, the Europeans have even made the conflict worse. Whether this is appropriate and what role German foreign policy has played, will ultimately have to be clarified by historians. I am, therefore, not asking whether one could not have settled the conflict through a political solution at an earlier stage. For today, I am saying that there may be a chance for a solution, and I say it very clearly: there is such a chance and mainly because, led by the United States and on behalf of the United Nations, NATO has become politically and militarily active. [applause] Such military intervention is always problematic because it is dangerous. There is the danger of escalation, which was pointed out by the foreign minister -- and I agree. At the same time, the statement remains true that the UN/NATO ultimatum did work in Sarajevo, and one can only hope that the active intervention in Gorazde, which the chairman of my party described as necessary, will help to bring the Serbs to reason, and -- I would like to add -- that it is not misunderstood by the Bosnians as a sign of one-sided support. Ladies and Gentlemen; the responsible officials on the Serbian side should now consider very carefully what they intend to do after the very cautiously sized UN military intervention. First reactions are rather worrying. Yet, the United Nations is not waging a war against the Serbian people, and neither is NATO. Both, with NATO, incidentally, acting as an agent for the United Nations, are protecting their own people who are engaged in the difficult attempt to save lives in the conflict areas and to create concrete conditions for a political solution of the conflict. The responsible people on the Serbian side should draw the right conclusion and return to the negotiating table. German diplomacy should contribute to this, also for example by using its good, also personal, relations with the Russian Government. Ladies and Gentlemen; putting an end to the suffering of the population in Bosnia-Herzegovina should be the real task of German foreign policy. The German foreign minister should make an effort toward this; he can count on our support in this matter. Ladies and Gentlemen; let me make another, somewhat bitter remark in this connection. We are once again discussing Yugoslavia here, somewhat more optimistically than on former occasions. The situation there worries us. One reason it worries us is that we see television pictures from there every day. There are also a few pictures coming from Kigali. There are hardly any pictures from Afghanistan and none from Angola, where far more people have been killed in the ongoing civil war than in former Yugoslavia. I would not like to make any comparisons, and I am not judging. The so-called CNN effect must, however, be taken into account in politics. Public opinion is important. It is produced, and it influences national and international actions. This influence must, however, not be a determining one, because this would make us ask whether our policies are morally justified. Morals is not the only yardstick. What also counts is one's own interests and the interests of one's partners. We should, however, avoid double standards. [applause] Let me say a final word, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our friend Hans Koschnick will go to Mostar, probably in May, in order to help with reconstruction there. This is not an easy task, but a difficult, even dangerous one. The fact that you are available for this task, dear Hans, proves your courage and great humanitarian commitment. Thank you very much, and good luck.
