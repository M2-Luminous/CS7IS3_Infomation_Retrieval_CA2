The LDPR Leader Moved in a Fast Track"] [Text] On Sunday Vladimir Zhirinovskiy arrived in Volgograd from Krasnodar and, after rushing along in an armored Zil limousine under the protection of several police Opel cars, plunged into the friendly atmosphere of a banquet at the Oktyabrskaya hotel, where from 2200 to midnight he discussed how to set things going in Russia with the governor and the chief of the internal affairs administration. An official meeting next morning was held behind closed doors. The participants declined any comment. After taking a tour around the city and laying wreaths at several historical sites, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy proceeded to the central part of his visit: meeting with the Volgograd electorate. Some 5,000 to 6,000 people turned up to marvel at the principal Liberal Democrat. Judging by their mood, many were disappointed after a two-hour mono-rally: There was none of the former criticism of present state rulers, with the main critical focus shifted to heads of ethnic provinces. The LDPR leader's presentation on oblast TV proved to be richer in concept. On a highly topical issue Vladimir Zhirinovsky announced that Russian peacekeeping forces should not be introduced into Abkhazia and Karabakh but withdrawn from there as a matter of urgency and that weapons should be sold to those countries, "leaving them to straighten things out among themselves." The next meeting with voters heard statements that it was only thanks to unflagging activity by the LDPR faction in the State Duma that six unamenable ministers had left the government and that it was only Zhirinovskiy's trip to Serbia that had helped Yeltsin and Kozyrev correctly to assess the situation and prompted the West to take a more cautious line with respect to former Yugoslavia. The LDPR leader spoke in sharp terms about the State Duma speaker, the president of Kazakhstan, and the communist leaders, and then jumped into the black Zil and rushed off. Before his departure he expressed his confidence that not 25 percent but 50 percent of the Volgograd electorate will vote for him in the upcoming elections.
