The reason was that his sincerity could be sensed from his facial expressions and he gave the impression that he was expressing his own ideas in his own words. I was surprised when he said, "I have had my own personal thoughts on legislation concerning national emergencies." I immediately felt that he would soon be fired for making a problem statement. In viewing his television press conference concerning retraction of his statement, he was making the statement as if he were doing so with great pain. As he said, "The statement was inappropriate," he did make an apology, but his facial expression reeked of the pain of having to make a statement in which he had no true conviction. This incident will be forgotten by society because of his removal from the position, until someone else makes a problem statement. Instead of considering the matter closed, there is a need to thoroughly evaluate the significance of this statement. There's the logical criticism asking, "Why did they appoint an individual with such ideas as minister of justice?" But, I do not agree. Perhaps they appointed him as minister of justice because he was an individual who "embraced such ideas." Mr. Nagano once served in the highest position in the Ground Self-Defense Force as chief of staff. He also served as an influential member of the Ozawa Research Council during the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] days. Accordingly, I feel that his appointment as minister of justice was not unrelated to the situation in the Korean peninsula. The most controversial issue in the process of formulating the basic policies for the coalition parties was measures to be taken in response to the situation on the Korean peninsula. And, even during the secret conferences held at the Prime Minister's Official Residence during the Hosokawa government days, the foremost issue tabled was "the legal basis for actions in the event of an emergency." The cabinet's Legislation Bureau asserted that actions feasible under current law were very limited. For that reason, legislation visualizing "emergencies" became a new issue for the coalition government. The basic agreement of the coalition parties reads, "The government will make provision for responding to emergency situations under the provisions of the Japanese Constitution." They made provision for possible new legislation or revision of existing law by referring to the "current constitution" rather than "current law." Perhaps the foremost issue for the Hata cabinet includes a response to the situation on the Korean peninsula and to use the response as a basis for making provision for "national emergencies." Even Koji Kakizawa, who accomplished the unusual feat of being appointed as foreign minister immediately following his resignation from the LDP, has stated, "We need to consider what sort of issues will face us in an emergency and what sort of legislation is necessary." Accordingly, we should view Mr. Nagano's appointment to the cabinet as designed to provide for preparation of legislation reflective of security concerns. In the past, the minister of justice's position attracted attention as being associated with prosecutors in charge of investigation of corruption cases. However, I cannot help but be amazed at the Nagano statement for its brilliance in striking the blind spot of public opinion. Such ulterior motives clearly conflict with Prime Minister Hata's position in which he states that he shares former Prime Minister Hosokawa's opinion about "responsibility for World War II." The prime minister's response to the Nagano statement reflected a kind of hesitancy most probably because the appointment to the position of minister of justice was not Mr. Hata's idea, but Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa's way of preparing for the establishment of a national emergency system. Mr. Ozawa is steadily making preparations towards realizing his professed goal of a "normal nation." His consistency in working towards that goal reflects no hesitancy whatsoever. The problem is that most of the public and the political world, including Prime Minister Hata, have not become aware of that fact. There is one more aspect to be considered. That aspect concerns the question of whether Mr. Nagano who is a graduate of the Army Academy, former Japanese army officer, and former chief of staff of the Ground Self-Defense Force, qualifies as a "civilian" as defined in the second paragraph of Article 66 of the Constitution which reads, "The prime minister and other ministers of state must be civilians." Just like the controversy about whether the Self-Defense Forces constitute a "military organization," there are a variety of positions on the term "civilians." The pros and cons of this issue should be debated as long as positions exist like that of Nobuyoshi Ashibe, who states in his book, The Constitution, "The growth of the Self-Defense Forces has evolved into the strong theory that members of the Self-Defense Forces are not civilians, meaning civilians must be those who are not career military personnel and those who never served as career military personnel." Incidents encompassing "problem statements, unfavorable reactions from Asian nations, and removal of cabinet officials" concerning Japan's responsibilities for World War II continue forever, because we have not arrived at a historical conclusion as to exactly what we had done in connection with World War II. Next year will mark the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II. Unless we complete an examination which accurately portrays the facts, we will be prone to repeat the same mistakes again and again. If we merely engage in a debate of "aggression," it will not serve to resolve the issue in a true sense. Perhaps, we should begin with the task of determining just exactly what happened in Nanjing.
