The members will consider research and development funding for electronic commerce. The meeting is expected to be attended by the following persons: Governors Alvarado, Daniels, del Junco, Dyhrkopp, Mackie, Pace, and Winters; Postmaster General Runyon, Deputy Postmaster General Coughlin, Secretary to the Board Harris, and General Counsel Elcano. The Board determined that pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, this portion of the meeting is exempt from the open meeting requirement of the Government in the Sunshine Act [5 U.S.C. 552b(b)] because it is likely to disclose information, the premature disclosure of which would significantly frustrate proposed procurement actions. The Board further determined that the public interest does not require that the Board's discussion of the matter be open to the public. In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of Title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, the General Counsel of the United States Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of Title 5, United States Code; and section 7.3(i) of Title 39, Code of Federal Regulations. Requests for information about the meeting should be addressed to the Secretary of the Board, David F. Harris, at (202) 268&hyph;4800. David F. Harris, Secretary.
