President Takes on Two Unwhacked Guys To Replace Two Who Have Been"] [Text] Security Council personnel completed the preparation of materials yesterday for a session that is supposed to discuss the situation in the zone of the Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict and the question of the Cossacks. It has been tentatively set for 6 April. This session is likely to be special because informed sources inside the Council do not rule out that the chairmen of both Federal Council chambers will be invited to attend it for the first time. For the time being two seats remain vacant in the Security Council which are intended, under the law "On Security," for a vice president and first deputy Supreme Soviet chairman. It is the vacant seats that Boris Yeltsin obviously had in mind when he told Vladimir Shumeyko that the chairmen of the parliament chambers could take part in the Council sessions. Interestingly, the president had so far felt no urgent need to fill the vacancies in this body. More, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has come to learn, its sessions have never before decided on any question by voting: the views of today's Council members always coincided with that of the president. The president, nevertheless is prepared to expand the circle of like-minded people by bringing in representatives of the legislative authority. Observers believe this is not just a tribute to political decency, but is also a demonstrative gesture by the president confirming his readiness for cooperation with deputies. The snag is in which way the speakers become Council members. If the president brings them in by his edict, that would reduce their status to that of federal ministers and they would only have the right of consultative voice. The deputies would hardly like it. The only alternative is to alter the law "On Security" by striking from the list of permanent members the no longer existing state positions and adding new ones. During the debates, the names of Aleksandr Rutskoy and Yuriy Voronin would surely surface, which would inevitably bring back memories of last fall. This has already been the case with the president's draft decree on amnesty. It is even not ruled out that as a result, the deputies would after all set up their own commission to probe into last October's events, with all the ensuing consequences. In the meantime, as KOMMERSANT-DAILY has come to learn, it has also been recognized as expedient, in the draft agreement on national accord, to include the parliament heads in the Security Council. It also recommends that representatives of parliamentary committees be drawn into the work of the Council's interdepartmental commissions. For the time being, according to KOMMERSANT-DAILY's lights, Vladimir Shumeyko and Ivan Rybkin will be invited to the first session of the Council as guests of honor with no right to vote.
