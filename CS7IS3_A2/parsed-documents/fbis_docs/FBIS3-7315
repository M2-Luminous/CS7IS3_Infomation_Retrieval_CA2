Hashimoto, chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said the row over the alleged scandal is threatening the passage of the fiscal 1994 budget program. Diet business has been stalled, leaving the 73.08 trillion bugdet in limbo, by the LDP's demands that Hosokawa release more data about a loan he says he received from Sagawa Kyubin Co. in 1982. The LDP says it will continue to refuse to open budget deliberations until Hosokawa meets its request.
