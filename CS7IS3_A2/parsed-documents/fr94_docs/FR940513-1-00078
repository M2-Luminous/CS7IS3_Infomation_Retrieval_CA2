However, it is expected that these impacts would br more severe than those expected for facilities emitting more than 1 Mg/yr of HAP. c Twenty-five facilities have HAP emission greater than 1 Mg/yr and are affected by RACT. These facilities are not included in these estimates. d Given the structure of the UTD cost estimates, distinctions between the costs at 93 percent and 95 percent emission reduction were not possible. However, costs would be at least as high as those shown for the MACT floor plus additional vessel retrofit costs. (Vessel retrofit costs range from $9,000 to $61,000.) e Given the structure of the UTD data base, distinctions between the impacts at 93 percent and 95 percent emission reduction were not possible. The impacts for facilities emitting greater than 1 Mg/yr of HAP would be at least as high as the impacts shown for the MACT floor, with higher impacts on vessels.
