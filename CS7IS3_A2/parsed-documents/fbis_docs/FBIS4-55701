He will coordinate the implementation of the structural reform in our economy and will facilitate the implementation of the general policy aimed at finally halting the production decline in industry, agriculture, forestry, construction, and transportation, under conditions of protecting the environment. He will also be in charge of monitoring the utilization of loans received for the purpose of investment, and the use of the resources of the Reconstruction and Development Fund. Second, I propose to appoint a deputy prime minister to control the country's financial situation, money circulation, and the implementation of deals and agreements. He will also monitor prices in the country and the foreign exchange market, in cooperation with the National Bank. In addition, he will control trade activity and help to create conditions for attracting foreign investment. He will also develop the government's relations with private business organizations. Third, I propose to adopt an approach of gradually eliminating the committees which have not been envisaged by the Constitution, except for special cases, when the committees are created by a special law. Therefore, at this stage I propose to form two new ministries -- a Ministry of Power Supply and a Ministry of Communications -- on the basis of the payroll and budget of the corresponding existing committees. Three other committees will be reorganized without transforming them into separate ministries. In the final analysis, as a result of all these measures the Council of Ministers will include 19 members. It will encompass 17 ministries, one of which will be led by a deputy prime minister, plus a deputy prime minister without portfolio and the prime minister, making 19 members in all. Until now the cabinet has had 16 members. Four agencies, instead of the existing three, will function at the Council of Ministers, and three committees instead of the existing eight. The government will review also the activity of the Agency on Foreign Aid and the Committee on Bulgarians Living Abroad, with a view to improving their work. Within the framework of these structural changes, I propose the following personnel changes in the cabinet: First, to release Valentin Stefanov Karabashev from the posts of deputy prime minister and minister of trade. Second, to release the minister of justice, Petur Zakhariev Kornazhev. Third, to appoint Docent Rumen Vasilev Gechev as deputy prime minister without any specific ministry under him, in accordance with the first item of these structural changes. Fourth, to appoint Kiril Petrov Tsochev as deputy prime minister and minister of trade, in accordance with the second item of the structural changes. Fifth, to appoint Nikita Georgiev Shervashidze as minister of power supply. Sixth, to appoint Gospodin Atanasov Atanasov as minister of justice. Seventh, to appoint Krustyu Ivanov Mirski as minister of communications. I propose that the National Assembly approves these changes to the cabinet. Ladies and gentlemen, you may approve or reject the specific program proposed by the cabinet for the period until the end of the year. The approval of this program must be supported next week by an agreement between the cabinet and the parliamentary factions or individual deputies that support it. This will be a sign that this cabinet is supported by a solid parliamentary majority, without which it cannot function successfully. Thus, the cabinet will not be a hostage to any parliamentary faction. The failure to approve this submission will cause the resignation of the cabinet, the failure of the reform, the nonimplementation of the mass privatization, and serious disruption of the country's economic development. In practice, this will mean assuming an orientation toward early parliamentary elections. I have done everything possible to find the best solution for the country. I and my team have served Bulgaria to the best of our abilities. We will continue to serve so in the future if the parliament so wishes. Thank you for your attention.
