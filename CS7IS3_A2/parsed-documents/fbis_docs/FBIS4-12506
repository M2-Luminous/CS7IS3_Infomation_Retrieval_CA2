After the suicide operation carried out by one of the fedayeen of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in 'Afula, in which eight Israelis were killed and at least 50 wounded, there have been other operations in the cities of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip throughout the past two days, especially the operation carried out in Ashdod by an Islamic Jihad Movement fighter in which one Israeli was killed and four others were wounded. This escalation occurs as the current Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the implementation of the Oslo agreement stumble because of Israel's refusal to set a date for the start of the withdrawal of its forces from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and Israel's timewasting in discussion of minor details. Just as the Hebron massacre underlined the importance of Palestinian security and the difficulty of coexistence between the Palestinians and the armed settlers, the latest fedayeen operations against Israelis inside the so-called green line and in the Gaza Strip confirm that the Hebrew state will never have security and stability so long as it maintains its current policy of humiliating the Arab negotiators and trying to blackmail them and to have both peace and land. The United States and its current administration is responsible for the deteriorating situation in the occupied territories because it has, for the past seven months, ignored the PLO's appeals for intervention to break the negotiation deadlock. President Clinton's administration has allowed Israel to persist in its conceit and arrogance in dealing with the Palestinians. When the Hebron massacre occurred, it was reluctant to condemn Israel and refused to vote in favor of the draft resolution calling for the disarmament of the settlers and the provision of international protection for the people of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. It is regrettable that the U.S. Administration has been putting intense pressure on the PLO over the past two days to make it condemn the 'Afula suicide operation. It did not exert the same pressure on Israel after the Jabalya massacre in which eight people were unjustifiably killed by Israeli special units. American officials, in making such demands -- which to them are ordinary demands -- on the PLO, fail to understand their dangers and their negative, perhaps even catastrophic, effects, and that is because they do not understand the Arab and, particularly, the Palestinian mentality. Any fedayeen operation against Israelis is received with applause and satisfaction in the occupied territories, and anyone who carries it out is a hero and a martyr who is buried in the graveyard of the martyrs and the immortals. Nobody can blame them for that conviction, for they have suffered the fire of daily Israeli repression and they face Israeli bullets with their chests. Any condemnation of the fedayeen operations is seen as a perpetuation of the occupation and as a blessing on its settlements and aggressive policies. That is why the PLO is very reluctant to give in to U.S. demands in this connection. The officials responsible for U.S. policy in the Arab region -- and some of them are Jews -- aim to isolate the PLO from its people and they aim to foment internal sedition in the occupied territories by calling on the PLO to condemn a legitimate act such as is carried out by all peoples of the world in the march toward independence and liberation. Resistance remains a legitimate and necessary element so long as there is occupation, and even more so when it is a repressive, colonialist, expansionist occupation like the current Israeli occupation of Palestinian. What is happening in the occupied territory is a renewal of the intifadah and a shift from the war of knives to the war of arms and explosives, which is, without doubt, the bloodiest and most dangerous war. Israel and the United States are to blame for this shift and its consequences because they aborted the peace process in the first real test on 13 December when Israel was supposed to begin withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, and in doing so they gave extremism a golden opportunity to overtake moderation and to increase its popular following in the occupied territories. That is what Israel wanted and what it had planned and continues to plan for because it does not want to give up the territory nor to commit itself to any peaceful settlement.
