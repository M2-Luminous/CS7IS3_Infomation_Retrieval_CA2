FBIS4-31796 "dreeu114__a94014" FBIS-EEU-94-114-A Daily Report 13 Jun 1994 ANNEX Czech Republic Poll: Citizens Leaning Toward Political Center Poll: Citizens Leaning Toward Political Center AU1306110294 Prague CTK in English 1006 GMT 13 Jun 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1306110294 Prague CTK English BFN [Text] Prague June 13 (CTK) -- The majority of Czech citizens declare themselves supporters of the political centre, a poll conducted by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IVVM) on April 28 to May 6 among 946 people over 15 showed. Although most Czechs are still orientated to the right, a shift towards the centre or left of the centre continues, the poll revealed. According to the IVVM, such development is connected with a repeated fall in voter preferences of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the government coalition. Only five percent of those polled declared themselves supporters of extreme right parties and only 2 percent said they support extreme left parties. Thirty-three percent of the respondents see themselves to be at the political centre. Followers of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), the Left Bloc Party (LB) and the Democratic Left Party (SDL) are mostly left-orientated. As regards the Czech Social Democratic Party (CSSD) none of its potential voters declared themselves supporters of extreme left while 75 percent of them support either left of the centre or centre parties. The ODS's potential voters traditionally stand unambiguously on the right spectrum of the political scene, while followers of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) and the Christian Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL), both government coalition parties, mostly declared themselves supporters the right-centre spectrum.
