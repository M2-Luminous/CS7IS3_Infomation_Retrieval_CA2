All parties to the conflict (led by Serbs) have brought large quantities of weapons to this area, so that the UN Security Council, the United States, and Russia have unanimously stated that a spark should not cause a fire, and a small fire should not develop into an uncontrolled blaze. The establishment of a security zone around Brcko is most convenient for the Bosnian Serbs. In this way they will be given international guarantees needed for the creation of the Serbian corridor between Serbia, Semberija (Bijeljina), Brcko, Pelagicevo, and further to Banja Luka. It is not true that the corridor was invented because of the Serbs, or that its importance is exaggerated! If there were no corridor, the so-called Serbian republics in Bosnia and in Croatia really could not function normally. If we look at the territory presently controlled by the Bosnian Serbs, we can see that it looks like an oak leaf split in the middle -- two separate parts are kept together by a narrow strip of land (the area between Brcko and Orasje, which is the most sensitive part of the corridor). Ratko Mladic has admitted himself that Muslims and Croats, who can "terminate" the corridor, have excellent weapons. The Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is extremely strong in that area because it has a direct communication with Tuzla and Zenica, from where it can be supplied. Apart from 40,000 regular soldiers, approximately the same number have been recruited from territorial defense units. Apart from light weapons and all-terrain vehicles, the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has a large number of guns and howitzers of Russian and Chinese origin, "Mi-8" helicopters flown by former Yugoslav People's Army pilots (carrying launching pads with missiles); they also have modern communications equipment, various types of antitank missiles, light antiaircraft launching pads, and so forth. Problem With Soldiers Ratko Mladic openly admits that the largest Serbian problem is soldiers -- there are not enough soldiers, their number cannot approach the number of members in the Muslim forces (half of the Serbian brigades are filled with only 50 percent of soldiers, for example). The Croatian side in Bosanska Posavina [HVO units] has far fewer soldiers compared to both the Serbs and the Muslims, but they have excellent weapons. Apart from older models, the "T-54," "T-55," and "T-34," the HVO also has "M-84" tanks that can be compared to Serbian armored units. It has self-propelled 122-mm howitzers of the "Gvozdika" type (they were seized in the Varazdin Corps), and all types and calibers of guns, howitzers, and multiple rocket launchers. The Serbs have brought to Brcko not only all known types of guns and missiles, but also new self-propelled "missile vehicles" assembled like in a "Mad Max" movie. Rails were added to adapted military transporters (on wheels) on which Russian air-to-air missiles of the type "AA-2 Atoll" are mounted (the Russian copy of the U.S. "Sidewinder AIM-9"), with which Serbian fighter planes ("MiG-21" and partially a "MiG-29") are armed. Since there are enough missiles in the Serbian air base near Banja Luka, which cannot be used because of the fly ban, necessary modifications were made at the "Vazduhoplovni zavod Kosmos" ["Kosmos" Air Force Institute] in Banja Luka so that a large number of vehicles are now equipped with two adapted missiles each. "Atoll" has a half-round front and front wings, it weighs 70 kg, it is 2.8 m long, its diameter is 120 mm and the distance between the back and front wings is 530 mm. Its red warhead carries 6 kg of highly destructive explosive. "Atoll's" range in air combat is 6.5 km (it has various types of infrared and semiactive radar control); the purpose of its ground version is to achieve a propaganda effect rather than its combat value. It has to be admitted, however, that the Serbs do not throw anything useful away. Some types of air-to-ground missiles ("Sparrow") are used even in the West in the modified ground-to-air version. The Serbs did the same thing as the United States did a long time ago (they adapted the "Sidewinder" into the light system ground-to-air "Chaparral," which is induced by heat sources). The "AA-2 Atoll" was transformed by the Serbs into a missile which should hit strong sources of heat radiation (various industrial facilities, tanks with running engines, and so forth), including helicopters flying at an altitude of several meters above the ground or flying in low flight. It is obvious that the Serbs are trying to help themselves somehow. The UNPROFOR, on the other hand, needs a large number of high-quality tanks of the "Leopard" type in order to supervise all three warring factions around Brcko. With the present number of 20 tanks the UN is able to protect only a very small territory and their personal safety. UNPROFOR intelligence professionals stress another thing, too: If the HVO joins the conflict on the Muslim side, the Serbs plan a revenge against "HVO logistics and supply bases" in Croatia with several additional multiple rocket launcher batteries of the type "M-7" and "Oganj" (caliber 128 mm, range 21 km). Artillery attacks would be aimed at Slavonski Samac, Stitar, Zupanja, Bosnjaci, Podgajci Posavski, Rajevo Selo, and Gunja. The UNPROFOR headquarters is warning officials in charge that the time is passing, and tension around Brcko growing, since the Serbian corridor is like a steak offered on the table.
