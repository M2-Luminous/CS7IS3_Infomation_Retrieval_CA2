According to a conservative estimate of the World Gold Association, in 1992, gold sold on the Chinese mainland for ornamental purposes amounted to somewhat over 250 tons, enough for China to overtake the United States which has held the record for the last 25 years as the world's largest buyer of gold. On passing into the "Year of the Rooster" [1993], the gold ornament market throughout China has "turned the whole landscape red" [a poetic quote, red being the color of great zeal and flourishing prosperity] somewhat like an immense fiery explosion. Gold Prices on the Mainland Rose in Five Consecutive Stages On the basis of last year, let us look more carefully at gold sales in Beijing, as gold prices rose within five months in five consecutive stages. They rose from the original 100 yuan/gram to 150 yuan, to 115 yuan, to 120 yuan, 135 yuan, to 140 yuan/gram, with swarms of buyers still eager to buy more. As gold prices on the mainland rose briskly almost daily, the temporarily declining world gold prices were thereby given a boost and restored to great splendor. Since March, world gold prices have risen 25 percent. London, Zurich, New York, and Hong Kong became bullish, prices rising from $325 to $360 per ounce, and after a short development at a slower pace, again suddenly jumping in May and June, piercing the $400 per ounce ceiling in the first week of July, when prices reached the highest level since 1991. After the Spring Festival, the heat came on strong in the otherwise frosty northern city of Harbin, namely the heat of purchasing gold ornaments. One customer, who had selected a gold necklace of 80 grams at Harbin's Asia Modern Dress and Jewelry Store, then found it still too small, and he finally preferred to buy 200 grams of other gold ornaments. At the ornamental gold counter of the Qiulin Company, daily sales at most amounted to 200,000 yuan. Some gold shops that normally sold about 10,000 yuan could also increase their sales three- or four-fold, and many shops warned the market that they received insufficient supplies. In Changsha, the gold ornament sales outlets at the various large markets continuously brought in new supplies, but still found all their supplies insufficient to meet demand. At times, frantic buying emptied the shelves. Average daily transactions at the gold ornament counters reached to over 100,000 yuan. Frantic Buying Clears All Gold at Exhibition Formerly, the market for gold ornaments in Hunan had always been weak, and shops had already reduced 24 K gold ornaments from 100 to 95 yuan per gram, which still evoked little consumer interest. Now, however, even such ornaments as bracelets of less than 99.99 fineness, which had been unwelcome in the past, have become fast selling items. In Nanjing, according to information from relevant quarters, a total of 312 kilos of gold ornaments were sold during January this year, which was something hardly ever seen before. During 1992, the slightly more than 60 sales outlets in Nanjing, sold 1.9 tons of gold ornaments, on the average only 158 kilos per month, but since coming into the "Year of the Rooster," there has been a steep rise in the sales of gold ornaments. The last few days, according to news from the Third Shanghai Jewelry Exhibition, sales of various kinds of gold ornaments there amounted to 36.5 million yuan, which was four times the amount sold at the first such exhibition which had taken place last year. At the exhibition, the buying public still mainly preferred ornaments of pure gold. During the first three days of the exhibition, gold sales reached the high figure of 6.2 million yuan, which was 70 percent of the total sales. Chains, necklaces, and bracelets sold fastest at the exhibition. The original intention was to have three days for the sale of the chains and necklaces, but unexpectedly almost all were sold out at the first day of the exhibition. Small pendants for children, such as small butterflies, small keys, or small roosters of about 1 gram each, altogether somewhat over 700 pieces, were all sold out the first day. The Shanghai Far Eastern Gold and Silver Jewelry Factory exhibited items it planned to put into production, such as artistic replica in gold of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac, also a "golden boy of wealth" and a "Tang-Dynasty-style imperial goblet." Each item was priced at several tens of thousands yuan, and all were carried off by eager customers. China Enters Its Golden Age This was the banner headline in the NEW YORK TIMES, used--certainly with some irony implied--when it reported on this subject, "..and speaking of the world's gold mines, the next specially large gold mine will be the Chinese consumers." What an eye-catching headline, what a perceptive vision! Main reasons for the present gold-buying frenzy are the desire to preserve value and the people's traditional infatuation with gold. It was made possible by the higher living standards of the citizens and their increased consumption capacity. A spokesperson of the State Statistics Administration revealed that individual bank deposits of common people amounted to RMB 1.8 trillion yuan. After an individual will have spent on the "three old things," namely watches, bicycles, and sewing machines, and will have gone through the "three new things," namely TV's, washing machines, and electric refrigerators, and while he will find his capacity insufficient for the purchase of the trendy new commodities of the 100,000-plus level, such as motorcar and house, there will be nothing else for him to buy. This will leave the citizen with some money, which will then unavoidably be idle, awaiting a future opportunity. Since there are no further commodities being offered at the 10,000 yuan level, and even though bank interest rates have been raised, the Chinese economy is still undergoing dramatic changes, resulting in periods of turbulence, so that the common people are suspicious of a possible currency inflation, therefore take refuge in the value-preserving function of gold. Although the value-preserving function of gold is continuously declining, the traditional mentality of the people seemingly will not accept this fact in a short time, and gold, thus, remains in the minds of the people a safe, all-weather life-line. It is therefore natural to expect a gold-buying frenzy and its continuation. Startling Effects on the World Gold Market In their analyses of the world gold market, experts believe that the continued demand for gold by Chinese consumers is to blame for the continuous increase in gold prices during the last decade. They furthermore believe that the more active China's economic development will become -- China being the world's most populated country -- the more money will be available to the Chinese consumers, and the larger will become the demand for gold, which in future will be a demand for several million or even several tens of millions ounces of gold. As these experts see it, reasons for the large purchases of gold by China are, for one thing, China's rapidly growing economy and lenient government policies, combined with the limited channels for the use of cash savings; secondly are the preparations by the government to take action against the country's currency inflation and the devaluation of China's currency. Ordinary Chinese women had not worn gold necklaces for quite a few decades, but now, with the higher living standards, they have started again to wear gold and silver, and this alone has been sufficient to exert a surprisingly strong effect on the world gold market, so that traders are beginning to watch more carefully the huge market that the 1.2 billion people of China represent. The international organization that has for some time been promoting gold sales, the World Gold Association, held a meeting early in 1993 at the Beijing Hotel for the exchange of opinions on developments in China's gold market. Said organization also undertook, for the first time, investigations at Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and as a result of these investigations revealed that among China's gold buyers 19 percent were women and 11 percent were men. As to the proportion of the various uses of gold, the ratio of gold used for ornamental purposes was 15 percent, used ornamentally for the mounting of precious stones 2 percent, used for gold coins and gold bullion only 0.3 percent, the ratio of gold ornaments bought for personal use was 11 percent, and gold used in presents to others 6 percent. Overall, the rate of domestic gold purchases has not yet reached the degree of full saturation, and compared with other countries, where people own six or seven articles of gold, there is here still a large disparity. The said association therefore concluded that China offers the largest ever potential in the world for becoming the largest consumer of gold. China will, in effect, induce a shift in the entire market toward the east. Vigorous Inception of Privately Operated Gold Markets Faced with the strong demand in China's gold ornament market and the steady rise in the prices of gold ornaments, gold markets of every description are vigorously being developed, as the times seem to require. In Ganwang Township, within Haicheng City of Liaoning Province, famous for its production of vegetables and for its clothing market, an open, privately operated gold market was suddenly, and quite unostentatiously, initiated. During the period from 1 September 1992, when firecrackers announced the opening of the first privately operated gold ornament shop, until the beginning of 1993, 106 business licenses to operate gold shops have been applied for, 73 were to be operated by private individuals and only 3 to be operated by collectives. The privately operated gold market has had over 1,000 visitors per day, and has transacted tens of millions of yuan. Businessmen have come to investigate and to buy not only from 10-odd provinces and municipalities of China, but some have even come to gain information on conditions and to negotiate business from more than 10 foreign countries and territories, among them Canada, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. With their courageous action, the people of Ganwang have challenged the last aristocratic stronghold in the financial system, namely gold. Their example will be emulated all over the country by "chiefs who challenge their overlords." In Yantai City, the foremost gold producing city, the city's Gold Bureau initiated, on 28 April 1993, a Yantai Gold, Silver, and Jewelry Trading Center. At this place, trading proceeds openly and fairly, and is also favored by the development zone's preferential policy regarding tax exemptions. On 10 May 1993, the country's second largest gold-producing city of county rank, Lingbao City in Henan Province, did similarly, and its gold, silver, and jewelry center came into being as a timely event. It was a place where 75 state-run, collectively run, and privately operating gold, silver, and jewelry shops were concentratedly engaged in production, processing, and sales. Indecision as to the Imposition of Controls On 19 June 1993, the Tongguan Gold, Silver, and Jewelry Street was inaugurated in Tongguan County, a key gold producing center in Shaanxi Province. It had resulted from the fruitful cooperation between the said county and the Wanlida Jewelry Co., Ltd. of Hong Kong. A well-informed person at the People's Bank of China revealed that there have by now been about 11 cases throughout the country, where local governments or trading firms in this way took the lead in setting up gold markets. Besides these, there have also been many underground, concealed markets, not controlled by any authority or government department. They blossom forth and disappear all of their own, and there is no way to cover such cases statistically. Even so, the People's Bank of China has issued circular notices in which it repeatedly stated that prior to any state plan for the opening up of the gold market, no local authority or unit may of its own institute gold markets. However, abstract and monotonous notices and government decrees are no match for the very concrete and explosive gold price developments, and will therefore naturally end in defeat. Faced with the tidal wave of gold market formations, the government agency charged with the control of gold must come to a decision: shall there be an opening-up or shall it be a closed area. The competent authorities are still in a quandary as to their next move.
