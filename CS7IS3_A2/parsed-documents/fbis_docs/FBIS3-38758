FBIS3-38758 "drweu026__a94025" FBIS-WEU-94-026-A Document Type:Daily Report 8 February 1994 ANNEX Spain Balance of Trade Results `Moderate' in 1993 PM0302192094 Madrid EL PAIS in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 43 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PM0302192094 Madrid EL PAIS Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Unattributed report: "Spanish Balance of Trade Improved by 30 Percent in 1993"] [Text] Madrid -- The Spanish balance of trade closed at the end of 1993 with a deficit of 2.5 trillion pesetas, a figure 30.5 percent below the 1992 fiscal year, when a deficit of 3.5 trillion pesetas was reached, according to figures supplied by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance yesterday. These results are due to the "good performance by exports and the moderate performance by imports," which totaled 7.9 trillion pesetas -- 20.8 percent more than in 1992 -- and which tripled the figure recorded during the 12 months of 1992 [sentence as published]. In 1993, imports [as published] represented a total of 10.4 trillion pesetas, a figure which represents a 2.7 percent increase -- half that in 1992. The cover rate was 76.2 percent during last year -- 11 percent above 1992. According to the Economy Ministry, which described the 1993 results as "moderate, the foundations have been laid for the recent upturn shown by most production and demand indicators to become consolidated in 1994." The geographical distribution of trade flows during last year shows a relative loss of importance by exports to the European Union [EU], which represented 68.2 percent of the total, as against the 71.2 percent registered during 1992. Imports from the EU increased by 3.2 percent, as against the 2 percent increase from other, non-Community, countries, a figure which keeps their 61 percent share of total purchases virtually stable. In the last month of 1993, the value of imports slightly exceeded 1 trillion pesetas, which represented a percentage increase of 21.1 percent with respect to the same month in 1992. This "represents an appreciable acceleration with respect to the rates recorded in previous months," according to the Economy Ministry. As for exports, these reached the figure of 847 billion pesetas -- 34.2 percent more than in 1992.
