Alekseyeva, Microbiology and Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev; UDC 579.22:577.113.6] [Abstract] It is reported that low concentrations of 6-azacytidine (6-AC)--a synthetic analog of cytidine produced at the Molecular Biology and Genetic Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences--suppresses DNA-genome virus (particularly adenovirus) reproduction and in contrast to 5-AC, is not very toxic and is not a carcinogen; moreover, it displays anticancer activity. It is also noted that there are no published data on the antimicrobial action of 6-AC but only indirect observations attesting to such activity. To bridge this gap, data on the effect of 6-AC on the functioning of various mollicutes and the probable molecular mechanism of this effect are investigated. In so doing, Acholeplasma laidlawi PG-8 mollicutes from the family of Acholeplasmataceae and two other species--the Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH and Mycoplasma fermentans PG-18--from the family of Mycoplasmataceae were examined. All strains were obtained from Dr. Freundt (Denmark). The mollicutes were grown in the SM IMV-72 medium. The study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of 6-AC on mollicutes in various systematic positions; standard mollicute strains ceased growing completely in a nutrient medium at a 6-AC concentration of 125-250 �g/ml. Different levels of inhibition at other 6-AC concentrations for various strains are summarized. Translation of mollicutes on ribosomes in vitro ceased completely at a 100 �g/ml 6-AC concentration, attesting that there may be two targets for 6-AC in the mollicute cells and possibly other microorganisms--ribosomes and DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase. In the end, the blockage of translation and replication processes by 6-AC leads to the death of mollicutes, but since 6-AC has no mutagenic, carcinogenic, or cell differentiation-inducing effect on human cells, it may be used as an efficient means of treating respiratory (atypical pneumonia) and urogenital diseases induced by mollicutes; with respect to the role of mycoplasma in the development of AIDS, 6-AC may be used as a preventive measure, provided that proper drugs are developed and clinically tested. It is speculated that the mechanism of 6-AC effect on the mollicute growth is related to direct interference in the replication of genome DNA and blocking of the ribosome function.
