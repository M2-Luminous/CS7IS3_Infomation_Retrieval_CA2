In the opinion of participants in the debates, the plan drawn up by the agriculture and food ministry "could at best be an agricultural policy concept as it falls short of specific recommendations for better farm production." They argued that an agricultural development program last "at least until 2000" and indicate not only guidelines and stages of reform but also "concrete results" that Russian farmers could achieve if the plan succeeded. A statement adopted at the end of the parliamentary hearings recommends that the National Agricultural Academy and agriculture and food ministry put the final touches to a federal program on measures to carry out agrarian reform, restore and develop agro-industrial production by the year 2000, worked out by a group of experts led by ex vice-president Aleksandr Rutskoy in early 1993. The cabinet was asked to submit the rehashed variant of this program for debate in the parliament's lower and upper houses by May this year.
