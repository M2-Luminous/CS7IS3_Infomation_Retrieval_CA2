Since the Khartoum government launched the dry season offensive, thousands of civilians have been forced to flee the war zone for neighboring countries. Most of them ended up in Uganda and the SPLA [Sudanese People's Liberation Army] rebel movement appears to be on the retreat in the face of Sudanese Air Force bombing raids. The rebels claim that the National Islamic Front, NIF, is behind the recruitment of fresh troops to take part in some kind of holy war. Well, SPLA leader, John Garang, has just attended the seventh Pan-Africanist Congress which was held in Kampala, and William Wanendeya put it to him that things were going badly for his movement. [Begin recording] [Garang] We are doing very well. We are a guerilla movement and we employ a multiplicity of tactics. If we don't need to defend ground, why defend it. Sometimes, the aim is to inflict as many casualties on the enemy as possible and I tell you the NIF, mujahedin, are dying like flies. So we are succeeding. It is true that the civil population is bearing the brunt of the NIF offensive because they are being bombed. As for the soldiers, they are in their trenches and foxholes but the civil population has no foxholes and no bunkers. That is the only tragedy but with respect to the war proper, the SPLA is invincible. [Wanendeya] You've suggested that one of the problems is that the SPLA does not have many arms, does not have many lorries to transport its soldiers around. Now, recently there was the story that the SPLA was buying guns through Israel and the plane was stranded in Cyprus. Do you have any comments to make on this issue. Was this plane carrying arms for the SPLA? [Garang] We wish it was. We never knew anything about the plane. The plane does not belong to us, if it is there at all. So, we have no knowledge of it. We only heard it over the BBC that there was a plane that was in Cyprus and the arms were intended for the SPLA. No arms were intended for us and you can take it from me. Because if anybody should know, I should. [Wanendeya] What about this story that I have heard that you are receiving Stinger missiles from the American Government to shoot down antennae, high altitude antennae bombers. [Garang] There is no truth whatsoever. I think the NIF is making these things up in order to mobilize resources from the fundamentalist Islamic world. [Wanendeya] If I could ask you on a topic unrelated; where were you born in southern Sudan and how did you grow up? [Garang] I was born in Bordie Street, Bokor, (Wanglor) village. I don't know exactly when, but I think it is 1945. What else do you want to know? [Wanendeya] What did your parents do and what kind of early life did you live? [Garang] My parents were peasants -- cattle-rearers and cultivators just like any other southern Sudanese family. I lived until I was eight years at home, when I went to school.
