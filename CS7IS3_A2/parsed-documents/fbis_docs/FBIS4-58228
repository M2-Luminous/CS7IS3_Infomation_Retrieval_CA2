Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH commenting on the talks held in Riyadh on Sunday evening between Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, said these talks had come within the framework of existing coordination between the kingdom and Egypt. As the kingdom and Egypt constitute the most important pillars of joint Arab work, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz and President Husni Mubarak are capable of playing an effective role in the service of the Arab cause, said the daily. The kingdom and Egypt have been exerting sincere efforts to contain the dangers facing the region, added the daily. The kingdom and Egypt, while working for tackling the peace process in the Middle East, are aware of the Israeli maneuvers to block the march of the peace, the daily pointed out. For its part, Mecca-based AL-NADWAH said it has been clear that Israel is trying to escape from the pledges it had earlier made. This policy of procrastination will have an adverse impact on the future of the peace process in the Middle East, said the daily. As we face the danger of the Zionist plots in the Middle East, the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina face the dangers of the plots hatched by the Serbs, added the daily. It has become an essential matter for the international community to put an end for the maneuvers of the Serbs and Zionists in defiance to the international legitimacy, said the daily and added it has also become necessary to take the appropriate measures for enhancing the pillars of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East and the Balkan region.
