Nothing changes. Now do the same thing with a sheet formed from a shape-memory alloy. The crumpled mass unfolds into a sheet again. Shape-memory alloys are among the most fascinating of new materials for this unique ability to return to their original shape when heated, no matter how badly they have been distorted at a lower temperature. Until recently, speculation on their potential raced far ahead of actual applications. But the alloys are now finding widening use in a broad range of fields, from consumer electronics to women's clothing to dental prosthetics. Shape-memory alloys are one class of intermetallic compounds, a special group of two-metal alloys. What makes them unique is their molecular structure. When a typical metal is heated or cooled, bonding between atoms changes. But in a shape-memory alloy, the bonds between adjacent atoms remain very strong. As a result, the material is very elastic and although it can be deformed below a certain temperature, it returns to its original shape when reheated. These two unique properties of shape-memory alloys are being utilized in a variety of applications. In England, a shape-memory alloy has been used as the hinges for greenhouse windows. When the outdoor air reaches a certain temperature, the hinges change shape, opening the window in the process. Storage Applications In Japan, shape-memory alloys are being used to help keep the air dry inside storage units holding chemicals, camera lenses and other moisture-sensitive products. A shape-memory alloy is used for the spring which controls a door separating the storage room from the unit containing the moisture-absorbing desiccant. When the desiccant can no longer absorb moisture, a heater kicks, triggering the spring to shut the door. With the storage area thus protected from exposure to moisture, the desiccant can be reconditioned. Consumer-electronics manufacturers are using shape-memory alloys to give air conditioners added value. When the air conditioner is used to heat the room, a spring made from shape-memory alloy contracts, pulling the flaps down so the hot air is blown toward the floor. The tremendous elasticity of shape-memory alloys has been used to make eyeglass frames and women's brassieres. In the dental field, the alloys are being used for artificial-tooth roots. The branches of a tooth root made from a shape-memory alloy are straight when the dentist implants the root in the jaw bone, but bend when warmed by body temperature. As a result, the root becomes firmly secured and more difficult to dislodge. Shape-memory alloys are also being used for orthodontic braces. The medical field is the site of much applications research. One day, shape-memory alloys may be employed to help mend broken bones by keeping the fractured parts firmly together. Two types of shape-memory alloys are now in use: a nickel-titanium alloy, which accounts for 90% of all present applications, and a series of copper-based alloys, such as copper-zinc-aluminum. Copper-based alloys are comparatively easy to process and therefore cheaper than nickel-titanium alloys, but they loose their ``memory'' after around 1,000 heating and cooling cycles. In contrast, a nickel-titanium alloy can last for as many as 1 million cycles. Moreover, this type of alloy does not corrode and is biocompatible, so it can be used inside the human body. The job now is to simplify the processing steps and to reduce production costs.
