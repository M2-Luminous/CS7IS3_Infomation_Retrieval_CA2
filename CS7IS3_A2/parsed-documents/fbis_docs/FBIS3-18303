For days, the NATO partners had futilely tried to contact Moscow. Now the Russians wanted to talk to the Germans. Unfortunately, Chancellor Kohl was unable to talk to his friend and fellow sauna-goer; he was busy otherwise, he was traveling around eastern Germany. Altruistically, the politicians in Bonn passed the telephone partner from Moscow on to the White House in Washington. Yeltsin's respect inflated Bonn's ego considerably. The fact that NATO's threat of bombing the Serbs had an effect "is primarily also due to my influence," the chancellor praised himself. And this influence will grow if he has something to say about it. As soon as peace is established in the war in Yugoslavia, the Germans want to help with reconstructing the tortured country. The times when Germany was just permitted to be an economic giant are over. As budding peacemakers, Helmut Kohl and his Free Democratic Party Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel ("Germany need not hide its light under a bushel") are hoping for the glamour of the political stage. The Bonn politicians last week praised their Bosnian conference of important diplomats in the former capital as a particular highlight of their new foreign policy. Since the signing of the treaties on German unification, Foreign Ministry officials enthused, interest in Germany had never been as great: 34 television teams aimed their spotlights on the German presenters of "good mediating services" (Kinkel) in the bloody Bosnian conflict. The idea of the international conference in Bonn had developed during telephone conversations that Kinkel held the week before last during a meeting with his Russian colleague Andrey Kozyrev in Athens. From there, the German foreign minister first startled his U.S. colleague Warren Christopher by passing on -- "By the way, colleague Kozyrev is standing right beside me" -- the telephone receiver. Later on, the two foreign ministers established contact with London's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. A new axis? Of course not. Bonn did not become the site of the talks on Bosnia at Kinkel's instigation. Others did not want to be the host -- out of fear by those in power that they might throw themselves open to ridicule with another fruitless discussion. Some countries were not supposed to be the hosts either: Greece, which is currently holding the presidency of the European Union [EU], has disqualified itself in the view of the other Europeans because of its unilateral embargo against Macedonia. The Americans did not want to go to Brussels because, as a Bonn diplomat said, they did "not" want to go "to a European event." The British, whose Lord Owen has earned more criticism than praise as EU mediator in Bosnia, refused. They pushed the Germans forward. "Everyone knew," some of Kinkel's helpers described the risk after the talks, "that this could be a complete failure." However, since the parties to the war were not invited, there was no quarrel but results -- some that were to increase Germany's praise of itself, others that indicated a surprising development in civil-war-torn Bosnia. Since the NATO ultimatum against the Serbia besiegers of Sarajevo, since the Russian readiness to send soldiers for the UN troops there, and since the conference on the Rhine Russians and Americans are sitting "in the same boat with us," according to Bonn's analysis. The Bosnian initiative, which Foreign Minister Kinkel and his Paris counterpart Alain Juppe started last year is now generally used as a basis for the further search for peace. With the "momentum" (Kinkel) of the NATO ultimatum supporting them, those participating in the round of talks in Godesberg are now supposed to divide the work and push the warring parties in Bosnia toward compromises: Together with the Americans, the Germans first want to address Croats and Bosnian Muslims, because they have great "affinity" (Kinkel) with them. As soon as a separate treaty has been agreed on, the Russians "will put a curb on the Serbs," according to the distribution of roles in the chancellor's office. A cease-fire between Bosnian Croats and the government troops came into force last Friday [25 February] at noon. Finished concepts are in the drawers in Bonn: Bosnia is to remain -- for the time being -- in existence as state but only in "loose confederation." The regions of the Croats and Serbs could "lean" toward Croatia and Serbs -- up to an "economic union." The Serbs are even supposed to be given the opportunity of leaving the confederation by means of a referendum if they want to be ruled by Belgrade. "The biggest and most important initiative of German foreign policy for many years" (Kinkel) has, however, a glitch. At the end, there is the recognition of Serbian conquests, of "ethnic cleansing," and a division of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- which was considered totally unacceptable in the West last summer. A new language is now being used in Bonn: This plan does not accept a "forcible change of borders." "The time of threats" is over now, it is said. Now it is important to crate "incentives" for concluding peace. The most important obstacle so far: The Muslim government in Sarajevo has refused for months to agree to a division of the country -- as European peace searchers Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg have suggested several times. The United States is now going to use its influence on the Bosnians so that the Izetbegovic government gives in. Kinkel gives the incentive of "bringing" Bosnia and Croatia quickly "close" to the European Union and to provide help for reconstructing the areas that have been destroyed by the civil war. Kohl's adviser want to bait the regime in Belgrade with prospects of a gradual abolition of the economic sanctions. Sarajevo, where Serbian troops are just leaving, is to be placed under UN administration for the time being. Mostar, which is besieged by the Croats, is to get a German administrator on behalf of the European Union, according to some ideas that sound rather bold. The "emergency mayor" in Mostar is to be supported by German policemen and administrators. Bundeswehr paramedics could operate the hospital. Bundeswehr engineers from Germany could repair bridges and roads, just as they did in their humanitarian mission in Somalia. Civilian experts from the FRG are to reestablish electricity supplies and repair water pipes and sewage pipes. "We need a lot of personnel," one of Kinkel's helpers says, "but we have enormous difficulties finding people who want to go there." Even in Tuzla Germans are supposed to march in as soon as the Serbs finally put a stop to firing a the airport. As a precaution, the Foreign Ministry cautiously asked the Defense Ministry whether soldiers who are on leave or have recently been discharged would be available for operating the airport. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe is still resisting. He is sticking to the chancellor's previous statement that a mission by German soldiers in the former Yugoslavia is out of the question. Ruehe's resistance will probably crumble if the "vision" of his boss Kohl is fulfilled: The chancellor dreams of sealing a peace agreement at a summit with the Americans, French, British, and Russians -- as President Yeltsin has already publicly demanded. The Germans have already taken over "patronage" for a peace agreement -- at least that is what the diplomats on the Rhine claim. At the summit, they then want to rise to the first ranks of international politics in front of everyone's eyes. There Germany is to "practically guarantee" peace as one of the "big powers" -- that is Kohl's desire. The precondition: The civil war parties must agree. There have been so many cease-fire agreements in the former Yugoslavia so far that even experts have lost count. Another one came into force last week.
