The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, due to become law within two months, extends the range of offences that cannot be regarded as political. Westminster MP's were furious when the Irish High Court recently freed Joseph Magee, 27, from Armagh, who was wanted in England in connection with the murder of Sgt Michael Newman, 34, in Derby on April 14, 1992. Two of the three grounds given for quashing the extradition order were that the offence was political and that the procedure followed when his extradition was ordered by the lower District Court had been unfair. The legislation is designed to close both loopholes. The new law would mean that people committing violent crimes involving firearms and explosives would no longer be able to claim their offence was political.
