The demonstrators, who termed the event a nonpartisan show of patriotism, were flanked by military security patrols, a safety measure never before offered to exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's supporters. A witness said the demonstrators shouted chants against foreigners. The chants are evidence of an increasing negative sentiment against foreigners, confirmed by several expatriates as the deadline for the enforcement of the new measures approaches. Several foreign news teams had reportedly been arrested and detained for a few hours by the Haitian police in recent days.
