A great many of those in the military hierarchy and at intermediate grades as well as among ordinary enlisted men do not like this way of conducting the political dialogue that, in the space of several weeks, favored a marked advance of the fundamentalist movement in Algeria. There is, the evidence would suggest, a major risk of seeing the country's total destabilization rush forward. Indeed, Algeria is currently experiencing the most dramatic moments of its young existence since independence. You truly have to be a complete innocent to keep on thinking the way some people were barely a few months ago. The fundamentalist movement is an indivisible whole but one that is subdivided into different compartments, oftentimes contradictory ones, to be sure, but that is all. Its basic logic is a rejection of the other. The record of the dialogue that can be drawn up is an undeniably disastrous one for the country. The state has not negotiated from a position of strength. It has given every impression that it is discussing from a position of weakness, as its numerous concessions, which have produced nothing, demonstrate. And this attitude was very well understood by FIS leaders who not only failed to lift their little finger to put an end to the terrorism, despite the concessions made by the Algerian state, but who also increased their directives to "burn" the country. The basic question facing Algerians today is to know whether the Army is going to stand behind a process that will make Algeria disappear a few months from now.
