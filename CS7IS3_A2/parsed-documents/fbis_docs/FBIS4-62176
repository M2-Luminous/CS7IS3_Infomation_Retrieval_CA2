Sokolova] [Text] Despite the fact that the Russian side has not yet furnished Estonia with a timetable for the withdrawal of its forces, the withdrawal itself is, according to the military, proceeding strictly on schedule. The headquarters of the Navy in Tallinn is left with only support units under its command. Ninety percent of the property from the torpedo and mine depot has already been shipped out by rail and road. Only a few bits and pieces remain. The workshops for overhauling torpedoes are deserted. Equipment is being sold to the Estonian side. It will be possible to make use of it for civilian purposes. Unserviceable and obsolete equipment is being abandoned. It would be very expensive to ship it out, and the Ministry of Defense is refusing permission to sell it off as scrap metal. It is clearly afraid of a repetition of the problems experienced in the Western Group of Forces. So we are abandoning thousands of tonnes of metal, to the joy of the local scrap merchants. Unlike the Ground Forces units, the Navy units are not being withdrawn but are being disbanded on the spot. Only one in three officers is being offered a new posting. This means that two-thirds of them will end up homeless in our vast motherland. Those with less than 20 years of service will not even get a service pension. What is to become of them? Will they just become vagrants in naval uniform? Who will answer for the fact that people who are having to listen daily to being called "occupationists," people who have given the best years of their lives to the Navy, are being abandoned to their fate?
