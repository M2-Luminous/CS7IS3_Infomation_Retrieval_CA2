Semenov introduces Rybkin and Shumeyko and says the topic of discussion will be the agreement on civil accord to be signed on 28 April. He begins by asking why the civil peace accord is needed. Shumeyko explains that the Constitution was the basis for the '94 election of the chambers of the Federal Assembly. He says: "We must do a lot in Russia now, and without agreement it will be impossible. The Duma has nine factions that unite various political parties, but many parties have been left outside these bodies of state power. There are more than 100 parties all together. There are also many public movements, groups, and public organizations in the provinces. We would like to unite all of them around one goal, the goal of building. Russia needs calm today; Russia must work." Rybkin suggests that Russia is in the middle of a crisis and accord is needed as soon as possible. He adds that there should be cooperation between all forces in society. He says that the State Duma has already released its own memorandum on accord, and the new document is absolutely necessary. Shumeyko continues by saying that the people who worked on the new constitution have also contributed to the new agreement on accord, but the new document is less important than the act of signing it. He adds: "The signing of this accord means that every politician takes upon himself the responsibility for this accord. He undertakes to suspend all political battles, thus enabling Russia to work for at least two years, leaving aside the power struggle and the struggle for predomination in various social movements. This is an accord on the politicians' responsibility to find peace and a common language." Rybkin says that there are also internal, interethnic problems facing Russia and cites relations with Chechnya as an example. He says he hopes that the agreement on accord will help to resolve these problems. Semenov asks Shumeyko whether Chechnya is a constituent part of the Russian Federation. Shumeyko replies: "The Chechen Republic has been and still is a constituent part of the Russian Federation. The only difference is the politicians' view on this matter. As you know, President Dudayev has been the leader of the Chechen Republic for the last two years. He has been elected by the Chechen people. There is only one document, a decision by the former Congress of People's Deputies, declaring these elections void. And so, on the basis of this single document, as well as on the basis of various declarations--some harsh, others less so--issued by President Dudayev, everyone seems to have decided that Chechnya has separated from Russia. So this nation of 1 million, which is part of Russia, finds itself in a temporary, self-imposed isolation. The Federation Council will continue to work very consistently, but calmly, in order to fully reintegrate the Chechen Republic into Russia." Shumeyko and Rybkin then discuss the Federation Council and the State Duma's future work on the civil accord and other pending matters. Semenov asks Shumeyko about the fate of the Black Sea Fleet. Shumeyko replies: "Well, first of all, the fleet certainly must be retained. Russia, as you know, will very soon be celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Russian fleet. The Russian fleet is a Russian creation. The fleet is Russia itself. It is simply impossible to imagine Russia without it. Therefore, it is perfectly clear that it should be retained. "The decisions that the presidents made--I mean, at the last CIS summit.... [pauses] Representatives of Ukraine and Russia stayed on after the summit. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin had talks with Leonid Makarovich Kravchuk, and the two presidents made a decision to divide up the Black Sea Fleet with a ratio of 20 per cent to 80 percent. You see what happened afterwards, when talks began at lower levels of authority. "I believe that the process will stabilize, but what I would like to see and what I would like to say by way of warning is that decisions here should not be made rashly. Things should be done more calmly. We all know this. Both the Ukrainians and ourselves know that the fleet should remain, and the Black Sea Fleet will remain and will exist forever. As to what form it should take, I would prefer it to remain as a complete fleet. I believe that this is what will happen eventually--however much the politicians are insisting on their short-term gains today. Short-term gains are very dear to certain politicians. A little time will pass, and the people will have forgotten about today's politicians, but the fleet will be remembered." Semenov then asks Rybkin about possible trouble on 1 May. Rybkin replies: "I am convinced that on 1 May, the day of spring and labor--our official holiday but also the Orthodox Easter day--the streets in Russia will be calm. People are beginning to understand that there is a need for the accord that we have been talking about for a whole hour today." Rybkin then adds: "I am sure that we will be both intellectually and emotionally strong enough to understand that we must find a way out of the crisis through joint efforts. As they say, Russia has always been strong through its team spirit, and is famous around the world for its great good deeds rather than for its meanness." Semenov thanks the listeners and says he hopes to see the chairmen in the Kremlin on 28 April to sign the agreement on public accord.
