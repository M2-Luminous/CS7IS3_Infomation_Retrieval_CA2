In Beijing, the official CHINA DAILY reported that Tang Shubei, vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) would meet with his Taiwan counterpart Chiao Jun-ho on January 31 to discuss economic "and other non-political issues." The five-day talks in Beijing were expected to pave the way for a meeting between ARATS chairman Wang Daohan and the chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Koo Chen-fu, who first met for a landmark get-together in Singapore in April, analysts said. CHINA DAILY quoted Tang as saying he hoped his talks with Chiao would settle matters concerning the Wang-Koo meeting and set the starting date for talks on economic, scientific and technological cooperation. But in Taipei, a mainland affairs official said Friday that Taiwan was considering suspending the talks. "We have decided to make a re-evaluation on whether the talks between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei should be held as planned," said Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC). "Mainland China has made a series of unfriendy moves against us recently and set pre-conditions on topics to be discussed (in the meeting,) trying to deny our legal jurisdiction by avoiding political issues," Kao said. The various steps Beijing had taken to isolate Taiwan and its effort to threaten the island militarily "had caused negative response from the people here and undoubtedly led to adverse impact on relations across the Taiwan Strait," Kao said. Taiwan's threat came only two days after China and France issued a communique in which Paris had pledged not to sell Taiwan any more arms in order to normalize relations with Beijing following a year-long freeze caused by its supply of 60 Mirage 2005 jet fighters to the island. The landlocked African state of Lesotho also announced Wednesday the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with China and severed official ties with Taipei. No problems could be really solved if the mainland continued the "you die, I live" mentality in dealing with Taiwan, Kao warned. The Chinese communists drove the Nationalist troops to Taiwan in 1949 in a civil war and still claims sovereignty over the island. Beijing has barred other countries from making any major arms sales to or forging diplomatic ties with Taiwan which it considers part of its territory. Tang had planned to visit Taiwan last month, but the trip was cancelled after talks in Taipei failed to reach an agreement on the thorny issue of repatriating Chinese hijackers to the mainland. The hijacking issue and fishing disputes were major obstacles to the successful conclusion of the three previous rounds of talks between the two semi-official bodies which also got bogged down on jurisdiction and sovereignty. A spate of 10 hijackings in 1993 added a new soure of friction between Beijing and Taipei which have both claimed to be the legitimate government of all China since the communists forced the nationalists to flee to Taiwan in 1949 following a civil war on the mainland. ARATS closed a two-day meeting in Beijing Thursday during which it decided to establish a new economic department to respond to increasing economic and trade relations across the Taiwan Strait. SEF and ARATS were set up in 1990 as nominally private bodies to get around Taiwan's 44-year-old policy of no direct contact with Beijing.
