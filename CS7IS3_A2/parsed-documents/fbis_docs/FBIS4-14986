In connection with the current Helsinki seminar of the council on preparing new members which is attended by a group of Russian deputies Laar said "the strong interest of our neighbor in the East in membership can be viewed from a positive angle." However, the prime-minister said, the organization is opposed to the presence of foreign troops on the territory of a country without consent. "Consequently, before becoming a full member of the Council of Europe Russia should pull out its troops," Laar said. "If any European country wishes to revise the provision, the Estonian delegation will be consistent on this question," he added. The question of admitting new members to the council is decided on the basis of consensus.
