FR940106-1-00045 FR940106-1-00010 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 73 [MM Docket No. 93&hyph;254, DA 93&hyph;1576] Radio Broadcast Services; Limitations on Commercial Time on Television Broadcast Stations AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; extension of reply comment period. SUMMARY: This action, in response to a request indicating good cause to extend the reply comment period filed by the Center for the Study of Commercialism, the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation of America, and the Office of Communication of the United Church for Christ, extends the deadline for filing reply comments in the Notice of Inquiry in the above-cited docket. The Notice solicited comments on whether the public interest would be served by establishing limits on the amount of commercial matter broadcast by television stations. The Commission adopted the Notice on its own motion. Comments were due by December 20, 1993. The deadline for reply comments was originally January 5, 1994, and is extended until February 4, 1994. DATES: Reply comments are now due by February 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Paul R. Gordon, Mass Media Bureau, Video Services Division, (202) 632&hyph;6357. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: December 29, 1993 Released: December 29, 1993 Reply Comment Date: February 4, 1994 By the Chief, Mass Media Bureau 1. This action extends the deadline for filing reply comments in response to the Notice of Inquiry in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;254, 8 FCC Rcd 7277 (1993), in which the Commission seeks comment on whether the public interest would be served by establishing limits on the amount of commercial matter broadcast by television stations. The Commission adopted the Notice on its own motion. Comments were due by December 20, 1993, and the deadline for reply comments was January 5, 1994. 1 1 The Bureau altered these comments dates from the original dates set forth in the Notice of Inquiry. Order in MM Docket No. 93&hyph;254, DA No. 93&hyph;1425 (released November 22, 1993). 2. The Center for the Study of Commercialism, the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation of America, and the Office of Communication of the United Church for Christ (the parties) request a 30-day extension of the reply comment period in order to address adequately the matters asserted in the comments. The parties state that the reply comment period extends over the seasonal holidays, providing insufficient time in which to prepare an adequate reply. In addition, they state that their co-counsel, a clinical legal education program at a local law school, lacks the staff to prepare reply comments during the school holiday. 2 2 The parties also state that an extension will allow the Commission to supplement the Notice. Specifically, they request that two pending petitions for rulemaking, both of which concern the Commission's rules on commercial sponsorship identification, be incorporated into this proceeding. However, we believe that the issues raised in the petitions for rulemaking are best addressed separately by the Commission. Accordingly, we decline to extend the range of issues addressed in this proceeding. 3. In light of the foregoing, the Bureau finds that good cause exists for an extension. Grant of the request will provide the Commission a more substantial record upon which to base its findings. Therefore, pursuant to 47 CFR 0.283, the deadline for filing reply comments is extended until February 4, 1994. Federal Communications Commission. Roy J. Stewart, Chief, Mass Media Bureau.
