[passage omitted] Slovak Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner announced at a briefing that some 18,000 foreign nationals are currently staying legally in the Slovak Republic, and another 20,000-30,000 are estimated to be staying here illegally, most of whom are citizens of the former USSR.

Jarnjak said that, although the number of foreign tourists doubled in Croatia last year, the crime rate declined 18 percent, also thanks to preventive operations. [passage omitted]
