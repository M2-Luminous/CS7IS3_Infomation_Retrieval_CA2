The semifinished products were stretched until a specified deformation was achieved and then dried while held with clamps or left free. Alkyl siloxane-type organosilicon compounds were then used as a filler for producing quasi-liquid membranes. The filler was incorporated into the substrate by replacing the crazing medium. This was done by stretching amorphous PETP in n-propranol, releasing it from the clamps, and transferring it into polymethylsiloxane [PMS] or polyethylsiloxane [PES] fluid. After several minutes it completely replaced the propranol in the crazes' micropores. Not all the PMS fluids used proved to be suitable fillers. The highly volatile ones (e.g., PMS-10) lost up to 50 percent of their mass in the first 4 days of storage. As a result, PMS with only very slight volatility (e.g., PMS-20 and PMS-100) were used along with PES-5 and fractioned oligodimethylsiloxanes. Samples of quasi-liquid membranes retained their dimensions after months of storage. The permeability of the quasi-liquid membranes with PMS or PES fillers was thousands of times greater than that of films of amorphous PETP with a selectivity of _a_[.sub]02/N2[/] = 2.2 to 2.4. Furthermore, the parameters characterizing the newly synthesized quasi-liquid membranes were on a par with those of Silar-type block copolymers, and their mechanical properties even surpassed those of block copolymers. As anticipated, the quasi-liquid membranes with the more viscous filler (PMS-100) had lower permeabilities because of the decrease in the coefficient of diffusion of gas in a liquid as that liquid's viscosity increases. A mechanism of active gas transfer was used to increase the quasi-liquid membranes' selectivity. Through directed alteration of the crazing mechanism, the researchers were able to obtain microporous materials with improved permeability. Decreasing the thickness of the working layer of quasi-liquid membrane and using polymers with a high permeability were said to be the simplest ways of further increasing the performance characteristics of crazed quasi-liquid membranes.
