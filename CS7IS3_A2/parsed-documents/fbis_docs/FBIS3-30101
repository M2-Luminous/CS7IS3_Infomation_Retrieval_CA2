Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said the package will feature a plan to whittle down Japan's current account surplus to 2.8 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the new fiscal year. "As long as Japan runs as much as 59.3 billion dollars of surplus with the U.S., we cannot have understanding from the international community," he told reporters after a special cabinet meeting on the trade dispute with the U.S. Hata quickly added that the figure is a goal, not a pledge. "We cannot make a pledge on such matters because of volatile factors such as foreign exchange and interest rates," he said. The proportion cited by Hata is an official target announced earlier in the government's economic forecast which covered a broad range from economic growth, to prices, to trade balances. Japan's current account surplus was 3.32 percent of the gross national product (GNP) in fiscal 1992 and 2.62 percent in 1991. The proportion is estimated at 3.1 percent for the year ending March 31. GDP represents GNP minus net inflow of income from abroad. At a press conference after the special cabinet meeting, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura quoted Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa as saying it is natural for Japan to voluntarily do what it can, regardless of its trade negotiations with the U.S. The collapse of the bilateral "framework" trade talks earlier this month refueled U.S. anger over what it perceives as exclusive markets in Japan. A couple of days after the talks broke down, Washington threatened to impose sanctions over a bilateral feud concerning Japan's cellular phone market. Washington is moving to revive the Super 301 provision of a 1988 trade act which authorizes the government to identify and retaliate against "unfair" traders. Refusing to yield to such pressure, at least on the surface, Hosokawa has repeatedly said Japan will pursue market liberalization regardless of external prodding. The newly planned market-opening measures will not only cover the four areas pinpointed earlier but contain other necessary steps such as a review of Japan's 10-year plan to spend a total of 430 trillion yen on public works projects, Takemura said. The earlier-announced measures involve further deregulation, promotion of imports and foreign investments, acceleration of government procurement processes, and revamped policy on competition. Friday's meeting brought Hosokawa together with Takemura, Hata, and other chiefs of the ministries of finance, trade, posts, health and transport, as well as chiefs of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) and the Management and Coordination Agency. Trade Minister Hiroshi Kumagai also told a separate press meeting that the need to draft the package had been felt since the moment the prime minister said "no" to the U.S. demand to fix quantitative targets for Japan's imports at the February 11 talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton. Kumagai reportedly told the cabinet that not only market-opening steps, such as deregulation, but macro-economic steps should be included in the package. EPA Chief Manae Kubota opposed the proposed inclusion of the 2.8 percent surplus-to-GDP proportion in the package. She told a press conference that few of past government surplus targets have been realized since the agency started compiling such figures in 1955.
