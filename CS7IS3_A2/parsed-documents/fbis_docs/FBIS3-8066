He assessed that Russia's involvement in the search for a peaceful solution is of crucial importance and that the balance of powers has now been restored on the international scene. Russia is not returning to the international scene in the sense of confrontation with the West, but in the sense of a very active role in the process of searching for a solution to the crisis, Karadzic said and assessed that the Serbian side, as he said, has finally found somebody through whom it can articulate its views and point to what is totally unacceptable for it. When we asked him whether we can now expect a concrete new Russian initiative regarding the conflict in Bosnia, Karadzic replied: [Karadzic] I think that the Russians will work in sync with others. It seems to me that at least two moves so far -- Yeltsin's letter regarding heavy arms to [Serbian] President Milosevic and via him to me, and now this about the Tuzla airport -- have surprised western circles. It seems to me that Russia has accomplished a considerable advantage here, on the basis of which it can now take part in the resolution of the crisis on an equal footing. I expect and assume that meetings similar to those in Washington will also happen in Moscow. [Vidic] Karadzic then commented the Washington agreement on the Muslim-Croatian confederation: [Karadzic] We are still studying this agreement and we are not sure yet whether it has been struck at the expense of the Serbs or as a partial step toward peace. We fear any sort of Croatian-Muslim coalition, we remember them from World War II and from the beginning of this war, and for this reason we are very cautious. If they form a joint state then we must also take care of our territories and borders. They must be easily defendable in case this country, this neighbor, starts displaying hostile feelings toward us. In principle, we think that it is not good that the United States has assumed the role of the United Nations, and has taken the place of the international institutions, so to speak, with the great ambition of helping along an agreement of the Croats and Muslims only. I am afraid that the United States is missing another opportunity to portray itself as objective. Therefore, the impression of its partiality and orientation against the Serbian interests is strengthening. [Vidic] The next steps of the Srpska republic will be to strengthen peace on all front lines in order to negotiate in the best possible atmosphere, Karadzic said. We will participate in all negotiations, however, we have reserves toward those who act as arbiters and neglect the significance of the Serbian side in this conflict. We will not allow the realization of the Croatian-Muslim coalition and joint state to the detriment of the Serbs, Karadzic emphasized. Commenting on [Croatian Foreign Minister] Granic's invitation to the Serbs to enter the confederation, Karadzic said that the Croatian Minister should have said this in Belgrade and not in Paris. Karadzic then replied to a question about the decision to open Tuzla airport: [Karadzic] We have never opposed the opening of the airport for humanitarian purposes. Our fundamental concern was that the airport could be abused for military purposes. We have held very fruitful talks regarding this in Russia and received assurances that the arrangement that we had agreed with the Russians protects against any sort of misuse of the airport. In such a case, we have nothing against the opening of the airport. [end recording]
