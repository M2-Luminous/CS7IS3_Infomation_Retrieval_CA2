In fact, agreement has been reached on the names of those who will return as part of confidence-building measures between the two sides. Sources close to the negotiations noted that final agreement was also reached on reopening all PLO, Fatah, and other popular organizations' offices in the occupied territories, which were closed recently after the intifadah activities were stepped up. These offices were officially allowed to reopen once the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed on 13 September 1993. The same sources clarified that measures to reopen these offices are being taken by the Israeli military ruler for all the occupied areas. Moreover, sources close to the negotiations' delegations have affirmed that negotiations on autonomy in Gaza and Jericho will resume on Sunday in Cairo. The sources said that all necessary measures will be taken to speed up these negotiations so that they will end in about one week, or ten days at the latest. These sources clarified that there are four different committees: The Economic Committee, which was meeting in Paris under the chairmanship of Israeli Finance Minister Avraham Shohat and Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', head of the PLO Economic Department, will meet in Cairo with the rest of the committees. The other three committees are the Security Affairs Committee chaired by Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq; the Civil Affairs Committee chaired by lawyer Jamil al-Tarifi and General Gadi Zohar, deputy director of civil administration in the West Bank; and the Autonomy Privileges Committee, which will set the final arrangements for the transfer of Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho. The same sources clarified that concerted efforts are being exerted to end the negotiations within the coming week so that Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin can sign the final agreement no later than 12 April 1994. It is worth mentioning that the Palestinian and Israeli delegations actually started discussing the agenda of the remaining issues on implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement late last night.
