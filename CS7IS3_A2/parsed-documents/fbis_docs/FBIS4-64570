A further great and important step toward the enlargement of the EU has been taken, Kinkel said in Bonn on Wednesday [3 May]. Kinkel said he is confident that the last hurdles will also now be overcome and that the referenda and ratification processes in the individual states will be brought to a brisk and positive conclusion. Kinkel stressed that the Federal Government will do everything to ensure the treaties of accession were ratified in good time in Germany, so that the four European Free Trade Association states will become equal members of the EU on 1 January next year.
