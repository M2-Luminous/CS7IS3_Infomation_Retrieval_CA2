"We have no intentions whatsoever to seek the interaction or assistance of military action in our patriotic pursuit", the National Democratic Coalition said. The recently-formed coalition, comprising politicians, former ministers, ex-state military governors and retired military officers, has called on the military ruler General Sani Abacha to hand over power to Yoruba politician Moshood Abiola. Abiola was the widely accepted winner of the presidential elections, organised last June. The then military ruler Ibrahim Babangida banned the publication of the results. The current military ruler, Abacha, took over in November. The pro-democracy coalition has supported Abiola who earlier this month proclaimed himself head of a parallel government after breaking out of house arrest and going into hiding.
