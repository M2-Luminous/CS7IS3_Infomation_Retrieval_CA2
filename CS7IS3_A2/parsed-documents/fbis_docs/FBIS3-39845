He added, however, that it is not a legal problem but a political one. Venizelos said the Greek Government is particularly satisfied with the outcome of the European foreign ministers' meeting because it handled the issue as a political one. Venizelos said the measures continue to be implemented. Asked whether EU Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek will visit Skopje and Athens, the spokesman replied positively and added that his mission would be to examine the situation. The government spokesman said Van Den Broek will meet the Greek Government, which will express its well-known and clear positions. He said: For us, dialogue will begin when [FYROM President Kiro] Gligorov's government gives tangible proof of goodwill. Asked about the community's mechanism and Van Den Broek's visit to Athens and Skopje, Venizelos said the Dutch commissioner will pay a visit in order to determine whether Skopje maintains the same intransigent behavior. Greece has adopted these measures after considering Skopje's intransigence. The spokesman described as absurd reports of an equal distance between the EU, Greece, and Skopje, because Greece is a member of the community and currently holds the presidency. Venizelos concluded: A presidency that has been praised so far.
