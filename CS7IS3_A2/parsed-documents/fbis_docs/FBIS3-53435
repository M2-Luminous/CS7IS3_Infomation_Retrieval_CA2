Indian interest in Stinger was primarily to use the American technology for upgrading their Akash series of missiles which have not produced satisfactory results during the trials, they said. Indians have been desperately trying to enhance the capability of Akash to use it as an anti-missile-missile capable of engaging multiple targets. In this context India had also approached Israel for transfer of technology of Arrow anti-missile-missile which is a joint venture of USA and Israel. Informed sources have confirmed that access to Stinger technology would significantly help India in improving the performance of Akash missiles. It may also be recalled that the Clinton administration had allocated huge sums for purchasing the Stingers from the Mojahedin to obviate the possibility of these being delivered to a third country. It may be mentioned here that the Indian intelligence agencies operating in Afghanistan and having links with Afghan counterparts Khad/WAD were making hectic efforts to establish rapport with various Mujahideen groups for this purpose since quite some time.
