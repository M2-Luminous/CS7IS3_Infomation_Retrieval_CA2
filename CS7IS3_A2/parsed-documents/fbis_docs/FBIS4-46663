Cheremisin; UDC 528:629.783] [Abstract] The already demonstrated effectiveness of the Etalon passive geodetic satellites is further discussed. They were launched for increasing the accuracy in determining and predicting the parameters of motion of vehicles in the GLONASS system, refining geodynamic parameters and constructing corresponding models of these geodynamic parameters. Refined models based on Etalon observations can represent an improvement over models now used for the GLONASS system and can be used in constructing a highly precise model of the nongravitational forces acting on navigational satellites, as well as in solving problems directly related to increasing the accuracy characteristics of the GLONASS system. It is believed that this will make it possible to solve a wide range of geophysical problems: refinement of fundamental geophysical and astronomical constants, construction of a model of the internal structure of the Earth and formulation of a theory of its rotation. A table gives the characteristics of the Etalon passive spacecraft. The observations made it possible to construct a highly precise model of motion of passive spacecraft taking the following perturbations into account: Earth's gravitational potential, gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, gravitational attraction of Venus and possibly Jupiter; pressure of direct solar radiation and that reflected from the Earth. The Etalon passive spacecraft in the future can be used for solving all problems within the framework of the GLONASS system and for increasing the accuracy of fundamental geophysical and astronomical parameters. The means by which these goals can be most effectively attained are outlined.
