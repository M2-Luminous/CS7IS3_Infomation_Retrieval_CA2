Commander Eric Chaperon, spokesman for the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR), said the unidentified soldier was killed Sunday evening at his observation post in Gorazde, probably by Serb gunners. His death brought to 44 the number of peacekeepers killed in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the past two years. "Sunday was a really bad day for the UN in Gorazde," Chaperon said. He said UN patrols in the region had come under repeated attack by Serb and Moslem gunners throughout the weekend, but no further casualties were reported. [passage omitted] Elsewhere, artillery duels continued Monday in the northern Mount Ozren region, where the Moslem-led Bosnian army has been waging a major offensive against Serb forces, but the fighting was less intense than over the weekend, Chaperon said. "It is clear that the Bosnian troops have made territorial gains," he said although he couldn't provide any more details. The Serbs have reportedly evacuated several villages in the area in the face of the Moslem offensive. Chaperon said UN military observers deployed in the north were reporting heavy shelling from both sides. The observers were finding it increasingly difficult to accomplish their mission as they are not being granted access to the battle zones, he said. The fighting is in a strategic zone just south of a thin land corridor linking Serb-conquered territory in northeast and western Bosnia. [passage omitted]
