Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-09FEB94-RUSSIA Duma Factions Successfully Negotiate Committee Assignments SUMMARY In contrast to their protracted wrangling over the election of the State Duma's chairman, legislative factions apparently worked together relatively smoothly in nominating candidates to fill the positions of the Duma's deputy chairmen and the chairmen and deputy chairmen of all the committees. In an apparent effort to counter fears that the Duma will, like the old Supreme Soviet, become a bastion of hardline opposition to President Boris Yeltsin, pro-communist factions evidently made a deliberate effort to ensure that reformist and centrist party factions would be well represented among the committee chairmen. As a result, the Duma has attained a politically balanced and professionally competent committee leadership that will make it a far more credible source of institutional opposition to Yeltsin than the old Supreme Soviet. END SUMMARY Demonstrating that the competing factions in the new Duma are, so far, willing and able to work together, at least on organizationl matters, after two days of closed-door discussions the Duma's factions reached agreement on a package of nominees for deputy speakers and the leadership of 23 committees. The package distributed the committee assignments about evenly across the political spectrum, giving each of the major party factions the leadership of at least one key committee. The sharing out of committee positions may have been made easier by the Duma's draft rules of procedure, which stipulate that the chairman and deputy chairmen of committees cannot belong to the same faction (See Note 1). Once the final package was drawn up, the Duma heard speeches by eight of the committee chairmen nominees but cut off further debate and adopted the entire package by a vote of 290 to 63 with 8 abstentions (Interfax, 17 January; Izvestiya, 18 January). (Note 1) The framers of the package evidently made an exception for the agriculture and geopolitics committees, however, since agriculture has a chairman and one deputy from the Agrarian Party, and geopolitics has a chairman and a deputy from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (Kommersant-Daily, 19 January). Balancing the Factions While it seems possible, judging by the success of pro-communist forces in electing the Duma's chairman, that they could have imposed their own nominees for most committee heads, they evidently chose to avoid the risk of an immediate return to the mutual hostility that characterized relations between Yeltsin and the old legislature by proposing a provision in the Duma's temporary rules mandating the "proportional representation" of factions among the committees (Interfax, 18 January). The provision, which the Duma approved, allocated the committee leadership positions in approximate relation to the numerical strength of the factions (see box). According to a deputy from the Party for Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), an alliance of centrist and hard-line factions would have been able to keep reformers out of leadership positions if Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin--who the deputy contended wanted to avoid the dominance of the "anti-presidential opposition" in the Duma--had not proposed the proportional concept (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January). The reformist newspaper Segodnya (26 January), however, credited the idea to Communist Party (CPRF) leader Gennadiy Zyuganov, who also reportedly devised a mathematical system for assigning points to each leadership post, allowing factions to "buy" positions based on their numerical strength. According to Segodnya, the Russia's Choice faction, though numerically greater than the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), received fewer committee chairmanships because it used up more "points" to elect faction member Mikhail Mityukov as the Duma's first deputy chairman. Press reports have shed little light on the factions' negotiations, but the negotiators evidently used a variety of techniques to reach a consensus on the the final list. They all reportedly worked together to prevent ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy from heading the important international affairs committee that he had openly coveted or any other prominent position in the Duma (Interfax, 14 January; ITAR-TASS, 17 January). In addition, reformers and pro-communists may have cut a deal to split two other key committees, defense and security, between Russia's Choice and the CPRF, respectively. In some instances, the negotiators appear to have made an effort to match committee assignments with deputies' expertise. In an apparent effort to satisfy the factions' aspirations to gain a prominent platform through committee portfolios, several committees were added, boosting the total number to 23 instead of the 17 agreed upon by the Yeltsin-appointed commission charged with forming the Duma's structures (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). Similarly, the negotiators added a third deputy chairman position for each committee, thereby enabling almost one-fourth of the deputies to attain a "leadership" position (Nezavisimaya' Gazeta, 25 January). Key Committees With the exception of the LDPR, which the factions evidently maneuvered to exclude from prominent committee positions, the major party factions each got the chairmanship of at least one key committee. Before the factions met, the CPRF was reportedly angling for both the defense and security portfolios (Interfax, 5 January), but in the end, it won only the security chairmanship. For its part, the Agrarian Party gained the chairmanship of the important judicial and legal reform committee. Defense. Despite holding the military rank of colonel, committee chairman Sergey Yushenkov, a Russia's Choice member, appears to have limited experience in military matters. The Defense Ministry reportedly regards committee deputy chairman Aleksandr Piskunov, a member of the New Regional Policy group of non-party deputies, as "more sophisticated in military matters" than Yushenkov (Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 January; Kommersant-Daily, 27 January). Piskunov was deputy chairman of the former Supreme Soviet's defense and security committee. Security. The CPRF's Viktor Ilyukhin, a former USSR deputy prosecutor general who once attempted to have ex-President Mikhail Gorbachev tried for treason for his role in the dissolution of the USSR, became head of the security committee (ITAR-TASS, 17 January). Citing an unidentified source in the Federal Counterintelligence Service, Kommersant-Daily (27 January) reported that the service regards Ilyukhin as "a man with whom one can talk," in part because of his reported commitment to strong, centralized security bodies. His committee also includes such hardline nationalist figures as television anchorman Aleksandr Nevzorov and Yuriy Vlasov (Kommersant-Daily, 27 January). International Affairs. The choice of former Ambassador to the United States Vladimir Lukin, a member of the Yavlinskiy bloc, to head the international relations committee most likely satisfies hardliners' minimum aims to bring a less Western-oriented point of view to foreign policy while simultaneously assuring reformers that the committee is not likely to be extremist in its views. Before his appointment as ambassador, Lukin chaired the Supreme Soviet's international affairs committee. Although it is not clear if the CPRF had its own candidate for this post, Russia's Choice reportedly was prepared to back either Lukin or former First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin (also a member of the Yavlinskiy bloc), and the two sides evidently cooperated to find a mutually acceptable candidate to prevent Zhirinovskiy from heading the committee (Interfax, 14, 17 January; AFP, 17 January). As a PRES deputy observed, "Communists and Agrarians do not want the complete discreditation of the Duma" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January), and the selection of Zhirinovskiy would have led to polarized relations with the executive and made the committee a less credible instrument in the opposition's struggle against Yeltsin's pro-Western foreign policy. Nevertheless, the LDPR's Aleksey Mitrofanov, who holds the foreign ministry portfolio in the LDPR's "shadow cabinet," was elected as a deputy chairman (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 30 November 1993). Legislation, Judicial, and Legal Reform. The selection of the Agrarian Party's Vladimir Isakov, a determined advocate of strong powers for the legislature, to head this committee places him in a position to assert the legislature's interests on major political reform issues. The committee is responsible for the preliminary examination of all draft legislation on the judicial system and on the civil and criminal codes, as well as all "federal constitutional laws"--approximately a dozen key laws governing presidential and parliamentary elections, the procedures for forming the Federation Council in the future, the holding of referenda, and the specific powers of and interrelationship among the president, the Government, the Federal Assembly, and the constitutional court (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 27 January). Isakov, who headed the Supreme Soviet's Committee for Constitutional Legislation and spearheaded many of that body's attempts to limit Yeltsin's presidential powers and had expressed early interest in heading this committee, is likely to continue to push for amendments to the constitution, which he says contains "inherent contradictions" between the executive and legislative branch, though the constitution outlines a very difficult and cumbersome amendment process (Interfax, 5 January; RIA, 25 January). Any anti-presidential initiatives by Isakov will be opposed by reformers on the committee, including deputy chairman and Russia's Choice member Boris Zolotukhin, the experienced legislator Viktor Sheynis (Yavlinskiy bloc), and Vladimir Tumanov, a PRES deputy and legal specialist at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of State and Law (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 5 February). Proliferation of Committees In the original list of 17 committees, only one oversaw foreign policy issues, but the final list added one for relations with the CIS, headed by PRES deputy Konstantin Zatulin, and one on "geopolitics," headed by the LDPR's Viktor Ustinov and staffed predominantly by other LDPR members (ITAR-TASS, 4 January, 20 January). The presence of three committees overseeing foreign policy--in addition to the security and defense committees--will probably complicate the Duma's handling of foreign policy issues, especially toward the CIS, and, as Nezavisimaya Gazeta's foreign desk editor Mikhail Karpov suggested, may allow Yeltsin and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev to exploit differences among these committees (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 19 January). Geopolitics. According to Russia's Choice member Arkadiy Murashev, the creation of the geopolitics committee was a concession to the LDPR after the factions successfully kept Zhirinovskiy off the international affairs committee (Interfax, 17 January). Even here, however, the negotiators denied Zhirinovskiy the chairmanship, choosing instead the LDPR's Viktor Ustinov to head it. Of the committee's 14 members, nine are from the LDPR faction (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8 February). CIS Relations. As a businessman who attempted to unite Russian entrepreneurs and enterprise directors in his association, Entrepreneurs for a New Russia (Moskovskiye Novosti, No. 31, 1 August 1993; ITAR-TASS, 7 September 1993), Zatulin appears to have a vested interest in promoting close relations with CIS member states as a way of restoring the economic ties that bound the former USSR republics together. He has stated that PRES supports the "reorientation" of foreign policy "toward the near abroad [CIS member states] and the creation of a confederation within the CIS framework" (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 11 January). Information Policy. Russia's Choice became another beneficiary in the committee proliferation game when the negotiators agreed to create a new committee on the media and nominated Russia's Choice member and former media tsar Mikhail Poltoranin to head it. The new Committee on Information Policy and Communications also has ample representation of opposition figures among its deputy chairmen: Gennadiy Seleznev, a CPRF member and former chief editor of Pravda; Oleg Finko, an LDPR member and chief editor of the legal newspaper Yuridicheskaya Gazeta; and Igor Klochkov, an Agrarian Party member and former chairman of the traditionalist Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 26 January). Ethnic Policy. This committee, which was not on the original list of committees, appears to have been added as a concession to the New Regional Policy group of non-party deputies, whose member, Bair Zhamsuyev, was selected to head it. Zhamsuyev was elected to the Duma as a non-party candidate from the Aga-Buryat autonomous okrug (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993). Economic Committees The failure of Russia's Choice to receive the top post in any of the three committees concerned with economic matters is a setback for the faction and reflects continuing fractiousness among reformers, who reportedly failed once again to unite against the more organized opposition, particularly the CPRF and Agrarian Party (Kommersant-Daily, 19 January). Both the proposed and final list included three economic committees, but the final list realigned the committees' responsibilities somewhat, creating overlaps in important areas that may hamper the adoption of economic legislation. Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance. This committee--the largest by a wide margin with 43 members (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8 February)--is headed by Mikhail Zadornov, a member of the moderate reformist Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc and a former associate at Grigoriy Yavlinskiy's Economic and Political Research Center (Moskovskiye Novosti, No. 20, 19 May 1991; Krasnaya Zvezda, 25 January). According to Interfax (16 January), Russia's Choice proposed Aleksandr Pochinok, who was chairman of the analogous committee in the Supreme Soviet--to head this committee but was willing to compromise on Zadornov, with Pochinok ending up as one of the committee's deputy chairmen (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 26 January). While the original list proposed one committee for budget and taxes and another for banking, finance, and monetary policy, the faction negotiators apparently decided to combine fiscal and monetary oversight functions, greatly expanding the committee's purview. In a major win for reformers, ex-Finance Minister Boris Fedorov was elected to head the subcommittee on credit and monetary policy, giving him an official role in overseeing Central Bank policy, which he has vociferously criticized (Radio Rossii, 8 February). Many committee members are reportedly former directors of small enterprises, trading firms, commercial banks, or private investment funds rather than economists, leading Krasnaya Zvezda's parliamentary reporter Vladimir Yermolin to conclude that the committee will divide between private and corporate interests rather than between monetarists and industrialists (25 January). Property, Privatization, and Economic Activity. In a major boost for the New Regional Policy group of non-party deputies--which is second in numerical strength after Russia's Choice--one of their members, Sergey Burkov, was chosen to head this important committee. Burkov was elected without party affiliation from a single-seat constituency in Kemerovo Oblast, where he served as adviser on economic matters to the oblast soviet (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993). As committee chairman, Burkov will be in a position to defend regional interests as the focus of privatization shifts toward the regions. Economic Policy. As with the choice of Lukin for the international affairs committee, the selection of Sergey Glazyev, a member of the centrist Democratic Party of Russia (DPR) and former minister for foreign economic relations, appears to reflect a conscious decision by faction negotiators to find a mutually acceptable candidate to head this broadly mandated committee. With only 15 members in its faction (ITAR-TASS, 19 January), the DPR may not otherwise have been a contender to chair such an important committee. The committee itself was added to the original list, which had given responsibility for overall economic reform to the property and privatization committee (ITAR-TASS, 4 January). Glazyev has indicated a preference for a more moderate reform course, saying that he would like to stimulate production by reducing the "excessive tax burden" currently imposed on enterprises (Segodnya, 3 February). He is reportedly planning to present to the Duma an economic program that calls for price controls and "temporary" wage freezes and would reassert state management over certain sectors while also reserving for the state "veto power" over shareholder decisions in the case of large industrial enterprises undergoing privatization (Segodnya, 8 February). Party and Professional Expertise Several of the committee chairmanships appear to have gone to the factions with a strong vested interest in the subject matter, perhaps as a result of these factions' bidding under Zyuganov's "points" system. For example, members of PRES, which billed itself as the "party of the regions" during the election campaign, head the Committee on Local Self-Government and the Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy. The latter committee's functions may overlap with those of the Committee on Ethnic Policy. The Committee on Agricultural Issues is headed by a member of the Agrarian Party faction, and 19 of its 27 members are also from the Agrarian faction (Rossiya, No. 5, 2-8 February). Likewise, the Women of Russia faction, whose election campaign focused on the need to protect women and families from the adverse impact of economic reforms, heads the Committee for Women, Family, and Youth. For some of the less high-profile committees, the factions appear to have tried to match committee chairmanships with the professional expertise of individual deputies. For example, Bella Denisenko, a Russia's Choice member and former first deputy minister of health, heads the Committee on Health. She also served on the former Supreme Soviet's Committee for Public Health, Social Insurance, and Physical Culture and even resigned her government position to retain her committee position after the Supreme Soviet passed a law preventing government members from serving simultaneously in the legislature (ITAR-TASS, 18 December 1992; Kuranty, 13 February 1993). Similarly, the LDPR's Mikhail Lemeshev, who heads the Ecology Committee, is a long-time environmental activist whose interest in environmental protection appears to have led him to embrace the nationalist cause. He has held a number of environmental posts, including as an "expert" with the UN, and was once a member of the governing board of the Committee To Save the Volga (Podmoskovye, No. 17, 27 April 1991; Rabochaya Tribuna, 31 October 1991). Lemeshev also served as president of the USSR Anti-Nuclear Society, in which capacity he advocated energy conservation--in part through higher energy prices--as an alternative to nuclear energy (Svet (Priroda i Chelovek), No. 3, March 1991). Like other nationalists, Lemeshev has condemned overreliance on the export of natural resources to earn hard currency and the exploitation of Russian oil fields by Western companies (Podmoskovye, No. 17, 27 April 1991). Mixed Views on Compromise Process Deputies from various factions across the spectrum have praised the decision to draw up a package of candidates for a single vote as a way of streamlining what might otherwise have been a protracted, contentious process. The Agrarian Party's Isakov said that the package vote was a "reasonable" compromise that made it possible "to avoid wasting weeks on voting on appointments," while Vyacheslav Shostakovskiy of the Yavlinskiy bloc succinctly termed it an "achievement" (ITAR-TASS, 20 January). Even PRES chairman Sergey Shakhray, who initially opposed the negotiations and package vote, said that ultimately the process was beneficial: "Had we nominated heads of parliamentary committees person by person, the political spectrum would have been more uniform, and the factor of professional qualification for the post would not have been always taken into account" (Interfax, 17 January; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 25 January). Other deputies, however, particularly those not affiliated with a faction, complained that the factions' closed-door negotiations did not take into account the interests of non-party deputies and expressed concern that factions are playing a disproportionate role in the Duma's decisionmaking. However, because here are no more than 58 unaffiliated deputies in the Duma, their voice is likely to go unheeded by the factions: -- Commenting on the factions' compromise, Vasiliy Lipitskiy, who heads the non-parliamentary People's Party of Free Russia but was elected as an unaffiliated deputy from a single-seat constituency, complained that the Duma "vacillates between utter uncontrollability and too rigidly controlled decision-making by the heads of groups [factions]" (ITAR-TASS, 20 January). -- Similarly, deputies who have affiliated with the Union of 12 December group, started by Economic Freedom Party leader Irina Khakamada, and Sergey Baburin's nationalist Russian Way group- -neither of which has yet gained enough members to register as a faction--expressed pique that their groups were slighted in the negotiations, with the Russian Way calling the package vote a "black day for Russian patriots" (Segodnya, 26 January). Implications By reaching a consensus relatively quickly on the distribution of committee assignments, factions demonstrated their ability to overcome significant party differences, negotiate, and compromise. Deputies may in the future try to use package votes like the kind successfully employed in this case as one tool of compromise, though it will be more difficult to apply this technique to substantive issues like legislation. The factions' negotiations also indicate that they are likely to play a dominant role in the Duma, possibly making it a more disciplined and less capricious body than the former Supreme Soviet. By agreeing on compromise candidates for some committees and distributing key committees among the major factions, the pro- communist opposition successfully pursued what appears to have been a deliberate tactic not to provoke an immediate confrontation with Yeltsin. Having sought an organizational structure that is not overwhelmingly dominated by their own members, Yeltsin's opponents in the Duma appear intent on making the legislature become a more credible, and therefore more effective, institution than the former Supreme Soviet, thus increasing pressure on Yeltsin to take its views into account.
