The issue of frontier surveillance was raised during Ahtisaari's state visit to Sweden. Sweden thinks that in the last few years Finland has militarized the surveillance of the western border. The Frontier Guard thinks, however, that the opposite is the case because Finland has reduced the number of frontier guards on the western border in the last few years.
