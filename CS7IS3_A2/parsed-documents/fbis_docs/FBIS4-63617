As Interfax has learned from well-placed parliamentary sources, Shumeyko addressed to Duma's Chairman Ivan Rybkin a letter, saying that "the bill looks like an army drill instruction and has nothing in common with democracy and the free press." Its enactment, in Shumeyko's view, "may induce a significant infringement of the freedom of the press in Russia, and endless and senseless law-making activity since both the Constitution of Russia and the Federal Media Law would have to be changed." Drafted by the Information Policy and Communication Committee, the bill contravenes article 29 and many other points of the federal Constitution. In Shumeyko's opinion, "the constitution's ban on censorship is covertly breached by a whole range of the bill's clauses." "Although the draft law starts with independence guarantees, it ends with threats of trial, criminal punishment, penalties and sanctions. Yet, in Russia's Penal Code there isn't a word about punishing a journalist for doing or not doing what a state body wished him to do," Shumeyko remarked.
