The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, said this while responding to a question on Sino-British talks on the financial arrangements for the new airport in Hong Kong. "The key matter regarding the financial arrangements for the construction of the new airport in Hong Kong is whether or not to observe the memorandum of understanding on the new airport," Wu said. In compliance with the relevant provisions of the memorandum, the Chinese side has already put forward a whole set of proposals for settling the debt burden of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, increasing the cost-effectiveness of the airport project and intensifying necessary supervisory mechanism, Wu said. He added that China now hopes to see a favorable response from the British side. "However, some leading officials of the British Hong Kong Government recently made remarks in public attacking the Chinese side on this issue," he said. "This only points to the lack of sincerity for negotiations on the part of the British side. Therefore, should the talks be reopened, the British side ought to show its sincerity first."
