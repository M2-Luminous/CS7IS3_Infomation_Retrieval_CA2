This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at the conference -- "The Role and the Responsibility of the Mass Media in Democratic Process and the Development of Tolerance" -- that has opened in Moscow. "Our recent history testifies that manipulation with the mass media and the creation of a kind of ministry of the truth, for instance in the form of an ideological department of the CPSU Central Committee, may considerably affect the sentiments of the people," pointed out the foreign minister. Today, too, such a mighty weapon as the mass media is not always treated with sufficient honesty and required dignity. The minister pointed out that the mass media was often used to propagandise Russophobia and anti-semitism and to stir up national hatred. In many publications one can find ideas of nationalism and chauvinism. "It is a dangerous disease which cannot be left unnoticed," Kozyrev pointed out. He called for respectful relations between the authorities and the press. "We welcome well-reasoned, not ideologised, criticism, but we also want that journalists quote the speeches of officials more accurately, not distorting their words. However, they have the right to their own commentaries on the speech of any official," the minister said.
