FBIS4-22401 "jpusr036___94024" FBIS-USR-94-036 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 1 April 1994 CAUCASUS ARMENIA Armenia's Kurdish Community Ready for Compromise Armenia's Kurdish Community Ready for Compromise 944K1011B Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA in Russian 1 Apr 94 p 1 944K1011B Yerevan RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA Russian CSO [Artem Yerkanyan report: "Kurds Ready for Compromise"] [Text] A news conference organized yesterday by the Kurdish Professionals of Armenia Council, the Kurdistan Committee, and the newspapers RYATAZA and BOTAN was devoted to the events of the current stage of the national liberation movement of the Kurdish people and also to the attitude toward the Kurdish question of the governments of Turkey and Western states. A purpose of the measure was to explain the propositions of the appeal of Abdulla Odzhalan, general secretary of the Kurdistan Workers Party [RPK], to 35 states, in which the RPK leader states once again his readiness to renounce power methods. "We would welcome all initiatives aimed at a peaceful solution of the Kurdish problem and are prepared to embark on their discussion without any conditions whatever," the appeal says. It follows from that same document that the RPK does not insist on the obligatory dismemberment of Turkey and would discuss all proposals of the Turkish leadership concerning mutual compromise, including the possibility of a federal arrangement of Turkey. The participants in the news conference--Amarike Sardar, editor of the newspaper RYATAZA, the poet Karla Mad, and the scholar Sharafe Ashir--dwelt in detail on the position of their compatriots in Turkey and this state's policy in respect to the Kurdish people. The parliamentary elections in Turkey on 27 March were seen as a fraud. In the eastern provinces, in which the Kurds live, the elections were conducted under the pressure of a beefed-up contingent of the armed forces. A parliament formed under such conditions cannot be legitimate. The anger of Armenia's Kurdish community at the world community's reluctance to recognize the seriousness of the problem is intensified by the avowedly anti-Kurdish actions taken by the governments of certain European countries. The leadership of the FRG was subjected to particular criticism. The Ministry of Interior of Germany has banned the local Kurdish community from celebrating the Novruz national holiday. As a sign of protest, two young Kurdish women committed an act of self-immolation in the West German city of Mannheim. The questions put by the journalists concerned both the main topic of the news conference and the disagreements within the Kurdish community connected with the separatist sentiments of the Yezidi Kurds.
