How does this measure reflect on the lives of Ivorians in concrete terms? [Duncan] There are two levels of response to your question. First, when you owe, normally you must settle your debt. This debt will inevitably weigh on the use of your resources. However, since you have less to pay, you have fewer constraints on your resources, so you can use part of your resources to make new investments and even meet your everyday needs. This is the first aspect of my answer. In a more concrete way, this reduction of our debt will mean the cancellation of all the arrears Cote d'Ivoire owes to the French Development Fund, CFD. This is extremely important, because up until now we were not able to draw from this fund for the simple reason that we had not paid our arrears. We are now in a position to get disbursements from previous assistance. For example, the CFD used to give assistance to the Abidjan transport company [SOTRA] with government support. In recent times the disbursements were stopped because Cote d'Ivoire had accumulated arrears. Very soon we will be able to get a disbursement of about 4 billion francs. You are undoubtedly aware that SOTRA has some problems; there are not enough buses. The government had to resort to additional borrowing of about 90 billion francs to have 150 buses repaired. New buses are needed, and now we have funds. This is one concrete element. Another concrete result of this reduction of our debt on the lives of Ivorians will be in the textile sector. As you know, we reorganized the textile sector, which took us a lot of time. Long discussions took place between the government and the private sector for the partial privatization of the sector. The reorganization was to lead to the abolition of 800 out of 6,000 jobs. It was envisaged that after the sector had been revived reemployment would be conducted. All this necessitated about 11 billion francs from the CFD. The greater part of this amount has already been disbursed, and about 3.6 billion francs remain. Because of the state's arrears to the CFD, the remaining disbursement could not be made, so the reorganization program encountered problems. The situation was even more alarming because out of the remaining money 500 million francs was needed to resettle the laid off workers. [passage omitted] [Yao] Let's talk a bit about the sovereignty of our countries. One has the feeling that the devaluation was imposed on our heads of state without their being able to resist. Did this decision come from our leaders, or it was simply dictated to them by our partners? [Duncan] I am going to put things bluntly: The decision to change the exchange rate of the CFA franc was made by the heads of state and governments of the 14 African countries. If the heads of state did not want devaluation, they said so. Don't you remember the in July 1992 in Paris they said no to devaluation? Are you saying that when they say no, it is their own decision, but when they say yes, then it is no longer their decision? We must be logical. One can say "no" at a given time and say "yes" at another time if new elements allow for a change of opinion. [passage omitted] Among the international institutions, financial backers demanded conditionalities because they wanted to ensure that countries that come to them have the ability to repay their loans and have a good economic future, because it is economic situation of a country which enables it to generate resources to pay its external debt. [passage omitted] Let us get this straight: The decision is not an imposed one. We opted for devaluation because it appeared to us to be the only way out of our crisis. [Freedom Neruda, LA VOIE] Salaries have been frozen for 10 years now. It is obvious that the 5 to 10 percent salary increase is not enough. In Niger labor unionists have demanded a 70-percent salary increase. What does the government intend to do in order to have the crop purchase prices it has just set respected? Last year farmers were not protected enough against dubious purchasers. [Duncan] We admit that the 5 to 15 percent salary increase is not enough. You said that Niger workers have demanded 70 percent, but how much did they obtain? This is what you should know first. The reality is willy-nilly. We announced soon after we returned from Washington that we would call on the nation for more efforts, and this was not a lie. It is obvious that if you increase salaries by 70 percent and producer prices by 100 percent your devaluation will be to no avail. It is like beating the air. Let us understand each other well: Salary increases should be low, otherwise your devaluation is to no avail, which means that there is no effect, and you should start all anew. One cannot do that. These are measures taken once for all. Why is the increase in farmers' revenues more substantial? This is because they bore the brunt of the adjustment for a long time. You, wage earners, your salaries were frozen but not reduced. Elsewhere, salaries were cut, in addition to the devaluation. You cannot say that you were not defended enough. It is therefore important for political parties and labor unions to understand that salaries cannot be increased beyond a given level, otherwise the operation become worthless. Concerning the control of crop purchasing prices, we have set up an interministerial committee charged with monitoring the implementation of the various measures that we have just announced. Even before the devalution, the minister of agriculture took measures to this effect. They must now be reinforced and checked. In this sector and others, particular punitive measures will be taken against businessmen who do not respect the decisions made. In the past it was decided that farmers should participate in the commercialization of their produce. The guaranty funds will be increased substantially. Cooperative-oriented groups will therefore be given resources to play their role. [James Cenac, NOUVEL HORIZON] Mr. Prime Minister, gas delivered by the Ivorian Refinery Company costs 48 CFA francs. The state gets 243 CFA francs for this gas, while pump retailers get nine CFA francs on it. Now that sacrifices are needed, isn't it possible for the state to use its margin to freeze the price of gas sold at filling stations, especially since the price of the commidity is linked to the dollar, which has depreciated over the past few days, and as there is a subsidy system in the price structure? [Ducan] These are legitimate concerns which were much expected. You can imagine that these issues were examined, reexamined, and reviewed by the experts and the heads of state and government who made this decision. [passage omitted] First, concerning gas, this is a major question. I can see that our friend James Cenac, went through enough documents to give figures. Except for some minor details, his figures are reliable. The answer is relatively simple. For a country to be developed, it must benefit from projects, and to finance them, it needs money. Where does this money come from -- from taxpayers. Until further notice and before other types of measures are taken, this money will be taken from taxpayers. Actually, one of the means used to finance projects in Cote d'Ivoire is taxes on petroleum products, since a large part of these taxes go to the special investment and equipment budget to finance roads and the major projects in this country. This country's infrastructure was actually financed by these taxes. I worked in the Ministry of Finance, so I also have some figures. These taxes considerably contributed to financing projects in this country, particularly in the road sector. Of course, fewer taxes could have been raised by petroleum products. [Duncan] If this had been done, however, we would probably have not attained the development level we have today. That is the reality of it. Oil taxes -- and I will give you the figures -- amounted at the time to between 80 and 100 billion CFA francs per year. They were substantial gains indeed, and that is what enabled the state to carry out investments.... That is what enabled the Special Investment and Equipment Budget [BSIE] to be maintained at a relatively acceptable level in order to carry out normal maintenance, pay for recurrent expenditure, and make new investments despite the economic crisis. That is where the funds for all that came from. If you do not have that information, and I know you do, but since you asked the question for the benefit of the public, I would like you to know that these taxes were used to finance investments in our country. You are saying that we could have reduced taxes to lessen the burden on the population. When studies were conducted at the beginning, partners for development suggested a 35-percent price increase for fuel. You are always complaining that decisions made with the IMF, banks, and development partners take a long time, so we are incompetent. We could have agreed to a 35-percent or even a 40-percent price increase. What would your reaction have been if that had been the case? [passage omitted] The customs duty in Cote d'Ivoire is very high. It was increased as time went on to enable the state to earn revenue. It developed into a prohibitive customs duty and encouraged fraud. You are aware that for a few years now we have been trying to reduce customs duties. This has cost us a lot of money, but we are on the right track because the basic customs duties have been brought down to acceptable levels of around 35 percent. [passage omitted] [Lebry, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to ask you questions which are political and economic at the same time, since devaluation involves both aspects. The first question is this: You mentioned that representatives of the countries were truly unanimous in their decision during the summit. However, certain people expressed anxiety here and there, which seems to show that there was no true unanimity after all. What assurances do heads of state and prime ministers have that France will not abandon African countries? What assurances have African countries obtained or what promises have they received to confirm that this will not happen because they run the risk of being left in the lurch by France? The second question is: At the moment, France is continuing to guarantee the CFA franc's convertibility. I would like you to return to that issue. In the long run, in light of France's wish to get a firm footing in Europe and in light of the weakness of African economies, and especially with pressure from Americans, a situation may arise in which France may pull away from backing the CFA franc. How do leaders of African countries intend to prepare African economies for such an eventuality? [Duncan] As to whether the decision was unanimous, I can confirm that it was indeed unanimous. I am not the one making it up; you heard the communique. It was signed by all the heads of state and prime ministers who were in Dakar. That is what I am using as my reference. We insisted on everybody signing it. I have signed copies of the communique, which are proof of the fact that the decision was unanimous. France delivered a very strong message at the summit, and I think everybody heard what Minister Roussin said there as well as what he later said on his return to France. The message was: It is not just the presidency, it is not just the French Government, it is France which is backing African countries of the franc zone in this operation. It is not backing them just politically, it is backing them economically and financially. The measures which have been announced are along those lines. I have already mentioned debt reduction, and I will give you the figures soon. There will also be financial assistance for development. The French fund has received instructions on that, and the Finance Ministry has begun contacts to determine how France is going to assist Cote d'Ivoire in carrying out investment. This is not just empty talk; it is a political decision which has economic and financial repercussions. France has already assisted certain countries whose situation was particularly urgent with the payment of salaries. That decision was made right away. This goes to show that France is truly committed to assisting our countries. [passage omitted] Despite this commitment, before anything else, we must be responsible. In the first place, the future must depend on us and not on France. We must know this. We must first help ourselves, and France will help us later. Concerning the issue of the guarantee for and the convertibility of the CFA franc, I probably have to explain it further for better understanding. At the time of independence, the desire to create our national currencies was expressed in our countries. Since self-determination is regarded as one of the most significant signs of sovereignty, it was suggested that it was necessary to create our own currency and manage it all alone. The issue was raised at the level of the former French West Africa and the former French Equatorial Africa. Here, the states felt that it was better to remain in a monetary union. This led to the creation of the monetary union for the West African and the Central African zones. Together these states created their currency, the CFA franc, the management of which could have been made independently, because we were six or seven countries that came together. This means not being connected to any external currency. It is a political choice that we could have made. [passage omitted] Things went well from 1962 until 1980. [passage omitted] The crisis began in 1980, and the accounts which had surpluses began to diminish until they became negative. We had a surplus of between 100 and 200 billion. We later came to a deficit of 10, 20, 30, 100, and even 200 billion CFA francs at a certain time. The guarantee played a role in this case and the balance became positive again -- even if not very significantly -- at least by between 50 and 60 billion CFA francs in our zone. This was not quite sufficient, because it was necessary to go beyond the threshold of 20 percent. You see, assurance is a guarantee. Nobody is obliged to take to it, but at that time, you would be running a personal risk. We feel that at any given time, one can successfully run such a risk when one's economy is well seated and diversified. This is the future you are talking about. For what reason should we be attached to the European currency unit [ECU]? Look at the level of our trade with Europe. According to the statistics, we have between 60 to 70 percent trade with EEC countries. Why should we want to get attached to the ECU, which will be Europe's sole currency? Simply because, if we do so, we will become attached to the totality of the external partners. We can eventually do this without even asking for a guarantee from France. France can propose it, but what will this cost us? Will this help us? Let us build the future for our children. Let us not make then run useless risks by seeking to create another currency apart from the CFA franc. We need to be prudent in politics. We need to have guarantees and envisage all the possibilities. We are not less free than those countries which have their own currencies. We speak with the same voice in international meetings and we are even better respected when we speak. Look at the delegations which were coming to Cote d'Ivoire when the late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny was receiving people here. You will also see the number of heads of state and government who will come here during his funeral. We need to avoid too much susceptibility in politics. The economy must predominate. [passage omitted] [Roger Kouassi, FRATERNITE MATIN] Are we safe from further devaluation? With the devaluation, has the specter of retrenchment in the civil service been avoided forever? When prices are not displayed, can we really prevent abusive price increases? [Duncan] You are right. It could happen that there is further devaluation. Unfortunately, this is what happens to the national currencies of most African countries. This happens when the rates of devaluation do not correspond with the imbalance. If we had set a rate of 25 percent, there probably would have been another devaluation a year later. This is what surprised everybody, especially traders, who were expecting the devaluation but not at 50 percent. Provided that we are able to adopt the measures that I have mentioned concerning the control on the social demands (salaries) and provided that that we are able to respect the price increases, I am sure that we will succeed. The total subsidy granted to help maintain prices at the level they are now has reached 30 billion CFA francs. I say that there will not be any subsequent devaluations. Concerning retrenchment in the civil service, because of the devaluation, there will not be any retrenchment. I only spoke about voluntary retirement. If some people want to go on voluntary retirement from the civil service, we will help them do so by paying them 18 months' salary at the time of their departure. This is better than what has been achieved so far. Concerning the listing of prices, the minister of commerce and industry spoke on the subject in order to avoid panic. He was to have hosted a news conference on 13 January, but I asked him to wait for mine first. Beginning next week the various ministers can hold theirs. I asked that the public sector-private sector liaison group be activated so that these issues could be discussed. A commission will be set up on the issue of devaluation and hold consultations that could lead to practical solutions. It is also worth noting that some time ago a decision was made on the liberalization of prices, except for the prices of a certain number of regulated products. This explains that there was no price control because an important section has been liberalized in order to encourage competition. In the decisions reached, the authorized products which will be subjected to special control were indicated. The practical measures will be announced when the meeting takes place. Among other things, there will be measures indicating to the consumer the places and the telephone numbers where one can lodge complaints. These measures will be taken beginning next week, because the consumer is the real controller. We cannot put policemen in all the shops, but the consumer who notices any irregularity will be able to contact the ones who will be able to remedy the problem. [passage omitted] [Gustave Nguessan, REVEIL HEBDO] Couldn't the search for competitiveness in Cote d'Ivoire because of the devaluation be hindered by competitive devaluation that could be introduced by neighboring Anglophone countries (Ghana and Nigeria)? [Duncan] Due to the rate of devaluation, it is certain that we will be more competitive than these countries. Could there be a threat of a competitive devaluation? Let me remind you that the change in parity is managed by an international organization, namely the IMF, of which we are all members. The change in parity obeys some precise rules. The countries to which you refer are compelled to abide by these rules. The IMF will always have its say, which will help prevent competitive devaluations. [Raymond Djadou, Bank Workers' Trade Union] I am Raymond Djadou, secretary general of the Bank and Financial Institutions Workers' Union of Cote d'Ivoire. Mr. Prime Minister, you mentioned an increase in salary in the public sector. Is the private sector concerned by this measure? [Duncan] The workers' minimum salary and the agricultural workers' minimum salary are a guideline, but it is also true this is not the objective, because the private sector is regulated by collective agreements. The case in point here is that the state gives directives and will later initiate discussions. On the other hand, the Employers' Association and others expressed the wish to meet us, so decisions will be made. [Patrice Douh, IVOIR'SOIR] I would like to ask a two-fold question. On 19 and 20 April 1993, a seminar was held in Abidjan on the harmonization of corporate law in franc zone countries. While African states were studying reports that were submitted to them, the decision to devaluate the CFA franc fell on their heads like a sword. Won't this hasty decision to devaluate the CFA franc be a source of blockage at the exchange level between West African countries? My second question is to know the level, in terms of quantity, of the exchange volume in the West AFrican zone and in which proportion, taking into account the devaluation, exports will increase in this zone? [Duncan] You just said that there was an April meeting in Abidjan on corporate law and that there has been a certain lack of preparedness in terms of devaluation that could jeopardize cooperation. First, I would like to say that there was no lack of preparedness. Just because governments did not talk about the devaluation in the streets does not mean that they did not study the question. I can assure you that no politician announces devaluation beforehand. I do not know of a single one who would do this. It is an operation that is carried out under the cover of night and generally while markets are closed and on weekends; then it is over. Therefore, there is no need to shout that we are going to devaluate. This operation was well planned and thoroughly examined before a decision was made. I will tell you that this decision will strengthen cooperation within the zone and the cooperation with France. All commitments made here in Abidjan as related to the cooperation between African countries will continue as far as rights are concerned at the social security level and corporate law. You will see that all these documents will be swiftly examined and signed in the shortest possible time. [passage omitted] [Goore-Bi-Hue, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, you stated that devaluation will make households consume Ivorian-made goods. What measures will you take to ensure that households effectively consume quality goods, to ensure, for example, that locally manufactured rubber shoes last much longer and that Ivorian-made cloth does not rip after washing for a second or third time? [Duncan] You are right in pointing this out. I think this must be the concern of all Ivorian industrialists. They should ensure that their goods are of good quality. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with the private sector, has established the Ivorian Standards Board to ensure that goods manufactured in Cote d'Ivoire meet Ivorian standards. We must ensure that the goods leaving this country meet international standards as far as quality is concerned. I think competition, which is now more open, will make buyers reject goods that are of low quality. As I told you, once this measure is taken, more industrialists will come back to Cote d'Ivoire.... [Ballo Lancine, Radio Cote d'Ivoire] Mr. Prime Minister, you spoke about 650 billion CFA francs that will be disbursed. Who will disburse this amount --the IMF, the World Bank, France? Is this another burden that is coming to put more weight upon the external debt? [Duncan] The 650 billion CFA francs will mainly come from the IMF, of course. This money will come from major contributors, from development partners, from Japan, and so on. Some of them have already announced their commitment. You are asking whether this is going to put more weight on the Ivorian debt. Of course, these are elements of debts. What I can tell you at this stage is that these elements are at very consessional rates. As a result of this operation, Cote d'Ivoire becomes an International Development Association member country, that is, a country that can benefit from assistance at concessional rates from the World Bank. Thus, we can now receive more loans at extremely low rates like 0.5 percent repayable over lengthy periods, say 40 years. That is it. We will thus have the means for development. As this is the last question, I would like to conclude this news conference by saying that we have made difficult decisions. This is a new start. This is a term used by a number of heads of state who spoke at the Dakar meeting. The statement issued by the president of the Republic pointed this out. Cote d'Ivoire and all its components -- farmers, civil servants, the business community, housewives -- must all feel involved in this decision. They should not see only its negative aspects, but rather the positive aspects that will enable Cote d'Ivoire to get out of the present rut in the near future. In summation, we are saying that Cote d'Ivoire must improve its competitiveness. Public finances must be improved, giving more means to the state. The possibility of developing businesses in Cote d'Ivoire must be improved, both at the level of national businessmen as well as foreign businessmen. The return of private capital that might have been placed abroad, if such does exist, will be made easier. It is essential that Cote d'Ivoire play its important card. We have some assets and we must ensure that they are well exploited. I have been asked in particular to tell you that the government and the president of the Republic are confident in the future, and that the president of the Republic and the government will work tirelessly so that we regain our growth rate within a reasonable period. This growth rate must reach and later exceed the 3.5 percent population growth rate. We must reach a 5.6 percent growth rate every month. We can achieve that within the coming two or three years. This is a message of hope. I think that Cote d'Ivoire has the human and material potential to attain this goal. Thank you.
