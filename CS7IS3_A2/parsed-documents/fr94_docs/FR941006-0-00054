FR941006-0-00054 FR941006-0-00012 (7) Mark FOUO material sent to authorized persons outside the DoD with an explanation typed or stamped on the document: This document contains information EXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE UNDER THE FOIA. Exemption(s) . . . . . . applies (apply). (Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of (enter OPR)). (b) DoD components, officials of DoD components, and authorized DoD contractors, consultants, and grantees send FOUO information to each other to conduct official DoD business. Tell recipients the status of such information, and send the material in a way that prevents unauthorized public disclosure. Make sure documents that transmit FOUO material call attention to any FOUO attachments. Normally, you may send FOUO records over facsimile equipment. To prevent unauthorized disclosure, consider attaching special cover sheets (i.e., AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet, for Privacy Act information), the location of sending and receiving machines, and whether authorized personnel are around to receive FOUO information. FOUO information may be passed to officials in other departments and agencies of the executive and judicial branches to fulfill a government function. Mark the records ``For Official Use Only,'' and tell the recipient the information is exempt from public disclosure under the FOIA and whether it needs special handling. If the records are subject to the PA, refer to Part 806b of this chapter for PA disclosure policies. (c) AFI 90&hyph;401, Air Force Relations With Congress (formerly AFR 11&hyph;7), governs the release of FOUO information to members of the Congress and AFI 65&hyph;401, Air Force Relations With the General Accounting Office (formerly AFR 11&hyph;8), governs its release to the General Accounting Office (GAO). Review records before releasing to see if the information warrants FOUO status. If not, remove FOUO markings. If the material still warrants FOUO status, mark the records FOUO and explain the appropriate exemption and marking to the recipient. (d) When you use the US Postal Service, package records with FOUO information so their contents are safe. If FOUO information is not combined with classified information, individuals may send FOUO information by First Class Mail or Parcel Post. Bulky shipments, such as FOUO directives or testing materials, that qualify under postal regulations may be sent by Fourth Class Mail. (e) Mark each part of a message that contains FOUO information. Unclassified messages containing FOUO information must show the abbreviation ``FOUO'' before the text begins. (f) To safeguard FOUO records during normal duty hours, place them in an out-of-sight location if people who do not work for the government come into the work area. After normal duty hours, store FOUO records to prevent unauthorized access. File them with other unclassified records in unlocked files or desks, etc., if the Government or a Government contractor provides normal internal building security. When there is no internal security, locked buildings or rooms usually provide adequate after-hours protection. For additional protection, store FOUO material in locked containers such as file cabinets, desks, or bookcases. (g) When a record is no longer FOUO, remove the markings or indicate on the document the markings no longer apply. Try to tell everyone who has the records that their status has changed. (h) Destroy FOUO materials by tearing them up so no one can put them back together and throwing them into trash containers. When the information needs more protection, local authorities may use other methods. However, balance the expense of extra protection against the degree of sensitivity of the FOUO information in the records. You may recycle FOUO material. Safeguard the FOUO documents or information until recycling to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Recycling contracts must include agreements on how to protect and destroy FOUO and PA materials. (i) Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO records is not an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Air Force personnel must act to protect FOUO records under their control from unauthorized disclosure. When unauthorized persons gain access to these records, administrators find out who is responsible and take disciplinary action where appropriate. Unauthorized disclosure of FOUO information containing PA information may also result in civil or criminal sanctions against individuals or the Air Force. Tell the originating organization when its records are improperly disclosed.
