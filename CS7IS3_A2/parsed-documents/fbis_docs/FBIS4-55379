The reform will reduce their number to 230,000 by 1995 and to 200,000 by the end of the year 2000, Lieutenant-General Dumitru Cioflina, defence secretary of state and chief of the Army's General Staff, told a news conference today. The reform will also mean a higher level of professionalisation of its military who by 2000 will be permanent and highly trained in a proportion of 50 percent. The chief of the general staff gave a number of details as to the reform. This is to be carried out by restructuring its bodies in two phases: one ended in 1993, the latter will last until 2000. The reform and restructuring includes the reduction of armament in compliance with Romania's international commitments: tanks from 2,850 to 1,375 in 1995, 100 mm and more artillery pieces from 3,780 to 1,475, armoured cars from 3,100 to 2,100, fighter planes from 505 to 430. Attack helicopters are planned to grow in number from 13 as of now to 120. General Cioflina revealed plans to set up a 100,000 strong protection corps formed of territorial forces (similar to the former civic guards), which will add up to the national defence system consisting of regular army, gendarmes, police, frontier guards and fire fighter corps. According to the Romanian senior military official, the Army's budget is 75 percent of minimal requirements, and it covers the purchase of new armament, the maintenance of the old one, the entire wage and outfit expenses. General Cioflina mentioned descentralisation as one of the effects of the reform, with responsibilities relegated from minister to the staffs of the three armies and to the general staff. This includes the creation of an intervention force formed of armoured car brigades, three paratroopers brigades, tank and artillery divisions. The reform and the restructuring, Secretary of State General Cioflina admitted, caused some apprehension among military who fear that they might be either put on the reserve or reassigned to other garrisons. Among other tasks devolving upon the Army General Cioflina mentioned its duty "to defend the democratic order," a constitutional provision to be found in other constitutions as well, with the difference that, as concerns the Romanian Constitution, specifications must be made as to the moment and mode of intervention. To complement this, two laws are being drafted at present: the law of the state of siege, and the law of the state of emergency, meant to clarify an issue that has caused so much heated debate starting with the intervention of the Army in December 1989.
