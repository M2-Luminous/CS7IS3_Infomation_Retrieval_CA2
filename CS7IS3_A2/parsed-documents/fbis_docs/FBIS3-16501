Moldovan President Mircea Snegur signed the appropriate agreement in NATO headquarters in Brussels on Wednesday. Speaking at the signing ceremony, the Moldovan leader said that the Partnership for Peace programme would certainly help strengthen national security and territorial integrity of his country. Snegur said he was ready to begin working out proposals to conclude a bilateral partnership agreement which would define the character and the extent of Moldovan cooperation with NATO. Snegur also said the mechanism of consultations with NATO envisaged by the "Partnership for Peace" is very important for any country whose territorial integrity, political independence, and security are threatened. The Moldovan president reiterated that the 14th Russian Army deployed on moldovan territory plays the main stumbling effect for the political settlement of the conflict between Moldova and its eastern Dniester province. According to Snegur, negotiations should be held on the terms of troops withdrawal. He expressed confidence that the new Moldovan parliament would adopt a law granting the Dniester province a special legal status to help the withdrawal of the 14th Russian Army. NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said that NATO favours a prompt and complete withdrawal of foreign troops from Moldova. He also emphasised that in the proposed partnership scheme, the North Atlantic alliance does not want to exclude or isolate any country. NATO expects Russia to join the "Partnership for Peace" programme, Woerner stressed. The participation of all invited countries will play an important role in implementing our efforts to build a new Europe, he said. Today, Moldova, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Estonia, Hungary, Ukraine, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Czech Republic have joined the "Partnership for Peace" programme. Many leaders of these countries consider joining this programme as the first step towards full membership in NATO. Russia has expressed its support for the programme, estimating it as a mechanism of strengthening security of coopration in Europe.
