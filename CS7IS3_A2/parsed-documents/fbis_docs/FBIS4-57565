The diplomat met with congressmen. After the meeting, he again directly threatened Argentina with trade sanctions because Congress is delaying the debate of the bill. Thus, Cheek formulated three similar warnings in less than 24 hours in what appears to be a clear offensive to get the bill approved before the last day of June. [passage omitted] Radical Civic Union Ernesto Algaba told journalists accredited to Congress that the deputies will not accept "any pressure or threat from the United States." Algaba once again conditioned any debate to an agreement within the terms agreed during the GATT round of talks. He believes this agreement could be ready within 90 days for approval by Congress, and if this were to be fulfilled, "our bloc is willing to debate the patents law, which we oppose in its current version." The meeting was informal because it was held at the office of Santa Fe Province Deputy Horacio Usandizaga and not at the Health Committee offices. [passage omitted] Radical congressmen Algaba said the proposed goals "are difficult to achieve." Deputy Alejandro Armendriz added: "Congressional schedules must be respected, without any external pressure, so we can improve the law pertaining to this important matter." Despite all these assertions, Ambassador Cheek left his first meeting with the Radical congressmen in a very happy mood.
