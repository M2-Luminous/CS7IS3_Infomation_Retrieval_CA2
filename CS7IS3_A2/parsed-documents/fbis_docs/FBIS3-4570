FBIS3-4570 "dreas039_a_94026" FBIS-EAS-94-039 Document Type:Daily Report 28 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Controversy Surrounding Reshuffle Issue Noted SDPJ Secretary Kubo Interviewed OW2702111294 OW2702111294 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network in Japanese at 0045 GMT on 20 February in its "Discussion" program carries a 15-minute live interview with Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] General Secretary Wataru Kubo on the cabinet reshuffle being planned by Prime Minister Hosokawa. Interviewers are NHK commentator Takashi Yamamoto and Tokyo University professor Takeshi Sasaki. Asked about the SDPJ's position on Prime Minister Hosokawa-proposed cabinet reshuffle, Kubo says: "We believe the cabinet reshuffle should not be carried out if it weakens the centripetal force of the ruling parties. Therefore, it would be best not to reshuffle the cabinet during the current, crucial period in which the Diet is being held." He adds: "I know the prime minister has the arbitrary power to reshuffle the cabinet. However, as we are a coalition government, he should get the full understanding of the coalition partners. As members of the coalition government, we are seriously concerned about the possibility the cabinet reshuffle will produce negative results." Citing rumors the purpose of the cabinet reshuffle is to replace Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, Yamamoto asks for Kubo's view. Kubo says: "If a cabinet reshuffle is done simply to change certain ministers, it should not be termed a cabinet reshuffle." He adds: "I do not think the cabinet should be reshuffled if the purpose is just to remove certain ministers, and it is not a good idea to carry out a reshuffle at present because Diet deliberations on the supplementary budget are about to begin." He says any reshuffle should be carried out after the immediate political issues have been solved. Kubo is asked about current relations between Prime Minister Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura. He says their relations are not as bad as reported. He says: "We cannot do anything about it if the prime minister decides to reshuffle the cabinet because it is needed to keep the ruling parties united, or if he believes that unless there is a reshuffle, it will be difficult to deal with the current ordinary Diet session and the many important political issues." He is asked how the party will respond when its chairman, Murayama, is asked by the prime minister to join the cabinet as minister in charge of political reform in place of minister Yamahana, who is an SDPJ member? Kubo says: "It's up to the chairman." Yamamoto takes up the issue of political realignment and asks if the SDPJ has agreed with Sakigake and the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] to create a new political force. Kubo denies this, saying there is no behind-the-scenes agreement. He also asks Kubo about the next general election, which will be held under the new electoral system. Kubo says: "I think the ruling parties have to cooperate with each other as much as possible in the election. There is a feeling that the ruling parties should be unified into one party to win the election. I do not think it is right." He says he feels it is impossible for the ruling parties to become one because of their differences in political ideals. He suggests, though, that Japan may enter an era in which politicians are divided into new conservatives and new reformists. He is asked if it is inevitable that the SDPJ will split in the process of promoting realignment in the political world. Kubo says it is impossible to get along with party members who are negative about being part of the coalition government. At 0115 GMT the interview ends.
