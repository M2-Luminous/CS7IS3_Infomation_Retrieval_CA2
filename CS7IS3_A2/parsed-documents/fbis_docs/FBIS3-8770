Jeszenszky is unofficially in Serbia's northern Vojvodina province since Saturday to attend ceremonies marking the 100th anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth, organized by the Democratic Community of Vojvodina Hungarians (DZVM), the national party of the Hungarian minority. "Relations between Hungary and Yugoslavia should not remain at their current level," Jeszenszky told journalists after the talks in Novi Sad. "I hope very much that the inernational community's efforts will result in a peace in the former Yugoslavia and that all people who live here will overcome a difficult period," the Hungarian diplomat said. Bulajic also expressed hope that the two countries' bilateral relations would soon attain a higher level and, with this in mind, he officially invited the Hungarian president and prime minister to visit Yugoslavia soon. Jeszenszky also attended a commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the death of Lajos Kossuth held in the Vojvodina village of Novi Itebej, close to the Hungarian Border. The Hungarian foreign minister told the manifestation that it is always better to compromise in conflicting situations than to try to reach solutions by force, and expressed regret that evil and destruction imposed by others are still present in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Recalling the historic role of Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian revolution of 1848, Jeszenszky said that this was the period when the Hungarians, Serbs, Croats and other nationalities became aware that they have to live together in the Carpathian basin. The only way for their coexistence is tolerance and readiness to make concessions, because in a possible armed conflict all sides would be losers, Jeszenszky said. The Hungarian press anounced that after Vojvodina, Jeszenszky would leave for Zagreb and Sarajevo.
