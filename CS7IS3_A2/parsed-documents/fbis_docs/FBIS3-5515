The bills, still subject to Diet approval, call for a 1.7 trillion yen reduction in residential tax, while also allowing local governments to issue debt-financing bonds to pay for the local tax cut. Leaders of the ruling coalition agreed last month to cut income taxes for one year as part of the latest recession-fighting package designed to stimulate the sluggish economy.
