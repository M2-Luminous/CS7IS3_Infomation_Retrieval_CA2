After months of frantic argument and compromise among the world's largest industrial powers, the signing of the GATT Final Act is expected to usher in the broadest program ever for reforming trade and tuning up international markets. Czech political leaders, as a result, are predicting increased import-export business at home and claiming small victories for the Czech domestic marketplace. "I'm convinced that GATT is not only important for big exporters like the U.S. and Japan, but also for transitional countries like the Czech Republic," said Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy at an April 22 press conference, one week after signing the document in Marrakesh, Morocco. With expanded export possibilities, Dlouhy said, the country's economy is poised to begin real improvement, after years of falling production levels and sluggish growth during its transformation from a planned economy to a free market. Demand on the Czech domestic market alone, with only 10 million consumers, "will never be enough to allow for growth," Dlouhy said. For Czech political and business leaders, economic liberalization has long been a rallying cry at home and abroad, and nowhere more so than in the government halls of foreign countries whose markets seemed a tad too tightly managed for Czech tastes. One of the biggest gains for Czech producers may well be increased access to West European markets. The Czech Republic has been quietly booming on the European Union (EU) market, the world's largest trading area. With its heavy industrial background and low labor costs, the Czech Republic has become a serious competitor in many areas. During much of GATT's long negotiating process, protectionist policies in the EU were one of the thorniest obstacles. Especially in agriculture, textiles and steel--three markets in which Czechs are strong--domestic farm subsidies and foreign import quotas made access, especially for the newly emerging economies of Central and Eastern Europe, difficult to obtain. "Those are the areas where the EU protects its markets," said Kamil Cermak, a press spokesman for Dlouhy. Such barriers have in the past attracted criticism from many, including GATT General Director Peter Sutherland, for leaving the post-Communist countries out in the cold. "Many of these new democracies are fragile politically and economically. Their leaders have often acted with great courage in their policies of economic liberalization. What these countries need is full assimilation into the multilateral trading system, not rejection by the most successful beneficiaries of that system," Sutherland wrote in late 1993 for the WALL STREET JOURNAL. The Uruguay Final Act will cut subsidies, quotas and tariffs significantly, ostensibly giving Czech products a leg up. In addition, the Czechs have continued to negotiate with the EU headquarters in Brussels, which has imposed quotas on Czech goods in many areas. "There are improvements [already], because there is a lot of communication between Brussels and Prague, but GATT will help this," Cermak said. Czech trade with the EU has soared over the last four years, jumping by 169 percent despite the EU's restrictions. "In general, Czech trade has exploded," said Gerhard Sabathil, first secretary of the European Commission's permanent delegation to the Czech Republic. "The Czech Republic is the only Central European country to have a trade surplus with the EU." Also, with the implementation of GATT, Sabathil said, EU officials may modify the so-called "European Agreements," which form the basis of economic relations between Central and Eastern European countries and the EU. If, for instance, GATT dictates lowering a specific tariff, the agreements may be adapted to remain in harmony with the new levels prescribed by GATT, Sabathil said. GATT "definitely stands to benefit us," said Milan Tomanek, press spokesman for the Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka (CSOB), which handles half of the country's export business. "The field where we feel we are specifically strong, traditionally strong, is the area of international trade." For instance, Tomanek said, CSOB has already run up against the caps on steel exports to the EU. "The steel companies in the north of Moravia are clients of the bank, so we have seen a tremendous drop there," he said. As the numbers break down, GATT will lower tariffs in developed countries by an average of 38 percent and leave approximately 40 percent of imports tariff-free. The 124 members of GATT also agreed the world's major trading powers, such as the EU, Japan, the U.S. and Canada, would gradually eliminate tariffs on pharmaceuticals, construction equipment, medical equipment, steel, furniture, agricultural machinery, wood, paper, toys, beer and liquor. Also, quotas, which have been a thorn in the side of free traders, will be lifted on textile products and clothing over the next 10 years. In addition, domestic subsidies for agricultural products will drop by an average of 20 percent over the next six years, while export subsidies will drop by 36 percent. To make the transformation complete, all non-tariff barriers, such as quotas, will be transformed into the form of tariffs, which will then be lowered on average by 36 percent. In the Czech government's report on the Final Act, Dlouhy and Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec wrote that the Czech side came out ahead in the final results. For instance, they wrote, the Czechs will lower tariffs on industrial goods entering the domestic market. Reduction for GATT member-states is one-third. After fully implementing this reduction, the average incidence of tariffs (i.e., the percentage of goods on which tariffs are levied) on the Czech industrial goods market, which is already relatively open to exports from abroad, will be roughly 3.8 percent, a figure that "approaches the rates of the EU," Dlouhy's report says. Czech firms also stand to gain considerable market access as a result of the Final Act, as the developed market economies will either "completely eliminate tariffs on industrial products or reduce them to a very low level," the report says. At home, however, Czech producers will not see such stiff reductions, says the report; since protectionism abroad and particularly in Western Europe has been disadvantageous to the Czech Republic in the past, it will not have to subject its businesses to outside competition as quickly. "Through this approach, it has balanced out the various levels of market protection through tariffs, which had been up to now unfavorable for the Czech Republic in comparison with countries [with developed market economies] as a whole," the report claims. Although in sensitive sectors such as steel exports, one of the Czech Republic's real powerhouses, GATT often either spreads out reductions in EU tariffs over long periods of time or lowers them less than Czech firms might want, the Czech side will still not have to reciprocate. But Dlouhy and Zieleniec also predict that, especially in the textile and clothing markets, where domestic subsidies will drop by 20 percent and export subsidies by 36 percent, Czech producers will have to take some bad with the good. Says the Czech government report: "In addition to new possibilities for access to markets of other countries, however, Czech producers must count on stiffer competition on foreign and domestic markets from developing countries whose exports to the markets of developed countries have been strongly restricted." Currently, however, the Czech Republic does not have an extremely liberal import regime, the report says, which ought to lessen the impact of tariff reductions. Also, the reductions here will be spread over 10 years to give domestic producers a chance to adjust, whereas reductions elsewhere will take effect much more quickly. The final victory for developing economies like the Czech Republic's, where costs for labor and outlays for social welfare remain low, was in persuading GATT members not to concentrate on "social dumping" clauses in the final agreement, said the Ministry of Industry and Trade's Cermak. "Some West European countries and the United States want to talk about social conditions and labor standards," he said, "and that's uncomfortable for us, because that can become another form of protectionism." GATT feared that the more developed economic players, like the U.S. or the EU, might insist that Czech producers were engaging in "social dumping"--in other words, keeping pay rates down at home in order to dump their goods on other markets cheaply. "Other countries could use antidumping [measures] because our wages are very low," said Cermak. But, he added, "That's our biggest comparative advantage."
