FBIS4-1963 "drchi065_k_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political & Social Activist Zhai Weimin Released From 3-Week Detention Activist Zhai Weimin Released From 3-Week Detention HK0504044494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 5 Apr 94 p 5 HK0504044494 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Bruce Gilley] [Text] Chinese authorities released a pro-democracy activist, Zhai Weimin, from detention in western Henan province last Tuesday [29 March], but are not allowing him to return to Beijing. Instead, Zhai's normal political rights, which were to have been restored on September 13, a year after his release from prison, have been suspended for a further 94 days and he has been told by public security officers that he will not be allowed to leave the province until the end of the year, sources said yesterday. Zhai is staying with his parents in Xinan county, about three kilometres from the Yeshugou jail where he was detained after being sent back to the province in a special train carriage under police' escort on March 7. Zhai plans to sue the provincial public security bureau over the 21-day detention, which he was told was due to his participation in unspecified "illegal activities". Zhai, who completed a three-and-a-half year sentence for "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement" last September, was picked up by Beijing police in the city's university area on March 6. While in Yeshugou prison, Zhai was fed only steamed bread and corn meal. He emerged from the three-week detention pale and thin, his family said. "He is irritable and has a bad temper because he says the authorities had no justification to lock him up like that," one source said. Zhai has asked local officials to arrange a job for him in a nearby high-technology economic zone so he does not become bored at home. Zhai, 23, was number six on the "list of most-wanted students" after the 1989 Tiananmen Square movement.
