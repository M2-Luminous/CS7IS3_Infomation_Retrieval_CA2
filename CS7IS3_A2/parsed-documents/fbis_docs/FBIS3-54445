In his preliminary reaction to the nonpapers, the foreign secretary, Shaharyar M. Khan, told newsmen in Islamabad today we feel Indian policy is to talk on relatively less important issues to show the world that it is engaged in negotiations so that pressure of the public opinion and the governments is deflected from the core issue. He said none of these nonpapers really goes to the depth of the core issue. However, he said, we will consider these nonpapers very carefully and with the seriousness they deserved. About the contents of these nonpapers, he said the first one related to Line of Control, suggesting to make it line of peace and tranquility. This proposal, he said, virtually asked Pakistan to accept status quo at the Line of Control. We have already indicated that it is not acceptable to Pakistan. The foreign secretary said the Indians did not refer to the question of repression which, in our opinion, is the real reason for tension in occupied Kashmir. He said in the fifth nonpaper on confidence-building measures, India has referred to peripheral issues, whereas we want to engage with India on important issues like nuclear proliferation -- regional or global, control of mass destruction weapons, control of ballistic missiles which India has been indigenously manufacturing, and our proposal for a regional nuclear nonproliferation regime in South Asia.
