Committee President Raymundo del Toro says the meeting is an opportunity to support the act of free trade with Cuba, sponsored by New York Representative Charles Rangel. Del Toro says it is time for the Clinton administration to change U.S. policy toward Cuba now that the United States has ratified the most-favored-nation status for the PRC and lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam. The Cuban-American Committee for Peace president says Clinton is associating himself with the reactionary minority of the Cuban emigre community, which has made maintaining the economic blockade against Cuba a lucrative business. Del Toro also predicted that Clinton will, once again, lose the 1996 elections in Florida if he maintains ties with that minority group of the Cuban emigre community.
