For the last month or so, it has been blocking the bank accounts of the Libyan Embassy in Brussels. It is said to be the only country with such a strict application of Security Council Resolution 883 of 11 November on blocking Libyan assets. "Such a measure has not been taken by Italy, Germany, nor even France and the United States (against the Libyan mission to the United Nations in New York), two countries which are directly involved," Libyan Ambassador Muhammad Sharaf al-Fayturi said. He said the measure infringed on the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. Blocking the embassy's accounts is causing a considerable nuisance. To prevent electricity from being cut off, the accounts are being paid in cash. The ambassador and the other staff of the Libyan People's Bureau have not been affected personally. Their accounts have been left untouched. The measure is a consequence of the sanctions imposed by the Security Council on Libya in connection with the so-called Lockerbie affair. This involved a bomb on a PanAm plane which exploded in 1988 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie, resulting in 270 deaths. The United States and United Kingdom believe that two Libyans are the perpetrators and are demanding their extradition. [passage omitted]
