The article said that "all the classical attributes of a fascist party, ideology and personality perfectly apply to Zhirinovskiy and his party." The Liberal Democratic Party's appeal to Izvestiya, handed to Interfax, says that instead of initiating a direct dialogue between political opponents, Izvestiya was playing into the hands of politicians of the same bias, publishing articles discrediting the Liberal Democratic Party one after another. The letter says that the Liberal Democratic Party leaders, "considered their duty to inform its electors of their attitude to Gaydar's dirty article through any other Russian newspaper which will not be afraid to give space to the party which won the election on December 12, 1993."
