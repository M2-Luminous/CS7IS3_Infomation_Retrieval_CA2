But it has been learned that the original plans envisaged debates on such important questions as the State Duma's draft declaration on succession and draft laws on amendments to the Criminal Code and on an amnesty. Commenting at the editorial office's request on this marked difference between the original plans and the final version of the agenda, M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma, reported, in particular, that the draft declaration on succession prepared by V. Isakov, chief of the Duma's Legislation Committee, was not recommended for consideration as a result of two Duma Council sessions because, in the opinion of most council members, it was quite clearly aimed at a confrontation between the Duma and the president and had all the prerequisites for dragging legislators into a lengthy process of discussing the president's edicts issued from 21 September through 24 December last year. Mityukov believes that Isakov's main aim was, in camouflaged terms and in a competently compiled legal document, to throw doubt on the president's norm-creating activity. Neither could the factions reach agreement on the draft law on amendments to the Criminal Code. This sounds paradoxical, because in their election programs practically all parties, associations, and deputies promised to fight crime ruthlessly. But the proposals made by the "Russia's Choice" faction -- which envisage, in particular, the standardization of responsibility for crimes against property (the concept of "socialist ownership" is excluded here), increased punishments for terrorism and organized crime, and the extension of citizen's rights to necessary self-defense -- did not meet with support from the bloc of communists, agrarians, and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. It is worth noting that this draft law was adopted by the former Russian Supreme Soviet in its first reading without any problems. Neither was it possible to submit the draft law on an amnesty for discussion. The formal reason for this was the lack of an official letter from the president on submitting the draft law to the State Duma. But the main reason for postponing consideration was once again the position of certain factions which, according to Mityukov, "tried to play the amnesty card for their political purposes and which want, on top of 20,000 convicted invalids, pensioners, women, and war veterans, to pluck the participants in the October events out of Lefortovo." Consequently the agenda turned out to be a rather tame one which did not promise any furors. Possibly wanting to capitalize on the polemical potential that accumulated during the week, most State Duma members decided to supplement the agenda with the favorite question of all Soviet deputies -- "On Mass Media Coverage of the State Duma's Activity."
