Doubts about whether we will remain in the Russian ruble zone or whether we will adopt the Armenian dram have been finally settled. The Council of Ministers decided to put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert. Karen Nersisian, head of the finance and credit department of the council of ministers of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, answered the question of HAYLUR correspondent Shushanik Abrahamian. [HAYLUR] Mr Nersisian, a decision has already been made to put the Armenian dram into circulation in Stepanakert. [Nersisian] The exchange of currency will take place in Stepanakert in the same way it will proceed in Armenia. [HAYLUR] Have any preparatory steps been taken, because the people of Artsakh were in chaos in the preceding days? [Nersisian] Yes, we have also created exchange boards. There is also a central board which is headed by Minister of Finance Spartak Tevosian. All the money safes have been sealed so that there will be no circulation of the old currency. A special commission has been sent to customs inspection points so that there will be no flow of old currency from the outside. The corporations and enterprises of the republic have been given instructions to create their own appropriate boards. [HAYLUR] You said that the exchange of currency will proceed in the same way as it will in Armenia, that is, 1 dram will be exchanged for 200 rubles. There are no collective farms in Armenia. How will the workers of collective farms [in Karabakh] be paid for their labor? [Nersisian] There are many special cases which have been taken into account. Eventually everything will come out fine. [HAYLUR] What about the case of people who are serving in the army or on the front? [Nersisian] The army also has its exchange board which will take care of everything. I think that everything in our republic will proceed smoothly without any unnecessary confusion.
