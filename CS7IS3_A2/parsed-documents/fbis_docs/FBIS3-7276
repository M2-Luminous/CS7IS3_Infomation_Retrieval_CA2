His speech concentrated on the past, present and future of relations between the two neighbors. Led by the speaker of the Lower House, Masako Doi, Kim and his wife, Son Myong-sun, entered the Diet hall to a standing ovation. He responded with gentle waves. During his 20-minute speech, Kim was interrupted by applause 14 times. Many Japanese lawmakers nodded with approval when the South Korean president emphasized that his country and Japan will have to work together for peace and prosperity in the Asia and Pacific region. Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa sat in his assigned seat in the Lower House while Doi and other parliamentary leaders sat on the right side of the podium and members of Kim's entourage, on the left. Kim waved from the podium when all members of parliament stood up and applauded at the end of his speech. Prior to his speech, Doi told the president that "Korea was the first country in the world to invent metal printing type and Japan has learned a great deal of cultural traditions from Korea." "Japan's extreme action once created tension between our two countries but by looking at our past correctly and reflecting on it, we have to restore mutual trust," she said. After giving his speech, Kim chatted briefly with Doi and the president of the Upper House of the Diet. "President Kim's gait is very strong and full of vitality," Doi told the Korean visitor. "We all listened to your speech in an exciting atmosphere," she added. Later, Doi led Kim to the upper house president's chamber where they met with more than 70 Japanese parliamentary leaders and representatives of political parties. Welcoming Kim "whole-heartedly," Doi proposed a champagne toast, and Kim responded that he was happy and honored to have delivered a speech at one of the most well-known landmarks in Asia. South Korean-Japanese relations have experienced difficulties because of an overemphasis on the past, Kim said. "(but) let us work together to open a new era of Korea-Japan relations," he said.
