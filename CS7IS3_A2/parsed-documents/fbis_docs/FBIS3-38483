Rehn says that such openness would also apply to relations with Russia, so that it will not interfere in internal Finnish affairs. "I would build very well-operating ties with Russia." Labeled an extreme right-wing conservative, Rehn sees herself as adjusting well to liberal debate, "although sometimes I can be rather extremist." [Astikainen] In the first round you did poorly in Paltamo. Also, how could a middle-aged Paltamo farmer find reason to vote in the second round for Swedish People's Party's Elisabeth Rehn? [Rehn] He is now going to have to ponder whether he is in more agreement with the things I think about and that I am enthusiastic about than those issues Ahtisaari represents. He has to make his choice on this. It's not just a matter of feeling enthusiastic about supporting me, but rather it is necessary to look at the alternative and see who is most suitable. [Astikainen] Where is Martti Ahtisaari better than you? [Rehn] He has strong experience as a Foreign Ministry and international organization official, also with UN administration experience. Of course I have none at all in these. [Astikainen] Within the Swedish People's Party you are considered belonging to the moderate conservative wing. How does this differ from the party's centrist wing? [Rehn] My conservatism is [to be understood as supporting] business, privatization, the right of individual ownership and generally of ownership, strong patriotism, and national defense. These things made up my conservativeness when I came into parliament. But already at that time I was a strong upholder of human rights and cared about helping those less well off; I had a global perspective and realized that not everyone was doing equally well. For this reason I fit well as a centrist, even somewhat as a liberal, although I can sometimes even be a conservative. [Astikainen] You got into parliament in 1979 under the slogan "Woman from the right." Will this also be enough to get elected this time? [Rehn] No, because this does not encompass more than a small part of me. [Astikainen] Is Mauno Koivisto a dangerous socialist? [Rehn] In no way. I think rather highly of Koivisto. He has been a wonderfully good cooperating partner with me. There are many such qualities in him that I hold in the highest respect. But since this is such a clearly nonsocialist country, it would be a little strange if again an individual clearly aligned with a leftist party were elected president. [Astikainen] Is Ahtisaari a socialist? [Rehn] He himself is strongly advocating this [socialism]. [Astikainen] What is your thinking on the welfare state? [Rehn] It is the sort of thing where there are good features, in which room is be made for inventiveness and flexibility, not to take care of as many people as the typical leftist society is doing. Welfare is connected with seeing that basic rights are preserved: education, basic economic security, and targeted health care services. But many creeper vines have grown out over the years. We ought to use this awareness right away and look at what is dispensable and how it can be pruned. I don't want to make cuts on the level of service delivery, [for example] by nurses and day care personnel. [Astikainen] Is foreign policy now being decided too much by ministry officials? [Rehn] They have been deciding rather much. I believe that this is going to change. At least I can assure that in my presidency, policy decisions will be of chief importance. The preparation given by ministry officials is vital, and there are excellent foreign and security policy experts handling both these areas. [Astikainen] Then the situation will change if you are elected? [Rehn] I have said that in policy aspects there is certainly going to be noticeably more information, openness. Currently the situation is a little like information should not be given out regarding what has happened and is happening. [Astikainen] Were you afraid when you heard about Russia having handed a [protest] note to Finland? [Rehn] In reality I became irritated that the government had not been particularly aware that these discussions had been going on. The note emerged at a little inconvenient time. There are those who still have not come to understand that the old days are gone. These people are still found in Russia's embassy in Finland. [Astikainen] Could you as president revoke the Paris Peace Treaty completely? [Rehn] This is not necessary, since it has become obsolete on its own. Aspects regarding border questions are still relevant. New agreements--all human rights agreements, UN special treaties--are replacing it. Forty-seven years have passed since the peace treaty. Conditions have changed much. All the world has changed. The treaty's significance is extremely limited. [Astikainen] How as president would you prevent Russia from interfering in Finnish internal affairs? [Rehn] Through openness. I would make it clear what Finland's position is regarding its own sovereignty. I would build good, very good operating relations with Russia. These must be built anew, no matter what happens there. This will be the task of the next president in any case. Russian Uncertainty Is Danger Factor [Astikainen] The Estonians fear Russia. Has the threat regarding Finland been eliminated for all time? [Rehn] Not surely for all time. We have learned over the past years that nothing is eternal, nor especially durable. Perhaps we have reason to manifest a little fear regarding what is happening with the Baltics. Their fear also might be a little anticipatory. Uncertainty regarding the eastern neighbor is a danger factor for us too, but I would prefer not to speak of there being a threat. [Astikainen] What is your vision: What will Russia be like at the end of your presidential term in the year 2000? [Rehn] Surely it will be democratized, but it is a long road. The biggest error they have made was perhaps in assuming that everything would just convert to a market economy with just a ping and there it is. They have such an old glue of tradition as to how things are done there. One doesn't need do more than go shopping in Moscow or Leningrad: First you go and select something, then you go to the cashier to pay and finally you are able to ask for your item. This will go on until all of this strange bureaucracy is gotten rid of. But they have embarked on the right direction. [Astikainen] Is the border between Finland and Russia then just as easy to cross as is now the border between Finland and Sweden? [Rehn] I doubt this is the case. [Astikainen] Do you really want to grant asylum in Finland to all applicants from Russia and Estonia? [Rehn] No. From where did you get this idea? [Astikainen] You have opposed the government's decision to declare those countries as so-called safe countries. [Rehn] First of all, it should be kept in mind the dimensions of which we are speaking. Last year some 700 people from Russia and Estonia asked for asylum. Since over the same period well over a million people came on passports and visas, then in my view we are just not speaking in the same in unison rearding these phenomena. We ought to be much more strict and careful in deciding to whom we justly grant visas. Those asylum applicants who have committed crimes can be turned away very fast, if the police will only act. I do not support criminals in any way. And the government's decision was drafted in such terms that Russia is to be considered a safe country for only Russian citizens, that is, just as I had hoped. Of course in Russia are small groups--draft evaders, homosexuals, Jews--who still are persecuted, but perhaps this will be after all brought under control. [Astikainen] Why don't you use the word neutrality in describing Finland's foreign policy? [Rehn] Because in my opinion this is not relevant. We have sought membership in the European Union [EU] and said that we support supplemental provisions regarding a joint foreign and security policy. We have not presented any reservations on this. And I think in general that the word neutrality is slightly obsolete after disappearance of the blocs. Partnership for Peace Won't Increase Finnish Security [Astikainen] How can Finland keep talking about joining a Western military alliance although even you speak of nonalignment? [Rehn] We can't add [to our security]. For example, in the PFP (Partnership for Peace) we were participating only in a contributory member. We aren't getting anything; we aren't getting security guarantees; we aren't even asking for these. We regard the work of bringing about peace in Europe as being this important. Finland is working to realize the possibilities for this. [Astikainen] First there was NATO's joint consultative body NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], and now there is Partnership for Peace. Surely cooperation is being increased. [Rehn] In NACC we are observers and attend committees that are specifically involved in peace-maintaining issues. [Astikainen] How will a signing a Partnership for Peace agreement increase Finnish security? [Rehn] It will not increase it. We are to act as a contributory member if we join. [Astikainen] You are quite actively bringing Finland closer to the West. Is this based on logic or feelings? [Rehn] It is clearly based on logic that we have always been part of Europe. I have always considered Finland a Western country. When I was able to go abroad for the first time in 1953 as a new student, I was horrified that Finland was considered an East bloc country. An American university woman student I met in Venice surprised me by saying: "Are you Finnish? I didn't know that you were allowed to travel freely." Then I thought: "My God!, I'll show you that Finland is still a Western country." Of course one's feelings can also be involved about this. [Astikainen] What would staying out of the European Union mean for Finland in your estimation? [Rehn] Concretely, I think that we would not be able to have a voice in decisionmaking regarding issues of concern to ourselves. Especially, if there is an expansion in the area of security policy decisionmaking, it would be extremely vital to be participate, because at issue is security for all of our Europe. Regarding economics, investors surely will avoid countries that are outside. In addition, there are educational programs in which we cannot join as just a member of the European Economic Area.
