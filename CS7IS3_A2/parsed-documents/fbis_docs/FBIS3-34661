Attempting to answer this question, the Palestinian side sees the agreement as a direct conduit for turning the Declaration of Principles [DOP] from written words on paper into facts on the ground -- facts that will gradually evolve into the realization of long-term Palestinian aspirations, namely, the establishment of an independent state and the restoration of the name of Palestine to the map of the Middle East. Israeli sources, however, are not so optimistic. They regard the Cairo agreement as the first in a series of agreements and understandings that must be reached before actual implementation of the DOP. These sources do not expect those agreements to be signed within a month. In the aftermath of the signing of the DOP and the interim agreement, events in the occupied territories have been characterized by an escalation of Israeli practices, a considerable increase in the suffering of Palestinians, the perpetuation of the closure on Jerusalem, and the continued detention of Palestinian prisoners and detainees. All these and other developments have cast a dark shadow over any positive expectations during the past weeks. Nonetheless, the signing of the Cairo agreement has somewhat restored momentum to the negotiating process, even though this momentum has not yet been translated into reality. Perhaps the most visible proof of the theoretical nature of the Cairo agreement is the statement by high-ranking Israeli sources that the situation in the occupied territories will remain as it is until a detailed agreement in various spheres is reached. Therefore, according to these sources, no withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will be carried out nor will any Palestinian prisoners be released before those agreements are signed. Again, any optimism regarding the future would be premature. Their long experience -- whose most recent lesson was the disappointment and frustration of those who had pinned their hopes on the interim agreement -- has taught the Palestinian people realism. Therefore, after the Cairo agreement, it is better for one to wait, be patient, and expect surprises of a different nature.
