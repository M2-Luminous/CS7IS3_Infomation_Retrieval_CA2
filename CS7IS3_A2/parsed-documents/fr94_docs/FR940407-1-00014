FR940407-1-00014 FR940407-1-00006 By letter dated March 18, 1994, Colorado submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. CO&hyph;604). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment in response to a letter dated April 7, 1993 (administrative record No. CO&hyph;539), that OSM sent to Colorado in accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(c). The concerns raised by OSM in its 30 CFR part 732 letter pertained to a January 1985 MOU between the Colorado Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Colorado Department of Health (DOH) which Colorado intended to supersede a December 15, 1980, MOU between the two agencies. Whereas, OSM had approved the 1980 MOU, Colorado had not submitted the 1985 MOU to OSM, and OSM had not approved it in accordance with 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17. The 1980 MOU provided that both DOH and DNR would inspect coal mines for compliance with effluent limitations and specified that should either agency determine that a water quality violation existed, either agency could take the appropriate enforcement action in accordance with its own regulations. The 1985 MOU stated that, ``as a matter of general practice, DNR will be responsible for enforcing water quality protection pertaining to the requirements for design and maintenance of structures and the requirements to minimize disturbance to the hydrologic balance from sources other than the point of discharge,'' while DOH ``will be responsible for enforcing water quality control standards at the point of discharge.'' In its 30 CFR part 732 letter, OSM notified Colorado that the revised MOU was inconsistent with both SMCRA and the approved Colorado program because under the division of responsibilities in the revised MOU, only DOH has the authority to enforce effluent limitations, and that if and when DOH decides to exercise that authority, enforcement action is taken only under the provisions of the Colorado Discharge Elimination System (CDES). The CDES is the State's water pollution control program approved pursuant to the Federal Clean Water Act and is not the coal mining regulatory program approved pursuant to SMCRA. Since the enforcement provisions of the CDES program do not require the citation of all violations and do not include sanctions and procedures similar to those set forth in SMCRA, the Colorado program is not in compliance with section 512(d) of SMCRA, which requires that a State program incorporate sanctions no less stringent than SMCRA and contain the same or similar procedural requirements. Colorado proposes to add new language to the section titled ``Inspections, Monitoring and Sample Analysis'' to provide that in those instances where DMG suspects an unpermitted discharge, DMG shall collect a water quality sample for analysis. Colorado proposes to add new language in the section titled ``Enforcement'' to provide that: (1) WQCD shall be solely responsible for enforcement of the CDPS permit program against point source discharges of pollutants into the State's surface waters that are conducted without an effective CDPS permit and for the enforcement of CDPS permit conditions and (2) DMG will issue a cessation order if during a coal mine inspection, DMG determines that there is imminent danger to the health or safety of the public or significant environmental harm to land, air or water resources. III. Public Comment Procedures In accordance with the provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is seeking comments on whether the proposed amendment satisfies the applicable program approval criteria of 30 CFR 732.15. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Colorado program. 1. Written Comments Written comments should be specific, pertain only to the issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under DATES or at locations other than the Albuquerque Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the administrative record.
