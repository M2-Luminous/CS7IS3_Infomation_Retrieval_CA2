"In signing NATO's Partnership for Peace [PfP], Russia has shown haste and passiveness. How can we be satisfied with the expansion and strengthening of the NATO military bloc when we, the Russians, have made concessions beyond anything that the international community could have imagined!" In the mouth of Russian Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov, on a stopover in Paris for the Eurosatory arms exhibition, the questioning of the "partnership" may seem particularly unexpected. This reformist officer, who made a large contribution to the failure of the August 1991 Communist putsch, is known for his fidelity to President Yeltsin. Moreover, since last winter, he has become his special representative within the powerful state company Rosvooruzheniye, responsible for the thorny question of Russian arms sales abroad. His "outburst" must therefore be taken for what it is: a polite but strong warning against marginalizing and humiliating Russia, a plea for a new collective security system. "No, I have not changed, I am still in favor of cooperation with the West," he said smiling, when concern was expressed about the hardening of his stance. "What I am trying to say is that this cooperation has started badly, that it bears the stamp of an extremely dangerous imbalance." The marshal explained his fears: "If you stand back a little from what has happened in recent years, you will understand more clearly the concerns of the Russian military. They have the impression that they have taken huge steps toward cooperation. But without deriving any real benefit from it. Communist ideology has been abandoned, the Warsaw Pact has disappeared, the Soviet Union has collapsed, our troops are withdrawing from the whole of East Europe and the Baltic countries.... And on the other side, what do we see? That the NATO military bloc is still there and that, far from disappearing, it is expanding and growing stronger, even aspiring to the role of [becoming the] armed wing of the United Nations, the world's policeman. You must admit that there is reason to ask questions." Yeltsin's opposition is doing so wholeheartedly, he stressed with some anxiety. "The extreme nationalists grouped under the Rutskoy and Zhirinovskiy banner can easily say that Russia has lost everything and that the West is dictating its will. For the average Russian, caught up in his everyday economic problems, these remarks produce a special response. People are becoming suspicious about the West's intentions." Security `On One Leg' Marshal Shaposhnikov has not reached that stage. But he is worried by the emergence of a NATO bloc which, through its association with Russia, is complicating Russia's relations with its big Chinese neighbor. "Russia is Russia, it cannot blindly adopt the West's mechanisms, it must be able to continue to walk its path between Europe and Asia. Remember that it has never been able to accept foreign diktat for long." What he rejects in the PfP is that, according to him, it leads to "an extremely unbalanced international scene, based on just one leg, one pillar." The marshal explained: "This monolithism is not satisfactory. It introduces a hierarchical organization among states, which is not acceptable. At the top, there is the United States which leads, then come the NATO member countries, then the states associated with NATO, like Russia or Albania, then all the others...." In his opinion, it would be better to vigorously reject this bloc rationale and strengthen the military structures of the United Nations. "The mechanisms exist, they must be brought into play, we must create a veritable UN command for the peacekeeping forces," the marshal said with enthusiasm, brandishing the flow charts he has drawn himself: "At the regional level, the various existing organizations -- the CSCE, the CIS, ASEAN -- could, under UN control, equip themselves with military structures and a security council. And NATO could become the armed branch of the CSCE!" For the time being, he admits, the Western countries are not ready to really call things into question. "The NATO member states felt that they needed to think about the future of their organization, now that the enemy is down. But they have not been capable of carrying through their reasoning. They have only produced the PfP. That is not enough." Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov admits that he can understand them. "They are afraid of Russia, afraid of destabilization. They are not therefore in any hurry to disarm." However, Russia must not be driven into a corner, there must not be constant attempts to weaken it. "We have reached a threshold beyond which, if we are forced to back down further, we will be driven into revanchist positions." From Rwanda to Georgia Suddenly the marshal grew angry: "I am thinking of our policy within the CIS, in the Caucasus for instance. I admit that I was very surprised to hear some French officials accuse Russia of hegemonic aspirations. The intervention mission which we are carrying out in Georgia has been decided at the request of the two sides in the conflict. It must not be forgotten that this region has been part of Russian cultural and political space for centuries. We therefore have obligations over there. So why question our intentions? Am I expressing surprise at the dispatch of a French military force to Rwanda? Am I talking of hegemonism? And yet, the ties which bind France to that African country are much more tenuous than those which we have with Georgia!" The same type of argument is behind his analysis of Russia's access to the international arms market. "The Russians cannot be prevented from having a presence on that market. Do we frown when the French supply Mirage planes to Taiwan. No. We therefore ask that nobody should express surprise when we sign a contract to sell MIG planes to the Malaysians." "You know," he added, "I do not represent the Russian military-industrial complex, but I receive the directors of military factories every day in my office. Their economic and social problems are awful. They are trying to solve them... Our aim is not to inundate the world with our weapons but to find our place on the market, in accordance with the rules of competition." In the specific sphere of the control of Russian arms sales by the state, the Rosvooruzheniye company has made great progress, according to the marshal. The Mafia structures which had seized control of this profitable sector at the time of the USSR's collapse, have been "dismantled."
