FR940928-1-00002 FR940928-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;15&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; American General Aircraft Corporation Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to American General Aircraft Corporation (American General) Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes. The proposed action would require inspecting (one-time) the wing attach shoulder bolts for fretting, scoring, wear, excessive clearance, or enlarged or elongated mounting holes (known as damage from hereon), replacing any damaged parts and repairing any damaged areas, and reporting to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) the results of the inspection. Four reports of wing attach shoulder bolt failure prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent wing attach shoulder bolt failure, which could lead to structural damage of the wing/fuselage to the point of failure. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;15&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from Fletch Air, Inc., 9000 Randolph Street, Houston, Texas 77061; telephone (713) 649&hyph;8700 or (800) 329&hyph;4647; facsimile (713) 643&hyph;0070.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;15-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;15&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion The FAA has received four reports (three in England and one in the United States) of wing attach shoulder bolt failure on American General Models AA&hyph;5, AA&hyph;5A, AA&hyph;5B, and AG&hyph;5B airplanes. Investigation reveals that excessive wing to center spar clearance could have contributed to the bolt failures; however, in each of the four instances, the bolts failed prior to reaching the service life of 7,250 hours time-in- service (TIS). The FAA has determined that, in order to assure the safety of these airplanes, the established service life of these bolts needs review.
