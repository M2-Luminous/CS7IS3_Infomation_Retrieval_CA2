FR940419-0-00072 FR940419-0-00019 It is not EPA's intention to require contractors or their subcontractors to keep records tracking the personal conflicts individual employees may have, nor is it our intention that prime contractors keep personal conflict of interest records of their subcontractors. Such records are not necessary to comply with our reporting requirements. EPA's intent is to minimize any paperwork and administrative burden by having both prime contractors and subcontractors make their employees aware of the sensitivity and importance of conflict of interest when working on EPA projects and to place with their employees the responsibility for identifying conflicts. When the contractor is informed of a personal conflict, it should then report the conflict to EPA. When a personal conflict would arise at the subcontractor level, the subcontractor would notify the prime contractor of the conflict of interest, along with a description of actions taken to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize the conflict. The prime contractor would in turn notify EPA. If subcontractor information is sensitive, the prime contractor will consult with the Contracting Officer to determine a procedure that will allow the prime contractor to fulfill the conditions of the contract and simultaneously providing protection for the information. 3. Ownership of stock and objectivity of individuals. One commenter suggested that without criteria about ownership of stock or the knowledge about the psychology of individuals, the concept of personal conflict of interest is impossible to define in practice. We recognize that analysis of conflict situations may be difficult, and there are no objective criteria that can address every situation that might arise. The critical test that a contractor must use regarding any potential conflict is whether a conflict exists which would impair the person's objectivity in performing the work under an EPA contract. 4. Limiting disclosure requirements to key project personnel. Some commenters stated that the proposed clause was too broad and should apply to key personnel and not to personnel, such as clerical or accounting employees, who have no influence over work on a project. Some commenters connected this requirement to the system of records issue previously addressed, to demonstrate the prohibitive expense associated with the notification requirement by all personnel. EPA has carefully considered exempting certain personnel working under an EPA contract from the requirements of the clause and has decided not to change the clause which extends the notification requirements to all personnel performing work under an EPA contract. We do not agree that employees below the level of ``key personnel'' do not contribute to and influence work on EPA projects. One cannot assume that personnel will always perform tasks which are limited to their generic job categories, and that such employees never have access to sensitive information and never exercise discretion that may impact work performed for EPA. The final rule simply requires that a contractor inform its employees about their responsibility to report conflicts of interest. This process is a significantly less burdensome approach to managing personal conflicts of interest. The development or maintenance of a system of records about a contractor's employees is not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel clause. Therefore, the concern about the expense associated with a system of records is not central to the issue of which personnel would be subject to the provisions of the clause.
