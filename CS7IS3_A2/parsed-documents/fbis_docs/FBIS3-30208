At a packed news press conference in Belgrade's Yugoslavia hotel, Zhirinovskiy recalled that "the Russian Army is still in Europe" but added that his party is urging peace and an end to the war in Bosnia and that "it is not threatening anybody". Speaking in detail about ways to solve the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina, he said that there were three ways: Either the foreign troops leave the territory of former Yugoslavia and let the Slav nations solve their problems on their own; or "accepting the status quo"; or "the arrival of Russian troops." "We are supporting the Serbs and our standpoint is that the Serb lands -- the republic of Srpska and the republic of Serb Krajina should be within the Republic of Serbia," he said, adding that he would be happy if "Russia and Serbia had a common border." Zhirinovskiy stressed that he had come as chairman of the party which had won the Russian parliamentary elections by a wide margin, and went on to call on the Western governments "to understand the language of the new Russian authorities." He also said that he has never "liked the policy pursued by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, particularly in the Balkans" and that he will demand his resignation "if he does not support Serb policy." According to him, Russia has never threatened anybody with anything and has not done anything by force, "but it will come, if someone calls for it." Asked whether he would have a meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Zhirinovskiy said that he is ready for talks, "if someone in the Serbian leadership requests this", but that for him "the most important thing is the Serbian people". He stressed that he would "when he is elected as president, propose an alliance of Slav states, whose centeer will not be Moscow, because everyone has grown tired of this." Expressing his personal view that the former member countries of the Warsaw Pact "should remain neutral," Zhirinovskiy stressed that "Russia will not enter NATO." The president of the Russian Liberals stressed that he is "against all blocs" and against "any center that dictates conditions by force." Speaking about the situation in Russia, he said that "that there should not be any upsetting of the internal political situation in Russia," that parliament "will do its work over the coming three years," and that "the people elected his party for the sake of stability." Commenting on relations between the United States and Russia, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia assessed that U.S. President Bill Clinton "has shown himself to be a weakling" by not having a meeting with him in Moscow. "This is a gift, because anti-American feeling is growing in Russia, because the people know that Clinton supports the disintegration of Russia," Zhirinovskiy added. Commenting on his recent stay in Slovenia, he noted briefly that the visit passed off "without incident" and "without contacts with the authorities." Zhirinovskiy stressed at the end of the news conference, which lasted almost 90 minutes, during which he was frequently interrupted by applause and ovations, that "the time for the withdrawal of Russia has passed and that a general emergence is beginning."
