They unanimously adopted, at their regular meeting, a resolution calling for the early installation of a new administration, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Hatoyama told a news conference. The accord also calls for early Diet approval of the already overdue budget for fiscal 1994, which began April 1, Hatoyama said. Parliamentary Vice Construction Minister Eisei Ito proposed that an agreement should be reached to end the political turmoil which has resulted from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's sudden decision to resign last Friday, he explained. Hatoyama spoke of the need for the ruling parties to synchronize their basic policies, particularly on some issues of immediate concern, as a prerequisite for the formation of a new coalition government. "Without such a policy consensus, the new government will face a crisis sooner or later," he said.
