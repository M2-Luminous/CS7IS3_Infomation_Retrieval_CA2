He pointed out: The new situation and tasks urgently ask us to further strengthen and improve education of party members and raise the standards of the ranks in an all-around way. Arming the vast numbers of party members with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics constitutes the most important improvement in party members' education in the new period. Successfully carrying out this task will most effectively strengthen party member's education, push forward party building in the ideological sphere and in all other areas, and provide a stronger guarantee to the success of our socialist modernization. Wei Jianxing, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Secretariat and secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, attended the conference. Hu Jintao said: In the course of leading us to blaze the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and begin a new undertaking, particularly in critical junctures, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has time and again stressed the need to build our party well. His thought on building the party in power in the new period has greatly enriched and developed theories on party building in Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought. We must earnestly learn and grasp his series of new viewpoints, theses, and inventions to guide party building in practice. After enumerating Comrade Deng Xiaoping's expositions on strengthening the party's ideological building, improving party members' education, and raising their standards, Hu Jintao urged comrades involved in party building and party members' education to systematically study Comrade Xiaoping's related thoughts in his works, profoundly grasp their essence, integrate them with the practice of conducting party education in previous years, earnestly summarize the experience and lessons, further raise their work standards, and more successfully carry out their tasks in the future. Hu Jintao stressed: In conducting party members' education, we must regard arming the entire party with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as a fundamental task and use it to help accomplish other education tasks. He pointed out: Arming the entire party with the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a fundamental way to strengthen and improve party building and raise party members' standards in an all-around way. It has a bearing on whether the party's basic theory and line will remain unchanged for 100 years and on the future and destiny of our party, state, and nation. Party organizations at all levels must work hard to carry out this great ideological construction project vital to our fundamental interests. At present, we must organize party members and cadres to study the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" in conjunction with the study and implementation of the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and direct them to use the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to guide the practice of reform -- accelerating the building of a socialist market economy -- and seek tangible results on three issues: 1) strengthen the determination and consciousness in building a socialist market economic structure and developing a socialist market economy, further unify our minds based on the guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and firmly implement the various policy decisions made by the central authorities to promote reform; 2) work hard to acquire knowledge about developing a socialist market economy, constantly seek to improve the ability to operate a socialist market economy, and approach problems with new ideas compatible with the requirements of building the new economic structure, and try to adapt as soon as possible our work methods to the process and measures for in-depth reform; 3) consciously step up tempering our party spirit in the course of developing a socialist market economy, study and work hard to build the new economic structure, correctly approach the adjustment of certain interests necessary to deepening reform, correctly handle the relationship between the overall and partial interests and between the collective and the individual, uphold the party's ideals and faith, and maintain correct values, integrity, and self-discipline to stand the new test in the new period. Hu Jintao said: Over the past several decades, our party has accumulated a wealth of experience and developed a number of good forms and methods in the education of party members, which we undoubtedly should uphold. Meanwhile, we should also note that with the in-depth development of reform and opening up, the environment and conditions in which party members are today are quite different from those in which they used to be. In such circumstances, it is not inadequate to only use the past methods to educate party members; we must improve such methods and concentrate our efforts on the education of party members to achieve actual results. He pointed out: First, we should link the education of party members closely to the implementation of the party's basic line and resolutely make it serve the purposes of reform, development, and stability; second, we should effectively use the theoretical weapon, have a definite object in mind, enhance the purposefulness, persuasion, and appealing of education for party members; third, we should link strengthening education and settling ideological questions with showing concern for party members and solving practical problems for them; fourth, we should combine strengthening the education of party members with the improvement of management and the enforcement of party discipline; and fifth, we should strengthen the building of primary party organizations while stepping up the education and management of party members. Hu Jintao said in his speech: Party organizations at all levels are required to pay close attention to recruiting party members from among people, especially from among young people, working at the frontlines in production, scientific research, and other work. He pointed out: The cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is a cause led by our party with the ultimate lofty aim of realization of communism, a cause of never ceasing to break new ground in our march into the future. This requires unremitting efforts by generation after generation of Chinese communists, and it is also necessary for us to continuously inject new blood into the body of the party. The replacement of new party members for old ones, like the replacement of new cadres for old ones, is an organizational guarantee for unswervingly upholding the party's basic line for a hundred years and a prerequisite for ensuring that there is no lack of successors to carry on the party's cause and that the party's cause will thrive. Proceeding from reality, party organizations at various levels should analyze new conditions for recruiting party members and seek ways and methods to solve new problems. In recruiting party members, it is essential to uphold the criteria for party members as stipulated in the party constitution and to ensure that new party members are qualified. Hu Jintao hoped that party committees at various levels would take the lead in implementing the principle of "the party handling party affairs" and strengthen and improve their leadership over the education of party members. They should improve their leadership methods, change their work styles, and strengthen their marco- guidance and specific supervision and inspection; they should step up investigation and study and conscientiously analyze the new changes brought about through the establishment of a socialist market economy in the values, thinking, feelings, and mentality of party members; they should often sum up and popularize effective methods developed by basic-level party organizations in the education of party members; and they should accumulate experiences in practice and gradually grasp the laws of educating party members in the new situation to perform this work efficiently. Lu Feng, director of the party Central Committee Organization Department, chaired today's meeting. Leaders of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and relevant departments under the party Central Committee attended the meeting, including Hou Zongbin, Song Defu, Zhao Zongnai, Xu Weicheng, Wang Jialiu, and Chen Fujin. Also present at today's meeting were party committee secretaries of various departments under the party Central Committee and the State Council.
