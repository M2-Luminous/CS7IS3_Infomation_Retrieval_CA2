He maintained corruption is one of the worst evils that is currently eating away at the world's countries. He also noted we must implement a priority program to fight poverty in Latin America. He pointed out he advocates Cuba's admittance into the American accord and recognized this is the right time to revise the Ibero-American system. President Caldera greeted the heads of state who are attending the Cartagena summit, especially those who are about to end their terms, and stressed that their successors "must support and strengthen the region's integrationist and democratic movement." The Venezuelan president defended democracy and said that he bases himself not only on popularity ratings but also on macroeconomic figures that show progress is the community's foundation for peace and harmony. He added we are "deeply moved" as economic indicators reveal "a growth in poverty." Caldera pleasingly admitted that international financial institutions, such as the Inter-American Development Bank, have recognized that the fight against poverty requires the unity of the community and demanded industrialized nations increase social development contributions. He added that by holding talks we must understand that the foreign debt issue deserves a great deal of attention because it has become a very onerous burden for some countries. He insisted "we must find tangible solutions to these problems." He said "economic reactivation alone is not enough to solve our nations' socioeconomic crises," and demanded joining efforts "to achieve being understood and recognizing that the fight against poverty must become a priority." Afterwards, Caldera mentioned one of the thorniest issues of the summit: corruption. He pointed out "corruption is one of the most serious evils that are choking our countries" and urged his colleagues "to commit ourselves to sanction rather than protect those who steal official funds despicably and put our nations in deteriorating situations." The Venezuelan head of state noted "just as we fight against drug trafficking, I invite you to commit ourselves to not support and to morally and materially defeat those who commit crimes of corruption," adding that "we are currently living hard times" in many countries. President Caldera admitted that summits like the Cartagena summit "constitute a great hope" for the future. "At this summit, I want to express my faith and hope that we will be able to overcome the situation we are currently facing and to respond to the terrible dilemma we are living," President Caldera concluded.
