As newsman Marcos Castellon told PRENSA LATINA today in a telephone conversation, lawyer Magda Montiel Davis is the chief target of those attacks, in addition to Vivian Maneruc, owner of the ABC Charters company that flies airplanes from Miami to Havana. On Thursday, Montiel's offices were evacuated following two bomb threats that turned out to be false, while most of her staff members resigned, voicing a deep fear for their personal safety, the source said. He added that after leaving the building in the company of her husband, the lawyer's path was blocked by a hail of insults until the Miami police intervened to clear the way. According to Castellon, other attendees like Maneruc also reported threats and requested protection, fearing reprisals by groups opposed to any peaceful rapprochement between Cuba and its emigrants. On their return to Miami, the participants in the meeting with Cuban authorities were taken out of the airport terminal under strict security to prevent possible violent clashes with local ultraright-wing segments. The political climate in Miami, the commentator of Radio Progreso Alternativa indicated, has been traditionally marked by the intolerance of the right, and there is a long history of bomb attacks and physical and verbal attacks on persons who support dialogue. He recalled that two participants of the 1978 dialogue, which gathered Cuban emigrants for the first time in Havana, were killed. Emigrant ultraright-wing sectors were excluded from participating in the meeting held 22-24 April. The meeting was regarded as the first step toward normalizing Cuba's ties with its emigrant community.
