FR940413-0-00051 FR940413-0-00016 EPA is making this final rule effective upon publication in the Federal Register to ensure that sensitive information in the EPA&hyph;30 system of records is immediately exempt from disclosure so that the OIG can accomplish the law enforcement functions described above. In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), EPA believes this reason constitutes the required ``good cause'' to make the rule effective immediately. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. EPA has determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866. OMB received a copy of the proposed rule during the public comment period and provided no comments to EPA. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not constitute an information collection request within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Regulatory Flexibility Act Section 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604(a), requires EPA to prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis in connection with any rulemaking for which EPA must publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking. The required regulatory flexibility analysis must contain a statement of the need for the rule, a summary of the issues raised by public comments, and a description of alternatives considered. Section 605(b) of the Act, however, provides that section 604 of the Act ``shall not apply to any proposed or final rule if the head of the agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), EPA certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule, which exempts the OIG Hotline Allegation System from certain subsections of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, will have no economic impact on any businesses, large or small.
