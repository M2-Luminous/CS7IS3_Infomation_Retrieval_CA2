Giving up plans to reshuffle the cabinet has weakened the Hosokawa administration's leadership, and the concerned ministries and agencies are not working vigorously enough. At the informal 9 March cabinet meeting, it was decided that the government would back off from its original decision to announce its policies in a single package before the end of March; instead, part of these policies would be compiled in late March, and the remainder, before the Naples Summit (of leaders of the advanced countries) in July. While the automobile industry is now preparing to issue voluntary plans for the purchase of additional U.S.-made parts, this is not likely to meet U.S. expectations of a large-scale increase. Although the government wants these foreign economic policies to be a stepping stone toward reconciliation with the United States, the United States is not likely to be pacified by the first batch of measures to be announced. There is now a strong possibility that tension in bilateral relations may continue for some time. The government has basically decided on including the following measures concerned with the priority negotiation areas at the framework talks in the first batch of economic measures to be announced by the end of this month: 1) the stationing of a permanent Transport Ministry inspector in Detroit to facilitate the issuance of certificates for American cars; and 2) expediting procedures for approving new insurance products. Furthermore, the package is also expected to include the implementation of the government procurement action plan, the formulation of a guideline on the Antimonopoly Law in relation to public works projects bidding, and import-stimulation measures in the fiscal 1994 budget. However, the above measures have either been predicted previously or have already been announced. Even the officials in charge admit that they are "not impressive" (according to a senior Ministry of International Trade and Industry official). While the merit of the economic measures actually depends on how far new policies can be drawn up, concrete measures regarding deregulation in the flow of commodities, and improvement of customs procedures have not been finalized, although they are actually being discussed. Officials of the Cabinet Councilors' Office on Internal Affairs, responsible for compiling deregulation measures, lament that "the ministries are all reluctant." With regard to macroeconomic measures, even the agenda has not been decided upon. The government is unable to take any action on the extension of the income tax cut beyond 1994, an issue in which the United States shows great interest, because this has to wait for the ruling coalition parties' consultations on tax reform to reach a conclusion. As to setting a voluntary target for reducing the current accounts surplus, while some cabinet members are in favor of this idea, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa takes a negative position. There is evident vacillation in the cabinet. A factor contributing to this lukewarm attitude toward compiling economic measures is the internal strife within the administration, as evidenced by the abortion of the cabinet reshuffle plan. While Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura is supposed to be responsible for compiling the foreign economic measures, cynics in the concerned ministries and agencies ask: "Does he really have the full confidence of the prime minister?" The bureaucrats doubt if they can have the full support of the ruling coalition parties if they come up with deregulation measures, which businesses are expected to oppose fiercely.
