Berlin, O.A. Muravyev; UDC 621.311.21.004.69] [Abstract] Commissioning of the small Dobromyslyanskaya hydroelectric power plant on the Chernitsa River in Belarus after retrofitting and an overhaul is reported. Initially, the plant was equipped with two hydroelectric units with RO123-V-84 turbines; the new power station employs commercially produced pump units serving as turbines and induction motors running as generators. This design has advantages both from the cost and delivery schedule viewpoints. Data on the power plant equipment option costs in 1990 prices are summarized. The range of factors which must be taken into account is selecting the pump is outlined. Analyses show that pump impellers have a 75% efficiency within a broad head range, which is lower than that of turbines, but this is compensated for by the low cost of equipment which is cheaper by close to tenfold. The particular features of induction motors make them especially suitable at small power plants with a low head. The power plant overhaul was financed by the Vitebsk electric grids under the leadership of G.I. Kubarovskiy; plant construction and erection were conducted by the Girdotekhnik Association (Lithuania) and Belyy Ugol enterprise under the direction of N.V. Shanin.
