The yen shot up by over 2 yen against the U.S. dollar in early Tokyo interbank trading Monday in reaction to the failure of talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton on Friday to resolve a trade dispute. The source said on condition of anonymity, "Foreign exchange rates reflect the balance of current account of a country. Japan, with this much surplus, may have to bear the yen's advance."
