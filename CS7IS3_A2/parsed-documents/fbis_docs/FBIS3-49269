By this, conditions have been created for lifting the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Krajisnik said. "The Serb side yesterday confirmed its readiness for Muslims to be given 33.3 percent of former Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, and accepted a proposal that in the next two years the province of Sarajevo, including its nine municipalities, be administered by the United Nations, during which time a final solution for Sarajevo will be found." "The third thing that we discussed yesterday was our demand for access to the sea in the area of Molunat and Prevlaka. The last demand by the European Union and the Muslims has been fulfilled by our acceptance of the percentage of territory to be given to the Muslims and of the status of Sarajevo; therefore there is no reason not to abolish the sanctions against the Serb people," Krajisnik said. If the negotiations on 18 January in Geneva do not yield result, it will be clear that the Muslim side is to blame, Momcilo Krajisnik said.
