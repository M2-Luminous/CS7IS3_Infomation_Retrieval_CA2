The SPPM secretly decided in Blagoevgrad to dissolve itself and join the OMO, where it "could be more useful" in the struggle for the autonomy of Pirin Macedonia. SPPM leader Alan Andonov had already resigned. The SPPM has about 1,500 members and its ideas are similar to those of the OMO. However, its independent activity was aggravated by the investigation of the regional security service and attacks in the Bulgarian press. The organization gained some prominence when the Russian nationalist Zhirinovskiy visited Sandanski. Then it became clear that Ossetian Alan Andonov was the commissary of the illegal "red units" in Bulgaria. They were established in Sandanski in 1992 to protect the interests of the Bulgarian Communist Party [BCP] and the struggle against U.S. imperialists and bourgeois ethics. However, later on relations between Andonov and Vladimir Spasov, chief of the BCP Central Committee, cooled, and the Ossetian now embraces the ideas of nationalism. The SPPM supported the recognition of Macedonian, Pomak, and Slav-Muslim minority rights in Bulgaria, in accordance with the program adopted at the end of September. The scandalous news conference in Sofia of OMO Secretary Jordan Kostadinov galvanized the most right-wing elements in the Pirin region. The one-man organization, Slave Makedonski, considered until now the chairman and member of several organizations hitherto considered moderate, also joined the OMO. On 23 March his newspaper MAKEDONETS carried the illegal SKORNUVANE (AWAKENING) as a supplement. Its previous issue had been confiscated for its anti-Bulgarian propaganda. The newspaper, written in a mixed Macedonian-Bulgarian dialect, points out that from 22 to 24 May militant nationalists intend to organize an international symposium of the "Macedonians of Pirin Macedonia." The Initiative Committee has reportedly invited emigrees from Australia, Germany, and Canada. They were supposed to come with their pockets full of money to finance the symposium. The delegates will visit Melnik and sample the famous wine made in this town.
