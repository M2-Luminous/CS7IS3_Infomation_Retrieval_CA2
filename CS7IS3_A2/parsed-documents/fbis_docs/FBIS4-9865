Today, well-informed sources of the Cuban Foreign Ministry informed PRENSA LATINA of the diverse geographical backgrounds of the representatives invited to the meeting, which will be held from 22 to 24 April in this capital. The participants of the conference "The Nation and the Emigre Community," approximately 200, will include critics of the Cuban political system who will be able to freely state their views and even make proposals in pursuit of a common effort, an authorized spokesperson confirmed to PRENSA LATINA. Although the largest group will be from the United States, given a large number of emigres reside there, other large delegations will include Cubans living in Mexico, Venezuela, and Spain. There will also be delegates from countries that are very diverse, including Costa Rica, Germany, Puerto Rico, Angola, China, Argentina, Brazil, France, the Dominican Republic, the eastern Caribbean islands, Australia, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia [as received], and Canada. According to the agenda, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will deliver a keynote address during the first working day on the country's relations with the emigres as well as on various issues. During the second day Vice President Carlos Lage will present a report on the national economic situation. Two other main presentations on the government's behalf will be made by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists, who will give a presentation entitled "Culture and National Identity." Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, will speak on the Cuban political system and the work by the organization that he heads. After each presentation, the participants will exchange views and make proposals on immigration regulations and emigres' participation in the cultural and economic life of their country of origin. Regarding the latter, it was noted that professionals and Cuban-American businessmen recently demonstrated great interest in participating in a seminar also held in Cuba, an interest intellectuals who reside abroad have also shown. Information obtained by PRENSA LATINA indicates the government is stressing the fact that guests to the event should include delegates from a broad spectrum of political positions, excluding only those who are engaged in aggressive or terrorist attacks. Although current problems are different and the concept of bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States are also different, Cuba believes the dialogue with the emigres held in 1978 can serve as a precedent for the new talks. On this occasion, according to the same source, the Cuban Government has decided to raise again the issue of normalizing relations with emigres, despite the fact there are no expectations that bilateral ties with Washington will improve, as happened during the 1970's. In this context, it is expected Cubans who live outside the country will be able to voice interests and concerns of a specific nature. Also, it is understood the conference will not be able to exhaust all the topics of interest to the government and nationals who live abroad. In light of this, the meeting can be described as the first step in an important direction and, also, as a pillar for even more ambitious and definitive projects.
