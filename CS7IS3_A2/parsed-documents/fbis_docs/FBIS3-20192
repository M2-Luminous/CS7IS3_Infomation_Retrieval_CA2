What do the results mean for your option of a red-green coalition at the national level? [Fischer] The election results in Lower Saxony mean a very good outcome for Bonn because it takes away the fears of an SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]-Green alliance and at the same time demonstrates that the Greens are continuing to consolidate their base. For the coalition Greens in Lower Saxony it is bitter to have won and nonetheless not be able to participate in governing any longer. To be sure, the question remains unanswered as to how long the SPD's one-vote majority will really continue to hold. The Greens in Hannover are a governing party in waiting. The results are generating incredible motivation nationwide and that seems to me to be the decisive aspect. [TAGESZEITUNG] Was it the Mannheim party convention that made possible this enormous thrust on the part of the coalition Greens? [Fischer] If I were to be ironic in my answer now, I would say "Yes." [TAGESZEITUNG] To ask in all seriousness: Did the Mannheim resolutions and the harsh public reaction to the party convention play a negative role in the outcome of the Lower Saxony elections? [Fischer] The Mannheim resolutions, taken as a whole, show that the party has taken a gigantic step forward. I would have liked the rhetoric to have been less agitated--then the signals sent out from Mannheim would have looked better. But that is old hat. [TAGESZEITUNG] It is understandable that you now interpret the Lower Saxony election results as a fine success for the party as well as for the red-green project, but making the appropriate projections for the Bundestag elections, the increase would mean that the Greens would jump from 4.8 percent to 6.6 percent. Yet that certainly is not the magnitude of importance that the Greens want to achieve in the fall of 1994 in order to convince Rudolf Scharping that he cannot avoid an red-green coalition, is it? [Fischer] I am not among those who believe that whoever is the winner in the opinion polls will be also be the winner in the elections. The French Greens certainly taught us that lesson: They traded at 20 percent and wound up at 7 percent. Everything over 5 percent is good; everything over 7 percent is very good; and everything over 10 percent would be sensational. That is my hierarchy. [TAGESZEITUNG] What results do the Greens need, in your opinion, for there to be at least a chance of a coalition with the SPD at the national level? [Fischer] The Greens must first of all come in from the cold. I never tire of stressing that so arrogance and carelessness do not take hold. If things go too well for the Green donkey, it likes to dance on thin ice, and distress is then very great when it falls through. [TAGESZEITUNG] Can an SPD-Green alliance be created at all with Rudolf Scharping? He had the choice in Rheinland-Pfalz and decided in favor of the liberals. [Fischer] Whether it is possible will depend upon the participation of the Greens, the content of their programs, and their people. One thing is certain for me: no coalition at any price. If we cannot see Green policies reflected in a coalition, I will advocate remaining in the opposition. [TAGESZEITUNG] In May of last year on this same point you informed us that the Greens would probably not be ready to assume governmental responsibility at the national level in 1994--that they were still too much of a protest party. [Fischer] For me the same principle continues to apply: I would reject any coalition agreement that I was convinced could not be lived up to. The Federal Republic is not something to play games with. If we want to govern, it means that we must strive for a successful coalition. If you do not think you are capable of that, then you should leave it alone. It would be worse than a disappointment if, after a year and a half, the sole approach to reform on the democratic left were to be over and done with for a long time to come. [TAGESZEITUNG] Scharping is conducting an election campaign with emphasis on classic SPD priorities; there are hardly any issues in common with Green policies. Is that something more than campaign tactics--that is, is it already a decision in advance against an SPD-Green coalition? [Fischer] If an SPD-Green alliance wants to achieve a majority, the party of the people has to wage the battle for the center and win it. During the last Bundestag campaign there was obvious SPD-Green competition between the SPD and the Greens. That proved to be unsuccessful for both sides. Nonetheless, I am not advocating that the SPD pack in its red-green interests and in the final analysis we negotiate with a modernized Hermann Rappe by the name of Gerhard Schroeder. One thing, to be sure, is clear: There will not be a national government with our participation without vigorous ecological reform. [TAGESZEITUNG] Hence, an election campaign as a kind of division of labor without truly evident programmatic common interests and a coalition after the election. That sounds rather artificial. [Fischer] He who wants a red-green coalition must vote for the Greens, and he who wants a reform Kohl will vote for the SPD--and together we will form a true ecosocial reform coalition. [TAGESZEITUNG] Whether society is imaginative enough to be able to conceive of that and is eager enough to experiment... [Fischer] ...If this crisis does not invite experimentation, it will not be overcome. Now is the hour of experiments! And that is why I am no longer as pessimistic as I was maybe just a year ago. Society is beginning to move in the direction of fundamental change and basic policy changes--the reduction in working hours, for example, proves this. The contention that there is no climate of reform or "no experiments wanted" is no longer valid. [TAGESZEITUNG] Let us assume that the climate is really better than its reputation, that the numbers are sufficient, and that the SPD is willing to go along with the Greens... [Fischer] ...Just the opposite--the Greens are prepared to go along with the SPD. [TAGESZEITUNG] Fine. What will the new social contract look like that you are talking about? [Fischer] We will have to stop dumping the burdens of unification primarily on the working classes. We need a new distribution of burdens. The question will arise as to what extent those who earn more will be willing to assume a greater share of the burden for the restructuring of our welfare state--whether they will be willing to bear, step by step, greater burdens for ecological restructuring, for investments in education, for German unification, and for basic security. [TAGESZEITUNG] That is still just a description of the problem rather than a solution. Thus far, it does not look as if the renunciation of material benefits for the sake of unification or of the environment can really be successfully appealed to. [Fischer] That is a matter of political conviction and also one of mobilizing interests. The workers are faced with the brutal issue of solidarity between those who have work and those who do not and therefore the propertied classes must also ask themselves whether they will increase their investments in Germany's future. In this case I am for undogmatic deliberations. Why should we not introduce municipal bonds? Why should not the citizens of Frankfurt be able to purchase city-owned enterprises? But we will also have to ask whether a landtag member or an editor-in-chief should have everything for free. The question of solidarity is to be formulated in a very tangible manner here. [TAGESZEITUNG] Will that not scare off the Greens' classic middle-class constituents? [Fischer] I like to be a Utopian in this case. If such deliberations scare off the middle class, then things will continue to go downhill until the point is reached where even the middle class will realize that things cannot continue in this manner. I am not advocating the expropriation of the middle class. At issue here is the realization of one's own self-interest that cannot be defined in a narrow-minded, material sense. [TAGESZEITUNG] A future national government will hardly be able to do without tax increases. Will the Greens say in advance how much more and for what the citizens will have to pay? [Fischer] The issue here is not a policy of tax increases but rather an overhaul of the tax system. If we introduce ecotaxes, we will have to back off on taxes pegged to incomes. If I demand somewhat more from people in the way of taxes on petroleum, then there must be tangible improvements in local public transportation. Too, the creative phase for both parties will not really get under way until the coalition negotiations--not in party conventions held to develop platforms. Then things will really get exciting. When it comes down to fundamental change, when various elements of society with their ideas and demands crowd their way into such negotiations as well, when a true restructuring of policies is at stake, I think that the SPD too--even Mr. Scharping--will get a kick out of it. Desire for reform, frustration with stagnation, experiments at last: That is the motto. [TAGESZEITUNG] What are the core issues of emphasis for a red-green government program? [Fischer] We need a structural revolution in energy, transportation, and waste management policy. The second area will be a restructuring of the welfare state, the attempt to stop social disintegration. The third project will be German unity. Fourth: The Europeanizing of our society, the right of immigration, and dual citizenship. And finally, we will deal with a new definition of foreign policy while at the same time retaining the tradition of the Federal Republic as a nation of peace--that is, where is this Germany headed? Will we remain oriented towards Europe or are we again going to chase old illusions of power? Will Germany become a factor for stability or a risk factor? Those are the fundamental questions for future foreign policy. [TAGESZEITUNG] Will you answer these questions on the basis of the Mannhein resolutions on foreign policy? How much popular support do the Greens expect for their demand for a gradual abandonment of the Bundeswehr and the dissolution of NATO? [Fischer] No one among us wants to dissolve NATO immediately. The question arises: How should a pan-European peace order look? And this order will transcend NATO. The Greens' program contains, by the way, a clear "Yes" to European integration--that is, the manifest incorporation of everything resolved in Mannheim as the Greens' vision into an overall European process--including the linkage of the disarming of the Bundeswehr to peace conditions in Europe that permit this. We are not advocating a new adventurism here. [TAGESZEITUNG] Does what you are explaining here so nicely mean that our resolutions are one thing and real policy something else? [Fischer] That would amount to opportunism. That may have been the case with one individual or another--the ringing party convention speeches simply sound different than internal statements. For the majority of the delegates and the party, however, that does not hold true. It is not a question of opportunism but a kind of ensuring one's own identity--precisely because in many other areas a far-reaching step has been taken in the direction of realpolitik. [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in the final analysis, will still remain of the party's foreign policy resolutions in a red-green coalition agreement? [Fischer] We will have vigorous negotiations to conduct on the issues of the Bundeswehr's mission and the reduction of its troop strength; likewise on the issues of ending armaments exports and effective measures for conversion. We will make human rights a central criterion of foreign policy and we will have to negotiate on a new, solidarity-oriented definition of Germany's role in north-south issues. [TAGESZEITUNG] What, in your opinion, do the coalition-seeking Greens have to do this election year for a red-green coalition to come about? [Fischer] We must struggle and forego everything that will result in dissention. If we were to succeed in formulating 20 salient points from the Greens' perspective on the basis of our election platform and program of principles--and do so without dissention and in a manner that transcends factions--I would emphatically advocate that they be presented, debated, and adopted at a one-day extraordinary party convention. That would once again give a boost to our motivation. [TAGESZEITUNG] Do you want to do a little retroactive repair work on the current state of party resolutions? [Fischer] No, make them more specific because our program of fundamental principles and our election platform are jumbled together in our Mannheim resolutions. What do we think we can really take on in four years? [TAGESZEITUNG] Is not a red-green coalition in essence only a playfully meant option that is being debated because the conservative-liberal governing coalition has exhausted itself without a majority in society having committed to a fundamental change of policy? [Fischer] No. A red-green coalition is the sole, seriously intended reform option. If the conservative-liberal government survives the elections, there will be no renewal--at most a restoration in the direction of a more German nationalist-oriented conservatism. A grand coalition means grand stagnation and a socialist-liberal coalition would result in a barely recognizable modicum of change with a Free Democratic Party (FDP) that is only in the government for its own sake. We are fighting to govern this country because we want to shape it. That is the old dream of 1968. In those days, we dreamt it in revolutionary terms, and today we dream it in terms of reform. The historic mission of my party lies in ecological restructuring--where critical and basic policy guidelines have not yet been decided upon. And that is, after all, a great challenge in one of the most important industrial countries of the world. That will require all our strength.
