Under the basic withdrawal treaty, Russia must get its remaining troops out by Aug. 31. The agreement on the social protection of military pensioners refers to those who permanently lived in Latvia by January, 1992, when Russia transferred the Soviet Army in the Baltics to its own jurisdiction. The retired military persons are naturalized as Latvian citizens in compliance with the Latvian law. The war pensioners are granted the status of permanent residents and the property use rights. The delegations also coordinated several paragraphs in the agreement on the Russian radar at Skrunda, Latvia. Firstly, Latvia lets Russia operate the radar station for four years and then dismantle it in 18 months. Secondly, Latvia allows Russia to keep 500 military persons and 200 civil persons to service the installation. The Latvians themselves will perform the outer guarding of the station. Thirdly, the delegations decided that the early-warning anti-missile radar is "a Russian military installation under civil control." Consequently, Skrunda won't be considered a Russian military base. The parties still disagree on the amount of rent for the radar's functioning. Russia's offer of 2 million USD per year does not satisfy Latvia. Russia has said it wants to sign the entire package of documents simultaneously. The conclusive summit of the presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Guntis Ulmanis, could take place already in the beginning of April, chief Russian delegate Sergei Zotov told reporters today. The completed round of talks was already the 13th since the beginning of interstate consultations in 1992, the Interfax news agency reported Monday. According to estimates, around 12,000 Russian military persons are still stationed in Latvia and another 3,000 in the Baltic country of Estonia. Lithuania has completely parted with the former Soviet Army.
