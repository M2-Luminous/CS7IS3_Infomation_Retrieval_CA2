FR940208-2-00179 FR940208-2-00093 Rules 46 to 49 Rules 46 to 49 provide for the conduct of oral proceedings. Rule 46, which amends former rule 45, provides for orders of a committee on a motion for in camera hearings. Subrule 46(2) has been added to clarify that the responsible Secretary is not to serve documents containing personal information filed by a panelist on a motion for an in camera hearing prior to the time for withdrawal by the panelist of documents filed under seal on the motion. Rule 47, formerly rule 46, provides that a committee may decide the procedure to be followed in an extraordinary challenge proceeding. Rule 48, formerly rule 53, provides that oral argument in a committee proceeding is at the discretion of the committee. Rule 49, formerly rule 54, provides for oral proceedings in camera. Rules 50 to 61 Rules 50 to 61 consolidate and, by amendment, clarify the responsibilities of the Secretary. Rule 50 has been added to correspond to rule 8 of the Article 1904 Panel Rules, which sets out the business hours of the Secretariat. Rule 51, formerly rule 32, provides guidance to the Secretary as to who is to receive notice on completion of the selection of the members of a committee. Rule 52, formerly rule 7, sets out the administrative support to be provided by the Secretary. The new rule removes the requirement that the Secretary should make arrangements for simultaneous translation because such a service is included in the term ``administrative support''. Rule 53, formerly rule 8, specifies that each Secretary shall maintain a file of all documents filed in each extraordinary challenge, whether or not a document was filed in accordance with these rules, reflecting that the Secretaries do not have any discretion to reject a document that is submitted for filing. The issue of whether a document is properly filed is for the committee to determine. Rule 54, formerly rule 9, provides for the forwarding of documents from the responsible Secretary to the other Secretary. Rule 55, which amends former rule 10, provides for the publication of documents. Under the new rule, both Secretaries cause a document to be published. The provision in the former rule for forwarding a document from one Secretary to the other has been removed because it is part of the Secretary's administrative practice. Rule 56, formerly rule 12, provides for the storage, wrapping, handling and access to documents filed with the Secretary, which contain personal, privileged or proprietary information. The term ``storage'' has been expanded to include storage, maintenance, handling and distribution of documents. Rule 57, formerly subrule 13(3), provides for removal from the Secretary's office of documents filed in an extraordinary challenge proceeding. Subrule 58(1), formerly part of subrule 13(1), provides for access to information in the file of an extraordinary challenge proceeding that is not personal, privileged or proprietary. Subrule 58(3), formerly part of subrule 13(1), sets out the procedure for providing copies of information to persons who have been given access to the information. Rule 59 amends former rules 20, 26 and 41 and sets out the responsibilities of the Secretary for the forwarding and service of documents, orders and decisions. Subrules 59(1) and (2) provide for the forwarding and service of documents upon the filing of a Request for Extraordinary Challenge Committee. Subrules 59(3) and (4) provide for the service of orders and decisions of a committee and of Notices of Completion of Extraordinary Challenges. Rule 60, formerly rule 56, provides for publication of the final decisions and orders of a committee. Rule 61 Rule 61, formerly rule 44, provides for the service of documents in cases where the time period fixed for filing a motion by a panelist for an in camera hearing has expired.
