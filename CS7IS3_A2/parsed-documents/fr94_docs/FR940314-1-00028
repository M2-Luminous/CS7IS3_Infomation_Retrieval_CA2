FR940314-1-00028 FR940314-1-00008 Based on agency testing of post-September 1, 1992 vehicles, the agency estimates that approximately 650,000 model year 1993 passenger cars and 18,000 light trucks do not meet the present requirement. For the final rule, the agency estimated the consumer cost of redesigning the transmission key-locking system to be $6.75 to $14.00 per vehicle. Those are maximum figures that include both the situation where a complying system must be installed and the situation in which an existing system need only be adjusted in order to comply. In that respect, those figures likely overstate costs for this rulemaking, especially those applicable to an existing system needing only a minor adjustment. Additionally, some manufacturers have likely modified model year 1993 systems to comply with the existing requirements. Therefore, the actual numbers of passenger cars and light trucks that do not now meet the requirements are probably less than the estimates suggested above. Since NHTSA did not anticipate the need for manufacturers to redesign a large number of transmission locking systems, the agency believes that it should consider whether it is appropriate to require such redesign. This is particularly true to the extent that the apparently noncomplying locking systems at issue result in essentially the same child-injury prevention safety benefits as would occur if the systems were redesigned to comply with the current requirement. As indicated above, Standard No. 114 currently requires automatic transmission vehicles with a ``park'' position to have a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key unless the transmission is locked in ``park'' or becomes locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. In other words, under the first alternative, a vehicle must be designed so that the key cannot be removed when the transmission shift lever or other shifting mechanism is in any position other than ``park.'' NHTSA is proposing to amend Standard No. 114 to instead require a key-locking system that prevents removal of the key: (1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in the park position, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key, and (2) whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than park, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. The standard would no longer address key removal when the transmission shift lever is between shift positions. (NHTSA notes that, for nearly all current designs, the key cannot be removed if the transmission shift lever is in a detent other than park. However, electronic designs can be produced which permit the key to be removed while the transmission is in a position such as drive and then automatically move the shifting mechanism and transmission to park. Both the existing language of Standard No. 114 and the proposed language permit such designs.) The basic rationale for limiting the key-removal requirement to situations where the transmission shift lever is in detent positions is that drivers are unlikely to attempt to remove the key when the transmission shift lever is between shift positions. As a practical matter, drivers are likely to either leave the transmission in the gear they had last used or attempt to put the transmission in park, before attempting key removal. The only chance for mispositioning is therefore in the latter situation, and the agency believes the chance for such mispositioning is small. Therefore, as a practical matter, when the agency decided to prohibit key removal in situations where the transmission was not in park, it was essentially addressing situations where the shift lever was in detent positions other than park. A more complete discussion of this rationale, which addresses the transmission designs currently at issue, is provided below. Since the key-removal requirement would be limited to situations where the shift mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position, it would be necessary for the agency to specify a means for determining whether the mechanism is in such position. Under the proposal, a vehicle would be considered to be in ``park'' when the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected and the vehicle will not roll away on an incline when the parking brake is disengaged. A vehicle would be considered to be in a drive gear when the transmission gear selection indicator shows that a drive gear has been selected and the vehicle can be moved under its own power. A vehicle would be considered to be in ``neutral'' if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected, the vehicle is stopped, and activation of the accelerator pedal does not cause the vehicle to move. As part of assessing the safety implications of the proposed amendment, it is necessary to evaluate the types of locking systems that would likely be produced under it. NHTSA believes that the most likely types of systems are ones like the Mazda-designed locking system that was the subject of the agency's November 1992 interpretation letter and the other locking systems that led the agency to issue letters concerning apparent noncompliances.
