The "circular" states: Since the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, advocated by Deng Xiaoping and other veteran proletarian revolutionaries, the Army and the civilians throughout the country have extensively launched the Army-civilian joint activity of building socialist spiritual civilization to meet the demand of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, thereby achieving fruitful results. In his report to the 14th National CPC Congress, Comrade Jiang Zemin demanded that "greater efforts should be made to launch such mass activities as the Army-civilian joint activity and the police-civilian joint activity of building civilized units in order to implement the building of spiritual civilization down to grass-roots organizations in both urban and rural areas." In order to implement the series of instructions given by the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of the socialist spiritual civilization, to meet the demand that the PLA units should march in the van of the society in building spiritual civilization, and to continuously deepen the Army-civilian joint building activity, the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee and the General Political Department of the PLA have decided to commend in October this year a number of units advanced in launching the Army-civilian joint building activity. The "circular" stresses: Those grass-roots units which have scored remarkable achievements in the army-civilian joint activity of building the socialist spiritual civilization should be recommended for commendation. Major conditions are: The units whose Army and local leaders have attached importance to the activity, whose organizations are perfect, and which have plans and specific measures for joint building activity; the units that have launched the activity closely around the principle of training a new generation of people who are politically aware, morally sound, well educated, disciplined, and that have effected an obvious improvement in the ideas, morality, and cultural expertise of their soldiers and civilians; the units that have adapted themselves to the new situation of building the socialist market economic structure, have continuously created and summarized new experiences, and have played an exemplary role in building spiritual civilization in their own areas; and the units where Army and local personnel learn from and support each other and the relations between Army and local personnel are harmonious. The "circular" demands: All localities and all PLA units should regard the process of recommending advanced units for commendation as the process of profoundly and realistically launching the Army-civilian joint building activity, should conscientiously research and draw up plans and measures for deepening this activity under the new situation, and should further mobilize the initiative of the vast numbers of soldiers and civilians in participating in this activity.
