FR941011-2-00026 FR941011-2-00008 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [Docket No. 940844&hyph;4282; I.D. 082394C] RIN 0648&hyph;AG75 West Coast Salmon Fisheries; Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Notice of program for financial assistance. SUMMARY: NMFS establishes a program, the Northwest Emergency Assistance Plan (NEAP), that will provide $12 million of assistance to salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest who have been affected by a fishery resource disaster during 1992 through 1994, while providing conservation benefits to salmon resources. These disaster relief funds, which were made available under the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act (IFA), will be applied toward the following three programs, administered by the following intermediaries: A vessel permit buyout program_Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife; and a habitat restoration jobs program_Soil Conservation Services (SCS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); and a data collection jobs program_Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission (PSMFC). The intent is to provide assistance to those commercial fishermen who have recently participated in the salmon fisheries, who were substantially reliant on West Coast salmon resources for their income, and who suffered an uninsured loss as a result of a significant reduction in income because of the resource disaster. The intent is also to provide this assistance in a manner likely to contribute to conservation/restoration efforts for salmon. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 11, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Bruce Morehead, (301) 713&hyph;2358, or Stephen Freese, (206) 526&hyph;6113. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On May 26, 1994, the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) declared a fishery disaster and, with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), announced a $15.7 million emergency aid package for Oregon, Washington, and northern California. This aid is intended to alleviate the economic hardship suffered by individuals and communities because of the collapse of salmon stocks in fishing areas along the Northwest coast. Included in this package is $12 million available under the section 308(d) of the Interjurisdictional Fisheries Act of 1986, 16 U.S.C. 4107(d), to undertake the NEAP program, as described in this notice. In addition, $3 million is being administered by the Rural Development Administration (RDA) of USDA. Grants by RDA will be made to public bodies and private nonprofit corporations to finance development of small business enterprises in cities under 50,000 in population. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) of the Department of Commerce is making $882,000 available, instead of the $700,000 originally announced as part of the $15.7 million aid package. Grants by EDA have been earmarked to communities for tourism development and to tribes for stream reclamation. In addition to the $15.7 million package, aid to salmon fishermen is also being provided by the Small Business Administration and the Farmers Home Administration, in the form of loans and debt restructuring programs, and by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the form of unemployment assistance, up to $14 million, to dislocated Washington, Oregon, and California fishermen who are unemployed as a direct result of the continuing effects of El Ni√±o on salmon fishing. On behalf of the Secretary, NMFS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) on June 3, 1994 (59 FR 28838), to solicit public comment on issues to be considered in development and implementation of the $12 million NEAP program. In addition to the ANPR, NOAA's Office of Sustainable Development and Intergovernmental Affairs arranged a series of eight town meetings designed to gather information about the effects of the decline in the salmon resources on local communities and fishermen. A notice of the proposed program, which included responses to comments received on the ANPR, was published on September 7, 1994 (59 FR 46224). Comments received in response to that notice are summarized and responded to in this document.
