Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, at 20th, Special, Session of the Republic of Tatarstan Supreme Soviet on 6 June 1994: "Revisions to the Program of Targeted Social Protection of the Population of the Republic of Tatarstan"] [Text] We are discussing at this session an urgent present-day problem--how to avert increasing crisis phenomena in the republic's economy. The most important question arises: What is the situation with regard to people's daily urgent requirements, and what can we guarantee them in the foreseeable future? Unless an answer to this question is obtained, how can we win the trust and support of our population in the business of the continued implementation of reforms? We need to find within ourselves courage and honesty and tell primarily ourselves and the people what our lives will be like henceforward: What will the living standard be, how can we pay worthy tribute to our veterans for their labor invested in the name of our welfare, what will be the fate of our children today, and what will they inherit from us tomorrow. We need to make our position clear--the economy for man or man for the economy. Our practical actions will be the answer to all these difficult questions. It is from these positions that I would like to discuss all problems connected with the government's social policy for this period of time in respect primarily to children and veterans, and in our republic they constitute more than 2.3 million persons, or 55 percent of the total number of inhabitants. We all need to recognize that, in any event, regardless of the state of the economy, concern for their living standard is on our conscience and will depend on the results of the labor of those in work and the efficiency of the state mechanism of income redistribution, that is, the budget. Considering that the subsistence level, which, as we know, prevents death by starvation, today constitutes approximately R50,000 a month per person and that, in addition, subsidized payments in the amount of approximately R30,000 are allocated from the republic budget monthly for each inhabitant of the republic, regardless of his income level, which constitutes R11 billion, the subsistence level for children and veterans guaranteed by society will thus constitute approximately R80,000 a month on average. This is the line beyond which lies starvation, the degradation of the personality, and social upheaval, with all the ensuing consequences. This means that we have as of the present to guarantee from various sources of funding (the wages of those in work, the retirement fund, the targeted social protection fund, the republic budget) the appropriation of a minimum of R162 billion of [word illegible] funds, R85 billion of this for children. For what proportion of this expenditure can the state realistically provide, and for what, the working section of the populace? Let us try to comprehend how efficiently we are working, what the efficiency of our economy is, and what is dependent on all of us for the creation of opportunities for an increase in the growth [as published] of income of the approximately R1.5 million persons employed in the republic. Inasmuch as foodstuffs account for the bulk of individual spending, I shall permit myself to start with agriculture here. It is hard to exaggerate the role of agricultural production in the republic's economy. It is thanks largely to the agricultural workers and the single-minded work of the president of the republic, the administration chiefs, and the agricultural activists that the stable provision of the republic's populace with food has been established. The living standard of those employed in agricultural production, and this is 17 percent of the republic's able-bodied population, is markedly higher than in the Russian Federation on average. Thus, the average monthly wage in the month of April in agriculture constituted R94,200, which is 25 percent higher than analogous indicators for Russia, and this despite the fact that the average monthly wage in Russia in the national economy as a whole is 20 percent higher than in Tatarstan. This means that the rural worker is not only worthily discharging his obligations to the children and veterans, but has taken on some of the obligations of the employees of industry on administrative leave. We see the development of the positive trends of a rise in the living standard by way of an increase in the income of the agricultural workers in the realization of the following principles: --the establishment of private ownership of the land, starting with long-term land leasehold relationships and an increase in the size of the subsidiary plots; --state protectionism in the sales markets; --a binding obligation on the part of the state in respect to timely payments for agricultural products that it has commissioned; --a voluntary approach in the choice of forms of management and the sale of one's own products; --a differentiated pricing policy. During the consideration of the bills on social policy submitted to the session today, the observations and expectations expressed by the administration chiefs and kolkhoz and sovkhoz leaders to the effect that we are not taking account of the income obtained from the subsidiary plots when determining the amount of the compensation payments from the targeted social support fund proved very useful. The draft revisions to the Targeted Social Protection Program contains, considering your expressed wishes, a procedure of the determination of aggregate per capita income with regard to the income from the personal subsidiary plots. The situation in industry is far more complicated. We are talking about 526,000 employees, or 35 percent of persons employed in the republic's economy. It is here, unfortunately, that the most negative trends in terms of the living standard are being observed. The average monthly wage in the industry of Tatarstan, for example, is 26 percent lower than the analogous indicator for Russia. It may be observed also that in the past nine months the ratio in industry of the average wage per employee to the subsistence level has declined by a factor of 1.5. It is not hard to imagine what will have happened by the end of the present year if this trend persists. It would be unfair not to mention that, despite the entire complexity of the situation, a number of major industrial enterprises and associations such as the Tatneft Stock Company, the Kama Truck Plant Stock Company, petrochemical plants, and others are managing to maintain the living standard of the employees and their families and, in a number of cases, to raise it, even. Such enterprises should, understandably, be supported by the state first and foremost, and they, in turn, should guarantee those employed in production a minimum wage not less than the cost of the minimum consumer budget. Similar approaches should be employed in respect to all other enterprises also on the basis of a selective approach [as published]. It is essential, when employing the selective approach, aside from all else, to use a separate balance sheet with the introduction of accounts for expenditure on the social infrastructure. These accounts will afford an opportunity to see the viability of basic production and make it possible to obtain information on the cost of social functions, which should subsequently be assumed by the state. Unfortunately, we have to affirm that at a number of enterprises the extent of sold output is insufficient for allocations to the retirement fund and the payment of wages at least up to the subsistence level. Availing themselves of the absence of a mechanism of state control, these enterprises have begun a process of self-corrosion: On the strength of enterprises' public assets, created to a large extent by the labor of previous generations, they are obtaining from the banks financial resources at a high rate of interest and channeling more than 75 percent of these resources into the wage fund. Each ruble thus borrowed from the bank and channeled into this corrosion requires society to pay back to the bank within a year no fewer than R2.5. A process of the self-corrosion of the resources of all of society and our national wealth thus arises. In addition, such social dependence based on free resources and an absence of responsibility has engendered and is increasing rapidly various forms of concealed unemployment. The motivation to labor is disappearing, wage-leveling is flourishing. As of today, concealed unemployment numbers approximately 200,000 persons. Would it not be more beneficial to give society this ruble from the employment fund, thereby saving R2.5? Would it not make more sense to channel these resources into the return of the arrears to the countryside by means of the building of facilities of a social infrastructure and for the development of the health care, culture, education, and intellectual potential of society, and also for an increase in the financial support for veterans? A specific mechanism of realization of the program for the support of veterans could be the government's transfer of part of the state's share of the stock in privatized enterprises for management by specialized trust companies and those same banks, but on an entirely different, commercial, basis. The resources obtained from this should be channeled into an enhancement of veterans' living standard. We would thereby be ensuring fairness in the privatization of public property created to a large extent by the labor of preceding generations. Merely in respect to 27 industrial enterprises that were surveyed, the sum total of arrears to the banks amounts to R39 billion, which constitutes the lion's share of the value of these enterprises' assets. There is something here for us all to think about and to decide what we will, in fact, leave our children. The question arises: Who allowed the banks to dispose of public assets, and what has happened to the control of the National Bank, if it is in fact defending the interests of the economy of Tatarstan? If the banks are permitted to continue this practice, we will be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. The conclusion that suggests itself is that credit must not be granted against the surety of public assets without government permission. It is also obvious today that the government cannot remain aloof from financial support for the enterprises of the aviation complex and certain others that as of this time have specific promising developments and a big future. The government must help them overcome the arrears problem, fund the social infrastructure, and allocate investment resources for structural reorganization and, in particular cases, according to harmonized lists, resources from the employment fund for compensation payments up to the subsistence level for highly skilled specialists who are on administrative leave. There is no doubt that these methods, provided they are fulfilled, will make it possible to maintain and enhance individuals' living standard. The bill "The Minimum Wage," which provides for employers' liability for a failure to comply with the laws of Tatarstan in this respect, has been prepared for your attention. The center of gravity of the resolution of social problems of the transitional period will increasingly shift in the direction of the budget and will thereby engender the preconditions for a decline in the living standard of the population of the republic. The arising vacuum of society's sources of income may be filled only by the elaboration of adequate measures of state regulation under the conditions of a market economy and state support for enterprise. The support of enterprise demands that the state and its official representatives gradually withdraw from the spheres of economic activity in which the development of the private sector is required. In market economics, disagreements on economic matters in the fields to which the writ of the state does not run should be resolved in legal form. We must have the opportunity to rely on the judicial system in the defense of the rights of private individuals against encroachments on the part of the government. It is essential also to raise the level of pay of employees of the justice system, the militia, and the tax authorities, such that it be appreciably higher than the wages in other fields. Work in these authorities should be held in high regard. But there should at the same time be an increase also in their responsibility for timely and high-quality treasury receipts and for the protection of the interests of society, including the fledgling nonstate structures, in accordance with the rules of international law. They are called on also to contribute actively to the transition of entrepreneurs from the "shadow" economy to the legal tax space, with regard to the specific features of the transitional period expressed in the discrepancy between the old operative laws and the basic principles of the market economy. As you know, the state itself is a major employer and provides jobs for 286,000 persons, which constitutes 19 percent of the total numbers of those in employment in the republic. An analysis shows that the average wages in April of the employees of health care and social security exceeded by more than R50,000 the average wage of persons employed in the field of culture, art, and research. The living standard of those employed in the sphere of culture, art, and research is below the republic average. This state of affairs is impermissible. The government, as an employer, should in the transitional period provide for an average monthly wage not less than the cost of the minimum consumer budget. We have simultaneously to devise a mechanism of the adaptation of these spheres to market conditions. Thus, the state is directly responsible in the transitional period for the living standard of children, veterans, and persons on the public payroll--2,316,000 persons altogether--and this means 62 percent of the republic's population. This means that all the conditions should be created for the remaining 38 percent of the population of the republic for the application of their entrepreneurial activity. And whether they work for society or go into the "shadow" economy will depend on the rationality of the structure of our tax field. There are two paths of the possible behavior of the state aimed at maintaining the living standard of the population--passive and active. The first path--passive--is geared to the artificial containment of prices and an increase in subsidies in all areas. With this approach, the number of persons living below the subsistence level will have grown by almost 1.5 million by December of this year. This would be a progressive figure, which our budget could not sustain. The second path--active--is oriented toward high personal income and presupposes the creation for the able-bodied population of the conditions for a display of initiative and enterprise and a stimulation of the role of the state in maintaining an adequate living standard for veterans, children, and persons on the public payroll. It is to this path that I have, in fact, devoted my speech, for I consider it the sole correct one. Thanks to the persevering, dogged labor of the president, the Supreme Soviet, and the government headed by the prime minister, sufficient political potential has been created for the start of immediate, dynamic, and fundamental transformations in the economy of the republic, and I hope that we will be up to this task. Thank you for your attention!
