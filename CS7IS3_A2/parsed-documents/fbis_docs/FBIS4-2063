The ministry's report based on the mainland's diplomatic offensive from the period September 1993 to February 1994.

Countries included in the list as being targeted by the mainland were Malawi, the Central African Republic, Haiti, (?Belize) and Niger. The mainland's money comes in the form of low interest loans among other things.
