Kozyrev and Gasanov, she said, discussed the possibility of a cease-fire and signing an agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan as soon as possible. As Sidorova said, negotiations between the two sides are progressing with difficulty, since many grievances and suspicions have built up between them during the conflict. According to Sidorova, "a further escalation of hostilities is dangerous not only for the two nations which are actually engaged in annihilating each other: It poses a threat to stability in the region as a whole. That is why foremost importance is attached to the need to stop military actions," she said. The head of Russian diplomacy may also confer with Armenia's Foreign Minister, Vagan Papazian, in Moscow in the near future, Sidorova said. It is possible that the Presidents of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan - Boris Yeltsin, Levon Ter-Petrosyan and Geydar Aliyev, will meet in Moscow before the end of this month.
