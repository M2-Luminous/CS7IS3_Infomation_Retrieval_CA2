Under the new situation of reform and opening up in recent years, many leading cadres have taken note of going deep into the realities of life, doing investigations and studies, and creatively implementing central principles and policies in connection with practice, and they have scored gratifying achievements. However, there are also some comrades who have slackened their efforts to conduct investigation and study. According to these people, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics has outlined the blueprint, the party's basic line has illuminated the direction, and reform and opening up have been practiced for more than a decade. Hence, no major problems are likely to crop up. Believing that they are proficient and familiar with their jobs, they are not willing to go deep into the realities of life and maintain contacts with the masses. Instead of doing meticulous investigation and study, they are satisfied with reading documents and listening to reports. They are used to sitting in offices, issuing orders, and willfully making policy decisions. Consequently, this gives rise to subjectivism, or sticking to old conventions which lag behind the masses and the situation, or blindly seeking advanced growth which is beyond one's capacity. To prevent the occurrence of these problems, it is necessary to conduct investigation and study in a thorough manner and to guard against subjectivism. The year 1994 is a very crucial one for China's reform, opening up, and modernization program. The pace of reform has been accelerated and its endurance is great. As the establishment of a socialist market economic system is a brand new topic, leading cadres are pupils in this issue. We should correctly understand and handle relations between reform, development, and stability; correctly understand and handle the two different types of contradictions; earnestly study the form of expression and development trend of the contradictions among the people in the new situation; and particularly take note of the new problems arising from the adjustment of the relations and structure of interests in the course of deepened reform. Hence, it is necessary to go deep into the realities of life, conduct investigation and study, apply Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics to analyze and resolve problems, overcome difficulties, and forge ahead. To do a good job of investigation and study, the most important thing is to attentively listen to the voice of the masses and have a comprehensive understanding of the true situation of the grass-roots levels. It will be impossible for leaders to have a clear idea of the true situation of the grass-roots levels by just scratching the surface, doing things perfunctorily, and making cursory observations. Investigation and study require a correct guiding ideology and prevention of subjectivism. Taking several bags with them before conducting investigation and study, some cadres are good at carefully watching the situation. They offer whatever the higher authorities want and regard whatever their superior say as the truth. Therefore, it is necessary to proceed from objective reality in conducting investigation. Besides going to the rich and advanced regions, they should also go to the poor and backward regions. Besides listening to good-sounding words, they should also listen to words and advice unpleasant to the ear. Instead of going to the grass-roots levels with a predetermined conclusion and framework, they should insist on the practice of drawing conclusions after conducting investigation and study, which should be based on scientific representation. It is necessary to seriously analyze and study the new problems and experiences occurring in reform and opening up. We should not hastily negate the newly emerging things which conform to reform and development or speak highly of and laud erroneous behavior which goes counter to the socialist market economy. It is necessary to seriously analyze the root cause of the negative phenomena cropping in the course of reform and to propose ways to resolve them. Through investigation, it is necessary to study how to integrate the line, principles, and policies of the central authorities with the practice of the local departments and units and continue to create a new situation. Comrade Mao Zedong had a motto: "No investigation, no right to speak." While doing revolution and construction in the past, we had benefited a lot from seriously conducting investigation and study, and also suffered from subjectivism. We must firmly bear in mind both positive and negative experiences. Now the enthusiasm of all localities is running high and a number of localities have proposed new ideas for implementing the ideas of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. This is indeed gratifying. However, we must have grounds for all this as well as resolute measures for implementation. As the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics will encounter numerous tasks and changes with each passing day, leading cadres at all levels shoulder heavy responsibility. Under such circumstances, it is particularly necessary to sincerely take practice as the classroom and the masses as teachers, constantly improve work style and methods, and remarkably accomplish tasks.
