For Dr. Eberhard von Perfall, as CEO of Ruhrkohl Umwelt GmbH in Essen, this was the realization of a "dream of true recycling": 32,000 metric tons of synthetic oil will now be produced from 40,000 metric tons of mixed plastic waste annually. Two years ago Wolfram Brueck was happy that the operators of the Bottrop coal-oil facility (KAB) were able to show him a way out of the terrible dilemma of waste disposal of mixed plastic waste. This was because the Managing Director of Dual Systems Deutschland (DSD) in Cologne did not find in the plastics industry nearly the recycling capacity urgently needed for long-term compliance with the recycling quotas set by the legislature. With the start of using plastic as raw material in Bottrop, he can now believe in a change. Since the beginning of the year, the KAB has been changing polymer packaging waste back into syncrude [synthetic crude oil]--a recycling product which is scarcely distinguishable from light mineral oil and can be used again without loss in quality as a high-grade oil refinery product. Eight hundred kg of oil are produced from one metric ton of mixed plastic, according to the estimate of the current facility's level of efficiency in processing material made by Dr. Eberhard von Perfall to the guests at the official start of operations on April 12th. At the same time, the CEO of Ruhrkohle Umwelt GmbH in Essen, which operates the facility together with Veba Oil AG, Gelsenkirchen, stressed the great gain in energy. He claims that only about 10% of the energy content (in terms of the energy which would be released if the plastic waste were incinerated) is lost though hydrogenation. "We are not in essence entering new territory here," said Dr. Hubert Heneka referring to the already tested technique. According to the President and CEO of Veba Oil AG, a technique which has been refined over decades is being used to solve a current waste problem: the reconversion of used packing plastic back into the original oil components. Using the modified Bergius Pier process, from 1981 to 1987 the KAB already converted around 250,000 metric tons of hard coal into liquid products. After coal hydrogenation could no longer be continued for economic reasons, the operators modified the facility for hydrogenation of petroleum residue using the Veba-Combi-Cracking process(VCC). In 1991 authorization for processing used waste oil, used solvents, and varnish or paint sludge was broadened to include the recycling of materials containing PCP. In April of 1992 the recycling of plastic waste was at last at hand. The insensitivity of the VCC process toward the content of the material involved was the technical prerequisite [for this to work], the pressure for recycling coming from the government's packing guidelines was the economic prerequisite. A major trial which was carried out at that time in which for the first time 60 metric tons of plastic waste was hydrogenated together with heavy petroleum residue confirmed the basic suitability of the process. But according to Heneka, it also made it clear that procedural steps developed for coal hydrogenation were too expensive for industrial recycling of plastic waste. Therefore an primary system had to be conceptualized and made, by means of which the polymers supplied as granular material are transferred as a fluid permitting them to be pumped together with the petroleum residue into the hydrogenation section. Heneka: "It is only this newly developed step in the process, the depolymerization, which now satisfies the requirement of recycling five metric tons per hour on a continuous basis." After 12 months under construction, the expanded facility with a total annual capacity of around 200,000 metric tons was ready for operation to recycle 40,000 metric tons of waste plastic per year. Operators had invested around 20 million German marks in modifications of the KAB, particularly in the core of the plastic preparation process, the depolymerization reactor. Here, completely cut off from the external world, the large plastic molecules are thermally split at temperatures of 350 to 400�C, so that they can be pumped without problem along with vacuum residue, additives and hydrogen into the actual hydrogenation system. In the hydrogenation reactor, syncrude (synthetic crude oil), hydrocarbon gas and hydrogenated bitumen are produced at a processing pressure of 300 bar and [a temperature of] 470�C. The hydrochloric acid released from the PVC during depolimerization is reclaimed as liquid hydrochloric acid in an auxiliary system and handed over marketing. A pipeline directly links the KAB with the nearby [oil refinery of] Ruhroel-Raffinerie in Scholven. In conjunction with the Kokerei Prosper [coke-oven plant], the delivery of the product as well as the service of the facility is thus efficiently assured. Still, the KAB operators have not yet passed the break-even point in plastic waste recycling. With an annual throughput of 40,000 metric tons of plastic waste, the syncrude produced in the Bottrop hydrogenation plant is about three to four times as expensive as comparable crude oil on the Rotterdam market. Dr. Hubert Heneka: "We currently need a turnover of around 800 GM [German marks] per metric ton. But we want to take the offensive in this business and ensure for ourselves a large share of the market in plastic waste recycling." The speaker from Veba Oil hopes to be able to cut costs in half if the legal requirements for expanding the capacity can be managed quickly with the city of Bottrop. Presuming that a rapid agreement can be reached, an annual capacity of 120,000 metric tons for recycling of plastic as a raw material would already be available in 1995. But Kurt Schmitz, the mayor of the urban district of Bottrop, "has trouble imagining" at this time an expansion of the facility. Substantial problems with acceptance already had to be overcome when the KAB first began [working with] the disposal of problem waste. Through the contributions made by DSD in recycling, the process today is, however, already paying off for the operators: according to the words of its managing director Wolfram Brueck, Dual System Deutschland currently pays 757 German marks per metric ton of plastic delivered for recycling in Bottrop. The common goal is to make it economically competitive with incineration. Environmental Minister Toepfer, who put the incineration costs at around 500 marks per metric ton at this time in Germany, was convinced at the official start-up of recycling plastic as raw material in Bottrop: "The horrific numbers of the high utilization costs are gradually becoming a thing of the past."
