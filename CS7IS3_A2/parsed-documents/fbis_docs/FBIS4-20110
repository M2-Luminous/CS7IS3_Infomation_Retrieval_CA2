Herr Jochen Borchert, German Agriculture Minister, told journalists at an EC meeting in Luxembourg that he was now seeking "a European solution." This appears to be a significant climb-down, as Herr Horst Seehofer, the German Health Minister, said last month that Germany would take unilateral action against British beef imports. The German position has found no sympathy in Brussels, where Agriculture and Health Ministers have pronounced themselves content with measures taken by Britain to ensure that meat from infected cows does not enter the human food chain. The European Commission has also warned Germany that unilateral restrictions would be illegal. The battle is not yet over. Herr Borchert will be pushing the Commission to institute more screening procedures for beef, but it appears that the threat of unilateral action has been withdrawn. However, Mrs Gillian Shephard, Britain's Agriculture Minister, said: "It is clearly a retreat by the Germans. I am not prepared to tolerate any question of a unilateral ban on a British product." She has accused Germany of scare-mongering by voicing fears about British beef. These, she contended, were having a devastating effect on an export business worth some 8 million pounds a year, and were affecting other British products such as lamb. To encourage Germany to back down, the Commission has announced measures that include a study of procedures for the processing of meat-and-bone meal, considered the primary cause of infection. Britain has already banned the feeding of cows on meal from other ruminants, after recognition that meal from diseased sheep was the most likely cause of cow infection.
