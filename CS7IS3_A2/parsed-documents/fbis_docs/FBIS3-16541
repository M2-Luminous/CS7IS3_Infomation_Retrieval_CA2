This was stated by Army General Pavel Grachev, chief of the Russian military department, at a meeting with journalists. He is not satisfied with how the agreement is being observed as "none of the sides is totally fulfilling the obligations undertaken." "Unfortunately, percentage-wise the Azerbaijani side is the one least fulfilling the agreement," Pavel Grachev noted. The leadership of Azerbaijan, in the minister's words, is categorically against bringing troops into the conflict region, which would make it possible to withdraw the troops of both sides some 20-30 km from where they are deployed. Grachev called this circumstance "a stumbling block." The Russian defense minister informed journalists that on 15 March he refused to meet the heads of the military departments of Armenia and Azerbaijan, who arrived in Moscow, and stated that he does not intend to meet them until they comply with the agreement which had been signed with his participation.
