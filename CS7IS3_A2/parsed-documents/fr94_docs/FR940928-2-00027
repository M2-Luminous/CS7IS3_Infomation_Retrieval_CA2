Take notice that on September 16, 1994 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) submitted for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing. Texas Eastern states that these revised tariff sheets are being submitted in response to Commission Order No. 566. 1 1 Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions, 59 FR 32885 (June 27, 1994, III FERC Stats. & Regs. Preambles Paragraph 30,997 (June 17, 1994). Texas Eastern states that on September 1, 1994, in Docket No. MT94&hyph;22&hyph;000, it filed sheets in response to Order No. 566. Subsequently, the Commission Staff notified Texas Eastern that there was a technical error on the tariff sheets as filed. The error did not affect the proposed language or the pagination, but was simply a spacing error. In light of such error, Texas Eastern withdrew its September 1, 1994 filing. This filing replaces the withdrawn filing. Texas Eastern states that these tariff sheets (1) modify Section 2.4 and delete Section 16.3 of the General Terms and Conditions, which relate to information on the availability of capacity, (2) revise Section 3.2 of the General Terms and Conditions, which refers to the information required for a valid request for transportation service, and (3) update Section 16 of the General Terms and Conditions. The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is October 1, 1994. Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Sections 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before September 29, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Public Reference Room.
