According to information available, Moscow has organized the talks at the request of the Armenian side. Another attempt to bring about a change in the political regulation of the Armenian-Azeri conflict will be made at the meeting with the participation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. A pre-meeting dialogue by the heads of foreign offices of Azerbaijan and Armenia will take place in Moscow as well. The questions discussed by the foreign ministers will be the same for the presidents. Diplomatic experts believe that Moscow and Yerevan will try to force Baku to agree to a plan that has been worked out by the adviser of the Russian president, Andranik Migranian [name as received]. According to this plan, Azerbaijan will have to guarantee the granting of status of broad self-government and the according political status to Nagorno-Karabakh. The plan's terms also include the creation of the so-called "humanitarian corridors" from Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh through Lachin and Kelbadzhar in exchange for peace. Moreover, this plan envisions the creation of a "demilitarized zone" along all the perimeter of Nagorno-Karabakh." The proposal also envisages measures providing regular transport of energy and free flow of communications in the Transcaucasian region. In particular, the plan also sees the creation of a railroad command post that would provide strict management of the railways.
