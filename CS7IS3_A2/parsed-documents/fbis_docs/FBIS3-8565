Russia announced its interest in joining on February 28 after consultation with NATO experts. The Czech Republic respects the plan, Klaus said, adding that "our sole task is, along with NATO's member states, to fill the plan with something of substance." "We understand the Partnership for Peace unambiguously as a mechanism of our strategical aim, which is the admission of the Czech Republic to NATO," he said. Klaus is to sign a general agreement on Czech participation in the scheme in Brussels on Thursday. The programme was approved at the NATO summit in Brussels on January 10-11 this year. Since then Slovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have added their signatures to the project.
