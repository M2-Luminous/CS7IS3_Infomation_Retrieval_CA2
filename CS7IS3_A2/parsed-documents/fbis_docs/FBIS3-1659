Meanwhile, Britain, in violating the understanding reached between China and Britain for the confidentiality of the contents of the Sino-British talks, published a lengthy, 10,000-word white paper, thus unilaterally disclosing the details of talks. The next day, the Hong Kong Government published in the gazette the second-phase political system bill. The series of actions are by no means accidental. They are an inevitable outcome of Britain changing its policy toward China and clinging to the "three violations" stand. They amply demonstrate that Britain alone has closed the door to negotiations and has taken the road of all-out confrontation with China on the question of Hong Kong's political system. All Chinese people, including the people of Hong Kong, absolutely cannot tolerate Britain's long-premeditated actions. As is universally known, Patten, as early as in 1992, shortly after he assumed the post of Hong Kong governor, assumed a facade of benevolence and, under the banner of "expanding democracy," systematically and step by step peddled the political system bill in an attempt to change Hong Kong's current political system and to promote pro-British and anti-Chinese elements in the political arena so that after 1997 Hong Kong would become an independent or semi-independent political entity controlled by Britain but beyond the reach of the Chinese central government. His sinister intentions are all too clear. For starters, in October 1992, Patten, without previous announcements, suddenly dished up the political system bill in his government work report, thus breaking the state of consultations and cooperation which had existed between China and Britain since the signing, through negotiations, of the Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong question. As a result, open polemics ensued for as long as six months. Then, last April Britain was compelled to begin negotiations with China on the question of the 1994-95 Hong Kong election arrangements. At the negotiating table, however, Britain constantly resorted to double-level tactics, uttering glib words while secretly playing small tricks and trying by hook and by crook to impede the progress of the negotiations. Later on, when China and Britain almost reached agreement on the question of elections for the district board and the two municipal councils, Britain raised news issues and insisted on including in the negotiations the method for holding the Legco elections. It also flagrantly announced the suspension of the negotiations on election arrangements for regional organizations, and it unilaterally proceeded to enact laws. Despite all these things, China still repeatedly stated that on the precondition that Britain withdrew some of its bills from the Legco, the door to negotiations would be wide open. However, Britain ignored the Chinese statements and thus shut the door to negotiations. The aforesaid facts clearly show that both prior to and during the negotiations, or during the three crucial stages that led to the breakup of negotiations, Britain demonstrated no sincerity whatsoever for cooperating with China; on the contrary, it has gone farther and farther down the road of confrontation. Recently Patten took great pains to travel to Australia, thus more openly trying to create public support and to solicit international support for the adoption and implementation of his political system bill. On 19 January, upon returning from his visit to Australia, he hurriedly submitted the partial political system bill for adoption by the Legco. Meanwhile, Britain also published a white paper. Over the past year or so, the "farces" carried out by Chris Patten were so closely staged one after another that it can be seen that they were arranged meticulously and long premeditated. Up to the present, Britain still keeps saying something like Chris Patten's "three violations" constitutional reform package is aimed at promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and has comprehensively considered the aspirations of the Hong Kong people. How pleasant this is to the ears. However, people have long ago put a big question mark over Britain's confession in light of its deeds. Everybody knows that the Hong Kong people's maximum interests lie in maintaining Hong Kong's prosperity and stability and in bringing about a stable transition and smooth takeover of political power in Hong Kong in 1997. The "Basic Law" has been formulated over four or more years of deliberations and drafts, and in the process the broad masses of the Hong Kong people were fully consulted and their opinions were absorbed. One of its important principles is to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. It is stipulated in both the preamble and general principles of the "Basic Law" that the socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong SAR and that the existing capitalist system and way of life shall not be changed for 50 years. Articles 45 and 68 of the "Basic Law" provide that Hong Kong's political system should be developed "in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong SAR and in accordance with the principle of a gradual and orderly progress." Maintaining Hong Kong's existing system and following the principle of a "gradual and orderly progress" are both aimed at ensuring Hong Kong's stable development and at bringing about the transition, the takeover of political power, and the establishment of a Hong Kong SAR government and a legislative council in a state of stability in Hong Kong. Therefore, these principles, which have been expounded in the "Basic Law" and which have identified with the broad masses of the Hong Kong people, are truly those which are in keeping with the fundamental interests and aspirations of the Hong Kong people. Without consulting any Hong Kong residents, however, Chris Patten hastily submitted a political system bill less than three months after taking office in Hong Kong. Then, in ignoring the call of people from various circles in Hong Kong for settling Hong Kong's 1994-95 electoral arrangements through negotiations, he forced the bill through the Legco. How can this express and reflect the aspirations and interests of the Hong Kong people? The Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulates that the British administration of Hong Kong will terminate on 30 June 1997 and that the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997. China has reiterated that as component parts of the British political body administering Hong Kong, the last British-Hong Kong district boards, the two municipal councils, and the Legco will definitely be terminated together with the end of the British administration of Hong Kong. Under the condition that China and Britain reach no agreements on the arrangements for the 1994-95 elections, the three-level bodies produced on the basis of the partial electoral bill passed by the British-Hong Kong Legco or any other electoral bill possibly to be passed in the future will be brought to an end as the British administration comes to an end, and they cannot be extended beyond the year 1997. If Chris Patten believes that this bill can be consolidated in the form of the law once it is passed and that the three-level bodies produced on the basis of this bill can be automatically continued after 1997, this is a badly mistaken fantasy. The times are progressing forward, and Hong Kong's future destiny is in the hands of the Chinese people, including the broad masses of the Hong Kong compatriots. No matter how far Britain confronts China over the issue of Hong Kong's political system, it can by no means resist the wheel of history, which is rolling forward. People on the Chinese side maintain that as long as the Hong Kong compatriots and the inland people make concerted efforts to properly and comprehensively implement "one country, two systems," Hong Kong will have a future of incomparable brightness.
