Upheaval in Germany's Industrial Research Infrastructure 2. Restructuring of Industrial Research: Elements of New Political Efforts Support for Research and Technology Is a Long-Term Investment and Does not Serve to Overcome the Current Crisis New Technological Concentrations and Their Increasing Interlinking New Functions of Technological Research and Industrial Innovation Develop Box 1: Market Opportunities for Eastern German Industrial Research: Modern Technological Strategies Necessary Regions Need a `Mix' of Industrial Research at the `Middle' Level of Technology and a `Wide Range' Box 2: Industrial Research in the Old Laender--Example: Baden-Wuerttemberg Industrial Research in Eastern Germany Needs Preferential Treatment in Order to Have a Chance to Adjust With the Double Structural Change Box 3: Research and Technology Support Activities by the Old Laender (according to the BDI [Federal Association of German Industry] Handbook of Research and Innovation Support in 1992) Stocktaking and Specific Restructuring of the Entire German Industrial Research Landscape Box 4: Development of the Market for Research and Development in the Old Laender Final Document Within the framework of a research contract from the Federal Ministry of Economics, the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems Technology and Innovation Research, Karlsruhe, and the Institute for Economic Research, Halle, Berlin Office, organized a hearing on 8 and 9 April 1992 in Suhl/Thuringia on the survival problems of industrial research establishments in the new laender. More than 30 experts from the economic sector, research and politics from the entire FRG took part. The participants expressed themselves very openly, with criticism and constructiveness, and as complicating conditions for restructuring the eastern German research landscape they mentioned: - the slim market for research and development work; - the great uncertainty about the economic development, which could last another five to seven years; - the barriers to entering the market, which many eastern German enterprises must overcome against the established competition. The participants in the workshop agreed on the following recommendations: 1. Industrial research must be retained in its core sectors, or the process of reindustrialization will be even more delayed. Industrial research establishments in the new laender need conditions similar to those of the competing institutions in the old laender, meaning - they need buildings, facilities and real estate; - they must be relieved of old encumbrances and old loans; - they have claims on equal treatment in the distribution of research contracts. 2. The governments of the new laender must recognize the major importance of applied research for the economic development. They should guarantee proportionate basic or fundamental financing for efficient R&D, in which activity they could be guided by the corresponding practice in the old laender. 3. It must be guaranteed that eastern German applicants are not discriminated against in evaluating project applications. At present, western Germans dominate in associations and on expert panels. The chances of experts from the new laender to have a say should be improved. 4. R&D enterprises need a secure financial base in order to fully utilize their scope for action. To this end the Trust Agency should contribute by transferring or conveying property. Rapid decisions are necessary, primarily for the so-called research companies. 5. Support for scientific and technical cooperation with Central and Eastern European countries could open up new demand for the output of eastern German research institutes. 6. The Working Group of Industrial Research Associations (AIF) should support activities to found new research associations and their acceptance as members. The conditions used so far, which are particularly favorable for project contracts to R&D establishments in the new laender ("exemption from self-supplied funding"), should be retained until 1995. 7. The Trust Agency should to a greater extent supply the industrial R&D establishments with guaranteed liquidity credits.
