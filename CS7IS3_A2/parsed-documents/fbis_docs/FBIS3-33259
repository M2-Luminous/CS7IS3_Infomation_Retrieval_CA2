As Army spokesmen disclosed, the meeting will be held in the morning. Colonel Javier Carrion, second in command of the EPS [Sandinist People's Army] General Staff, will be among those attending the meeting. This will mark the first time the military will sit down for talks with an armed group after the demobilization of the Nicaraguan resistance in 1990. This morning during a ceremony to turn over the Region 3 Military Command Building, EPS Chief General Humberto Ortega said government troops are withdrawing from the conflict zone to the area suggested by the OAS-CIAV [International Commission of Support and Verification] and Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission. Yesterday, the government reviewed the counterproposal sent by the 3-80 Northern Front in the main offices of the Government Ministry with Carrion present. Carrion arrived at the Government Ministry after CIAV Director Sergio Caramagna and Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission representative delivered the armed group's new proposals to the government at 1100. Those proposals, according to "Estaban," the 3-80 Northern Front's political chief, "are not outlandish." In order for the meeting to be held, the 3-80 Northern Front is basically demanding the physical security of all of its guerrillas and an EPS withdrawal from the conflict zone. Last Tuesday, following a meeting with the OAS-CIAV and Cardinal Obando y Bravo's Verification Commission in El Rosario, 35 km northeast of Murra, the rearmed group claimed that special EPS troops equipped with rifles with silencers and supported by heavy artillery "are putting a military cordon around us." During that same meeting, "Esteban" termed as "positive" the letter from Gen. Ortega, which informed the rebels on behalf of the EPS General Staff and the Military Council that "I guarantee you respect and protection for the lives and assests of all those who disarm immediately." [passage omitted] Jose Angel Talavera Alaniz, a.k.a. "El Chacal," answered Gen. Ortega's letter yesterday. In a letter dated 15 February, the day of the meeting between the 3-80 Northern Front and the CIAV, "El Chacal" reaffirmed his willigness, as well as the willingness of the 3-80 Northern Front's Board of Commanders, to contribute to the peace process. "On behalf of the 3-80 Northern Front, I am reiterating that the demands submitted to the OAS-CIAV at the 15 Febuary meeting in El Rosario have my full support," "El Chacal" wrote. "We hope and trust that you (Gen. Ortega) and the EPS General Staff will contribute as soon as possible to giving us the minimum guarantees to begin to bring our troops together and immediately begin negotiations leading to the incorporation of our command members into the mainstream of society, within the context of the proposals made," the letter from "El Chacal" concluded. The demands the 3-80 Northern Front basically refer to the personal safety of the rebels and their incorporation into the national police, as well as to some economic projects that the government must begin in the northern zone.
