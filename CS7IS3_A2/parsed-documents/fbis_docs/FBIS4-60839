The meeting between the foreign ministers of Russia, the U.S., and the other "key countries" is designed to coordinate the efforts of the world community to end the war in Bosnia, the diplomats announced at the press conference held after they approved the Russian initiative. The sides involved in the Bosnian conflict will not be invited to the conference. The date and place of the meeting between the foreign ministers have not been specified as yet, Churkin told ITAR-TASS. According to him, Russia, the USA and "leading European countries" will participate in the meeting, which will be "a special forum" independent of the international conference on Former Yugoslavia. Participants in the meeting will "make serious decisions," he said. Participants in a news conference devoted to the results of trilateral consultations said on Friday that the forthcoming meeting between the foreign ministers was to take place "as soon as possible" and to work out "a coordinated approach, a general strategy of international community in respect of settling crisis in Bosnia." According to them, the foreign ministers will consider situation in Gorazde and a mechanism of "settling crisis in Bosnia as a whole." The warring parties in Bosnian conflict will not be invited to the meeting. Participants in the news conference emphasized that after the situation in Gorazde was relatively normalized, there was a good chance that the belligerents would agree to a ceasefire in Bosnia. They also described criticism levelled at allegedly ineffective efforts of Stoltenberg and Owen as groundless. Peace-making process is actually replete with disappointments and failures, but it does not mean that no effort is being made, Stoltenberg said. The blame for constant foiling peace-making efforts rests not with the international community, but with the belligerents who fail to come to terms, Churkin said in this connection. We cannot wait for a showdown in the war in Bosnia any longer, Owen emphasized. Emergency measures are needed now to stop the war, because violence in Bosnia grows with each passing day, ethnic cleansing continues. Procrastination on the part of the international community results in continuation of violence, he added. It is extremely important that Russia plays a great role in stopping the war in Bosnia, Owen stressed. If the belligerents reach a ceasefire in Bosnia, the Russian parliament will be advised to consider increasing the number of the Russian peace-keepers stationed in Bosnia as a part of the UN Protection Force, Churkin said in this connection. Churkin and Owen met with Norwegian Foreign Minister Tore Godal, who fully supported the idea of holding the meeting between foreign ministers of "the leading countries" with a view to settling crisis in Bosnia.
