In a news conference for foreign reporters held at the North Korean Embassy in Beijing this afternoon, Ambassador Chu stressed that although North Korea showed the IAEA inspectors the nuclear fuel rods, North Korea does not have the obligation to permit any inspection, thus hinting that an actual nuclear inspection was not made. Ambassador Chu also said that if a package solution is agreed upon on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at the third round of talks between North Korea and the United States, the IAEA could supervise [kamsi] the replacement of the fuel rods at any time, thus making it clear that North Korea will link the nuclear inspection with its third round of talks with the United States.
