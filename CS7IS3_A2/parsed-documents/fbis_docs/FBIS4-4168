Present at the signing ceremony were President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, speakers of the two houses Ivan Rybkin and Vladimir Shumeyko, and political parties' leaders and leaders of the republics and regions. The document was proposed by Yeltsin soon after his main opponents, including former Vice-President Aleksander Rutskoy and former parliament speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, were freed in late February by the State Duma's political amnesty. More than 100 participants of the ceremony signed the document, which will remain valid for two years.
