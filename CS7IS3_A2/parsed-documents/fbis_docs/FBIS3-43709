Ministry spokesman Captain Craig Kotze says this will be part of ensuring free and fair elections on the East Rand. Kotze has been reacting to newspaper and radio reports quoting an East Rand SDU member who said killing particular people does not worry him. The member, code named Tembu, reportedly said when they kill particular people, for him it is like he has killed a chicken. He reportedly said this is because he sees no reason for people to live if they do not understand what the will of the people is. Kotze says the statement is a cause for extreme concern. He says it will be brought to the attention of the Goldstone Commission: [Begin Kotze recording] Such statements highlight the inherently uncontrollable killer instincts of ANC [African National Congress] SDU's, and the fact that ANC supporters, and not the South African Police as the ANC is fond of claiming, play a large role in the East Rand carnage. If free and fair elections are to be held on the East Rand in April, it is essential that these units be disbanded as quickly as possible by the ANC, and that the illegal weapons be handed over to the South African Police, and that the killers in their ranks be brought to justice as soon as possible.
