Lech Walesa talked to Estonia's President Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar, and Parliamentary Chairman Ulo Nugis. The president said that it is ever more clearly visible that Europe is becoming a united states of Europe. That is why, he said, we have to create it together. Referring to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia, on whose territory there are 2,500 servicemen, Lech Walesa stressed that maintaining troops on foreign territory is not only inconvenient, but also illogical. However, he noted that we must show understanding for Russia, which is constantly withdrawing its soldiers, and for its leaders, who has to explain this to the Russian public. In the presence of the presidents of Poland and Estonia, the two countries' deputy foreign affairs ministers signed an agreement on avoiding double taxation. During a meeting with Poles living in Estonia, President Walesa said he would probably have to stand in the presidential elections. Everything indicates that I shall have to stand, said Lech Walesa, because, as he put it, the job is not yet done and much work remains to be done in Poland. I feel sorry for Poland, the president added, and I do not want to waste the achievements of the last few years. Poles resident in Estonia told the president about their problems; about a shortage of text books for learning Polish, and about difficulties in communication between the two countries. One of the participants in the meeting, a former Home Army soldier, recalled Solidarity achievements in the struggle for an independent Poland and persecution under martial law. President Lech Walesa said the situation has changed since then. He added that today Solidarity is first and foremost a trade union. He emphasized that the split which has taken place in Solidarity was necessary because a new political stage is being constructed. Pluralism must reign in Poland, he added. The president also expressed the hope that his visit would contribute toward stimulating economic contacts between the two countries. According to him, so far both countries have not done enough toward this.
