Since unification, Germany has been going through a period of instability and uncertainty, which has led some young extremists to use foreigners as scapegoats for all society's ills. The result is that attacks on foreigners are increasing. In the more strictly political sphere, Roman Herzog's victory is a success for Chancellor Kohl, who had seemed to make an error of judgment, which is rare for him, by proposing the candidacy of Saxony Justice Minister Steffen Heitmann. The latter had been forced to withdraw after angering many politicians, even within the CDU by expressing particularly conservative opinions. His nomination led the liberals (FDP [Free Democratic Party]) to propose their own candidate, Mrs. Hamm-Bruecher, and to maintain her even after Heitmann's withdrawal. Herzog's election is also a success for the whole of the government coalition which, despite some provocative statements by the liberals over recent days, finally voted unanimously for the CDU candidate. It also strengthens the impression that the FDP is primarily anxious to stand by the government's side, wherever it is. The supporters of the SPD [Social Democratic Party] are disappointed and simply hope that Roman Herzog, who cannot be described as a reactionary, will show openness and liberalism. The Socialists recently mentioned the possibility of having the president elected by universal suffrage. All the opinion polls show that, in that case, Johannes Rau would have been elected. But, although there is no doubt that Richard von Weizsaecker, who was a great president, was very popular, this cannot be a guarantee of competence, and history has taught that a man's popularity should be distrusted.
