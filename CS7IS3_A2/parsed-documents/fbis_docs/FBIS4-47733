Henry Konan Bedie has become PDCI chairman. He was unanimously elected by PDCI activists, who took the big hall of the Palais de Congress by storm this morning during an extraordinary congress of the party. All the top-level dignitaries of the PDCI were in attendance. After being designated by the participants, the president accepted the mandate. Here is an extract of his statement: [Begin Bedie recording] We are also happy about the support committees, which are springing up throughout the country to back our actions at the head of the state and government. These committees, formed by civil organizations, are renovators. The bedrock of our fight for development, social progress, and peace, these organizations are from today support committees for the forces of peace -- for all our forces for peace -- committees for the defense of our liberties, committees for the respect of law and republican order, committees for civic action and for political, economic and social mobilization, and committees for the nation and for development. In brief, comittees for the defense of PDCI-RDA ideals. Let us now turn to the most-shared concerns of our compatriots: human and pastoral hydraulics and rural sites. I commit herewith the prime minister and the government to tackle the rehabilitation of village and rural communities' wells and feeder roads. We can do this without confounding the party and the state -- and without waiting -- as more than 3 billion CFA francs have been budgeted for the well-being of the rural population. Dear participants, we shall undertake these works immediately, rehabilitating sites in northern Cote d'Ivoire first because of the rainy season, and we shall continue after the main rainy season in the forest areas. Dear participants, a new wind is blowing over Cote d'Ivoire -- let us seize this opportunity through a permanent and lasting mobilization. The exemplary holding of the extraordinary congress shows that there are no cleavages or camps in our great party, as our detractors had hoped for. The congress has shown that we remain united. This unity is nourished and maintained by our permanent ideal of peace, an ideal which shall be our first objective throughout our mandate. President Houphouet-Boigny liked to say that his force, his capacity for action, came from the presence of a prime minister and a PDCI secretary general at his sides -- and especially from a party behind him.
