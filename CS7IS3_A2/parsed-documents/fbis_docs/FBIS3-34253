Dr. al-Tarawinah spoke to Salim 'Ali Dhiyab, our political affairs correspondent: [Begin recording] [Dhiyab] How would you assess this latest round of talks in Washington? [Al-Tarawinah] I am not sure I can call it that. It was not so much the usual round of talks as one of consultations. It was a novel approach proposed by the sponsors as a way of injecting some flexibility. It may have also been meant to test intentions and pave the way for another round. It concluded Thursday [3 Febeuary] culminating two weeks of contacts between delegation heads. Beginning 15 February, We will hold further contacts using the same method of one-on-one sessions between chief delegates. The next round may last two or three weeks. The sponsors are happy with the way in which these latest consultations were conducted. All the delegations agreed to resume consultations on 15 February. [Dhiyab] In this latest round, the news media was kept at bay, and it was limited to the chief delegates. What is the idea behind this? [Al-Tarawinah] The news media is usually not let in on consultations. As I said, we are talking about a test of intentions. Each track has its own peculiarities. The Syrians and Lebanese are addressing the principles of negotiations. We and the Israelis have a joint agenda. We have not yet begun discussing the items on this agenda. The latest round was an opportunity for the chief delegates to discuss these items and points. The Palestinians were also there to talk about issues other than those being addressed at the ongoing negotiations in Taba, Cairo, Davos, Paris, and other places. Their contacts are being conducted with reference to a different agenda. As for us, we have insisted that the agenda be respected. However, in the absence of experts, we did not get down to details. We are waiting for the next round of consultations to see how to proceed in the future. We hope to be able to hold full sessions so that the process may begin in earnest. [end recording]
