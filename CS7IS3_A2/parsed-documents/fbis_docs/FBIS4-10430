FBIS4-10430 "drlat071bb_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-071 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS IDB Members Agree To Increase Capital IDB Members Agree To Increase Capital PA1204211194 Madrid EFE in Spanish 2036 GMT 11 Apr 94 PA1204211194 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Guadalajara, (Mexico), 11 Apr (EFE) -- The 35th Annual Assembly of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) began on Monday in Guadalajara (Mexico) and focused on the need to foster social development in Latin America just hours after member countries agreed to increase the organization's capital. In the opening ceremony, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said that now that the structural adjustment programs are resulting in growth, there is a need to fight poverty and social inequality. "We need to face the challenges common to all people, to wage a frontal assault on poverty to ensure growth and job creation, to build strong and lasting democracies, to protect and conserve our natural and cultural heritage, and to continue the unyielding fight against the criminal force of drug trafficking," Salinas said. IDB President Enrique Iglesias, a Uruguayan, said that "economic growth and social integration are essential for political stability." He also warned against populist voices that affect social economic costs within society. "The social costs of misadjustment and hyperinflation have been much higher than the inevitable adjustment processes. We see this now when we look at social investment deficits," Iglesias added. Iglesias recalled a recent comment by Salinas de Gortari, who said that democracy is not only elections, because "people on the social fringes cannot effectively participate in politics. It is impossible to have full citizens' rights amid poverty and ignorance." Iglesias added that history has taught us that "macroeconomic stability is absolutely necessary" to improving social conditions in Latin America. "We need to redouble our efforts to continue modernizing and to bring stability. We also need to complete the great task that lies ahead," Iglesias said in reference to social support. The IDB president highlighted the fact that Latin American countries are increasing their social sector budgets and he expressed satisfaction at the recent agreement reached by IDB member countries to increase the IDB's funds to $40 billion. This agreement, which was reached a few hours before the assembly began, is a mandate so the IDB will increase by 50 percent its credit fund for loans destined to the social sectors of Latin American and Caribbean countries. This is going to allow us to earmark about $3.5 billion yearly for regional social development projects, compared to about $2 billion in 1993. The agreement, in addition to increasing the IDB capital from $60 billion to $100 billion, includes the repayment of $1 billion to the Special Operations Fund (FOE), IDB's "teller window" intended to grant very long-term financing at low interest rates to the region's poorest countries. Projects financed by this "teller window" will fight poverty, mainly in countries like Bolivia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Haiti, and Guyana. The National Assembly president, Mexican Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe, highlighted in the opening ceremony that the increase in capital will guarantee continued IDB loans at a rate of $7.5 billion a year. Aspe said: "Once we achieve repayment, we have urgent, unpostponable tasks ahead; that is, to create jobs and to fight extreme poverty." According to the IDB's annual report, there are approximately 200 million Latin Americans living in poverty; in other words, 46 percent of the population, which means a 2.5 percent increase compared to a year as recent as 1986.
