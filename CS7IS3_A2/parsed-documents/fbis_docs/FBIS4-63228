Here is what Foreign Affairs Minister Andrey Kozyrev told our observer Yuliy Semenov and other journalists. [Begin Kozyrev recording] There is to be a meeting in Tallinn on cooperation between the Baltic Sea states. Finland has given us support in implementing our initiative on creating the post of commissar for democratic institutions and human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to ethnic minorities. I have to say that there was a very difficult debate literally right up to the last few days, and I was even considering not going to this meeting at all unless there was agreement on this issue. But now Finland, Finnish diplomacy has taken the part of, what I would call, mediator, and has helped to work out a compromise that gives this commissar a clear mandate to tackle human rights issues in the Baltic states. We discussed in detail the tasks of this regional institution in general. Lastly, we have expanded bilateral ties; we discussed issues of regulating border crossings, in order to make such crossings simpler though, of course, controllable. We discussed matters relating to regulating the issuing of visas. We agreed to speed up the signing of a bilateral agreement on this score. One of the basic favorable factors of Russian-Finnish relations is the fact that we do not have any territorial problems. Neither side has any territorial claims on the other. These matters have been fully resolved by bilateral agreements and fully dealt under the principles of the CSCE. Incidentally, this is one of the issues that we will definitely be raising at the meeting of Baltic Sea states, so that Latvia and Estonia do not put forward any territorial claims. The existing borders are unshakable and, strictly speaking, no one with any sense contests them. It is true that such claims are being put forward by Estonia, but we are counting on assistance, perhaps even from the Finnish side and other states, in defending this principle without which stability as a whole would simply collapse. We are conducting bilateral talks on the matter of, say, the withdrawal of troops and we do not need any mediation here but, of course, we value and welcome friendly participation and when our Baltic neighbors give sensible advice. As for the problem of human rights, including the rights of ethnic minorities, this problem is an international one, because we cannot allow double standards and the violation of human rights in any country or in any region of Europe. This is not a problem for Russia alone. It is a problem for everyone. That is why the post of CSCE commissar for the rights of ethnic minorities was created who, incidentally, works primarily with the Baltic states. And now, to assist this commissar, the post of commissar for the Baltic Sea states is to be created. We believe that the high standards that have been achieved in Finland, Sweden, and other Baltic Sea countries in the human rights area and the rights of ethnic minorities should be applied in the Baltic states as well.
