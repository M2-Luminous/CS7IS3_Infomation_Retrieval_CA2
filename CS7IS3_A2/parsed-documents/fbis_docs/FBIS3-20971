As Prof. Alexander W. Koch explained, surface structures, component movements, surface rough spots, and vibrations, as well as coating thicknesses and optical constants of thin surface films, for example, can be analyzed with these sensors. Especially the thin coating technique is playing an increasingly more important role in environmental and medical technology in particular. There is a large number of possible coatings that endow the underlying materials with new properties. Laser measurement techniques have also proven to be very well suited to the examination of optically transparent coatings. With them the laser light on the interface between the surrounding medium and the coating is in part reflected and in part refracted into the coating. The light fractions interfere with one another, dependent on the changes in the optical path. He further said that, since the difference between the optical paths can only be vaired by a change in coating thickness when the material properties are constant, they have with this technique a sensitive in-situ monitor for the thickness of the coating. The resolution maximally amounts to somewhat more than 10 nanometers. When two interferometers are combined in a dual-beam experiment, their beam paths form different angles with the surface of the coating. If the coating is thicker, there are different periodicities of both monitor signals. Both interferometers detect the difference between the optical paths with high local resolution at the same point on the coating. A comparison of both monitor signals also further provides, in addition to the thickness of the coating, the refractive index of the coating. Furthermore, Koch explained, computer simulations of the signal sequences allow for conclusions as to absorption coefficients and the homogeneity of the coating.
