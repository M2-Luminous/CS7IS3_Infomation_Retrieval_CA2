A large number of Russian Government ministers, experts and entrepreneurs are accompanying Chernomyrdin. A batch of co-operation documents are expected to be signed by the two governments, Chernomyrdin said. "Russia and China are two traditionally friendly neighbors," he said. "The two countries should maintain and further enhance their normal and friendly relations." The Russian prime minister wished the friendship between the two peoples further progress and the Chinese people a happy life. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Shokhin, who arrived here earlier, and Russian Ambassador to China Rogachev were among those at the airport to greet Chernomyrdin and his party. According to his schedule, Chernomyrdin will visit the Forbidden City and the Great Wall today. This afternoon Chinese Premier Li Peng will host a welcoming ceremony in his honor.
