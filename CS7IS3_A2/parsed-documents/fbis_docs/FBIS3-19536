[Rabin] The pope said that he hoped to visit Israel soon. I do not know exactly what he meant by soon. At any rate, he did not mention any dates. [Segal] What importance do you attach to your audience with the pope? [Rabin] The pope is the religious and spiritual leader of hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Pope John Paul II decided to establish relations between the Vatican and Israel 45 years after the state's establishment. I thanked the pope for his courageous stand against totalitarian regimes, such as Nazism and Communism, and for his war against antisemitism. I asked him, as someone with influence over hundreds of millions of people, to support the Middle East peace process and to do his best to persuade elements in the Arab world to return to the negotiations. We obviously spoke about the need to put an end to the wars and the bloodshed which causes terrible suffering to all the parties, and especially to Israel. We spoke about those who had not returned from the battlefield and the soldiers who were still missing in action. I did not mention any names but I assume that there are continuing contacts between Israel and Vatican officials who may help locate Israeli MIA's. [Segal] You are returning to Israel this evening. Did your visit to Washington contribute to the promotion or resumption of the negotiations with the Palestinians or the Syrians? [Rabin] It is still too early to sum things up. There has been a delay in the negotiations. We discussed a series of steps, some of which have already been carried out and others which we shall implement in the future, as is the case with regard to the United States. This, in order to put the talks back on track as soon as possible. We cannot ignore the fact that the State of Israel, through the military government and the civil administration, is responsible for the security of the entire population. We have always been proud of this fact and stated it publicly. In the wake of what happened, we already took action and shall take additional steps in the future. [Segal] When asked which steps he proposed to initiate, Prime Minister Rabin refused to elaborate, merely explaining that they would be on two levels, both guaranteeing the security of the Palestinians in the territories as well as enabling them to return to the negotiating table. I asked Mr. Rabin if it was not time to defuse what he described as the time bomb in Hebron? The prime minister replied that he would not dismantle the Jewish settlement in Hebron because that would constitute a violation of the Oslo agreement. Rabin, nevertheless, used very sharp words when he described the Jewish settlement in the heart of the Arab town as stupid. [Rabin] I do not want to link the issue of the Jewish settlers remaining in Hebron to other matters. As prime minister at the time, I prevented settlement activity there because I knew what the results would be. From the security aspect, the Jewish settlement in Hebron was established in what I would describe as a stupid manner. The settlements are not concentrated but rather spread throughout Hebron. Whoever did things that way was endangering the lives of the Jewish residents. [Segal] In the interview, Rabin also hinted at the possibility of restrictions on settlers carrying weapons in Arab population centers, including Hebron.
