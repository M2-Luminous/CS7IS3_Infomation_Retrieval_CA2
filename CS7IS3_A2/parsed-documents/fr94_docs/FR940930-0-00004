FR940930-0-00004 FR940930-0-00002 After examining all available information related to the incidents above, the FAA published a proposal in the Federal Register on October 27, 1993 (58 FR 57760) to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain Beech 35 series airplanes . The document proposed to supersede AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1 with a new AD that would maintain the requirements of each of the current AD's, and would require rebalancing the ruddervators (off the airplane) anytime the ruddervator is repaired or repainted (even if stripes are added). The document does not propose any new speed restrictions. Interested persons were afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Several comments were received on the proposed rule. These comments reference inadvertent mistakes made by the FAA in drafting the proposed rule and request additional time to comment on the proposed rule. In order to allow the public additional time to comment on the proposed rule, the FAA reissued this document as a supplemental NPRM that corrected the inadvertent mistakes, and published it in the Federal Register on April 6, 1994 (59 FR 16151). Due consideration has been given to the two comments received on the supplemental NPRM. The Beech Aircraft Corporation states that reference to Beech Kit No. 35&hyph;4016&hyph;9 is referenced incorrectly as Beech Kit No. 39&hyph;4016&hyph;9 in paragraph (g)(3) of the proposed AD. The FAA concurs and has changed the AD accordingly. The other commenter recommends deleting Figure 2 (Method No. 2) because of the expense and effort required to accomplish the tasks presented. The FAA concurs that Method No. 2 is expensive to accomplish and that the complete weighing procedure is accomplished more accurately using the other two methods. Method No. 2 of the AD has been deleted, thus changing the proposed Method No. 3 to Method No. 2. After careful review, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed in the supplemental NPRM except for changes referenced above and minor editorial corrections. The FAA has determined that these minor changes and corrections will not change the meaning of the AD nor add any additional burden upon the public than was already proposed. The FAA estimates that 10,200 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 40 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $500 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $27,540,000. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected owner/operator has accomplished the required action, and does not reflect repetitive inspections. The FAA has no way of determining how many repetitive inspections a particular owner/operator may incur. In addition, AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1, which both are superseded by this action, require the same actions as specified by this AD. With the idea that all affected owners/operators are in compliance with the superseded AD's referenced above, this AD does not impose any initial cost impact over what is already required by AD 57&hyph;18&hyph;01 and AD 87&hyph;20&hyph;02 R1. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
