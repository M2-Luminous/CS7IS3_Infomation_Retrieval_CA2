Szekeres, speaking on the "Sunrise" program on Hungarian television, confirmed that even if the MSZP obtains the absolute majority of the votes, it would consider it necessary to have the broadest possible coalition government. Although many expect it, the MSZP does not intend to bring the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] into the government. The reason for this is the KDNP's performance over the past four years. Imre Szekeres and Ivan Petoe, chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats, who also participated in the TV program, both agreed that the tone of the elections ought not to change in the second round. In their view, the voters should concentrate on the individual candidates of the parties, and it would be desirable if these candidates could have an opportunity to introduce themselves to the electorate on Channel 1 of Hungarian Television, and not only on cable television.
