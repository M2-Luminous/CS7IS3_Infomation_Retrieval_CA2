List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 571 Imports, Incorporation by reference, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Rubber and rubber products, Tires. In consideration of the foregoing, NHTSA proposes to amend 49 CFR 571.114, Theft Protection , to read as follows: PART 571_FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for part 571 would continue to read as follows: Authority: 15 U.S.C. 1392, 1401, 1403, 1407; delegation of authority at 49 CFR 1.50. ยง571.114 [Amended] 2. Section 571.114 would be amended by revising S1 and S4.2.1 to read as follows: ยง571.114 Standard No. 114, Theft protection. S1 Purpose and Scope. This standard specifies requirements primarily for theft protection to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from unauthorized operation of a motor vehicle. It also specifies requirements to reduce the incidence of crashes resulting from the rollaway of parked vehicles with automatic transmissions as a result of children moving the shift mechanism out of the ``park'' position. * * * * * S4.2.1(a) Except as provided in S4.2.2(a) and (b), the key-locking system required by S4.2 in each vehicle which has an automatic transmission with a ``park'' position shall prevent removal of the key_ (1) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in any designated shift position other than park, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key, and (2) Whenever the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in the park position, unless the transmission and transmission shift mechanism are locked in park or become locked in ``park'' as the direct result of removing the key. (b) The following procedure is used for determining whether the shift lever or other shifting mechanism is fully placed in a designated position. The lever or other shifting mechanism is moved to a designated position and physical contact with the lever or other shifting mechanism is ended. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully placed in the ``park'' position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``park'' has been selected and the vehicle will not roll away on a 10 percent grade when the parking brake is disengaged. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully placed in the ``neutral'' position if the ``neutral'' position is selected, the transmission gear selection indicator shows that ``neutral'' has been selected, and activation of the accelerator pedal does not cause the vehicle to move. The lever or other shifting mechanism is considered to be fully placed in a forward or reverse drive position if the transmission gear selection indicator shows that a drive position has been selected and the vehicle can be driven under its own power. For purposes of S4.2.1, rollaway is movement of a vehicle greater than 100 mm. * * * * * Issued on March 4, 1994. Barry Felrice, Associate Administrator for Rulemaking.
