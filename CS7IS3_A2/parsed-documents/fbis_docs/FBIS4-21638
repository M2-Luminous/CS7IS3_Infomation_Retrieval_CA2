The statement, a copy of which AL-HAYAH received in Aden yesterday, says: "These weapons and ammunition are imported through a Jewish dealer who has strong links and ties with the Zionist centers of influence formed recently in a number of East European states." The statement, which falls within the framework of the resumption of media campaigns between the southern forces supporting the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the northern forces supporting the General People's Congress, describes "the weapons brought to Yemen recently as weapons of mass destruction like those which have been and are still being destroyed in Iraq and which are banned in other states." The statement says: "The military-economic establishment is a close commercial establishment controlled directly by the ruling military family in Sanaa. It controls most trade activities in the republic without the knowledge of the government and the House of Representatives." The YSP, which controls Aden, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping [YRG], which is led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, speaker of the House of Representatives, traded accusations yesterdays. The YRG said that houses belonging to its supporters in Aden has been stormed, while security sources in the city said that large quantities of weapons had been confiscated in hideouts in the city. The sources added that "the security services in Aden have over the past two days discovered large quantities of weapons which were smuggled in secretly and delivered to terrorist elements belonging to the Jihad organization in Yemen." The sources said that "interrogations of the suspects accused of acquiring the weapons have shown that they belong to a major Islamic party in the country" -- a clear reference to the YRG.
