It is the official baptism of a new political battle that will last a month and change the country, and it is perhaps a benediction as well: "I want you to go out there and tell the people that we have remained what we were in the beginning, we have not changed, we have done our utmost for federalism. We have done all that could be done." Bossi's oratorical style is the same as at the latest rallies (Baggio, Brescia, Piacenza). He lashes out all round: at Fini's "fascists," at Occhetto's "communists," and at his ally, Berlusconi, as well. As to the rest, Bossi leafs through the book of League dreams for the benefit of his future deputies. Fiscal federalism, free market forces, fewer direct taxes and lower labor costs, privatization taken to extremes, and so on: a list of things to be done now made flesh in the Northern League's "abridged election manifesto." Public Deficit "What needs to be done is: diverting public spending away from current expenditures toward investment expenditure, restructuring the public system, reducing state interference in the economy in favor of private initiative." The specific measures suggested include restructuring the civil service, radically reviewing state holdings, privatization, lowering interest rates, replacing the loss of earnings compensation fund and the "mobility" system with unemployment benefits, tax incentives for private investment, greater recourse to forms of indirect taxation, and the creation of fiscal federalism. Fiscal Federalism "Fiscal federalism comprises two basic elements: investing the local authorities with full autonomy in matters of taxation, and making the local authorities responsible for spending, which must be commensurate with revenue." A percentage of such revenue must be payable to the federal state so that it can "finance matters of general interest," but it is the prerogative of the local authorities to administer the major part of their revenue. Industrial Policy "This must evolve along totally different lines from those followed to date. The first major difference must consist in drawing a clear distinction between the type of development pursued in the north and the type pursued in the south." The north must widen its product range and promote research; the south, "complementing (and not in competition with) the north," must develop products "appropriate to its geocultural conditions" (specialized tourism and agriculture, aerospace). Employment "More market forces and less state intervention to tackle unemployment" is the slogan. "We must put a stop to the welfare handout policy, lighten the burden of taxation and other levies, abolish unjustified welfare charges. invest in research, introduce wage zoning [system whereby wage levels vary according to region] to boost employment, especially in the south.... Greater flexibility is needed as regards both working hours and atypical forms of employment. The regulatory and fiscal framework must be simplified to stimulate an increase in self-employment." Trade The goal is to create "a free market accessible to all competent, hardworking traders," and, to this end, "the law must provide tax incentives for widening, specializing, converting, merging, and ceding businesses." A gradual liberalization of licenses and the pursuit of alternative solutions to the deregulation of opening hours are advocated. Immigration "The flow of immigration must be stemmed and the requisite labor quotas might be strictly subject to possession of a work contract and access to housing." Defense "The armed forces must be radically restructured via the creation of a mixed, i.e., volunteer-professional and draft, recruitment system." Also: the safeguarding and preserving of peace in areas of fundamental strategic and economic importance; an increased effort in the fight against organized crime, consider the defense industry as a strategic public base essential to the whole industrial system; recognize the right of conscientious objection and create a generalized national civilian service. Broadcasting The League wants a privatized RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] restricted, as far as current affairs are concerned, to accurate, strictly factual news bulletins. Privatizing the RAI "will bring about a restructuring in the private sector," with clear-cut rules that will "restore the right to equal time" and introduce "strict antitrust regulations and well-defined limits on advertising." Health "Full financial, administrative, and legislative autonomy for the regions," plus: greater powers to be invested in the provincial authorities, reduction of the ministry's role, radical transformation of the USSL's [local health care units] into health care districts, "true specialized concerns managed as businesses, the abolition of health insurance via the national health fund, and freedom of choice...between private insurance cover and nonprofit professional and vocational health and insurance funds."
