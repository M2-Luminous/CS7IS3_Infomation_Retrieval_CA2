"The course of the Supreme Soviet will not change," announced Myechyslaw Ivanovich. "It depends on the deputies themselves rather than the chairman." Speaking about his first moves in the new office, M. Hryb said that, first of all, one must examine the work of the Supreme Soviet which has become ineffective. The new chairman intends to cooperate with all deputies. At the same time, he stressed that he had good relations with the parliamentary opposition and was ready to listen to all of its constructive proposals. M. Hryb is an advocate of a professional legislature. In his opinion, the work of the Supreme Soviet can be based on professionalism as of today. First of all, it is necessary to change the current mode of work. Myechyslaw Hryb proposed that deputies hold sessions for a week, and meet with constituents and draft laws over the next two weeks. According to his estimates, such regulations will not reduce the number of days spent in sessions. At the same time, this will enhance the deputies' efficiency. "A statement is not a law," this is how the new chairman commented on the Supreme Soviet plans to hold early elections. He also stressed that this act required the adoption of a relevant law. On the other hand, the parliament speaker supports the idea of holding these elections this year. According to M. Hryb, he has been Stanislav Shushkevich's supporter for a long time. The chairman noted that Stanislav Stanislavovich had many good traits which he failed to apply in his activities. His disagreements with Shushkevich were political. Hryb could not find a common language with him concerning Belarus' membership in the collective security system and the execution of adopted decisions. The adoption of a constitution is a very complicated process. Myechyslaw Ivanovich noted that our deputies underrated this fact, and listed foreign countries as examples where constitutional processes lasted for decades. The new chairman spoke out for the introduction of a presidential office in Belarus. "One may strive sincerely for sovereignty, but how can one achieve it if the Army of the neighboring country is present on our territory," said M. Hryb concerning this pressing issue. He stressed, however, that Belarus was an independent state which would seek neutral status. The new Supreme Soviet chairman emphasized that he had no disagreements with [Prime Minister] Vyacheslav Kebich. He noted that he was looking forward to the reorganization of the government capable of conducting successful reform.
