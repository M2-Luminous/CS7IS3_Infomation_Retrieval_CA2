How to link together as tightly as possible Russia and the Alliance by means of the Partnership for Peace project and, at the same time, not weaken NATO itself. The ministers' meeting, which begins on 9 June, will discuss Russia's proposals for mutual cooperation. Although the Russians, through Defense Minister Grachev, have expressed their agreement with the Partnership for Peace, they have also pointed to its limitedness, which consists merely of establishing partial military cooperation. They want to conclude a separate agreement with NATO that would enshrine cooperation among the military departments at the level of relations between partners with global options and responsibilities and also cooperation in conversion and peacekeeping operations. The most contentious proposal from Russia is for the introduction of mandatory consultations on all issues concerning European and world security. In other words, Russia would like to obtain the right of veto in all of the Alliance's decisions, which was immediately rejected by the defense ministers of the member countries. That is to say, they are very much aware that, with the gravity of Russia's agreement, NATO would lose its status and capability for action and would become just another cumbersome CSCE-type structure. Accorlding to Russia, the CSCE should play the role of an organization that coordinates the activity of all of the European security formations. If we take a look at the CSCE's results in the security sphere, it would seem that the Russians cannot mean such a proposal seriously. With a more detailed perusal of all of the pressures that affect the decisionmaking processes there, the impartial observer has to come to the conclusion that absolutely everything is possible. Fortunately, this does not apply to the West; so, although the Alliance currently lacks more explicit U.S. leadership, it is virtually out of the question that the foreign ministers will express themselves in favor of Moscow's proposals. However, whether we like it or not, Russia cannot be treated the same way as the Czech Republic or Poland. Russia's geographical area, the size of its population, and its widespread nuclear and other arms potential entitle NATO to adopt a special approach; of course, it is desirable for both the functioning of its structures and its relations with the states of Central Europe that this specific Russian feature is taken into consideration under the conditions and arrangements within the Partnership and not outside it. In Istanbul, the NATO foreign ministers should weigh all the aspects very carefully and knit together a special doctrine for building stability not against Russia but with it, a doctrine eliminating the dangers arising from Russian power-wielding whims. The atmosphere of the subsequent negotiations between the Alliance's ministers and the individual Central European "partners for peace" will be determined by the outcome of the talks on the Russian proposals. It is mainly the Czech Republic and Poland, countries that are among the most serious contenders for membership and justifiably seek NATO protection against the threat from the East, that are extraordinarily sensitive to any sign of increased Russian influence in this region. In our country, this is felt even more by the citizens than by the politicians. "What we are mainly interested in is ensuring that closer ties between Russia and the Alliance do not mean even a hint of any division of spheres of influence," emphasized Jozef Zieleniec, in reaction to Moscow's demands regarding NATO. The idea of any kind of direct influence being brought to bear on our incorporation into West European structures and NATO, first and foremost, by the Russian side is unacceptable for our security. The former Soviet satellites in Central Europe will have enough difficulties in convincing the individual NATO members about their contribution and gaining the unanimous agreement required for admission by Article 10 of the basic document--that is, of the North Atlantic Treaty. If I write about the inadmissibility of direct influence being brought to bear on the admission of the Czech Republic and other states into NATO, I do so with the knowledge that the situation in Russia is indirectly influencing this act in any case. It is slightly paradoxical that the hopes of Central Europe for entry into the Alliance are indirectly proportionate to the internal developments on the Russian political scene. The current "enlightened" government of President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, together with the substantial majority support for the reform course on the part of the population, is forcing NATO to adopt a cautious approach toward the contenders for membership so that the domestic position of the current Moscow leadership is not complicated. The feeling of danger to postcommunist Europe would be increased along with a possible rise in the influence of the antidemocratically oriented forces, and a new onslaught of ever latent Russian imperialism and NATO could not, in its own interest, ignore the much more emphatic hammering on its front door. No one wants such development to the west of Russia. The basis for genuine European stability is, at this stage, to seek a suitable partnership with Russia with a view to its involvement in all important structures, including NATO, and that only at a later date, as opposed to the states of Central Europe. Without faith in the future definitive transformation of the "evil empire" into a civilized democracy, we would have to turn to completely different models for the security arrangement in Europe.
