He claimed that "the Czech Republic owed Slovakia part of the archives of two intelligence service divisions, part of the archives of the Military Historical Institute, historical monuments and 800 million crowns worth of values which could not be transferred without harming the Czech party." "I doubt it that the present government would deal with problems related to property division," transport minister in the former government of Vladimir Meciar Roman Hofbauer said. He denounced the "accommodating attitude" of the new cabinet of Jozef Moravcik in negotiations with Prague on the mutual recognition of food quality certificates and the will to discuss Czech demands, including the recognition of Slovakia's 24 billion crown debt arising from the former Czechoslovak State Bank's final account. At a session of the Customs Union Council at the end of March, Prague and Bratislava agreed to mutually recognize the certificates on the condition that Slovakia's customs legislation is amended. During the March talks between the banking councils of the Czech and Slovak National Banks on the abolition of the "old bloc" on the clearing account, the Czech bank's Governor Josef Tosovsky praised the fact that Slovakia had not challenged the results of an audit carried out in the former Czechoslovak bank. According to it, Slovakia owes the Czech Republic more than 24 billion crowns (over $800,000).
