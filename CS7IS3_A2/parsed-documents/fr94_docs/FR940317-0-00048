FR940317-0-00048 FR940317-0-00020 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 672 [Docket No. 931199&hyph;4042; I.D. 031194A] Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Modification of a closure. SUMMARY: NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) to allow a 48-hour directed fishery. This action is necessary to fully utilize the total allowable catch (TAC) of Atka mackerel in that area. EFFECTIVE DATE: From 12 noon, Alaska local time (A.l.t.), March 14, 1994, through 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA is rescinded; and effective 12 noon A.l.t. March 16, 1994, through 12 midnight, A.l.t. December 31, 1994, directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA is closed. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Andrew N. Smoker, Fishery Biologist, Fisheries Management Division, NMFS, 907&hyph;586&hyph;7228. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The groundfish fishery in the GOA Exclusive Economic Zone is managed by the Secretary of Commerce according to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP) prepared by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Fishing by U.S. vessels is governed by regulations implementing the FMP at 50 CFR parts 620 and 672. In accordance with §672.20(c)(1)(ii)(B), the annual TAC for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA, was established by the final 1994 groundfish specifications (59 FR 7647, February 16, 1994), as 2,500 metric tons (mt). The final 1994 groundfish specifications also closed the directed fishery for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA under §672.20(c)(2). The Regional Director, Alaska Region, NMFS, in accordance with §672.20(c)(2)(ii), has determined that the TAC of Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA is sufficient to allow a 48-hour directed fishery. Therefore, NMFS is rescinding the closure to directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA as of 12 noon A.l.t., March 14, 1994. In accordance with §672.20(c)(2)(ii), the Regional Director has established a directed fishing allowance of 2,300 mt, with the remaining 200 mt to be taken as incidental catch in directed fishing for other species in the area. The Regional Director has determined that the directed fishing allowance will be attained by a 48-hour directed fishery for Atka mackerel. Consequently, NMFS is prohibiting directed fishing for Atka mackerel in the Western Regulatory Area of the GOA, effective from 12 noon, A.l.t., March 16, 1994, until 12 midnight, A.l.t., December 31, 1994. Classification This action is taken under §672.20. List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 672 Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Authority: 16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. Dated: March 11, 1994.
