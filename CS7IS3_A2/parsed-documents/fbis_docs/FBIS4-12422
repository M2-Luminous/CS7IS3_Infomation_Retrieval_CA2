He referred to the compromise plans in connection with the Palestinian issue and said: Compromise by claimants to leadership of Palestine does not solve any of the Zionist regime's problems. In his second sermon, Ayatollah Jannati referred to the emphasis by the eminent leader [Khamene'i] on the importance of work ethics, the social order, and a serious attitude towards work. He said that the lack of such an attitude constituted one of the shortcomings of the society, and called for greater efforts in this area. He then alluded to the grave responsibilities of the Voice and Vision of the Islamic Republic of Iran as a medium for communications. He stressed the need for greater efforts, as well as more help for that organization, so as to enable it to provide a more valuable service. The acting Friday imam of Tehran then set out to describe all the pressures exerted by America with the aim of forcing the Islamic Republic of Iran to surrender. He stressed once again that the Iranian nation would never surrender to tyranny and oppression.
