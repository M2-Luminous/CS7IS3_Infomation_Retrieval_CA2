Russia agreed in general with preparing long-term agreements on both raw materials, Klaus reported. Klaus welcomed that he had agreed with Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin on May 30 as the binding, final date by which the agreement on the schedule and form of payments of the Russian debt would be signed. Klaus admitted that Russia offered to repay a part of its debt by means of exports of military equipment.

"I found the political and economic situation (in Russia) was a bit more stable than anticipated," noted Klaus.
