In a joint statement issued that day, Chairman Kim Tong-kil of the United People's Party and Chairman Park Chan-chong of the New Political Reform Party also urged social organizations to halt internal strife and concentrate on easing the tension over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program. They warned that Pyongyang's withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency would lead to "a dangerous consequence of threatening to break the peace and security on the Korean peninsula," urging the North to "suspend all military intimidation and resume inter-Korean dialogue for a peaceful solution of the nuclear problem." The government should establish a national consensus on how to overcome the crisis before the inter-Korean confrontation over the nuclear issue leads to a tragic result, they said, calling for an emergency national meeting on the current situation and an inter-Korean summit. They charged that the government's fickle and unprincipled policy has pushed the nuclear issue to a critical phase and that President Kim Yong-sam is partly responsible as he has wavered from the basic principle of Seoul's North Korea policy.
