This decision was taken by five former members of Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party -- Viktor Kobelev, Aleksandr Pronin, Vladimir Novikov, Vladimir Borzyuk and Tatyana Bulgakova as well as Deputy Andrey Volkov. Aleksandr Pronin told INTERFAX they had decided to leave because of disagreements with the line taken by the Union's leader Boris Fedorov and also the desire not to be in the same group as Andrey Makarov. Another serious reason for the exit of the six was the fact that the leadership of the "Decembrists" had kept secret from ordinary members the fact that the leadership had met recently with President Boris Yeltsin and were therefore representing no-one but themselves. "If Zhirinovskiy is openly practicing deceit, then the leaders of the Decembrists are doing it behind people's backs," said Pronin. He said that the six deputies would not join any other factions but rather form an autonomous deputy group.
