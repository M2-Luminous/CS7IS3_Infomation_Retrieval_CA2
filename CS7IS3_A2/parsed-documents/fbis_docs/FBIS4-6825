FBIS4-6825 "dreas079_d_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 South Korea DPRK's Military Capabilities Analyzed DPRK's Military Capabilities Analyzed SK2304055594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0519 GMT 23 Apr 94 SK2304055594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 23 (YONHAP) -- North Korea celebrates the 62nd anniversary of the founding of its armed forces on Monday, April 25. The reclusive communist state founded the regular "Korean People's Army" on Feb. 8, 1948, and formerly observed this date as Armed Forces Day until 1978, when it opted for April 25 on the ground that it was on April 25, 1932, that Kim Il-song organized and became the first commander of the irregular "Korean People's Revolutionary Army." The change was intended to date the origin of the regular Korean People's Army back to the irregular guerrillas during the days of Japanese rule, which has a great bearing on North Korea's military strategy today. By ascribing the regular army to the irregular troops that waged guerrilla warfare against Japan in the 1930s, North Korea attaches importance to the art of unconventional warfare in its military strategy. This strategy calls for forming a second front in the rear area of South Korea by infiltrating guerrilla troops for a mix of regular and irregular warfare to turn the whole of South Korea into a huge battleground. North Korea's Armed Forces should thus be viewed as an important instrument of its strategy to communize South Korea by force for eventual reunification, analysts say. The strategy's objective is communist reunification of Korea, and to achieve this aim North Korea is pursuing "the four great military lines" while strengthening "the three great revolutionary capabilities." The four great military lines are guidelines of action for the military based on the chuche (self-reliance) ideology. North Korea has developed its military strategy with a mix of the Chinese people's warfare strategy, the former Soviet Union's modern warfare strategy and the lessons of the Korean, Vietnamese and Persian Gulf conflicts. Based on the concept of offensive war, the strategy calls for sweeping the whole of South Korea in a blitzkrieg action or invading the Seoul area in a limited but lightning-quick war. For this purpose, North Korea maintains mechanized and mobile troops, as well as special troops [to] infiltrate South Korea's rear area. It has also dug tunnels across the Demilitarized Zone as infiltration avenues. North Korea's defense structure is patterned after those of the former Soviet Union and China, and the Ministry of Armed Forces is not a part of the Administrative Council (cabinet) but under the direct control of the Workers' (communist) Party Central Military Commission and the National Defense Committee -- unlike cabinet ministries. And the chief of General Staff is directly responsible to the Armed Forces minister and controls the three branches of the Army, Navy and Air Force. Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of President Kim Il-song, became the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army in February 1991, a marshal in April 1992 and chairman of the National Defense Committee in April 1993, taking a firm grip on the Armed Forces. The Army has 16 corps, in addition to tank and special force commands. According to NAEWOE press, the official North Korea watcher here, the North Korean Army has 3,700 tanks, 2,500 armored personnel carriers and 9,800 artillery pieces, in addition to 12,000 anti-aircraft guns. Batteries of 240mm multiple rocket-launching systems are intensively deployed along the Western part of the front line. Each of these systems can launch 24 rounds of ammunition at a target as far as 24 kilometers, and Patriot missiles are reportedly not effective against this rapid-fire artillery. North Korea's missile capabilities include AT-3/4 anti-tank missiles and improved scud missiles. The special troops of North Korea number 100,000, including 20,000 paratroopers and special marines. The North Korean Navy has some 700 ships, including 26 submarines. It recently began improving its fleet of submarines, missile ships and torpedo boats. The North Korean Air Force boasts 1,600 aircraft, including 60 MiG-23 and MiG-29 fighters. North Korea's nuclear capability includes a 4,000-kw experimental reactor imported from the former Soviet Union in 1965, a 3,000-kw reactor completed recently and a 200,000-kw reactor under construction. In the 1960s, Pyongyang began developing its chemical and biological warfare capabilities. Today, it is known to have gas and germ weapons. North Korea has also developed a device capable of delivering these horrible weapons to targets in South Korea. North Korea is said to be capable of producing 100 improved Scud-B missiles with a range of 500 kilometers annually for export to Iran and other countries. Now, it is reportedly developing a new model with a range of 1,000 kilometers, known as the Nodong-1. Noteworthy is that North Korea deploys 65 percent of its ground forces, 60 percent of its ships and 40 percent of its Air Force below the line drawn between Pyongyang and Wonsan, a position close enough to the Demilitarized Zone for the North Koreans to launch a blitzkieg on South Korea whenever they want.
