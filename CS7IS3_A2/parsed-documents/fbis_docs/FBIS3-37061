According to Yavlinskiy, in the current year the slump in production will make up about 50% against 1989. In 1993 industrial investment was virtually nil, and the outflow of foreign currency to the West totaled 15 billion dollars. Analysing the complicated political situation in the country, Yavlinskiy said in an interview with the Nezavisimaya (Independent) Gazeta that under the circumstances Russia's government, no matter who leads it, is virtually in no position to do anything constructive. "Since the political crisis is bottomless, on the whole no good can be expected from the present government," Yavlinskiy said.
