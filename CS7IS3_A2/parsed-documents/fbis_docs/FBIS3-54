FBIS3-54 "cr00000016394001" 24 March 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-038--ALGERIA ALGERIA: Press Abstracts, No. 5 This issue focuses on recent reporting in the Algiers and Paris French-language press on the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). Slain GIA Members Identified The 28 February edition of EL WATAN reported that GIA leader Si Ahmed Mourad, known as El-Afghani, and IO GIA members were killed by police forces in Bouzareah. According to EL WATAN, among the GIA members killed were Rachid Djabri, Beraf ta Aissa, Daas, and Lounici; the others have not yet been identified. (LIBERTE of 28 February reported that Aissa's death has not yet been confirmed.) EL WATAN reported the following biographical information on the GIA members: Si Ahmed Mourad, a 29-year-old Afghan veteran living in Kouba, had been condemned to death in absentia by the Algier's Special Court. Mourad was reportedly responsible for several assassinations, as well as numerous crimes attributed to the GIA. Mourad, Beraf ta Aissa, Rachid Djabri, and Buezmir Mohamed were said to have been behind the October kidnapping of three French Consulate employees. Five GIA members were killed in the operation, although Mourad, Aissa, Djabri, and Mohamed escaped. Mohamed was later killed by police. (According to the 1 March edition of LIBERTE, Mourad was also known as "Seif Ellah" ("Sayf Allah").) Berafta Aissa, 35, and Rachid Djabri, 29, were both residents of Algiers. An arrest warrant had been issued for their involvement in several murders and other crimes in the Algiers region. Daas had reportedly been GIA head in Bouzareah and was wanted for several murders. Reaction to Slaying of GIA Members According to an article in EL WATAN of 28 February, the slaying of the GIA members on 27 February was not only "a brilliant success for the forces of order but also a significant blow to the organization and structure of the terrorist groups." The deaths of El-Afghani and his followers, considered "the bloodiest and the most radical of the fundamentalist armed groups within the terrorist movement," was viewed as a "decisive turning point" in a three-year struggle against "terrorism." According to EL WATAN, it is "reasonable to think that a considerable slakening" in GIA activity can be expected, although the paper did not rule out retaliatory acts by surviving group members. El-Afghani's refusal to support dialogue between the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and the government made his wing of the GIA a "serious barrier to dialogue." Now, according to EL WATAN, "his disappearance should logically open channels for dialogue." Given the GIA's threats under El-Afghani to kill all Islamists who engaged in any kind of negotiations with the government, EL WATAN asserted that his death was probably a priority and a prerequisite for any negotiations between the FIS and the government. An article in the 28 February LIBERTE interpreted the police operation as an indication that Algerian President Liamine Zeroual is "determined" to combat violence: "The successful attack demonstrated that the authorities not only had the intention of not easing up on armed groups, but when necessary also had the means to attack 'terrorism'." According to the article, the incident will "have a great effect on government-FIS negotiations," given El- Afghani's resistence to dialogue. However, the LIBERTE article also predicted that the government would harden its position that eradicating violence is of primary importance. The article also speculates that the government is still in the process of "getting back on its feet" after having recently appointed a new president. New GIA Leadership; Organizational Structure Sayah Attia has replaced Mourad Si Ahmed as chief of the GIA, according to Paris daily LE FIGARO of 9 March. Algiers daily EL WATAN of 1 March reported that Attia's group is one of three operating outside of Algiers under the name of the "Armed Islamic Group." Sayah Attia, the son of a "Harki", operates in Medea, Ksar El Boukhari, and Tissemsilt, according to EL WATAN. The newspaper calls him a "bloodthirsty" individual who prefers hand-to-hand fighting. He reportedly leads a "commando" of armed criminals, which is said to have committed over 200 "savage" terrorist acts. Attia is reportedly responsible for 132 assassinations, and 283 acts of aggression and vandalism. Security services have identified him as the ringleader in the killing of 12 Croats in December, as well as an attack on an official motorcade in Tissemsilt that killed 10 and a 1993 attack on the Boughezoul military barracks. ALGER REPUBLICAIN of 8 March reported that Attia returned to Afghanistan in 1989 with Saudi assistance. After staying in Afghanistan three years, he re-entered Algeria clandestinely in November 1992. Attia is the father of six children, and recently took a 14-year-old as his second wife. Khaled Sehili heads the second "Armed Islamic Group" which operates in Blida, El-Affroun, Chrea, and Boufarik, according to EL WATAN. Sehili is reportedly responsible for the slaying of at least SO police officers and nearly 150 acts of sabotage. He is also reportedly responsible for an ambush which killed about 12 military personnel last September in Chrea. Kada Benchiha, also the son of a "Harki", heads the third "Armed Islamic Group" which operates in Sidi Bel-Abbes. The group is composed of about 20 "elements" who reportedly easily slip through police blockades and escape from police sweeps in the region. Benchiha is reportedly responsible for the assassination of two French surveyors last September and for a fire at ENIE in Sidi Bel- Abbes last August.
