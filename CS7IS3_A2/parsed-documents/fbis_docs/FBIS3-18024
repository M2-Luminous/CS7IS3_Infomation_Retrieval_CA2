Introducing the communication, Mr. Flynn said that "this document represents a significant and important initiative by the Commission. It will initiate a wide-ranging debate with the Council and Parliament and beyond on the long term strategy now needed to respond to the challenges posed by immigration and asylum on the one hand and integration measures for third country nationals legally resident in the community on the other." Immigration, together with the separate but related subject of asylum, has continued to occupy an increasingly prominent place in the political agenda of the European Union and its member states. It gives rise to public and parliamentary debate of growing intensity, and occasionally is the focus of acts of violence totally out of character with Europe's traditions and laws. There is increased recognition that the issues involved need to be tackled on a cooperative basis. That has found expression in the provisions of the treaty on European Union which formally designates the subjects as being matters of common interest, to be addressed in the context of a single institutional framework. That is as it should be. The deepening of the European integration process calls for an integrated and coherent response, which combines realism with solidarity, to the challenges which migration pressures and the integration of legal immigrants pose for the Union as a whole. Failure to meet those challenges would be to the detriment of attempts to promote cohesion and solidarity within the Union and could, indeed, endanger the future stability of the Union itself. The Commission therefore looks to this communication as a basis to stimulate a new and wide-ranging debate as to how the new possibilities which the treaty on European Union creates can be used to provide the coordinated response necessary, and the framework, to guide the Union in its future work. To that end the communication takes account of the work already done and developments on the ground. In addition, it takes as its base a number of agreed starting points drawn from earlier discussions, in particular the need for a comprehensive approach which addresses the key components of an effective immigration policy: - action on migration pressure, particularly through cooperation with the main countries of would-be emigration to Europe; - action on controlling immigration in order to keep it within manageable structures; - action to strengthen integration policies for legal immigrants. The advantage of a comprehensive approach of that kind is that it enables control and admission measures to be matched by long-term cooperation with countries and regions of origin and an active policy of advancing the situation of those third country nationals already legally resident in the Union. The communication looks beyond the existing work programs of the Union in the relevant areas in ways designed to complement those programs. It seeks to be realistic while putting forward new ideas and a new emphasis on how policy objectives can be pursued in operational terms. Action on The Causes of Migration Pressure The communication argues that this requires ensuring that immigration and asylum policies are fully integrated into the union's external policies, and that the various external policy instruments available to the Union are used to address the root causes of those pressures. That could involve action at a number of different levels such as in the areas of trade, development and cooperation policies, humanitarian assistance and human rights policies. Effective action in this area also requires ensuring the availability of accurate information on current migration patterns and likely future trends. Action on Controlling Migration Flows Action to control migration flows will also require a policy response at a number of levels. It will mean defining and implementing common approaches to admission policies as regards admission of workers, self-employed persons and students and the approximation of admission policies for humanitarian reasons. It calls for policies to deal more effectively with the problem of illegal immigration by way of preventive measures and measures to address the issue of persons illegally resident in the Community, with a particular focus on combating illegal employment. Policies in respect of refugees and other persons in need of international protection also need to be addressed but the communication suggests that the focus here is of necessity different. The focus for the purpose of asylum policies should be on ensuring that the examination of asylum applications can continue to operate in a fair and efficient manner. The communication also deals with new issues thrown up by the war in ex-Yugoslavia by way of the development of schemes for temporary protection. It suggests that a Union committed to cooperative action could examine how best to show solidarity to help member states caught in a front-line position in responding to such situations. Action to Strengthen Integration Policies for Legal Immigrants The communication stresses that action in this area remains an essential element of the wider need to promote solidarity and integration in the Union. What this requires will be to ensure that integration policies are directed in a meaningful way toward improving the situation of third country nationals legally resident within the community by taking steps which will go further toward assimilating their rights with those of citizens of the member states. Strengthening integration policies will also involve action to create the right economic and socio-cultural conditions for successful integration by way, for example, of actions in the field of employment and education. Equally it requires promoting information and dialogue and combating racial discrimination and all forms of racism and xenophobia. The various ideas which the Commission invites the Parliament and Council to examine are set out in summary form in Chapter IV of the communication in terms of a possible new framework for action by the Union. The ideas set out there are not intended to lay down a definitive work plan at this stage. They do, however, represent a coherent set of proposals which member states and the Commission itself will want to consider in drawing up a long term action program that is now required to take account of both the new challenges and new possibilities offered by European Union. The proposals contained in chapter IV should therefore be regarded as ideas to be discussed and elaborated upon in the debate which the Commission would wish this communication to launch. Translating those ideas into action will represent the next phase. The Commission will equally seek to contribute to that process by using the various instruments at its disposal, both in relation to the plan of action adopted by the European Council in December 1993 and the new framework for action by the Union suggested in Chapter IV. Commissioner Flynn expressed the hope that "a consensus will emerge which recognizes that the challenge which immigration and related issues poses for the Community, demands both a balanced and comprehensive response in keeping with Europe's best traditions."
