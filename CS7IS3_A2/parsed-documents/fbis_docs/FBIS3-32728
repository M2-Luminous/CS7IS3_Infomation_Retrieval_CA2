Congressmen in the majority, whom the opposition have accused of violating the independence of the Judicial Branch, broke their silence through authorized spokesman Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, who justified the law and explained that in the end the criminal court may or may not abide by its contents. Opposition legislators reiterated their willingness to struggle in Congress and the Judicial Branch to repeal the aforementioned law. Amid a great deal of controversy and severe criticism, the executive promulgated and published in the official newspaper the law eliminating the vote that settles venue disputes, thus establishing that the La Cantuta case will be settled in a military court. Progovernment Legislator Carlos Torres y Torres said he is confident of a fair sentence by the military court and added that the provision is aimed at protecting the magistrates of the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court, the body that will now decide whether this provision will be implemented. [Begin recording] [Carlos Torres y Torres] The law has been published, therefore it must be implemented. It is now up to the Supreme Court of Justice, which must take note of the case and take the action it deems appropriate. [Unidentified reporter] Can the Criminal Chamber discard this provision? [Torres y Torres] Well, state branches are independent, consequently, the judicial branch may take whatever action it deems appropriate. [end recording] The first protests were not long in coming. [Begin Popular Christian Party, PPC, Congressman Antero Florez recording] The legislative wing of the PPC has just presented a draft bill repealing the promulgation of the law, which unduly transfers the La Cantuta case to military courts. Second, the PPC-sponsored bill declares that the article of the Judicial Branch Basic Law requiring four votes to pass a resolution instead of three remains in effect. [end recording] Opposition members met privately this afternoon and agreed to present tomorrow morning an amparo writ against Law 26-291, arguing that it is intended to protect the perpetrators of the La Cantuta crime. [Begin unidentified opposition representative recording] It is a law with a specific purpose: to violate the independence of the Judicial Branch. It is a law intended to dodge previously established procedures to protect the real perpetrators of crimes. [end recording]
