This information was given by the Estonian foreign minister on his visit to Stockholm. [Begin recording -- Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik, in English] The negotiations ended kind of in a, in a very smashing way, I mean they were not interrupted at the moment but there was a, there was a complete collapse. [end recording] [Reporter] The negotiations collapsed totally, crash and bang, it was not just an interruption but instead the whole basis of the negotiations collapsed. This was said by Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik at a news conference a little while ago at the Swedish Foreign Ministry where he has today had negotiations with Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas. The collapse in the talks on the Russian withdrawal came as a surprise; when the latest round started just outside Tallinn yesterday, nothing pointed toward that. The Estonian foreign minister expressed great disappointment today. The collapse is especially sad because we were more or less ready with an agreement that the last Russian troops -- there are currently only about 2,600 men -- will be withdrawn by 31 August this year at the latest, Juri Luik said. He added that the Estonian government will now consult their partners in the west, including the Scandinavian governments. On behalf of the Swedish Government, Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas deeply deplored what has happened now. [Begin af Ugglas recording] I am reacting very strongly, Swedish opinion is quite clear: International law requires that Russia withdraw its troops from both Estonia and Latvia. [end recording]
