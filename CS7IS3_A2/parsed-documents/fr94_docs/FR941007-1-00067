FR941007-1-00067 FR941007-1-00009 Definition of Service Area The December proposal would have replaced the concept of ``delineated community'' in the existing regulation with the concept of service area. The December proposal would have defined service area as the area around each institution's office or group of offices where the preponderance of direct reportable loans made through those offices are located. A service area would have been presumed acceptable if it was broad enough to include low- and moderate-income geographies and did not arbitrarily exclude such geographies. An institution had the opportunity to show there were no low- and moderate-income geographies within a reasonable distance given its size and financial condition, and the supervisory agency could reject an otherwise acceptable service area if the service area did not account for the true effective lending territory of the institution or if it reflected past redlining or illegal discrimination. The proposal would have required an institution to delineate multiple service areas if the geographies it served extended substantially across state boundaries or the boundaries of a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). An institution serving military customers would have been permitted to delineate a ``military community'' consisting of those customers. Each institution would also have been required to compile and maintain a list of all the geographies within its service area or areas and a map of each service area. The December proposal would not have required wholesale or limited purpose institutions to delineate a service area, but would have treated all low- and moderate-income geographies in the country as the service area for wholesale or limited purpose institutions. As a result of numerous comments received on this issue, the revised proposal makes several changes to the definition. Several commenters suggested that the proposed regulation adopt concepts from the existing regulation, including the equidistance provision that requires an institution to include those areas around its offices where it makes a substantial portion of its loans and all other areas equidistant from its offices as those areas. The revised proposal would adopt the equidistance principle from the current regulation in slightly modified form. The equidistance requirement is an effective tool to assure that the delineation of a service area is consistent with the purposes of the statute and that institutions do not draw their service areas too narrowly. This modification clarifies the service area requirement and builds on concepts with which the industry and community already have experience. This change does not significantly modify the substance of the December proposal, since the December proposal preamble stated that a service area conforming to the equidistance concept would generally have been acceptable. The revised proposal also incorporates the concept of ``local area'' from the current regulation. This responds to comments expressing concern that loans made a substantial distance from a branch might inappropriately expand the scope of a service area. The revised proposal would delete the requirement that a service area be broad enough to include low- and moderate-income areas. The necessity for this requirement was unclear, given the provision preventing institutions from arbitrarily excluding low- and moderate-income geographies. The proposal would clarify that the requirement that low- or moderate-income geographies not be arbitrarily excluded would take into account the institution's size, financial condition, and the extent of its branching network. An institution's performance evaluation would include an account of how many low- and moderate-income geographies are included in the institution's service area(s). The revised proposal would clarify that an institution's service area is derived from its direct lending in relation to its branches and proprietary deposit-taking ATMs, rather than its other non-deposit-taking offices. This appropriately links an institution's CRA obligations to where it takes deposits, while enabling the agencies to review whether the institution is serving the needs of its entire community in the manner in which it extends credit. Industry commenters were particularly concerned that the December proposal meant that lending conducted by non-branch offices, such as loan production offices, would expand an institution's service area. The revised proposal would not require an institution to include geographies where an institution has made loans through a loan production office, unless those geographies are in the local area around a deposit-taking branch or ATM. However, an institution would be free to include such geographies if it wishes, and the regulation would provide some incentive to do so. Under the revised proposal, if an agency determined that lending by an institution's affiliate(s) was integral to the business of the institution, then it would include the lending by that affiliate in its assessment of the institution's lending performance, even if the institution had not requested the agency to do so. In addition, by limiting the size of its service area, an institution would increase the likelihood that it would perform poorly on the criterion of the lending test that considers the proportion of the institution's total lending in its service area(s).
