To support this goal, greater efforts will be made to recruit foreign investment and technology, said officials from the Ministry of Communications. China is poised this year to add 18,000 kilometres of new highways. The figure includes 960 kilometres of expressways and other high-grade roads, which will be funded by the ministry and local governments. These new road projects include the major cross-country trunklines bisecting the mainland from north to south and from east to west. One of the two cross-country lines runs from Tongjiang in northernmost Heilongjiang Province to Sanya in southern-most Hainan Province. The other extends from Beijing to Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, running parallel to the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway. The first of the two east-west lines runs from Lianyungang in coastal Jiangsu Province to Korgas in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, alongside the new Euro-Asian Continental Railway. And the second line links Shanghai in East China with Chengdu in Sichuan Province, largely following the route of the Chang Jiang River. The blueprint also calls for 59 new seaport berths with an increased cargo-handling capacity of nearly 31 million tons per year. Last year, 19 deep-water coastal berths were built, four more than originally planned. In addition, 370 kilometres of inland waterway lanes will get facelifts and l9 new river berths will be built, with an increased handling capacity of 3.2 million tons. The ministry seeks substantial foreign investment this year in developing transportation facilities--above and beyond existing loans. Some State-owned firms, handling the building and operation of highways, bridges or berths, may issue stocks and bonds abroad to recruit foreign investment, a ministry official said. Foreign investment for transportation facilities was at a record high last year, the official said, although actual figures were not cited. Last October, the Hong Kong-based Hutchison Whampoa-led consortium signed a major joint venture contract with China to develop the Yantian Port of Shenzhen into a world-class harbour. The project's first phase, including two 50,000-ton container berths and four general cargo berths, has already been placed in service. The project's second phase will consist of three 50,000-ton container berths, scheduled to open in 1995. Meanwhile, businesses from the United States, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia and other countries are negotiating with Chinese authorities to build and manage such road projects as the Jilin-Changchun and Fuzhou-Guangzhou expressways. By the end of 1993, China's road and port construction has used up to $1.7 billion in loans from the World Bank, Asia Development Bank and the Japanese Government. This year the ministry will continue to open the land and water transportation market to the outside world in "a moderate way," said the official. By the end of last year, the ministry had endorsed 381 Sino-joint ventures for the development of highway transportation, 86 for waterway shipping, and 66 for vehicle repair work.
