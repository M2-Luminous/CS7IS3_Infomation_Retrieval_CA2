The technical meeting runs through Friday at Kingston's convention center. The meeting, which has brought together numerous representatives from most of the countries and territories that border the Caribbean Sea, yesterday evening held its first working session, which was attended by nearly every chief delegate. Cuban Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ramon Sanchez Parodi reaffirmed Cuba's commitment to regional integration and reasserted that Cuba remains an inseparable part of the Caribbean region. The vice foreign minister stressed that Cuba believes it has the duty and obligation to fully support efforts to establish the AEC because of Cuba's cultural, geographic, historic, and economic ties to all of the Caribbean Basin nations. In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Sanchez Parodi underscored that the fundamental feature of the first day of work was the agreement among representatives of the various subregions to join the association, regardless of other issues that may be raised in the course of the meeting. Experts from Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela, the special French Government envoy for overseas Caribbean departments, and other officials outlined their points of view regarding the future intergovernmental organization's potential structure, scope, and outlook. On Thursday, the agenda will deal with technical discussions on membership, the goals of the organization's primary agencies, decisionmaking procedures, and financing -- all of which are elements contained in the draft document dealing with the founding of the AEC. Observers believe that a specialists meeting might be needed before a ministerial-level meeting to finalize the groundwork for the AEC, which is scheduled to be approved by the member-nations' heads of state and government who will meet in Barbados in July.
