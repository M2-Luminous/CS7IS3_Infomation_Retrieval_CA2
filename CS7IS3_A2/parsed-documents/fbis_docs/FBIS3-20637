Erlian oil field is located on the Xilin Gol prairie at the northern border of Inner Mongolia, a frigid and forbidding place where production and living conditions are most difficult. Over 3,000 workers braved these obstacles, and overcame the severe natural environment and the many production and technical challenges, and achieved a stable annual output from a geologically complex oil field. Last year, these oil field workers and staff conducted explorations over a wide area at Saihan Toroi, Eren Nur, Jargalang, and Uliastai, further expanded the range of oil finds, produced 1.01 million tons of crude oil, completing their nationally assigned production mission over quota. By the end of 1993, 4 combined oil)production stations, 4 transfer stations, and 58 jipei [computerized distribution?] stations and departments were operating with 820 water)oil wells, while overall production and livelihood installations were being improved daily, a 361 kilometer oil pipeline steadily pumped crude oil to Saihan Toloi, Inner Mongolia.
