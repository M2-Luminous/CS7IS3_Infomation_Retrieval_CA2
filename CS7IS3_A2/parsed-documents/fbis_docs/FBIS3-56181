The commission comprises representatives of control and auditing administrations under the president, the tax police, and the Russian Federation Finance Ministry. In all probability, some of the facts that have been revealed and already reported by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS and that further investigation may prove to be gross financial violations, made Yakovlev ask the president to order a checkup at the state level. MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS has learned from competent sources that the commission is supposed to pay special attention to Lazutkin, former first deputy general director of "Ostankino," who currently holds the position of first deputy head of the Russian Federation Federal Service for Television and Radio Broadcasting. By all appearances, the commission will show special interest in the agreement Lazutkin signed between "Ostankino," the State Television and Radio Fund headed at the time by Kornilov (currently under investigation on charges of taking a $5,000 bribe), and the "YuSSYu- Art-Group" entitling the Americans to rights to Russian music archives.
