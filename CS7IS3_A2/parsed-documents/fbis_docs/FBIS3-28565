The largest-ever package reflects "the best possible effort" by the government to turn around the long-ailing economy, Fujii told a press conference. Fujii said he can say "with confidence" that the package will have "great effects" in achieving a full-fledged economic recovery in fiscal 1994 and sustainable growth in the following year. A combined tax cut of 5.85 trillion yen envisioned in the package is likely to spur personal spending, Fujii said. The Japanese economy is showing "steady" signs of recovery, Fujii said, citing strong housing-related spending and brisk investment in public projects. The latest measures are likely to give further boost to the recovery, he said. Fujii said the package contains an administrative guideline for the banking industry to solve the problem of bad loans which is affecting many banks following the collapse of the "bubble" economy. The guideline is intended to reinforce a set of measures contained in a preceding guideline which was adopted by the Finance Ministry in August 1992, Fujii said. The latest economic package, which is expected to bolster not only the Japanese economy but the global economy, will probably be highly rated by the United States during the coming Japan-U.S. summit, Fujii said. He said his ministry has yet to decide on the scale of a third supplementary budget to finance the package but it may be agreed Thursday.
