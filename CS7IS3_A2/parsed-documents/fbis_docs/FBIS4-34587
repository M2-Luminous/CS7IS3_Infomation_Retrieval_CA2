While the government is willing to invest about $21 million in alternative development as the coca surplus is being eradicated, Quiroga revealed that the coca leaders are visiting the settlements of Carrasco Province in the Cochabamba Department to convince the growers not to eradicate coca. Quiroga announced that to correct this situation the government will do "something" to lower the price of coca. He said: "If we don't get the price of coca produced for drug trafficking to drop, the policy of voluntary eradication will fail." According to the minister, the only reason coca is well paid by drug traffickers is because there is no adequate control system for marketing coca. This has been proven by the government, which is sure that when the main coca market in Sacaba operates without control the price of coca increases some 20 to 25 percent. "As soon as the Sacaba market is put under control, the price tends to drop," said Quiroga, who indicated that coca prices will drop if the five coca markets are kept under control.
