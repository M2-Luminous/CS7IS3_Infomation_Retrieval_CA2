The bill was introduced in the lower chamber, the House of Commons, just two days ago. It has already been given royal assent, which means it has now passed into law. With passage of the new law Canada claims the right to stop and arrest vessels and crew suspected of fishing illegally outside Canada's 200-mile limit. The move by Ottawa is directed at vessels with no nationality or those that sail under flags of convenience. Canada is trying to protect dwindling fish stocks off its east coast, which have cost thousands of Canadian jobs.
