When asked which country was our first priority, Syria or Jordan, Minister Peres replied: A great deal depends on them; we will be serious with whoever is serious. Interviewed by our correspondent Karmit Gay this morning, Minister Peres called on Knesset Member [MK] Hayim Ramon not to quit Labor both for his and the party's sake. Shim'on Peres revealed that he had met twice with Hayim Ramon last week to try to talk him out of his plan. Peres said Ramon belongs in the government, and his stepping down had been a blunder. The foreign minister rejected Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin's accusations, saying no one was pushing MK Ramon out of the party. Minister 'Uzi Bar'am has also said that Ramon should remain in Labor. He criticized Labor Secretary General Zvili's remarks, made in Washington this morning, against Hayim Ramon.
