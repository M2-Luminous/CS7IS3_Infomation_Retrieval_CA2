According to the paper, a national unified foreign exchange control market among banks will begin formal operations Friday [1 April]. Designated foreign exchange banks are expected to replace enterprises in undertaking transactional activities in the market, which will be linked with 10 big cities. An official of the State Administration of Exchange Control said that the establishment of the national unified market requires improvement. At present, China has 18 banks undertaking foreign exchange business, and about 100 foreign-funded banks. These banks may apply to become members of the China foreign exchange market. The official noted that China has succeeded in the transition from the old system of foreign exchange control to the new one over the past three months. It has smoothly merged the double-track exchange rates into one; abolished enterprises' proportional retention of foreign exchange system; and carried out a bank settlement system. It has also opened inter-bank foreign exchange business and stopped the issuing of foreign exchange certificates.
