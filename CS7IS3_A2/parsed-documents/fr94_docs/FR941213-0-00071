FR941213-0-00071 FR941213-0-00016 12. We believe that this revision will facilitate the flow of capital to applicants by enabling parties to make investments in multiple applicants for licenses in the same geographic license areas while ensuring that these investments will not lead to collusion among bidders. We recognize that some potential for collusion exists whenever an entity is permitted to hold an interest in more than one applicant for licenses in the same geographic license area. We expect that the certification requirement will adequately prevent collusion from occurring. However, we intend to scrutinize carefully any instances in which bidding patterns suggest that collusion may be occurring, and we wish to emphasize that all applicants and their owners continue to be subject to existing antitrust laws. Applicants should note that conduct that is permissible under the Commission's Rules may be prohibited by the antitrust laws. 18 Thus, applicants should proceed with extreme caution in situations involving consortia and joint bidding arrangements. We also wish to make clear that communications concerning bids and bidding strategies may include communications regarding capital calls or requests for additional funds in support of bids or bidding strategies to the extent such communications convey information concerning the bids and bidding strategies directly or indirectly. If applicants enter into new or modified consortia or bidding arrangements, or if changes are made in an applicant's ownership, the applicants must timely modify their short-form applications to reflect these changes. 18 See Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order at n.125. V. Ordering Clauses 13. Accordingly, it is ordered That part 1 of the Commission's rules is amended as set forth below. 14. It is further ordered That the rule amendments made herein will become effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register . This action is taken pursuant to sections 4(i), 303(r) and 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r) and 309(j). 19 19 Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), we conclude that ``good cause'' exists to have the rule changes take effect immediately because a delay would not provide applicants with sufficient time to finalize their bidding strategies and business plans for the upcoming broadband PCS auctions. Immediate implementation of the rule changes set forth herein also provides applicants with the required certainty to proceed with their bidding and business strategies, alleviating concerns that last-minute modifications to our rules would impede the success of their auction plan. See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1). List of subjects in 47 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
