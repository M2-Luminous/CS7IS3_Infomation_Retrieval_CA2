Ukrainian Nuclear Weapons Are Among the Main Objectives in Moscow's Offensive External Policy'' -- first paragraph published in boldface] [Text] It would be naive to believe that our missiles constitute a military threat for Russia. These missiles are under the operational control of Russia's Strategic Missile Troops headquarters; they are serviced by Russian specialists alongside Ukrainian ones; our military doctrine does not envisage first nuclear strike, and so forth. Notwithstanding this, Russia seeks Ukraine's nuclear disarmament as soon as possible and the ``missiles issue'' remains a stumbling-block in relations between Ukraine and Russia. Moscow is developing vigorous activity. Taking advantage of its prestige (more specifically, our lack of prestige) in the world, it does everything it can to continue playing the role of a big brother who holds the younger brother's hand and keeps pointing at him: ``A naughty boy!'' This negative image of Ukraine, the image of a minor nuclear aggressor is also steadily being created by the Russian mass media, which are readily quoted by the West. The world community is being encouraged to put pressure upon Ukraine. An appeal was recently issued by Russian designers, scientists, and specialists of the Atomic Energy Ministry [Minatom] to citizens and governments of world states, in which the Russians intimidated those governments with the dangerous state of Ukrainian nuclear warheads. All the numerous statements by high-ranking Ukrainian politicians and military figures on the groundlessness of such assertions do not produce any special effect and constitute, figuratively speaking, whispers against a background of Russian loudspeakers. Russia's official argument in this political struggle is the dangerous state of our missiles. Having pointed out that our politicians (people's deputy Serhiy Semenets, co-chairman of the group for studying aspects of ratifying START-1: ``Emergency Situations Are Impossible'') and military figures (Minister of Defense Vitaliy Radetskyy: ``The State of Missile Facilities Is Satisfactory'') have a different opinion, we will proceed to some other, more spontaneous, methods resorted to by Moscow for attaining Ukraine's nuclear disarmament. If Ukraine gets rid of its missiles, Russia will become the only nuclear power in the region of Central and Eastern Europe. This will also give it the traditional and desired possibility to be at the top. The Russian desire to be in control is more than obvious: For example, Russia's nervous reaction to plans by Poland, Hungary, and Czechia to join NATO was very revealing. If such plans are implemented, the alignment of forces promoted in the region will not be in Russia's best interests. At a recent (1 December 1993) CSCE conference in Rome, Russia demanded that the mandate of a peacekeeper in CIS countries be given to it -- not a single country supported that initiative. Fortunately for us, because that mandate, alongside statements by Russian politicians, in particular, Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev (``Russia must actively defend the rights of the Russian-speaking population, using rapid- deployment forces for the purpose''), would give our neighbors an opportunity for large-scale activities, since (again, from Moscow's point of view) that ``Russian-speaking population'' is abused in almost every former Union republic. Thus, Russia is clearly striving to gain control of the region, and Ukrainian missiles, which are presently a real factor of deterrence, do not in any way suit its ``far-reaching'' plans. Another factor of Russian impatience is totally prosaic -- the cost of the content of the Ukrainian warheads. This amounts to billions of U.S. dollars. That is why Russia demands that the warheads be transferred precisely to it. Kazakhstan, which had hitherto been ``quiet,'' played a dirty trick on Moscow: On 13 December, an American-Kazakhstan agreement was signed -- the Americans want to buy the entire uranium content of Kazakhstan's missiles. That uranium is worth about $1 billion; therefore, this money is flowing under Russia's nose into Kazakhstan's treasury. Moscow newspapers immediately called Kazakhstan's missiles ``in fact, Russian property'' and regretted that Ukraine's uncompromising position is having such a bad influence upon Kazakhstan's behavior. Therefore, Russia's striving to get hold of Ukrainian warheads is perfectly understandable, as is also Moscow's anxiety on this point: There is no agreement between Ukraine and Russia on transferring warheads to Russian plants. Russia's reaction to our parliament's decree on ratifying START-1 was all the more negative. At that time, Moscow resembled a furious fisherman looking at yet another empty hook. Kozyrev demonstratively refused to receive our Ambassador Volodymyr Kryzhanivskyy. The aforementioned appeal by Russian scientists to the world was quickly arranged. The Moscow press, having stopped pouring dirt by buckets, opened all the taps on the tank. A few words on the decree itself. It is quite obvious that this document cannot be assessed in a simple way. Yes, despite previous promises, we have actually become a nuclear power, although temporarily so; yes, the decree is at variance with some articles of the Lisbon Protocol under which our president's signature appears; yes, the document itself, from the point of view of politicians, contains rather naive points regarding security guarantees for Ukraine. However, it is pointless to assert either the wisdom or worthlessness of that document, proceeding from immediate considerations alone: Doubtless the future, perhaps, not so distant, will provide such an assessment. Let me remind you that the deputies almost unanimously (what a surprise!) approved the reduction, over seven years, of 36 percent of launch vehicles and 42 percent of warheads. They [the deputies] advanced conditions to the world: Never use nuclear weapons against Ukraine; do not use conventional armed forces against it, and do not resort to the threat of force; refrain from exerting economic pressure for the purpose of resolving any disputes; respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and inviolability of borders. By the time the decree was adopted, Ukraine had 176 vertical-launch installations with 1,240 nuclear warheads and 43 heavy bombers with 372 nuclear warheads. That the position of the Ukrainian parliament should not be characterized in categorically negative terms was soon confirmed by the Russian elections in which Zhirinovskiy, a ``sincere friend'' of the former imperial colonies, triumphed. Anti-Ukrainian articles on nuclear topics immediately disappeared from Moscow newspapers (apparently, not for long). The world became concerned and a question arose: Is it generally safe to transfer the Union's nuclear weapons to Russia? At any rate, the warheads of 17 missiles that were deactivated by Ukraine at the end of December have remained ``at home.'' At other times, this would have given rise to certain emotions in Russia. Now, there is complete tranquility. Maybe, the United States will also revise its policy with regard to Ukraine. So far, it only listened to what Russia was saying. According to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine will continue to adhere to its decision to become a nuclear-free state, but we will demand that a tripartite agreement be concluded with Russia and the United States. Meanwhile, an opinion is being formed among Ukrainian parliamentarians on the need for Ukraine to gain full control of its missiles: Such control on the part of Russia is dangerous for our country. It is significant that there is no nonaggression agreement between the two states. Besides, Russia's military doctrine envisages a preventive nuclear strike against nuclear countries. Technically speaking, according to specialists, it is not a major problem for Ukraine to gain positive control over the missiles. The problem is, rather, a political one. Without doubt, we are in favor of a nuclear-free world. However, at present, a number of political and economic considerations prompt us to refrain from hasty steps, such as was the proclamation of the country's nuclear-free status at the dawn of our independence. At any rate, the fulfillment of the parliament's decree has already started, and this is a specific step toward a nuclear-free Ukraine.
