He made this statement at a meeting with his voters in the Schelkovsky constituency where he was elected to parliament. A party spokesman in the Duma has quoted him as saying that "the cabinet is not working and is paralyzed, functionaries just care about their prosperity." "The State Duma has no real levers to influence this government. We are reviewing the situation so that our deputies and Duma committees can prepare documents for our future government and there would be no need for it to start everything from scratch," Zhirinovskiy declared.
