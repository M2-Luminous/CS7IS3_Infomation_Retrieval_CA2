Fierce artillery-infantry attacks are being waged in the regions of Podkozare, Paljike, and Oglecevo, where Islamic fanatics are trying to breach the defense lines of the Serbian territory at any cost. The Serbian military sources claim that the Muslims have regrouped their forces at the part of the front between Gorazde, Cajnice, and Foca, and that they have abandoned the idea of making an advance toward Cajnice via Gradina and Trebecevo, where they suffered major losses in the past few days. According to Colonel Jezdimir Lakicevic, on the seventh day of their offensive, the Muslim forces from Gorazde are not giving up their plan of linking up with their forces in Sarajevo and reaching the border with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and in this way realize their dream of establishing a green line linking Sarajevo, Gorazde, and Sandzak. In the fighting that took place this morning, the Serbian side did not have any fatalities. Several fighters were wounded.
