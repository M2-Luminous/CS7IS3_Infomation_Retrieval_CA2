According to a survey, more than 80 percent of Taiwan's people are dissatisfied with the Chinese Communists' ways of handling the case. However, nearly 40 percent of Taiwan's people believe that Taiwan Government and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] have failed in their performances. Most people advocate boycotts against the Chinese Communists. Because of this incident, people have considerably changed their attitude toward the "Taiwan independence" issue that has been sensitive all along. Please listen to a (Kang Yu-feng) report: [Begin (Kang) recording] The mainland's Chientao Lake boat tragedy has posed major variables on the development of cross-strait ties. The Gallup Poll Company conducted a survey of Taiwan's people who graded performances of the Chinese Communists, Taiwan Government, and the SEF in handling the case. The highest and lowest marks were 100 and zero, respectively, and 60 is the passing mark. The results showed that 83.9 percent of the people failed the Chinese Communists, including 56.6 percent giving them a zero mark; that 38.6 percent and 34.7 percent of the people failed Taiwan Government and the SEF respectively; and that 74.2 percent believed the Chinese Communists are hostile toward Taiwan. Consequently, to express our dissatisfaction toward the Chinese Communists, quite a high proportion of the people have advocated boycotts, including a total stop to sightseeing, visiting relatives, investing, and trading on the mainland, and cutting off contacts and talks between the SEF and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS]. Taiwan University Political Science Department Professor Li Ya- ling specially urged the Chinese Communists to be alert to such reactions of Taiwan's people. [Li] I personally believe the mainland's Chientao Lake incident was mishandled by the mainland bureaucrats. It was not in accordance with the government policy. Our survey will be a very good warning to the mainland. The handling of the cross-strait ties does not merely depend on high-level policies. Their bureaucrats' personalities can have very grave impact. [(Kang]) According to the current survey, because of this incident, 27 percent, an unprecedentedly high proportion, of people -- in comparison to past years -- have favored the Taiwan independence issue that has been sensitive all along. The National Chengchi University Political Science Department Professor Li Kuo-chung said if the Chinese Communists cannot properly handle the Chientao Lake incident, the cross-strait ties will gradually drift farther apart. [Li Kuo-chung] Any single incident may [words indistinct] or influence cross-strait ties or even have an impact on Taiwan's people on their identifying with Taiwan's destiny; namely, Taiwan's independence. It is very probable that because of a single incident, such as the Chientao Lake incident, the proportion of Taiwan's people identifying with Taiwan's independence will rise remarkably. If the Chinese Communists cannot properly handle this incident, I believe the cross-strait ties may gradually drift farther apart. [(Kang]) According to the survey, most Taiwan people thought that in the near future, the current conditions of cross-strait ties will remain unchanged. However, everyone is very unsure about the long-term future of the cross-strait ties. This is a point that really warrants our attention. This is (Kang Yu-feng) reporting from Taipei.
