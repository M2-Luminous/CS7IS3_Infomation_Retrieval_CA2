ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) herein proposes to amend the Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program (Program) regulations. The Service plans to add Texas and Maryland (beginning with the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season) to the list of participating States, and to implement some additional modifications to the Program. This regulatory action will require that licensed hunters in all participating States have evidence of current participation in the Program on their person while hunting migratory game birds. The quality and extent of information about harvests of migratory game birds must be improved in order to better manage these populations. Hunters' names and addresses are necessary to provide a sampling frame for a voluntary hunter survey to improve harvest estimates for all migratory game birds. DATE: The comment period for the proposed rule will end on May 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to the Chief, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 10815 Loblolly Pine Drive, Laurel, Maryland 20708&hyph;4028. Comments received will be available for public inspection during normal business hours in Building 158, 10815 Loblolly Pine Drive (Gate 4, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center), Laurel, Maryland 20708&hyph;4028. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert L. Jessen, Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program Coordinator, Office of Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 10815 Loblolly Pine Drive, Laurel, Maryland 20708&hyph;4028, (301) 497&hyph;4986, FAX (301) 497&hyph;5981. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The purpose of this rule is to expand the Harvest Information Program (Program) to include the States of Texas and Maryland beginning in the 1994&hyph;95 hunting season, and to make minor modifications to the Program. One such modification is proposed to limit the requirement for participation to only State-licensed migratory bird hunters. Another modification would require compliance with the Program in each State in which an individual hunts migratory game birds. Background A notice of intent to establish the Program was published in the Federal Register on June 24, 1991. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on June 10, 1992. State wildlife agencies expressed a number of concerns in response to the proposed rule. The majority of comments were positive and constructive in nature. However, many States were severely disappointed that the sole remaining option placed the major cost burden on the State wildlife agency. The identification of licensed migratory bird hunters and the collection of names, addresses and other information from them would be the State's responsibility and represents the major portion of the cost burden; while conduct of the harvest survey would be a Federal responsibility. Many States would have preferred the opportunity of using a separate Federal permit card. A State/Federal technical working group is continuing to develop procedures that would improve harvest estimates without placing unnecessary burdens on State agencies, license vendors or the hunters. Alternative survey designs continue to be investigated. Specifically, alternative survey methods for special groups of unlicensed hunters (e.g., junior and senior hunters) are being investigated to determine if any resulting biases in the estimates would compromise the quality of the survey and if other procedures could be developed that would conform to accepted statistical standards. The final rule was published in the Federal Register on March 19, 1993. The effect of that final rule was to establish the Program and implement the pilot phase in three States. Implementation of Pilot Phase State wildlife agencies and the Service began implementing and studying the Program in 1992 with a 2&hyph;year pilot phase in three volunteer States (California, Missouri, and South Dakota). These States are providing the names and addresses of migratory bird hunters and other necessary information, from which the Service is conducting a national Migratory Bird Harvest Survey. The pilot phase of the Program is being preliminarily evaluated to determine the adequacy and timeliness of the sample and the time burden, cost, and other impacts on hunters, State license agents, State wildlife agencies, and the Service. The approaches used in different States are being compared for costs, efficiency, convenience and survey performance. The Service previously stated that after evaluation in 1994 of this pilot phase and consideration of any proposed changes, other States will be phased into the Program until all States will participate in 1998. The suggested schedule was published in the June 10, 1992, proposed rule. Consistent with that schedule, Texas will participate in the Program beginning in 1994. Maryland has requested to participate in the Program earlier than scheduled. Revision of the implementation schedule is being proposed in this rulemaking document. Description of Program (1992&hyph;1994) Currently, all migratory game bird hunters in participating States are required to have a Program validation indicating that they have provided their names and addresses to the State wildlife agency. Validations are printed on their annual State hunting license or supplementary permit. The State may charge hunters a small handling fee to compensate agents and to cover the State's administrative costs associated with conducting this Program. Individual migratory bird hunters are not required to obtain evidence of Program participation in more than one State per year. The names, current addresses, and necessary information for an adequate sample of migratory bird hunters are needed in time for hunting-record forms to be distributed to selected hunters before they forget the details of their hunts. Because of this fundamental need, States have only a short time to obtain hunter names and addresses from license vendors and to provide those names and addresses to the Service. Proposed Modifications to the Program In addition to implementation of the Program in Texas and Maryland, the Service is proposing several other modifications to the Program. One such modification would require persons who hunt migratory game birds in more than one State to identify themselves as migratory game bird hunters and provide their names, addresses, and dates of birth to each State in which they hunt migratory game birds. Currently, individual hunters are not required to participate in more than one State per year; however, hunters must still adhere to the licensing requirements of all individual States in which they hunt. Another modification being proposed is to exempt hunters from a permit requirement if they are also exempt from State-licensing requirements. This would include several categories of hunters such as junior hunters, senior hunters, landowners, and other special categories. These exemptions vary on a State-by-State basis. Excluding those hunters who are not required to obtain an annual State hunting license from the Program also excludes their harvest from the estimates. The importance of their harvest depends on how many hunters are excluded and on the number of birds they bag. Excluding these hunters may result in serious bias. Therefore, the Service is currently evaluating the effects of excluding these hunters and would appreciate any information that may be available. Minimum survey standards are also being developed for exempt categories. One suggestion is to allow a class of hunters to be excluded from participating in the Program if 1) it is periodically demonstrated that only minimal bias in the estimates results from their exclusion or 2) a statistically sound alternate sampling procedure is implemented. States entering the program will individually address the effects of exempting unlicensed hunters through a cooperative agreement with the Service. NEPA Consideration The establishment of this Harvest Information Program and options have been considered in the ``Environmental Assessment: Migratory Bird Harvest Information Program.'' Copies of this document are available from the Service at the address indicated under the caption FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT . Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act On June 14, 1991, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks concluded that the rule would not have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 USC 601 et seq. This rule will eventually affect about 3&hyph;5 million migratory game bird hunters when it is fully implemented. It will require licensed migratory game bird hunters to identify themselves and to supply their names, addresses, and birth dates. Additional information will be requested in order that they can be efficiently sampled for a voluntary national harvest survey. Hunters will be required to have evidence of current participation in the Program on their person while hunting migratory game birds. The States may require a small handling fee to compensate their hunting-license vendors and to cover their administrative costs. Many of the State hunting-license vendors are small entities, but this rule should not economically impact those vendors. Only migratory game bird hunters, individuals, would be required to provide this information, so this rule should not adversely affect small entities. The collection of information contained in this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and assigned clearance number 1018&hyph;0015. The information is required from licensed hunters to obtain the benefit of hunting migratory game birds. The public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 0.015 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of these reporting requirements should be directed to the Service Information Collection Clearance Officer, ms 224_ARLSQ, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1849 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20240, or the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1018&hyph;0015, Washington, DC 20503. Executive Order 12866 This rule was not subject to Office of Management and Budget review under Executive Order 12866. Executive Order 12612_Federalism The regulations do not have significant federalism effects as provided in Executive Order 12612. Due to the migratory nature of certain species of birds, the Federal Government has been given responsibility over these species by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. State harvest surveys presently cannot provide adequate national estimates of migratory game bird harvests for the following reasons: Some States do not now conduct annual harvest surveys or maintain accessible lists of hunter names and addresses. Comparable information is not available from all States because States have different licensing laws regulating who must buy a hunting license and different survey procedures. Currently, many State license lists are not available in time to permit distribution of hunter records early in the hunting season. Budget constraints often prevent States from conducting harvest surveys during certain years or could cause some States to eliminate them completely. These rules do not have a substantial direct effect on fiscal capacity, change the roles or responsibilities of Federal or State Governments, or intrude on State policy or administration. Therefore, these regulations do not have significant federalism effects and do not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. In fact, the Service would cooperate with States in providing special surveys to meet mutual management needs, and increased cooperation between Federal and State agencies would reduce duplication of survey efforts. Executive Order 12360_Taking of Individual Property Rights Executive Order 12360 discussed guidelines for the taking of individual property rights. These rules, authorized by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, do not affect any constitutionally-protected property rights. These rules would not result in the physical occupancy of property, the physical invasion of property, or the regulatory taking of any property. Authorship The primary authors of this rule are Robert L. Jessen and William O. Vogel, Office of Migratory Bird Management.
