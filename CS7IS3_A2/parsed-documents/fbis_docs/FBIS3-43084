Despite the fact that the amount of capital investment is estimated at $300 million, specialists are sure: this sum can be recouped with profit in three years. This profit will be earned due to the sale of products in internal and world markets. Discussions of the preservation and multiplication of national intellectual capabilities in the high technologies sphere up to now resemble a dialogue between a blind person and a deaf person. Cries for assistance come from the camp of scientists and engineers; the government, which has no money, utters promises and commercial structures, scratching their heads as where to invest accumulated capital, lack the foresightedness for evaluating the essence of high technologies and to understand: a gold mine lies literally beneath their feet. However sad it is to admit, but precisely those foreign companies working in the field of microelectronics (behind which, among others, stand the major banks) sooner than our fellow countrymen understood that it would be the height of stupidity to ignore the possibilities of an enormous scientific-technical complex in whose creation they would not have to invest a cent. Somewhere slightly correct something, somewhere renovate equipment, then race for licenses for products in great demand, using the Russian work force which is very low cost by world standards. j In essence the only thing which is saving us is that in the West they know very well the value of the high technologies, which are called 21st century technologies. And therefore they are interested in not allowing the killing of the goose that lays the golden eggs. They are not interested because world practice has shown loud and clear: high technologies give a maximum yield only under conditions of an international division of labor. What this separation should be is a matter of business strategy. And now we will return to the Zelenograd scientific-technical complex, which after becoming a joint stock company, becoming privatized, was given the name Kontsern Nauchnyy Tsentr [Scientific Center Concern], the status of a juridical entity and a heap of troubles with respect to its own future. One of the first who drew attention to the capabilities of the Zelenograd enterprises was the American corporation IBM, which is known as the king of the computer market. It supplied the equipment for the Kvant plant forming part of the Scientific Center and there organized the production of personal computers and videomonitors. As they say, cheap but good. The specialists of this foreign corporation took a very far-sighted look. They calculated in time that the enterprises at the Scientific Center were capable on a regular basis of replacing their company electronic components by Russian components, concluding that this in no way would exert an influence on computer quality. Later there was more. It was found that due to Zelenograd know-how it was possible to increase considerably the capacity of the computer external memory, making it suitable for use in computer networks. In the long run IBM intends in general to afford the Scientific Center the opportunity to work to the specifications of their clients, on the basis of Zelenograd computers creating new-generation information-computer control systems. Another channel for the Scientific Center to enter into the world market had already been laid out independently. Its enterprises began to supply integrated circuits to the markets of Southeast Asia -- again in conformity to the specifications of the client companies. The quality of the product was quickly appraised favorably there and today approximately a third of the production of the ``Mikron'' and ``Angstrem'' plants making up the concern is exported. The reputation of the delivered products is so high that the clients pay in advance. Still more interesting for the people at Zelenograd is the story with China -- it did not begin to purchase microcircuits, but the equipment produced by the ``Elion'' plant for the production of microcircuits in order on its basis to establish a technological base for Chinese microelectronics. The unique production lines for the production of microcircuits cost really big bucks and therefore it is in general not difficult to understand the Chinese strategy. ``Elion'' offers its equipment considerably more cheaply and the price differential in no way corresponds to a loss in quality. The very same thing applies to the delivery of microcircuits to Southeast Asia. Accordingly, to think that the Scientific Center has become a foreign exchange millionaire for the time being is still premature. However, it may very easily become such if it is possible to broaden the production of microelectronics and start up the plant which is under construction. The time required for paying off the 300-million hard currency credit necessary for this purpose (taking into account the interest rate of 9-12% prevailing in the world) is estimated at three years. If reliance was to be oriented on the preferential credits within the framework of conversion programs just the construction of the plant alone would require six years and during this time there would be a changeover to the next generation in microelectronics. Turning to world experience of advanced countries, it is easy to understand: investments in scientific and practical development work of electronics companies always have been and remain a profitable business. And what about our commercial banks? Indeed, if you think it over, this is a possibility which for the time being they are deprived. When the shares of the Zelenograd enterprises are given a quote on the international money market together with IBM, Motorola, Sony and other companies specializing in this field, it will already be too late. It is not necessary to speak of how much the production of the Scientific Center is necessary in Russia and the CIS. Reference is not to computer production alone. It is sufficient to recall the quality of our telephonic communications, worse than which it is perhaps difficult to conceive. Accordingly, the programs of the Scientific Center include the modernization of the communication networks of the Moscow telephone center and the replacement of archaic electromechanical commutators by high-speed electronic commutators. For Moscow a project also has been developed for coinless automatic telephones using plastic cards. Still more far-going plans call for the development of a supercomputer on the basis of our own know-how and use of its technical solutions in the production of high-speed PC's in no way inferior in quality to similar products from IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other companies known throughout the world.
