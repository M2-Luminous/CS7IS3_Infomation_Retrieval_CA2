FR941028-1-00022 FR941028-1-00004 1. Reporting Requirements for Contract Markets The Commission is proposing in §§36.5 (c)(1) and (e) that contract markets operating pursuant to this section provide information daily to the Commission and to the public concerning total open interest, transactions, and prices for each commodity or type of contract similar to that required under Rule 16.01 for non-exempt futures and options. This information is intended to give the Commission an overview of the size and development of these markets and provide potential participants with important information concerning the depth and breadth of the markets as well as the opportunity to compare transaction prices against other markets trading the same commodity. In addition, in §36.5(c)(2), the Commission is proposing that contract markets provide open interest and transaction information for each clearing member similar to that required under Rule 16.00, 17 CFR 16.00 (1994). This information is necessary for market surveillance, providing needed input into the Commission's financial monitoring system for clearing member FCMs. Last, in §36.5(c)(3), the Commission is proposing that contract markets supply information concerning large traders conducting section 4(c) contract market transactions, but only on call by the Commission. In order to ensure that the financial integrity protections currently provided by using such reports are maintained, the Commission anticipates that contract markets trading section 4(c) contract market transactions will by rule require members to file daily reports concerning accounts carried by large traders similar to the information now provided by FCMs, clearing members, and foreign brokers under Rules 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02, 17 CFR 16.02, 17.00, and 17.02 (1994), for large traders in non-exempt futures and options. The Commission will rely on contract markets to define, subject to Commission approval, position levels at which a trader is considered large. Under this proposal, the Commission would monitor the development of the markets to determine if and when it would require that the contract markets submit large trader reports. If these exempt contract markets develop rapidly, the Commission may require large trader reports on a daily basis to augment the information it currently receives. The Commission is proposing that all information, with the exception of account identification forms, be provided in machine-readable form using a format and coding structure approved in writing by the Commission or its designee. Contract markets currently provide option and futures data pursuant to similar requirements. 2. Reporting Requirements for FCMs, Introducing Brokers and Traders The Commission is proposing to incorporate into §36.5 the provisions of Commission Rules 15.05 and Part 21, 17 CFR 15.05 and Part 21 (1994). Section 15.05 states that any FCM who makes or causes to be made any futures or option contract for the account of any foreign broker or foreign trader, and any IB who introduces such an account to an FCM is deemed to be the agent of the foreign broker or the foreign trader for purposes of accepting delivery and service of any communication issued by or on behalf of the Commission to the foreign broker or the foreign trader with respect to any futures or option contracts maintained in such accounts carried by the FCM. 45 This provision is used routinely for traditional futures and options, and has proven to be effective in obtaining information from foreign traders for market surveillance purposes. 45 The FCM or IB is considered an agent only if the foreign broker or trader has not duly executed or does not maintain a written agency agreement with a person domiciled in the United States. 17 CFR 15.05(d) (1994). The provisions of Part 21 provide that FCMs, IBs, foreign brokers, and foreign traders must furnish on call by the Commission certain information concerning their futures and options trading. Special calls under Part 21 may be made to obtain market-wide summary information on demographics and market uses of participants (§§21.02 and 21.02a, 17 CFR 21.02 and 21.02a (1994)) or, in the case of special market situations (§21.03, 17 CFR 21.03 (1994)), when information is needed about all, rather than only reportable, traders in a market. The Commission believes that it is important to retain this authority with respect to participants operating under Part 36 so that the Commission can make informed decisions and take appropriate action as special situations warrant. The Commission is also proposing that eligible participants in section 4(c) contract market transactions be subject to requirements similar to those contained in §§18.00, 18.04, and 18.05, 17 CFR 18.00, 18.04, and 18.05 (1994), for large futures and options traders trading in the non-exempt market. The requirements proposed in §36.5(f) paragraphs (2) (i) and (ii) would require large traders to file, on call by the Commission, information concerning their positions and transactions in the subject market as well as identifying and other information contained on CFTC Form 40. Proposed §36.5(f)(1) would require large traders to maintain books and records concerning section 4(c) contract market transactions and commercial activities that the trader hedges in the commodity underlying such transactions. Reports concerning these transactions and activities would have to be furnished on request to the Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice.
