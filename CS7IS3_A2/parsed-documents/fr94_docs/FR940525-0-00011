FR940525-0-00011 FR940525-0-00004 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AWP&hyph;22] Revocation of Class D Airspace: Fritzsche Army Air Field (AAF), Ft. Ord, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This document contains corrections to the final rule published on March 21, 1994. This final rule revoked the Class D airspace at Fritzsche Army Air Field, Ft. Ord, CA, and revised the Salinas, CA Class D airspace. The final rule did not contain language to indicate the part-time status of the Salinas, CA, Class D airspace. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gene Enstad, Airspace Specialist, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90261, (310) 297&hyph;0010. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 21, 1994, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published a final rule that revoked the Class D airspace at Fritzsche Army Air Field (AAF), Ft. Ord, California, and revised the Salinas Class D airspace (59 FR 13194). In describing the Salinas Class D airspace, the notation to indicate the Salinas Class D airspace as being part-time was inadvertently omitted. This correction to the final rule corrects that omission. Correction of Final Rule Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the publication on March 21, 1994, 59 FR 13194, and the description in FAA Order 7400.9A, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1, are corrected as follows: §71.1 [Corrected] On page 13195, in the first column, the description for ``AWP CA D Salinas, CA'' is corrected to read as follows: AWP CA D Salinas, CA [Revised] Salinas Municipal Airport, CA (Lat. 36 ○39 ’48 ’ ’ N, long. 121 ○36 ’23 ’ ’ W) That airspace extending upward from the surface to but not including 2,500 feet MSL within a 4.3-mile radius of the Salinas Municipal Airport. This Class D airspace area is effective during the specific dates and times established in advance by a Notice to Airmen. The effective date and time will thereafter be continuously published in the Airport/Facility Directory. Issued in Los Angeles, California, on April 11, 1994. Richard R. Lien, Manager, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;12775 Filed 5&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
