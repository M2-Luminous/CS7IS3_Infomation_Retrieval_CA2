FBIS4-45509 "jptdd028__l94009" JPRS-TDD-94-028-L JPRS Narcotics 10 June 1994 LATIN AMERICA BOLIVIA Deputy Warns MBL Will Leave Government If MIR-MNR Deputy Warns MBL Will Leave Government If MIR-MNR `Agreement' Confirmed PY1806022994 La Paz LA RAZON in Spanish 10 Jun 94 p A9 PY1806022994 La Paz LA RAZON Spanish BFN [Excerpt] MBL [Free Bolivia Movement] Deputy Erwin Saucedo warned on 9 June that the MBL will leave the government if the political "agreement" is confirmed between the MIR [Movement of the Revolutionary Left] and the MNR [Nationalist Revolutionary Movement] to exclude some MIR leaders from the final report by the Constitution Committee on the so-called "narcolinks" case [between the MIR and drug traffickers during Paz Zamora's government]. The MBL deputy confirmed his position, stating that his party had decided to participate in the current government based on the MNR's conviction to fight corruption in all its forms and not to conceal such phenomenon that ruled the behavior of several leaders of the defunct Patriotic Accord. "I think this is a subject that can break an accord (between the MBL and the MIR). If there are agreements and collusions not to fight corruption or if reports on the political settlements are confirmed, we will review the accord," Saucedo said. The MBL deputy then reaffirmed his party's decision to begin an impeachment process against former President Jaime Paz Zamora if it is established that he had a criminal relationship with presumed drug trafficker Isaac "Oso" Chavarria. However, the MBL deputy did not limit himself to that warning, but added that MIR congressmen, Constitution Committee members Edil Sandoval and Oliverio Iriarte, cannot throw overboard a serious work developed within that committee to find the truth about the "narcolinks." Saucedo's concern stems from reports that meetings were held several days ago between MIR and MNR members in an effort to exclude former President Jaime Paz Zamora from the final Constitution Committee report in exchange for support of the government by the three MIR senators in the impeachment process against the Supreme Court justices. It also was said that one of the meetings was reportedly held over the past weekend at the house of Senate President Juan Carlos Duran and that MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth was present at that meeting.
