FR940727-0-00158 FR940727-0-00028 ยง953.503 Indian preference requirements. (a) Applicability. HUD has determined that grants under this part are subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)), which requires that, to the greatest extent feasible: (1) Preference and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and (2) Preference in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises. (b) Definitions. Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises include both of the following: (1) Any economic enterprise as defined in section 3(e) of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;262); that is, ``any Indian-owned commercial, industrial, or business activity established or organized for the purpose of profit provided that such Indian ownership and control shall constitute not less than 51 percent of the enterprise''; and (2) Any ``Tribal organizations'' as defined in section 4(c) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (Pub. L. 93&hyph;638); that is, ``the recognized governing body of any Indian Tribe; any legally established organization of Indians which is controlled, sanctioned or chartered by such governing body or which is democratically elected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by such organizations and which includes the maximum participation of Indians in all phases of its activities.'' (c) Preference in administration of grant. To the greatest extent feasible, preference and opportunities for training and employment in connection with the administration of grants awarded under this part shall be given to Indians and Alaskan natives. (d) Preference in contracting. To the greatest extent feasible, grantees shall give preference in the award of contracts for projects funded under this part to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises. (1) Each grantee shall: (i) Advertise for bids or proposals limited to qualified Indian organizations and Indian-owned enterprises; or (ii) Use a two-stage preference procedure, as follows: (A) Stage 1. Invite or otherwise solicit Indian-owned economic enterprises to submit a statement of intent to respond to a bid announcement limited to Indian-owned firms. (B) Stage 2. If responses are received from more than one Indian enterprise found to be qualified, advertise for bids or proposals limited to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or (iii) Develop, subject to HUD field office one-time approval, the grantee's own method of providing preference. (2) If the grantee selects a method of providing preference that results in fewer than two responsible qualified organizations or enterprises submitting a statement of intent, a bid or a proposal to perform the contract at a reasonable cost, then the grantee shall: (i) Re-bid the contract, using any of the methods described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section; or (ii) Re-bid the contract without limiting the advertisement for bids or proposals to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises; or (iii) If one approvable bid is received, request field office review and approval of the proposed contract and related procurement documents, in accordance with 24 CFR 85.36, in order to award the contract to the single bidder. (3) Procurements that are within the dollar limitations established for small purchases under 24 CFR 85.36 need not follow the formal bid procedures of paragraph (d) of this section, since these procurements are governed by the small purchase procedures of 24 CFR 85.36. However, a grantee's small purchase procurement shall, to the greatest extent feasible, provide Indian preference in the award of contracts. (4) All preferences shall be publicly announced in the advertisement and bidding solicitation and the bidding documents. (5) A grantee, at its discretion, may require information of prospective contractors seeking to qualify as Indian organizations or Indian-owned economic enterprises; however, this information need not be submitted to HUD. Grantees may require prospective contractors to include the following information prior to submitting a bid or proposal, or at the time of submission: (i) Evidence showing fully the extent of Indian ownership, control, and interest; (ii) Evidence of structure, management and financing affecting the Indian character of the enterprise, including major subcontracts and purchase agreements; materials or equipment supply arrangements; and management salary or profit-sharing arrangements; and evidence showing the effect of these on the extent of Indian ownership and interest; and (iii) Evidence sufficient to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the grantee that the prospective contractor has the technical, administrative, and financial capability to perform contract work of the size and type involved. (6) The grantee shall incorporate the following clause (referred to as the Section 7(b) clause) in each contract awarded in connection with a project funded under this part: (i) The work to be performed under this contract is on a project subject to Section 7(b) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e(b)) (Indian Act). Section 7(b) requires that to the greatest extent feasible: (A) Preferences and opportunities for training and employment shall be given to Indians; and (B) Preferences in the award of contracts and subcontracts shall be given to Indian organizations and Indian-owned economic enterprises. (ii) The parties to this contract shall comply with the provisions of Section 7(b) of the Indian Act.
