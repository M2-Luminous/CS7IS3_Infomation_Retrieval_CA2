He said spending restraint was a "relentless task" which would be central to all Conservative Budgets. In an unusually tough speech Mr Clarke gave his first clear backing to the fundamental reviews of departmental expenditure being carried out by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. Mr Clarke underlined the importance of the reviews by saying that they were not a one-off attempt to reduce a big budget deficit. He said the whole basis of departmental spending -- including the issue of whether the state should withdraw from certain activities -- should be regularly scrutinised in the approach to the annual Budget. He told industrialists at a conference in Westminster: "Bearing down on public spending is a relentless task. My strong view -- and that of Michael Portillo -- is that controlling public spending is definitely not something chancellors and chief secretaries only do once in a while." In recent months some Tory backbenchers, including Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, have warned that tough spending cuts recommended in some of Mr Portillo's early reviews were not fully implemented in the last Budget. They have said that cost-cutting measures announced by Mr Clarke last November in areas such as social security and education -- were already in the pipeline, and that Mr Clarke could have been even more stringent. The chancellor emphasised yesterday, however, that he had reduced spending plans by 15 billion pounds more than had been envisaged in the March 1993 Budget -- "more than anyone thought possible." He said that the first four expenditure reviews -- in health, Home Office, education and social security -- had "contributed to the success of last November's spending round." Treasury officials privately emphasised yesterday that two cost-cutting reforms announced in the November Budget -- the introduction of the job seekers' allowance and of incapacity benefit -- were direct results of Mr Portillo's review of social security. One official said: "That was what the review was after and that was what we delivered." Mr Clarke stressed that cuts in taxation before the next election would be possible only against a background of spending restraint. "Whenever I am asked `Will taxes ever come down?' I say: `Yes, provided we control public spending,'" he said. "As a Conservative chancellor, I will always look first to the spending side of the account when deciding how to reduce the deficit."
