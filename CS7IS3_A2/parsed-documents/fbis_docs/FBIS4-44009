Guests in the SAT-1 studio in Mainz and people in the main square of Castrop-Rauxel in North Rhine-Westphalia, who are also participating live in the program, ask the chancellor questions. In answer to a question from SAT-1 moderator Heinz Klaus Mertes about the current election campaign, Kohl says that he and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Scharping will compete with each other "for the best way for Germany's future." He hopes that this will be done in a reasonable form. The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not his problem, but a problem of the Social Democrats. The PDS is, for him, "the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]." He has no sympathy with it. Charts demonstrating the economic upswing and the parallel increase in Kohl's popularity are presented. Kohl does not accept that "politics and the chancellor are alone responsible for good and bad economic developments." "The economy in Germany -- this is all of us." In his opinion, "there is a great chance to make further progress" and to achieve more than a 1.5-percent increase in the GNP this year because exports are flourishing. However, "the improvement in the past few months has something to do with trade unions and employers." He pays tribute to the "wise and reasonable collective agreements." Many people have a share in the present upswing. A shop steward from Teltow in the studio comments on increasing unemployment and poverty in his region. He doubts the economic upswing. Kohl says that "there is a tendency toward an upswing." Nobody said that "the upswing would take place everywhere in Germany at the same time." "There are also great differences in the new laender." He makes a point of stating that he "did not cause the breakdown" in the past. He knows, however, that "things do not happen quickly enough, but they are in progress." In the main square of Castrop-Rauxel, people complain about unemployment. Kohl points out that "many new jobs have been created, for example in Dortmund." There is also a chance for medium-size enterprises in this region. In answer to a question read by the moderator, Kohl says that he is not of the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl, president of the German Industrial and Trade Association, who called for further social cuts, despite the economic upswing. He rejects, however, social benefits "according to the pork-barrel principle" and calls for the elimination of abuse. Money should be given to those who really need it. In the studio, a shop steward from Dresden raises the topic of part-time work. Kohl says that it would be an "illusion" to eliminate the problem of 4 million unemployed by part-time work, but many who are unemployed would like to do a part-time job. However, "nobody must be forced to do it." Part-time jobs might be transformed into full-time jobs later. It is better if apprentices who have concluded their training have a part-time job than none at all. "The main problem is that the economic recovery cannot immediately be translated into jobs." A Bavarian director in the studio refers to a complaint from an east German, who is allegedly not paid by the Trust Agency and said that the chancellor did not keep his promises. Kohl said that he had promised "flourishing landscapes in four to five years." In many fields, they are currently developing. Being confronted with a chart on the opinion of the adherents of the individual parties on the economic upswing, Kohl says that it is clear the SPD adherents have a more negative opinion on it. Clips of participants in the SPD congress who ask Kohl questions are shown. He defends Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] Bundestag Group, against criticism that he is against the emancipation of women. A lot has been done for sports in eastern Germany. He denies that the situation in Halle is bad. Unemployment has to be gradually reduced as quickly as possible. However, there will always be a basic stock of unemployed, which is cause for "concern in the future." In answer to questions from people in Castrop-Rauxel, Kohl says that North Rhine-Westphalia, above all the Ruhr area, is the best location for Europe, which is growing together. The December summit of the European Union will be held in Essen, so that a landscape can be presented that has chances in the future. Germany's debts must not increase further. "Enormous financial transfers" to the new laender are necessary. This year it will be 160 billion German marks, including private investment. But "this is solidarity with our neighbors, our compatriots." "We who have lived in western Germany for 40 years" have to understand that "priority is now to be given to our compatriots in the new laender." In response to questions from people in the studio, Kohl says that those who do something without being paid for it have to be especially respected. A "flourishing economy is needed because of jobs, but, at the same time, we have a profound moral commitment to their creation." A man in Castrop-Rauxel says that the upswing can be perceived in the east, but not in the Ruhr area. Kohl asks him to compare the life of the people in the east with his own life. The people in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] also worked hard. He rejects prejudice and asks for solidarity. In the studio, a young entrepreneur from Chemnitz complains about insufficient support from banks. Kohl is in favor of more help for young entrepreneurs. One should wait and see whether the investment allowance will really expire at the end of 1994. Confronted with an Allensbach survey showing that a majority calls, above all, for tax cuts and a question from an EU official in the studio, Kohl agrees that "our tax burden is too great" and "the state quota is too high." However, money is needed for investments in the east. The stability of the German mark cannot be maintained with debts. "The stability of the currency must be my most important objective." Asked by a circus director in the studio why there is no culture minister in Germany, Kohl says that there are culture ministers in the laender. He supports the decentralization of culture. The moderator presents a survey showing that both east and west Germans give priority to leisure time over work. The final question is asked by an employee in the studio who wants to know how peace in Europe can be ensured if the preconditions for it are not given in Germany. Kohl is sure that "we will be able to solve the problems arising regarding questions of internal security." However, several things have to be changed. He thinks that the quarrels about the law on combating crime are absurd. "We want a liberal rule-of-law state, not an authoritarian state and least of all a police state. However, a change in one's way of thinking is also required here." Kohl gives the example of the murder of a police officer by a Red Army Faction terrorist, who was also killed. For several days, the German public did not deal with the murdered officer, but with the terrorist. Kohl points out that "foreigners are always welcome." "Xenophobia is always a disgrace for our country, but no foreigner has the right to block the exits and entries of superhighways because of political reasons in his homeland." Therefore, he does not understand discussions on the deportation of people who have broken the law. He calls for a "new way of thinking in Europe in combating crime." "Most of our police do a good job." He "passionately called for the establishment of a European task force" when the Maastricht Treaty was concluded. The important thing for the citizen is that he gets help. "This is our joint objective."
