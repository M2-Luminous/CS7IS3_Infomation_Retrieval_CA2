More than 1 billion dong (roughly USD 100,000) have been spent in rebuilding the Dien Bien Airport, supplying it with air traffic control equipment, and building an air services system. To upgrade the Na San Airport will take about 250 million dong (roughly USD 25,000). And to keep regular arrivals at the airport will need a further 1.2 billion dong (approximately USD 120,000). Operators will be Vietnam Airlines, Pacific Airlines and Vasco. These two airports fell into disuse three to four years ago due to the lack of passengers and poor infrastructure. Now growing demand for fast transport to serve tourism and business has prompted the Vietnam General Department of Civil Aviation to reopen these short flights between northern airports.
