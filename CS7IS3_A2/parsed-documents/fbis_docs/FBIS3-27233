It is no easy job, however, to truly put an end to this tendency. In these years -- though the central authorities have made repeated injunctions demanding cadres at all levels be practical and realistic and have vigorously encouraged a realistic style -- boastfulness and exaggeration have remained, despite prohibitions over a long period of time, and have shown themselves to be quite serious in some places. Some people are suspicious of the economic figures submitted to higher authorities by certain localities. This suspicion is not unfounded, nor is this because the figures are too high. If high figures have substance and show good cost-effectiveness, they are acceptable. The problem, however, lies in the source of the figures and how they are computed. I was told by private sources that the statistics in some localities are obtained by way of top-down breakdown, which means some very high economic targets are set at the beginning of a year and are broken down and assigned to subordinate units or areas, which, at the end of the year, are to submit to the higher authorities figures that are somewhat higher than the targets. If the targets are too high and beyond reach, and really are impossible to achieve with available resources, they will puff themselves up and make sure that the figures submitted are always higher than the targets. And this is not the worst. What is more outrageous is that some authorities bide their time and watch their neighbors toward the end of a year. When others have submitted their figures, they hold a meeting to set a figure that is higher than others'. If this figure is unrealistic, it will be broken down and assigned to subordinate units until the desired amount is made up. Naturally, this phenomenon is not the mainstream. Since the reform and opening up began, seeking truth from facts has prevailed in all respects of our life. Nevertheless, we have to pay serious attention to nonprevailing problems; not only can such bogus figures seriously undermine the normal operation of our economy, they also can make it difficult for us to correctly assess and grasp our economic development. Furthermore, once it develops into a common practice, it will poison society tremendously. The lessons of history should remain fresh in our memories. Spiraling emulation is one of the direct causes of the propensity to boast and exaggerate. If your "achievements" are great, mine are greater; no matter how much your figures have grown, mine have to exceed yours. We do encourage ambition and the spirit of not acknowledging defeat, but we should compare only genuine figures, not false ones. Some comrades ignore the subjective and objective conditions of their localities and try to compare with others by way of making up figures. They may receive "honor" and even a promotion as a result, but the masses definitely will suffer and the cause will be undermined. Leaders must take the lead in eliminating boastfulness and exaggeration. It is of vital importance how the criteria for appraising cadres are set. A jingle circulating among the masses in some places says that those who seek truth from facts are criticized, while those who make false statistical reports get generous awards and promotions. What those above are fond of, those below will be addicted to. Therefore, cadres at all levels must set an example.
