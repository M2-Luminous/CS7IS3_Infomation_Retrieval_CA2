Klaus was speaking after a public meeting of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), of which he is chairman. ODS Executive Chairman Petr Cermak added that "after the next parliamentary elections parliament will come to believe that rather than have a bad Senate, it will be easier to take the Senate out of the constitution." The attempt to fill the Senate completely in the first senatorial elections he called "an attempt to turn round the results of the last elections, an attempt to gain greater television exposure." A bill which would amend the method of voting for senators is now the subject of controversy among the coalition partners. At today's meeting of coalition party experts to consider the voting laws, ODS representatives stood by their party's original opinion, that the forthcoming senatorial elections should take place in only a third of 81 constituencies. Deputy Radim Spacek (Civic Democratic Alliance, ODA) said that Friday's compromise proposal on the method of elections to the Senate had been "decreed" by a member of the ODS, Deputy Petr Bachna. This suggestion, Spacek told journalists today, consisted of 27 constituencies electing three senators each, with limited-period mandates, with everybody being able to take part in individual voting periods.
