[passage omitted] The believers were also addressed by the President of the Presidency of ours state, Alija Izetbegovic. Here is an excerpt from his address: [Begin Izetbegovic recording] On this occasion we should remember those who are facing considerable difficulties even today: those in Maglaj, Bihac, or near Olovo. Thank God, it is somewhat easier in some other places, Allah Akbar. This is a chance to remember them and to ask the God to help them, to give patience to the weak and power to the strong to endure. This is perhaps a chance to remember with pride that we belong to a huge, huge mass of people, celebrating Bairam today--a billion people-- and, like us, hundreds of millions are attending Bairam prayers, marking this great day. You must know that the struggle is not over yet. More difficult days are ahead. However, do not be afraid, we belong to a nation which believes that you die once and live twice. [end recording]
