FR940812-1-00010 FR940812-1-00004 To summarize, the proposed policy changes are intended to: (1) Ensure that comprehensive refugee-specific services are provided to both refugee men and women within the first few years after arrival in the United States for the purpose of accelerating family economic independence and acculturation; (2) establish a time-eligibility limitation for the receipt of refugee social services and targeted assistance services so that funds will be concentrated on recently arrived refugees to help ensure that employable refugees are placed in jobs as soon as possible after their arrival in the U.S.; (3) increase State and local flexibility in the provision of services; and (4) replace the current 4-month extended RMA provision for employed refugees with a provision that would make RMA available for the full period (currently 8 months) of time-eligibility to RMA recipients, regardless of whether a refugee becomes employed. In addition, the proposed regulation limits the administrative costs a State may claim to those costs that are determined to be reasonable and allowable as defined by the Administration for Children and Families. This rule also establishes procedures to be used when a State withdraws from the refugee program. Finally, this rule proposes to set forth basic requirements for the administration of the targeted assistance program which has been in operation since FY 1983. Consistent with the preceding actions, 45 CFR 400.1, 400.2, 400.4, 400.5, 400.9, 400.11, 400.13, 400.62, 400.70, 400.71, 400.75, 400.76, 400.79, 400.80, 400.82, 400.83, 400.94, 400.100, 400.104, 400.106, 400.107, 400.140, 400.141, 400.145, 400.146, 400.147, 400.152, 400.153, 400.154, 400.155, 400.156, 400.203, 400.204, 400.206, 400.207, 400.210, and subpart K are being amended or removed and a new 400.212 and subpart L are being added. Subpart A_Introduction Section 400.1(a) is amended to provide that 45 CFR Part 400 prescribes requirements concerning grants to States and other public and private non-profit agencies, wherever applicable, under title IV of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Section 400.2 is amended by limiting the definition of case management services for purposes of 45 CFR part 400 to the referral to and tracking of refugee participation in employability services. Subpart B_Grants to States for Refugee Resettlement Section 400.4(b) is amended to require that a State must certify no later than 30 days after the beginning of each fiscal year that the approved State plan is current and continues in effect. If a State wishes to change its plan, a State is required to submit a proposed amendment to the plan for ORR review and approval in accordance with ยง400.8. Section 400.5(h) is revised to expand the types of agencies that a State must meet with on a quarterly basis to plan and coordinate the placement of refugees in advance of their arrival. This revision requires the inclusion of local community service agencies and other agencies that serve refugees in these quarterly meetings. Section 400.5(h), as revised, also advises States that currently have an approved exemption to this requirement that existing exemptions will expire 90 days after the effective date of this rule. Any State wishing an exemption may apply to ORR. An approved exemption will remain in effect for three years, at which time a State may reapply. A number of States were granted exemptions to this requirement in the early years of the program on the basis of the absence of problems associated with the planning and coordination of refugee placement or the small number of refugees in those States. We believe it is time to review these exemptions, given the passage of time, changing refugee flows, and changing circumstances in the States. A State wishing to request an exemption to the provisions regarding the holding or frequency of meetings under ยง400.5(h) must set forth the reasons why the State considers these meetings unnecessary because of the absence of problems associated with the planning and coordination of refugee placement. These requests should be submitted in writing to the Director of ORR. Section 400.11(b) is amended to clarify that States would be required to submit yearly estimates for reimbursable costs for cash and medical assistance, costs for unaccompanied minors, and related administrative costs for the fiscal year in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the Director of ORR.
