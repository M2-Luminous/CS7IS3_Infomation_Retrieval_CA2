But Sometimes a Little Jewish"] [Text] Let us engage in some racism. It is a shameful pastime, but it is entertaining. It is especially pleasant to do this at night on the eve of the nativity of Jesus Iosifovich Christ. He is now God, but when he was crucified he was a poor Jew, the son of Mary and Joseph, the great-great-great grandson of Solomon, David... (there is more detail on Jesus Christ's genealogy in the Gospels). You will not find a Russian named Volf on any kind of church calendars and, indeed, anywhere at all. Such fantasies do not exist among Russian parents, although it, fantasy, is very rich--it allows itself Adolf, and Elzevir, and Akakiy, and Dazdraperm (Long live the first of May). In German, Volf means wolf. In small-town Jewish pronunciation--it is Vulf. Volfson, Vulfson are typical Jewish last names; in a literal translation--the son of Volf (wolf plus sohn). On 14 December, at 1500 hours (it is nice to be precise), Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy explained his nationality. This happened at his press conference at the International Press Club (Slavyanskaya Hotel) in the presence of 500 journalists. Zhirinovskiy, as is well known, answers any question forcefully and rapidly. So rapidly that he does not have the time to think about logic. Therefore, concerning the humiliating position of the Russians, he promises to correct this matter, for "there are too many persons of a certain nationality on television." But to the question about racism, he angrily denies having anything to do with it: He says, I love all nations, it will be good for everyone, and it will be bad only for enemies. When my turn came, I asked: "You declared that there will be 99 percent Russians in your government. How do you intend to determine their nationality?" Zhirinovskiy set out to show that it was necessary for Russia to have a purely Russian Government. One can argue here, for Russia needs intelligent PEOPLE, and not questionnaires and genealogies. Let us say that many would agree on Margaret Thatcher. But I had no wish to argue. I wanted to get a direct answer to a direct question. And I interrupted the fuhrer: "Excuse me, but you did not answer: HOW AND ACCORDING TO WHAT FEATURES will you identify Russians? According to the shape of the nose? According to a blood analysis? Explain the METHOD of identification. Zhirinovskiy did not like this. He angrily uttered the irreproachably liberal formula: "He who considers himself Russian is Russian. He who considers himself a Jew is a Jew. He who considers himself a Tatar is a Tatar. This is a noble approach. It can even be said that it is Jewish. In 1990, while in Israel for four days, I saw a lot of Russian people there who had immigrated on forged documents. I even became acquainted with a cheerful girl, Klava from Leningrad, who, chuckling, related how for a small payment she became a Jewess, "having lost" her old passport. In Jerusalem I asked a highly placed MFA [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] official how Russians who arrive on forged documents are treated? He waved his hand indifferently. "We do not force anyone to pull down his pants. If a person calls himself a Jew--he is a Jew." It is accepted that Zhirinovskiy is of the same opinion. But soon a foreign journalist, who spoke Russian fairly well, got to the microphone. "Mr. Zhirinovskiy! Everyone is quoting your words that your mother is Russian, and your father is a lawyer. The inference is made from this that your father is a Jew. How is this reconciled with your anti-Semitism, and is it not time to answer precisely the question about your nationality?" Everyone gasped. No one yet had the courage to ask a question about this anecdotal Russian-juridical hybrid. Zhirinovskiy answered brilliantly! "This was fabricated by newspapermen. I never said that my mother was a Russian, and my father--a lawyer. It is simply that I answered questions at one rally. I read the question: What is your mother's nationality?' I answered: `She is Russian.' After a certain time, I get a piece of paper. I read the question: `What is your father's profession' I answered: `A lawyer.' But what was I supposed to do. Imagine, I get the question: What is my father's profession, and I answer--Russian. I would be called insane!" The audience laughed and applauded. One needs talent to extricate oneself so brilliantly. Even if he lied, it was still brilliant. Further, Zhirinovskiy explained his genealogy all the way back to his grandfathers and grandmothers. `ALL ARE PURE RUSSIANS, THERE ARE NO KINDS OF MIXTURES.' The parents of the father, it is true, are from Poland, but, after all, Poland is not a state, it is one of the Russian provinces... That is the way it is. But it was different recently. I have an interesting document in my hands. The form: "Communist Party of the Soviet Union. CENTRAL COMMITTEE." Stamp: "Top Secret." "Excerpt from protocol No. 101 of the meeting of the Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee 29 March 1983. Concerning the establishment of an Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet public 1. To concur in the proposal of the propaganda department of the CPSU Central Committee and the USSR KGB to establish an Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet public. 2. To confirm the staffs and official salaries... 5. To confirm the nomenclature of the positions of the CPSU Central Committee for the Anti-Zionist Committee... 7. To publish the appeal of the initiative group to Soviet society in the newspapers PRAVDA, IZVESTIYA, SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, LITERATURNAYA GAZETA, the journals NOVOYE VREMYA, SOVETICHE HEIMLAND, and newspapers of the Union republics and the Jewish Autonomous Oblast... 8. To instruct the propaganda department of the CPSU Central Committee to examine jointly with the USSR KGB plans for the work of the committee and to render the necessary assistance in their implementation." There are secret attachments to this Top Secret protocol: about rates of pay, material-technical support (the building, the Kremlin telephone exchange, high frequency, a polyclinic of the Fourth Administration (with members of families), automobiles...); expenditures in rubles and hard currency for international activity... The Soviet people could not even imagine how much the struggle against Zionism cost it, and more specifically the state anti-Semitism of the CPSU and the KGB. Dozens (and perhaps hundreds) of fighters against Zionism travelled throughout the world: to Austria, Argentina, Israel, Spain, Italy, the United States, France, the FRG, and Sweden. The countries are all somehow sick with Zionism. If at least someone would help the fight against Zionism in Mongolia, Poland, and Bulgaria... But it soon became clear: The West perceived the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet public as it should have--as communist propaganda and a KGB cover. And then the Anti-Zionist Committee (without making a show of it) established the Jewish society Sholom. Sholom did not have an open association with the CPSU Central Committee and the KGB, and--according to the plan of its creators--was supposed to become for the West the authentic voice of the Soviet Jews. Comrade Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy spoke at a Sholom organizational meeting. He sensibly and clearly commented on the charter. He introduced his candidacy for the election list of the leadership of the Jewish society Sholom. And--as a result of the vote--became a member of the council. Thus in 1988 Comrade Zhirinovskiy became a member of the council of the Jewish society Sholom. To my question as to whether the members of the Sholom society clarified Zhirinovskiy's nationality, one of the leaders at that time answered: Sholom was established by Jews, they created a Jewish society. All the members and all the leaders were Jewish. This goes without saying. In addition, Zhirinovskiy's face and accent are rather characteristic. We have a remarkable country. If people like you, you are Russian. If they do not like you--you are a Yid. Lenin's grandfather was liked--he was Russian; people stopped liking him--he became a Jewish Kalmyk. Yeltsin was liked--he was Russian. He became disliked--he became Eltsin. And Solzhenitsyn was Solzhenitser, and Sakharov--Tsukerman. WHEN THE COUNTRY ORDERS YOU TO BE A JEW, anyone will become a Jew! This clear, sincere, vital (bloody) argument made many Soviet people shake with feeling. When the newspaper DEN started to hate Yeltsin--they wrote about him: Eltsin is the ringleader of the occupiers, the puppet of the Jewish-Masonic lobby. When MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS and other democrats see Volfson (that is to say, Volfovich), we also first of all expose the Jew in him. Because we are a united people, and we like to drink (something on Easter, something on 7 November). And why should we examine the nuances of the anticrisis program when there is such a native, pleasant, usual, and simple method of determining who is a friend and who is an enemy. We are a united people. Only in our country 90 percent of the jokes are built on national arrogance: topknots, Yids, Chukchi, Armyashki... We roll with laughter, while a foreigner, if he understood the joke, blushes and diverts his eyes. This is not funny in his country. It is improper. It is forbidden. Well, the hell with them! We will enjoy ourselves. "What is the fastest animal in the world?" "A cheetah?" "No a Chechen in a Mercedes!" These are dangerous jokes. People may laugh, or they may kill. But he who was always despised in Russia was he who repudiated his own father. If you betray your father, you will betray your fatherland also. There he is--forceful, zealous, clever, an elusive liar, clambering to the top. Like a Jewish member of the council of the Sholom society. Like a Russian member of the State Duma. He is horrible! The whole world held its breath! Parliaments are meeting in fear. The Group of Seven, the UN Assembly, and the Baltics are trembling!.. And before whom? Just who is he? Who the hell knows! Whether he is a schizophrenic (typical speech: rapid, without thinking, without pausing, wound up. Saltykov-Shchedrin's "little organ": I will pull apart! I will destroy!) Whether he is a paranoiac (there are enemies, enemies, enemies all around). Whether he is a child of the Lubyanka; he had his fill, matured, broke away from the leash, and started his own game, but the confused Lubyanka is not able like Taras Bulba: "I gave you life--I can take it away." In 1988--a Jew; in 1993--a pure Russian... Oh, how I understand you, Vladimir Volfovich! It is sometimes the same with me. I wake up in the morning--like a Russian; the weather outside the window is Russian, the books on the shelves are only Russian. But when I watch you on TV, and your little falcons--no, I am still a Jew. Although Russian also. P.S. Grow a moustache, Vladimir Volfovich, for heaven's sake, it is about time.
