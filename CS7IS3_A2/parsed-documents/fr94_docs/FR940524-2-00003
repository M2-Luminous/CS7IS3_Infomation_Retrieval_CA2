FR940524-2-00003 FR940524-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [Docket No. 93&hyph;148&hyph;2] Availability of Determination of Nonregulated Status of Monsanto Co., Genetically Engineered Soybean Line AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Notice of determination. SUMMARY: The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is announcing the issuance of a determination that glyphosate-tolerant soybean line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 does not present a plant pest risk and should therefore no longer be a regulated article under regulations at 7 CFR part 340. APHIS' determination has been made in response to a petition received on September 15, 1993, from Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, MO, seeking such a determination. This notice also announces the availability of the determination, which provides the basis for the ruling, as well as the availability of an environmental assessment of this action. EFFECTIVE DATE: This ruling is effective May 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: The determination, the environmental assessment, the Monsanto Co. submission, and written comments received in response to our December 6, 1993, notice published in the Federal Register may be inspected at USDA, room 1141, South Building, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays. Persons wishing access to this room are requested to call ahead on (202) 690&hyph;2817. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ms. Shirley P. Ingebritsen, Regulatory Analyst, Biotechnology, Biologics, and Environmental Protection, APHIS, USDA, room 850 Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7601. For a copy of the determination or the environmental assessment, please write or call Ms. Kay Peterson at this same address and telephone number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On December 6, 1993, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) published a notice in the Federal Register (58 FR 64287&hyph;64288, Docket No. 93&hyph;148&hyph;1), announcing receipt of a petition from the Monsanto Co. of St. Louis, MO, that requested a determination on the regulatory status of glyphosate-tolerant soybean (GTS) line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2. This notice also indicated APHIS' role, as well as those of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration, in the regulation of GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2, food products derived from it, and the herbicide glyphosate that may be used in conjunction with it, if a new label for the herbicide is approved. This notice further announced that the petition was available for public review and invited written comments on whether such soybeans present a plant pest risk, to be submitted on or before February 4, 1994. Comments APHIS received a total of 33 comments on the Monsanto petition from farm cooperatives, farmers, a food company, national and State soybean associations, a science and technology policy organization, seed companies and affiliated research organizations, a State agricultural commodity commission for soybeans, State departments of agriculture, universities, and a university agricultural experiment station. With a single exception, the comments were favorable to the petition. APHIS has provided a discussion of the comments in the determination document, which is available upon request from the individual listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 is described by Monsanto as soybeans containing a Roundup Ready TM gene, and any progeny derived from crosses between GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 and traditional soybean varieties. The Roundup Ready TM gene contained in GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 is a single insert of DNA comprised of the enhanced 35S promoter derived from cauliflower mosaic virus, the chloroplast transit peptide coding sequence from Petunia hybrida fused to the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene derived from Agrobacterium sp. strain CP4, and the nopaline synthase 3' terminator from A. tumefaciens . Glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup ® herbicide, controls weeds due to the inhibition of the enzyme EPSPS. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 soybeans express an EPSPS enzyme tolerant to glyphosate, thereby conferring tolerance to Roundup ® herbicide. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 contains components from organisms that are known plant pathogens, i.e., the bacterium A. tumefaciens and cauliflower mosaic virus. GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 has, therefore, been a regulated article under 7 CFR part 340, and was field tested in 1991, 1992, and 1993 in accordance with APHIS regulations. APHIS' determination that GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 does not present a plant pest risk is based on an analysis of data and information provided by Monsanto, as well as other relevant published scientific data and comments received by APHIS concerning the potential plant pest risk of the soybean line. From this review, we have determined that the GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2: (1) Exhibits no plant pathogenic properties; (2) is no more likely to become a weed than its nonengineered parental variety; (3) is unlikely to increase the weediness potential for any other cultivated plant or native wild species with which the organism can interbreed; (4) will not cause damage to processed agricultural commodities; and (5) is unlikely to harm other organisms, such as bees and earthworms, that are beneficial to agriculture. In addition, we have determined that there is no reason to believe that new progeny bred from GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 will exhibit new plant pest properties, i.e., properties substantially different from any observed for the field tested GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2, or those observed for soybeans in traditional breeding programs. The effect of this determination is that GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 will no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS regulations at 7 CFR part 340. Permits and notifications under those regulations will no longer be required from APHIS for field testing, importation, or interstate movement of those soybean lines or their progeny. Agronomic practices involving the GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2, e.g., cultivation, propagation, movement, and cross-breeding with other nonregulated soybean lines, can now be conducted without APHIS' approval. Importation of GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 and seeds capable of propagation is still, however, subject to the restrictions found in the Foreign Quarantine Notice regulations at 7 CFR part 319. Variety registration and/or seed certification for individual soybean lines carrying the Roundup Ready TM gene may involve future actions by the U.S. Plant Variety Protection Office and State Seed Certification officials. The potential environmental impacts associated with this determination have been examined in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 USC 4321 et seq. , (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979). An environmental assessment was prepared and a finding of no significant impact was reached by APHIS for the determination that GTS line 40&hyph;3&hyph;2 is no longer a regulated article under its regulations at 7 CFR part 340. Done in Washington, DC, this 18th day of May 1994. William S. Wallace, Acting Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
