Aliyev, who arrived in the capital at a time when Russia is forging its new policy on the Caucasus, is trying to reestablish trust between his country and Turkey. [Begin Metin Corabatir recording] Aliyev landed at Ankara's Esenboga Airport this morning to eliminate Turkish apprehensions of the Azerbaijan Administration that emerged after the removal of Elchibey as president, and to reestablish Turkey in the balance of power against increasing Russian demands. That Aliyev gave importance to this visit was obvious from the very large delegation he brought with him. The delegation was made up of his daughter, six ministers, the leader of Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic, numerous officials, intellectuals, and artists. Two planes were needed to transport them. Diplomatic sources noted that Russia, which failed to prevent Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to Turkey last month, also tried to prevent Aliyev's visit. Acting in line with the new protocol, President Demirel, who was prime minister when Aliyev was the leader of Nakhichevan and from whom Aliyev received great support, did not wait for the formal reception in the afternoon at the Cankaya presidential palace and instead went to Esenboga to welcome his Azerbaijani guest. The official talks, which the two sides headed by Demirel and Aliyev started, basically aim at renewing trust. During the welcoming ceremony Demirel said that Turkey will always support Azerbaijan. Russia's latest proposals on the Karabakh problem are at the top of the agenda to be discussed at the talks. Oil prospecting, transportation, and the sale of military equipment are also to be discussed at the Turkish-Azerbaijani talks. During the talks Turkey will convey its wish to Aliyev that the democratic process in Azerbaijan not be disrupted. [end recording]
