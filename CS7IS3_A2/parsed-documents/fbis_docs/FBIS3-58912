At the recent NATO summit, it was agreed that the Alliance presence in Europe should be bolstered and, in this context, the partners discussed the possibility that the Western European Union [WEU] might conduct military operations, using NATO logistical support, he continued. This could provide an element of flexibility whereby the Europeans could resort to the use of force in a particular situation, without automatically involving the United States, he explained. The minister went on to discuss the possibility of projecting the Alliance farther into the Mediterranean both in terms of a formal extension of the partnership to other nations in the region, and in terms of cooperation between the WEU and friendly nations such as Egypt or Morocco, always within the NATO framework. At present, this would be a dangerous hypothesis, but if the Mideast peace process goes forward it could be seen as a possible development, Andreatta said. Moving on to matters of development cooperation, Andreatta said that the fundamental problem was the study of technologies more suitable to nations of the south and to their transfer.
