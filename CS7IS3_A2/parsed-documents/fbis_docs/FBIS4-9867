In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Suarez said the proposal, which will be analyzed today during a hearing at the U.S. Senate, reacts to the impact caused by the converse project defended by a group of representatives led by Charles Rangel. Rangel spoke out in favor of repealing the so-called Torricelli Law, as well as lifting the economic and trade blockade imposed by Washington on the Caribbean island. Menendez, with his antihistorical proposal, wants to strengthen a policy in Congress that is clearly receiving growing rejection. In the United States, this policy has triggered demonstrations of civil disobedience like that by the Pastors for Peace, the CEA director noted. To conclude, Menendez said the proposal deserves the name of Residual Project of the Cold War [Proyecto Remanente de la Guerra Fria] as it opposes even the interests of U.S. businessmen who want to improve relations between both nations. Meanwhile, Lazaro Barredo, vice president of the International Relations Commission at the National Assembly of the People's Government, said Menendez' proposal is an expression of how, in U.S. power circles, there are those who shy away from the necessary and civilized negotiating table. Barredo explained that what the representative of Cuban origin proposed definitely is no different than the amendment previously presented by Robert Torricelli, while he agreed with Suarez that it is in response to Rangel's proposal. Rangel's proposal had strong repercussions in the political, economic, and academic sectors as it advocates true and effective solutions to the Cuban-U.S. conflict, Barredo indicated. Barredo, who is also a Cuban reporter, recalled that Menendez, together with Ileana Ros Leithenen and Lincoln Diaz Balart, both of whom are also of Cuban origin, became a trio that far from representing their constituency, have undertaken a policy aimed at favoring only their personal interests.
