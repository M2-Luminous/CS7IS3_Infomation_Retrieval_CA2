The government is assigning five "priority missions" to the police for the next five years: safety of persons and goods, control of immigration and the fight against clandestine labor, the fight against major criminality and drugs, protection against "external threats and terrorism," and the maintenance of public order. The message Charles Pasqua addressed to "his" police is clear: in these five priority sectors the police must obtain results at the level of effort agreed upon by the governmental security policy in a period of budgetary restriction. The draft law, containing twenty-six articles, is accompanied by two appendices which define the government's security policy and the programming of means for the national police for the years 1995-1999. - Police, gendarmerie, customs officers: With authority over the entire country, the police and the gendarmerie have the "obligation" to cooperate with regard to equipment, technical and scientific police, the creation and use of files, and exchanges of information. The draft law also establishes their "obligation to share their allocations with each other and to rationalize geographic installations." The customs office sees its role recognized in combatting trafficking, especially of drugs, and fighting clandestine immigration and labor, without the customs officers becoming officers of the judicial police (OJP). Finally, a "reserve situation" is envisioned for those who have completed their national service in the police force; they will be recruited by the creation of a specific competitive entry examination. - Powers of police chiefs: In order better to coordinate the activities of decentralized services and forces dependent upon the state, the representatives of the state receive general authority for activities in crime prevention. In Paris, the chief of police coordinates the activities of the Ile-de-France police chiefs to "prevent or confront events which disrupt public order when they involve Paris and other departments of the region." - Municipal police and security agencies: The draft law recognizes the contribution provided by mayors to "the mission of public safety." The missions of the municipal police are limited "to activities which derive from the authority of the mayor." A draft law specific to the municipal police will be submitted "this summer." Another draft law will define the legal status and missions of guard agencies, money transporters, and investigative agencies. - Demonstration police: In order to protect the officials tasked with the maintenance of order, it is proposed to "prohibit the carrying and transport of material which could endanger the safety of persons and goods during demonstrations," as well as to permit "vehicle searches and the seizure of these materials." Also envisioned is "a supplementary punishment of prohibiting the participation in a demonstration at the same location to persons who have already been found guilty of violence during previous demonstrations." - Video surveillance and security measures: A legal framework will be established for the use of surveillance cameras on public streets and in places open to the public (stores, railroad stations). The general principle according to which the "security aspects" must be taken into account in laws and regulations "whatever the subject" is stated: large administration and construction programs (stadiums, housing projects) must include the security dimension. - Special status for police officers: In addition to the creation of three police corps, the minister declared that police officials will be granted "special status." The OJP status is granted to officers and commanders of the national police, which is in accord with the fusion of "uniformed" and "plainclothes" officers. - Ten billion francs over five years: Seven billion francs are allocated for police equipment and materiel (an increase of 71 percent over 1990-1994). Pasqua claims that this will permit a doubling of the effort devoted to transmissions and to computers, to furnishings and housing, while increasing the credits for weapons, clothing, and means of protection by 30 percent. In addition, between now and 1999, 5,000 positions for police administrative and technical agents will be created (1.9 billion francs). Measures for personnel (1.15 billion francs over five years) focus in particular on the establishment of a premium granted to "approximately 30,000 to 35,000 officials posted in difficult zones" in Paris and areas coming under city contract.
