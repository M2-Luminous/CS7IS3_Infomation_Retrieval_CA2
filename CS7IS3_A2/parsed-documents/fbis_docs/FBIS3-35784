We believe that good-neighborliness with the PRC is strategically important, the minister declared. Defining the principal criteria of Russia's foreign policy in the Asia-Pacific area, Andrey Kozyrev said: [Begin Kozyrev recording] First, the importance of this region to Russia's future is increasing, above all because the economic role of the Asian part of our own country is growing. Second, the system of international relations in the Asia-Pacific region -- and, indeed, throughout the world -- is neither monopolar nor bipolar but is becoming increasingly multipolar. I think that echoes of great power pretensions, including the idea that there should be one sole superpower, and the ideology of regional or global alliances of some countries in the Asia-Pacific region against others are receding into the past. The future of the region, and the world as a whole, lies not in power rivalry but in cooperation and interaction, above all among the great powers. The danger that a region of major military conflicts could emerge is now at its lowest level. The significance of the military factor has been markedly reduced. At the same time, there is considerable potential here for tension. Not only is there the legacy of the cold war but there is tension created by new problems -- the question of access to the resources of the seas and the Pacific Ocean, including the seabed, and a number of border disputes. Religious and ethnic extremism is dramatically acute in Afghanistan. It also poses a threat to Tajikistan. Unless we tackle these problems jointly, the outcome could be explosive for a region which includes both Russia and China, a region which is, of course, of vital interest to us. In these circumstances the key issue is the threat of the spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology. I am sure that it is not in the security interests of any part of the region, including Russia, China, and India, for such a development of events to happen. Fourth, the 21st century will clearly be a century of rapid economic development in the Pacific. Developing economic might will not threaten neighbors but on the contrary will create favorable conditions for economic growth throughout the region. In other words competition in this sphere is mutually advantageous competition. We welcome China's participation in the recent Seattle meeting of Asia-Pacific states as an important event. For our part we count on friendly China's support in getting Russia included in the region's economic unification. Fifth, in Asia, as in other regions, economic progress helps to safeguard the principal human rights and freedoms. We favor the formation of a security community in the Asia-Pacific region, which anyone who wants will be able to join. In this respect we should, of course, bear in mind Europe's experience, but at the same time go our own, Asian way.

Revealing this idea, Andrey Kozyrev said: [Begin Kozyrev recording] What could this new concept mean? Above all, the further strengthening of mutual trust and security. Guided by the policy of good-neighborliness with the PRC, Russia still fully adheres to the principles of the declaration on the principles of relations signed last year at summit level. This includes the whole range of the two parties' obligations to comply with the principle of not using force against each other or in international relations in any form, including not being the first to use nuclear weapons. We are also in favor of further progress at the first Russian- Chinese talks in Asia on military detente and confidence-building measures in the border region. As permanent members of the Security Council, Russia and China advocate resolving the problems of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula on the basis of International Atomic Energy Agency guarantees. On the whole, with regard to our cooperation on the Security Council, I would like to emphasize that we are satisfied with the existing level of interaction. The enhancement of trade and economic cooperation is an important aspect of our partnership. We are ready to participate in major economic development projects being implemented by China, such as the construction of the Three Gorges hydroelectric power station complex. Russia is very interested in the modernization -- or participation in the modernization -- of Chinese industrial enterprises formerly set up with the help of the Soviet Union. Cooperation in border regions is one of the quickest and most effective ways to develop economic ties with - it goes without saying - a coordinating role for the governments of both sides.
