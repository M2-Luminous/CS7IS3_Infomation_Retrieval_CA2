The data obtained from the measurements should be stored in a dioxin database and made public. Mandatory limits based on the principle of prevention should be laid down as rapidly as possible for the main sources of emission, says the SPD. The dioxin sources where dioxins and furans occur as undesirable by-products should be "stopped up." The deputies thus recommend a schedule for phasing out the use of hexachloroethane in the aluminum industry, close compounds involving chloric paints, lacquers, oils, and lubricants in the metal industry, chloric cooling lubricants and cleaning agents in metal working, and halogenated organic coatings such as PVC [polyvinyl chloride] or chloric materials for chipboard and wood products. Products containing halogenated organic compounds should be labeled accordingly, states the motion, which also calls for dioxin to be banned from recycling. The call above all is for a ban on close compounds containing chloric materials in the automobile industry, for instance PVC underseals, and in cable sheaths. Dioxin concentration limits should be laid down for agricultural and horticultural areas so as to avoid it being transferred to human beings via animal and vegetable foods. At the European level, the Federal Government should press for this dioxin modification program to be made binding throughout the European Union.
