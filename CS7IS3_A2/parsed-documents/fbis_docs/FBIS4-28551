Speaking at a ceremony marking the start of development of the Teluk Ratai naval base in southern Sumatra, he said Indonesia needed a strong and efficient naval force to patrol its vast waters and protect its economic exclusive zone. "People who have less than full understanding and who presented their views have blurred the issue, caused divisions and suspicions which can affect stability," he said. He warned that the government would not tolerate such manoeuvrings and would take firm action against such people, whom he did not identify. The controversy stirred by the purchase of the vessels -- the cost was said to be US$1.1 billion [Singapore dollar] (S$1.65 billion) -- has given an impression that there are divisions within the government between groups that are pro-and anti-Dr B.J. Habibie, the Research and Technology Minister. He was entrusted by Mr Suharto to handle the purchase but critics, including Defence and Security Minister Edi Sudrajat, have described the US$1.1 billion figure as being excessive. Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told Parliament on Tuesday that the government was only allocating US$319 million for the purchase and refitting of the ships. Dr Habibie has, however, defended the purchase and the cost though he accepted a slashing of the original US$1.1 billion budget he sought, which covered refurbishment and development of supporting facilities, such as bases. In his remarks yesterday, Mr Suharto expressed support for both the purchase of the ships -- now put officially at US$482 million -- and the establishment of the Teluk Ratai base, which is being developed to support the operations of the 39 vessels. At Teluk Ratai in Lampung province, he also witnessed the official handing over of five of the vessels to the navy. He said the government first heard about the availability of the vessels from private-sector sources. He then asked Dr Habibie to get more details about the ships and their availability. This was because Dr Habibie "is well-known to officials and private businessmen in Germany. "Because of that, the appointment of Dr Habibie to handle the deal should not be made an issue," he said.
