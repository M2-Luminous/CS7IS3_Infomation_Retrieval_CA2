He told journalists that Russia and China must have normal friendly and even fraternal relations. On the evening of May 25 Chernomyrdin will leave for China for a four-day working visit. He announced that a large package of agreements was expected to be signed during his visit to Beijing. These agreements cover the following areas: the Russian-Chinese state border regime, cooperation in the sphere of environmental protection, sea navigation, water resources in the border regions close to the Amur and Ussuri rivers, cooperation in the sphere of agriculture, avoidance of dual taxation and cooperation in the sphere of communications. Chernomyrdin emphasized that in 1993 the trade turnover between Russia and China had increased by 30 pct and amounted to about 8 billion U.S. dollars. He called this a success and added that during the previous years the trade turnover had been decreasing. This tendency was overcome only last year. Chernomyrdin stressed the importance of friendly relations between the two countries since they had a common border of 6,000 kilometers. He added that there was all necessary grounds for such relations. Chernomyrdin suggested that China had not forgotten the contribution of the ex-Soviet Union to its development. He said that many graduates from Soviet higher educational establishments occupied high posts in China. Chernomyrdin pointed out that Russia was ready to receive Chinese students and to send Russian students to study in China. He added that Russia could participate in modernization of Chinese enterprises built with the assistance from the USSR. Chernomyrdin remarked that the potential for development of bilateral relations was not being used efficiently enough. Chernomyrdin suggested that there were big opportunities in the sphere of military-technical cooperation. He stressed that Russia had military-technical capabilities which must not be ruined even under the conversion program and which could work for export. Chernomyrdin recognized that there existed problems in Russian- Chinese relations which must not be kept secret. A number of such problems were connected with cooperation in the neighboring regions. He was sure that there must be no barter-relations in trade. Chernomyrdin spoke in favor of a search for mechanisms for mutual account settling. The Russian government's apparatus told INTERFAX that during his visit to China Chernomyrdin would be accompanied by Vice Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, Agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun, Environment Minister Viktor Danilov-Danilyan and Transport Minister Vitaliy Yefimov.
