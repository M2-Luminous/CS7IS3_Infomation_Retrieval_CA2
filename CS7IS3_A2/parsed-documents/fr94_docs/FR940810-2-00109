FR940810-2-00109 FR940810-2-00072 The member shall maintain a copy of the names and business connections of all persons having any beneficial interest in the account or a copy of the current [opinion of counsel] written representation in its files for at least three years following the member's last sale of a new issue to the account, depending upon which of the above requirements the member elects to follow. For purposes of this section, a list or [opinion] written representation shall be deemed to be current if it is based upon the status of the account as of a date not more than 18 months prior to the date of the transaction. Beneficial Interest The term beneficial interest means not only ownership interests, but every type of direct financial interest of any persons enumerated in paragraphs (1) through (4) hereof in such account [, including, without limitation, management fees based on the performance of the account]. Provided, however, that no restricted person shall be deemed to have a beneficial interest in an account receiving a hot issue as a result of ownership of an interest in an investment partnership or corporation, or similar type account (``investment entity''), if the following conditions are met. 1. The investment entity establishes a separate brokerage account, with a separate identification number, for its new-issue purchases. At the end of each fiscal year, the general partner, or similarly situated party, will certify in writing to its independent certified public accountants that: (a) all hot issues purchased by the investment entity were placed in this new-issue account; and (b) that the participants in the new-issue account are not restricted persons under this Interpretation. 2. Prior to the execution of the initial hot issue transaction, the investment entity's accountant or attorney will provide a written representation that complies with paragraph B of the section of this Interpretation entitled ``Investment Partnerships and Corporations.'' 3. As part of its audit procedure for the investment entity, the indendent certified public accountant will confirm in writing to the investment entity that all allocations for the new-issue account were made in accordance with the provisions of the applicable investment entity agreement that restricts participation in hot issue purchases. 4. The investment entity will maintain in its files copies of the certifications, representations, and confirmations referred to in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above for at least three years following the last purchase of a hot issue for the new-issue account. 5. The investment entity will accept investment funds from other investment entities only if such other accounts provide the same documentation and assurances described in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(4) above that restricted persons will not participate in the purchase of hot issues. 6. The certifications and documents required in paragraphs (1)&hyph;(3) above shall be provided to the member holding such account at such time as these certifications and documents are filed with the investment entity and its independent certified public accountant and, the member shall make such documentation available to the NASD upon request. Venture Capital Investors This Interpretation shall not prohibit the sale of hot issues in an initial public offering to a person restricted under the Interpretation or to an account in which such restricted person has a beneficial interest (a ``Venture Capital Investor'') if the following conditions are met: 1. The Venture Capital Investor has held an ownership interest in the company issuing the hot issue securities for a period of one year prior to the effective of the public offering; 2. The acquisition of the hot issue securities in the public offering does not increase the percentage equity ownership of the Venture Capital Investor in the company above that held three months prior to the filing of the registration statement in connection with the offering; 3. The Venture Capital Investor received no special terms in connection with the purchase; and 4. The securities purchased shall be restricted from sale or transfer for a period of three months following the conclusion of the offering. Violations by Recipient In those cases where a member or person associated with a member has been the recipient of securities of a public offering to the extent that such violated the Interpretation, the member or person associated with a member shall be deemed to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation as well as the member who sold the securities since their responsibility in relation to the public distribution is equally as great at that of the member selling them. In those cases where a member or a person associated with a member has caused, directly or indirectly, the distribution of securities to a person falling within the restrictive provisions of this Interpretation the member or person associated with a member shall also be deemed to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the Rules of Fair Practice and this Interpretation. Receipt by a member or a person associated with a member of securities of a hot issue which is being distributed by an issuer itself without the assistance of an underwriter and/or selling group is also intended to be subject to the provisions of this Interpretation. Violations by Registered Representative Executing Transaction The obligation which members have to make a bona fide public distribution at the public offering price of securities of a hot issue is also an obligation of every person associated with a member who causes a transaction to be executed. Therefore, where sale are made by such persons in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of this Interpretation, such persons associated with a member will be considered equally culpable with the member for the violations found taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case under consideration. Disclosure The fact that a disclosure is made in the prospectus or offering circular that a sale of securities would be made in a manner inconsistent with this Interpretation does not take the matter out of its scope. In sum, therefore, disclosure does not affect the proscriptions of this Interpretation. Explanation of terms The following explanation of terms is provided for the assistance of members. Other words which are defined in the By-Laws and Rules of Fair Practice shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning as defined therein. Associated Person A person associated with a member or any other broker/dealer, as defined in Article I, paragraph (m) of the NASD's By-Laws, shall not include a person whose association with the member is limited to a passive ownership interest in the member of ten percent or less, and who does not receive hot issues from the member in which he or she has the ownership interest; and that such member is not in a position to direct hot issues to such person. Public Offering The term public offering shall mean any primary or secondary distribution of securities made pursuant to a registration statement or offering circular including exchange offers, rights offerings, offerings made pursuant to a merger or acquisition, straight debt offerings and all other securities distributions of any kind whatsoever except any offering made pursuant to an exemption under Section 4(1), 4(2) or 4(6) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or pursuant to Rule 504 (unless considered a public offering in the states where offered), Rule 505 or Rule 506 adopted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended [all distributions of securities whether underwritten or not; whether registered, unregistered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and whether they are primary or secondary distributions, including intrastate distributions and Regulation A issues, which shall at an immediate premium, in the secondary market]. It shall not mean exempted securities as defined in Section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Immediate Family The term immediate family shall include parents, mother-in-law or father-in-law, husband or wife, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law, and children.
