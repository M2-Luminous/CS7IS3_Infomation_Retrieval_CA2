In a statement distributed in London and a copy of which AL-HAYAH has received, the Free Iraqi Council said that Saddam accused a number of senior officials from al-Duri of conspiring against the regime. They are: Tali' al-Duri, military governor general; 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri, director of public security and former member of the Ba'th Party Regional Command, who was in charge of the Mosul organization in the past; Khadr al-Duri, former deputy of former intelligence chief Barzan al-Tikriti, Saddam's half-brother; and Sabir al-Duri, former intelligence chief. The council's statement said that 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Duri's family has been expelled from its home in the exclusive al-Mansur area, west of Baghdad, and that the house has been turned into offices for one of the Ba'th Party's organizations. Furthermore, a number of Army officers and party officials have been pensioned off. Some of them are being investigated.
