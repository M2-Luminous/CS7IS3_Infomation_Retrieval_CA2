The wages for employees have been paid from the loans received and other sources. This happened because of the Lithuanian tax laws according to which income taxes were imposed on the production which was not sold. "The nuclear power station sells the energy to the state energetics system which only now pays for the energy produced last year", Director General Viktor Shevaldin said. He also noted that the nuclear power station was the object of higher risk, thus, it was very irresponsible to do such things. However, "strikes and rallies are not our methods", Shevaldin said.
