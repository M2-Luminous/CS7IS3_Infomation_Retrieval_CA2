Vice Premier Li Lanqing attended both meetings and had group photos taken with those representatives present. Li Lanqing said: Since the start of reform and opening up, a great deal of good technology and management expertise has been introduced into our country. However, it is unavoidable that a few flies will get into the house when the windows are open. For this reason, it is even more necessary to step up the building of spiritual civilization, and strengthen ideological and political work. Some people think we can attract more foreign investment with some unhealthy practices; I think that it is an extremely big mistake. Tolerating such unhealthy things will only worsen China's investment environment. We must not permit anyone to undermine our investment environment and spiritual civilization with such unhealthy practices as the "three companions [to provide clients with female companions at dinner, drinking, and dance parties]." He said: Reform, opening up, and the development of a socialist market economy have created favorable conditions for China's economic development. However, national prosperity is the result of hard work, not a windfall. We must emphasize over and over that our cause requires the display of unselfish dedication and hard work, and it also requires thousands upon thousands of model workers to play a backbone and leading role. Both the power and chemical industry are China's basic industries, playing an important role in our economic life. At present, our country should accelerate the development of basic industries. The Ministry of Power Industry today conferred the honorific title "national special model worker of the power industry" on Zheng Changfei and 10 other workers and staff members, with a bonus of 10,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations; the honorific title "national model worker of the power industry" on Tang Zhihong and 305 other comrades, with a bonus of 8,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations; and the honorific title "national advanced collective of the power industry" on 100 organizations, including the No. 1 boiler plant of the Qinling Power Plant. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to confer the honorific title "national model worker of the chemical industry" on Wang Yongan and 379 other comrades; the honorific title "national distinguished ideological and political worker of the chemical industry for 1991-1993" on Cai Dejun and 99 other comrades; and the honorific title "enterprise of excellent ideological and political work for 1991-1993" on Beijing No. 2 Chemical Plant and 47 other chemical industry enterprises and institutions. State councillor Luo Gan attended the commendation meeting of the Ministry of Power Industry. Yu Qiuli, Qian Zhengying, Zhang Dinghua, and other leading comrades concerned also attended today's meeting.
