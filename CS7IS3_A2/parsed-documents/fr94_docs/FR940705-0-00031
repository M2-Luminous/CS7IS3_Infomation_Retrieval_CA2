FR940705-0-00031 FR940705-0-00002 (5) Testing procedures. The procedures for testing jacket specimens for compliance with paragraph (m)(4) of this section must be as follows: (i) Melt flow rate. The melt flow rate must be determined by ASTM D 1238&hyph;90b, Condition E. Jacketing material must be free from flooding and filling compound. (ii) Tensile strength and ultimate elongation. Test in accordance with EIA&hyph;455&hyph;89A, using a jaw separation speed of 500 millimeters per minute for low density material and 50 millimeters per minute for high and medium density materials. (iii) Environmental stress cracking. Test in accordance with ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a. (iv) Shrinkback. Test in accordance with the procedures specified in EIA&hyph;455&hyph;86 using a temperature of 100 # 1 ○ C for a 4 hour period for low density material and a test temperature of 115 # 1 ○ C for a 4 hour period for high and medium density materials. (v) Impact. The test must be performed in accordance with ASTM D 4565&hyph;90a using an impact force of 4 newton-meters at a temperature of ^20 # 2 ○ C. A cracked or split jacket constitutes failure. (6) Jacket thickness. The nominal outer jacket thickness must not be less than 1.3 millimeters. The test method used must either be the End Sample Method (paragraph (m)(6)(i) of this section) or the Continuous Uniformity Thickness Gauge Method (paragraph (m)(6)(ii) of this section). (i) End sample method. The jacket must be capable of meeting the following requirements: Minimum Average Thickness: 90 percent (%) of nominal thickness Minimum Spot Thickness: 70 % of nominal thickness (ii) Continuous uniformity thickness gauge. (A) The jacket must be capable of meeting the following requirements: Minimum Average Thickness: 75 % of nominal thickness Minimum Thickness: 70 % of nominal thickness Maximum Eccentricity: 40 % of nominal thickness E:GRAPHICSER05JY94.000 (B) The maximum and minimum thickness values shall be based on the average of each axial section. (7) For jackets having embedded strength members, the jacket thickness must meet the requirements of paragraph (m)(6) of this section except that the jacket thickness over the strength members must not be less than 0.50 millimeters. (8) The minimum jacket thickness at any point over the support messenger for self-supporting aerial cable utilizing such an element must be 1.1 millimeters. (9) The web dimension for self-supporting aerial cable utilizing such a feature must be as follows: E:GRAPHICSER05JY94.001 (n) Sheath slitting cord (optional). (1) A sheath slitting cord is optional.
