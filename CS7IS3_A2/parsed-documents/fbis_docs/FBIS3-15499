It was decided that after being finalized by a drafting committee and an initiative group, the documents would be forwarded by a co-chairmen to the adressees. Public chamber co-chairman Boris Topornin said at the close of the meeting that issues submitted for the chamber's consideration should be worked out more carefully. After hearing officials of the Russian Foreign Ministry and other relevant agencies, including the Migration Service, the Ministry for Cooperation, the Russian ambassadors to Latvia and Estonia, members of the Public Chamber agreed that "numerous violations of the rights of compatriots take place" in the Baltic republics of Latvia and Estonia. Not only people who settled in the Baltics after 1940, but also many of native residents have been stripped of citizenship there. Hundreds of thousands of non-citizens do not have the right to own land and real estate, they are even forbidden to change their flats. They are barred from public service, they are also socially deprived. Life is especially difficult for former servicemen and members of their families. All this can be considered as "a deliberate discriminatory policy of ousting ethnic Russians." Reporting some cases of discimination of Latvia's ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking "non-citizens," President of the Sodruzhestvo Foundation Mikhail Zadornov, who was among of the initiators of the discussion in the public chamber, pointed out that Russia did not provide actual assistance to ethnic Russians outside it and to forced migrants coming to the country. This view was shared by many politicians and public figures. They believe the president should "come up with a statement on the concept of Russia's state policy with respect to compatriots." This motion was included into a draft recommendation by the public chamber for President Boris Yeltsin. The Foreign Ministry was recommended to regard protection of the interests of ethnic Russians living in the Baltic states as a priority task and to step up its activities in international organizations with an aim to spotlight violations of human rights in the Baltic countries. The Russian Government was recommended to speed the drafting and passage of a federal programme for protection and support of ethnic Russians residing in former Soviet republics. The public chamber called upon the Federation Council and the State Duma to ratify within the shortest posssible time the agreements and accords signed with Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. These agreements are designed to ensure legal protection of ethnic Russians. Participants in the discussion emphasised that ethnic Russians in other ex-Soviet republics had found themselves in rather desperate conditions as well. Each of the newly-independent states "has its own specific problems related to the Russian-speaking population, but the need for actions to protect compatriots living there are extremely acute in all of them," the Public Chamber stressed.
