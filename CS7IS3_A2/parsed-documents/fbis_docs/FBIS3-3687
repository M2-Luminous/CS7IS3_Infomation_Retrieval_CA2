The Ecuadorian president is scheduled to pay a state visit to China from March 18 to 23 at the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. President Duran Ballen attaches importance to the visit and is expected to exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of common interest with the Chinese leadership, said Cesar Roman Gonzalez, Ecuadorian ambassador to China, in an interview with XINHUA. The visit is aimed at deepening mutual understanding, enhancing friendly co-operation and developing economic and trade ties between the two countries. Ecuadorian businessmen will accompany the president on the trip and discuss co-operation with their Chinese partners, Gonzalez said. Since the setting up of diplomatic ties between the two countries in 1980, the co-operative relations of friendship, based on mutual respect and understanding, have made steady headway, the ambassador noted. As a developing country, Ecuador practises reform and opening policies, and is seeking more investment from the outside, he said. Ecuador wishes to promote more extensive economic and trade ties with China, he stressed. "Our bilateral co-operation is at the beginning of a new phase," Gonzalez said, expressing the belief that the bilateral ties have bright prospects for development.
