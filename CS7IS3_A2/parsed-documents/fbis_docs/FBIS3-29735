LE MONDE recently cried for a "special inspection" of the DPRK, claiming that a "decisive attitude of the international community" should be shown. This is a pernicious propaganda aimed at casting a chill over the agreement between the DPRK and the IAEA. It reveals the sinister intention of France to force "special inspection" upon the DPRK and take international "sanctions" and pressure against it. As was already reported, the afore-said agreement has been unanimously welcomed by world public opinion as affirmative developments for a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. France, however, is obtrusively crying for a "decisive attitude of the international community," ignoring the unbiased opinion. This is not only an intolerable challenge to us but a criminal act to arrest the affirmative developments provided with so much efforts. Some time ago, the French foreign minister and the Foreign Ministry spokesman argued that the DPRK's "nuclear issue" should be "examined" by the United Nations Security Council. France has called for "sanctions" more than once against the DPRK to isolate and stifle it, in league with the U.S. right-wing conservative forces, Japan and the South Korean puppets. Such persistent moves of France against the DPRK are apparently aimed at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear test, charging the DPRK with the fictitious "nuclear issue." They are also motivated by its wicked design to encourage the United States, a dialogue partner of the DPRK, to confrontation with us to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, cause a military conflict in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula, profit from a massive sale of destructive military equipment and strengthen relations with the South Korean puppets. We take a serious view of the criminal acts pursued by the French wuthorities to stifle the DPRK. If France continues to resort to such insidious acts without discretion, it would drink a bitter cup. France would be well advised to clearly see the situation, ponder over the matter and promptly stop such wicked acts as doing harm to others.
