Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali "would like to make it very clear that he will not hesitate to use airpower again to protect UN-designated safe areas," said UN spokeswoman Therese Gastaut. Gorazde is one of six such areas in Bosnia. Two U.S. F-16 fighter planes attacked Serb positions near Gorazde Sunday, officials in Washington and Brussels said. The air raids were ordered by the top UN official in the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, in consultation with Butrus-Ghali to protect eight UN observers in the Gorazde enclave, Gastaut said. U.S. F-16 warplanes carried out two sorties, at 1625 GMT and 1629 GMT, she said. She characterized the attacks as "close air support" rather than air strikes in the traditional sense because the objective was to protect the observers and other UN staff in Gorazde. On Saturday Butrus-Ghali instructed the UN force in Bosnia to use all means necessary to force the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw to positions they held before their Gorazde offensive began in late March.
