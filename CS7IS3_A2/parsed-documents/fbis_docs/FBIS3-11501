Their presence confirms the firm determination of the people of Upper Huallaga (Tingo Maria-Tocache) to find reconciliation, peace, and development. The repented subversives, some with their respective families, were welcomed by the commanders, officers, and soldiers of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313, which is headquartered in "Los Laureles" Fort, on the outskirts of this city. In increasingly frequent and massive numbers, waves of townspeople are coming here to choose the path of pacification, after having mistakenly joined the Shining Path, or after being forced, or even abducted, to cooperate with this criminal terrorist organization. They explained to LA REPUBLICA today that before taking this step, most of them had previously contacted peasant self-defense patrol members of their respective localities. That is why military authorities attach priority to the organization of the self-defense patrols and the self-defense committees in the towns of Upper Huallaga. Some repented subversives try to make contact with military authorities in the Emergency Zone, in the antisubversive barracks of Tingo Maria and Tocache. Relatives, friends, or some other spokesman mediate on their behalf, seeking guarantees in exchange for their surrender. Today we saw the new group of repentant people being properly registered at "Los Laureles" Fort. They will then be submitted to a thorough medical checkup, including women and children. All pregnant women, and mothers and babies are transferred to a Health Ministry hospital for specialized care. The people will remain at "Los Laureles" Fort as long as necessary to be monitored, to receive medical treatment, to obtain the necessary documents to legalize their status as free citizens who are not wanted by the courts and -- in some cases -- to receive military protection as refugees. Most of the ones from this central jungle area decide to return almost immediately to their towns, back to their farm work and to the self-defense committees that now fight the Shining Path cells, which are desperately and unsuccessfully trying to reorganize. Today's arrival of the 100 repented subversives coincided with the conclusion of a military training cycle of 30 peasant self-defense patrol members from various peasant communities. Some of these patrol members are former subversives who repented and authorities of their respective localities who have been courageous enough to accept the challenge, refusing to yield to terrorist extortion and threats. These authorities have actively organized self-defense committees and peasant patrols to preserve order in the towns. They comprise volunteers of a community who are supplied with shotguns and machetes, and who are trained by the military. They protect civilians. A self-defense committee, which includes the peasant patrol, has a much broader mission. It protects the community and, at the same time, participates in reconstruction work, in the construction of civil works for the community, and in social support programs to promote development. EP [Peruvian Army] Commander Javier Riva Ramirez is the political-military commander of Leoncio Prado (Tingo Maria) Province and chief of Antisubversive Battalion No. 313 headquartered in "Los Laureles." Today, he supervised the incorporation of 100 peasant patrol members and the peasant patrol members' training session. Commander Riva reported that nine peasant patrols have so far been organized and trained in Leoncio Prado Province, the capital of which is Tingo Maria. Some 900 duly trained men, whom the government has supplied with shotguns, are members of those patrols. "To avoid infiltration by subversives, each peasant patrol candidate is submitted to examinations and careful evaluations that begin in their own community," Commander Riva said. He described the following steps of the evaluation and selection: - Peasant patrol candidates are first studied and selected by the authorities and by the people of each community. The names are then proposed before the military authorities of the Huallaga Front. - The applicants then report to the respective military barracks where a team of psychologists, psychiatrists, lawyers, and other specialists will study their personalities, backgrounds, and physical and mental capacity. - One these exams are passed, applicants are ready to receive military training. - Instructors teach patrol members defensive tactics in order to efficiently patrol their towns, the theory of the operation of firearms, practice with shotguns, and courage tests in a combat range and in the field. Under a burning sun, and in extremely muddy conditions following recent torrential rains, LA REPUBLICA today watched a military training session of 30 peasant patrol members. It was the last session of their training; at 1100 they attended a special ceremony at "Los Laureles" fort. At that civic patriotic ceremony, hundreds of peasant patrol members and a large number of repented subversives swore allegiance to the Peruvian flag. They also swore to fight terrorism and subversion so as to consolidate regional and national peace. At the shotgun exercises, the applicants today obtained satisfactory grades. The instructors said that some are quite good. Instructors are especially interested in teaching patrol members a defensive, rather than offensive, spirit. An instructors told them: "Bear in mind that your mission is, above all, to guarantee peace and order in your communities. We are fed up with war and useless shedding of blood. Consequently, be very careful when using the arms that we are giving you today." He added: "Do not forget that arms can help to protect many lives. They must be used only when necessary and against terrorist criminals who threaten our towns and our families." When the patrol members fired their arms, the instructors especially emphasized precautions for the use of shotguns to avoid endangering innocent lives. Commander Javier Riva told LA REPUBLICA that the new pacification strategy in Upper Huallaga involves the creation of the largest number of self-defense committees and the largest number of repented subversives. Commander Riva said: "This is linked with a broad program of social support for people rescued from the Shining Path yoke." He announced that soon his office will -- in coordination with the commander of the Huallaga Front, General Alfredo Rodriguez -- implement far-reaching agreements with the Special Upper Huallaga Project and with Foncodes [National Compensation and Social Development Fund], to find jobs and help the repented subversives, who are now striving to rejoin society.
