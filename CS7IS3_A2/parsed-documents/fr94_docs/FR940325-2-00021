FR940325-2-00021 FR940325-2-00004 We also do not consider bagging costs as representative of normal packing costs. Rather, it appears to us that Lafarge could not sell the flux to the home market customers without incurring these special bagging costs. While we agree with petitioner that Pads from Italy is applicable here (in that difmer adjustments are based on the variable cost of manufacture only), petitioner's reliance on Phosphoric Acid from Israel is misplaced, because the bagging for flux is clearly distinguishable from the drums used for packing (and accounted for in packing costs) in Phosphoric Acid from Israel. Therefore, we do not consider bagging in this case to be a pre-shipment expense, but rather a condition of sale. For these reasons, we have treated these bagging costs as direct selling expenses, rather than as part of variable COM or packing for purposes of the final determination. (See March 9, 1994, Memorandum from V. Irene Darzenta to Richard W. Moreland Re. Treatment of Bagging Costs Associated with Home Market Sales of Flux.) Because the difmer that resulted from exclusion of these costs from variable COM was less than 20 percent, we used the reported, verified home market flux sales as the basis for FMV and deducted bagging costs as direct selling expenses from FMV accordingly. Comment 12 Petitioner states that the difmer adjustment is also incorrect because respondent included fixed costs (i.e., G&A) and profit in its calculation. Petitioner asserts that if the Department includes bagging in the difmer adjustment, it should recalculate the amount of the difmer to include only variable costs. Finally, petitioner maintains that the reported packing expenses, inclusive of bagging costs, should be adjusted to avoid double- counting G&A expenses. DOC Position For the reasons stated in the DOC Position to Comment 11 above and in accordance with the Department's normal methodology, we have recalculated the difmer adjustment to exclude bagging costs and include only variable COM. However, upon further review of the documentation examined at verification, we note that the G&A expenses included in the reported packing expenses were not double-counted. Notwithstanding this fact, we have also excluded from the packing adjustment the reported G&A expenses. Comment 13 Petitioner believes that the claimed adjustment for home market technical service expenses should be denied or reduced. Petitioner maintains that the Department should deny the claimed direct adjustment for home market technical service expenses, because these expenses cannot be directly tied to specific sales made during the POI. According to petitioner, services such as those provided by respondent for purposes of determining new uses for a product in future production aimed at increasing future sales levels constitute goodwill or sales promotion, and as such are not directly related to the sales under consideration. Petitioner also argues that technical service expenses attributable to test sales made during 1992 that are considered to be outside of the ordinary course of trade should be excluded from the adjustment; however, because the Department did not verify data that would permit their exclusion, the Department should deny the adjustment in toto. Nonetheless, if the Department determines that an adjustment is warranted, petitioner urges that it should only deduct the reported travel expenses and not the reported salary expenses comprising respondent's technical service expense calculation because salaries are considered fixed costs which are incurred whether or not the services are provided. Respondent contends that technical service expenses should be treated as direct selling expenses in accordance with past Department and court decisions. Respondent notes that the technical services performed by LFI in France consist of visits to customers to review and help analyze the customers' test data and to work with the customer to make more efficient use of flux in its steel operations. Lafarge emphasizes that the customer needs to know from the time he makes his purchase that LFI's technical staff will be available to provide this analysis for him on an on-going basis. According to respondent, these types of services are not provided by LCA in the United States because LCA's U.S. flux customers perform this technical service using their own personnel. Respondent argues further that an adjustment for technical service salaries is appropriate where the technical service personnel provide functions that the customer would otherwise have to perform himself. DOC Position We agree with respondent in part. Lafarge provides the technical support to its home market customers because they have not yet developed the systems required to perform these services themselves. Without Lafarge's technical support, the customers cannot analyze and make appropriate adjustments in their steel production processes to optimize performance of CA flux in their operations. Given the nature of the steelmaking industry, it is reasonable to believe that, while these technical service expenses could not be directly tied to specific sales of flux, they would not otherwise have been incurred but for the sale of flux. It is the Department's practice to allow, as a direct selling expense, claims for services rendered in assisting the customer in solving problems with products purchased during the POI to the extent that the variable costs can be segregated from the fixed costs. In general, variable technical service costs include travel expense, while fixed technical service costs include salaries. (See e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Brass Sheet and Strip from Italy, 52 FR 816, January 9, 1987; and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany, 54 FR 18992, May 3, 1989.) Therefore, in accordance with our practice, we have treated travel expenses associated with technical services as direct selling expenses, and we have treated salary expenses as indirect selling expenses and deducted them from FMV accordingly. We made no adjustment to these amounts for expenses related to test sales that may have been made in 1992, because we did not have sufficient information on the record to allow us to do so accurately.
