On November 12, 1992, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 2 The NASD has amended the filing four times, most recently on April 8, 1994. 3 As amended, the proposal extends the provisions of Schedule E to the NASD By-Laws 4 to potential conflicts of interest that arise when a member participating in an offering owns debt, preferred equity, or non-voting equity of the issuer. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 The first three amendments were submitted prior to and incorporated in the notice if filing published by the Commission. Amendment No. 4, filed on April 8, 1994, was a technical amendment to reflect that the proposed standard for ``conflict of interest'' is a rebuttable presumption. Amendment No. 4 also responded to a comment letter on the filing received by the Commission. 4 NASD Manual, (CCH) Â¶ 1881. Notice of the proposed rule change, together with its terms of substance, appeared in the Federal Register on September 27, 1995. 5 The Commission received one letter commenting on the proposal. This order approves the rule change. 5 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32930 (September 21, 1993), 58 FR 50373. I.
