According to a source in that secretariat, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola Labor Party's [MPLA-PT] threats jeopardize the norms of the humanitarian organizations and show that Luanda continues to manipulate humanitarian aid policy in favor of the government and the MPLA-PT. That source also said that UNITA had no responsibility whatsoever with the attacks on World Food Program, WFP, aircraft in Malange, where, ironically, the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola are on the offensive and are logistically supplied by aircraft. That source added that UNITA will work to facilitate humanitarian aid work in Angola, as long as the government keeps its distance and stops interfering in the distribution of [word indistinct], the WFP's cooking oil, or the UNICEF's soap.
