VDI-N, Bonn, 3 December 1993--Next Monday the European ministers for research and technology are meeting in Brussels. Their theme: the fourth General Program for Research and Technology for the European Union. There are not only difficulties in agreeing on content and financing. Now the European Parliament is also headed on a confrontation course and has called for an additional increase in money for research. "We realize that we are on a confrontation course with our demands," Rolf Linkohr, the European parliamentarian, conceded, "but we cannot permit research in Europe to continue losing in importance." At Linkohr's suggestion, on the 18th of November the European Parliament called for 13.7 billion ECU (1 ECU = 1.92 German marks) for the fourth General Program for Research and Technology starting in 1994, 600 million ECU more than planned. Next Monday in Brussels the European ministers of research and technology will attempt to find an answer to this demand. But they already failed at their last meeting in mid-October to come to an agreement either on the content or the financing of this fourth General Program for Research and Technology for the European Union (EU). Nor is their success on Monday in any way a sure thing. "The chances," according to a colleague of Federal Minister for Research and Technology Paul Krueger, "are fifty-fifty." Three different ideas must be reconciled in the formulation of the fourth General Program for Research and Technology: - The European Commission has requested 13.1 billion ECU calculated for the research and technology program from 1994 to 1998. The largest blocks go to information and communications technologies (I&C - 3,900 million ECU), industrial technologies (1,800 million ECU), life sciences (1,325 million ECU), energy technology (1,050 million ECU), fusion research (980 million ECU), and environmental research (970 million ECU). - The European Parliament had originally agreed to this proposal but then on the 18th of November demanded another 600 million ECU. Of this, 400 million ECU should be added to research on non-nuclear energy carriers. In addition, the industrial technologies were supposed to go up by 300 million ECU and I&C technologies go down by 300 million ECU. Finally, the funds for the "socially oriented research" recently included in the fourth General Program for Research and Technology are also supposed to be increased from the previous 125 million ECU to 225 million. - The European ministers for research and technology responsible for the financing of this general program have until now approved neither of the Commission's or the Parliament's ideas on content nor financing. Even among themselves they are still far from agreeing on the content and financing (see VDI-N 22/93, p. 3.). That is why this coming Monday the ministers for research and technology will try above all to determine the amount of the total budget. While the majority of the EU countries either agree with the Commission's proposal of 13.1 billion ECU or even call for more, Krueger considers this proposal overspending. With his colleagues in the Cabinet and the Minister of Finance Theo Waigel in tow, he will therefore try to keep the budget down to under 13 billion ECU. He has the influence to do it. After all, Bonn finances the Brussels budget and thus the fourth General Program for Research and Technology as well to a good 30%. However, Krueger can currently count only on the British for support with his demands. They had already indicated in October that they did not want to go over 11 billion ECU. Krueger and his British colleagues cannot not be outvoted--unanimity is a requirement for passing the program. For tactical reasons, according to the Brussels research manager, the Council of Ministers may remain with its budget proposal well under the 13.1 billion ECU proposed by the Commission. That gives the ministers the necessary playing room in the poker game with the Parliament, since it has the final say in approval of the program. EU parliamentarians like Linkohr are, however, not counting on the Parliament being able to push through its demands for another 600 million ECU. "But," as Linkohr says, "we won't consider anything less than 13.1 billion ECU."
