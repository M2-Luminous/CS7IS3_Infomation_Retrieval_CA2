Particularly in the last 15 years since China's reform and opening up, as educational reform unfolds gradually, all types of educational undertakings at different levels have developed rapidly. Primary education has become virtually universal in over 90 percent of the country's populated areas. Today, nine-year compulsory education is being implemented step by step in a well-planned way. China's vocational education has also developed rapidly in the past few years. Total enrollment in vocational schools at the senior middle school level has exceeded that at regular senior middle schools. The unitary nature of China's secondary educational structure has also undergone major changes. China's higher education has also developed at an accelerated pace. According to statistics, the number of post-graduate students reached 110,000 last year. The number of regular and special program students at regular colleges totaled more than 2.5 million, while the number of regular and special program students at adult schools of higher learning reached 1.9 million. Both numbers were the highest in history. A comprehensive higher education system incorporating essentially all kinds of disciplines at different levels has basically taken shape. China's legislative work has also made heartening progress. It has promulgated, one after another, a law of compulsory education, a law on teaching, and many other laws. In addition, it has also promulgated regulations and decrees related to policy implementation. Thus, China has gradually entered the path of managing education according to the law. China's education has truly brought forth noticeable achievements. However, it should also be recognized that China, a fairly poor and large country, faces numerous problems and difficulties on its way to making its education successful. The tasks are also enormous. Despite the many problems facing China's education, there is still a way to make it successful. Exactly as Premier Li Peng said in his report on government work, we must acquire a long-term perspective and a sense of urgency toward education and give strategic consideration to developing education on a priority basis. We must recognize the importance of education from the perspective of modernizing our country. Particularly, we must promote education in a concrete way. During the National People's Congress [NPC] and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] sessions, deputies and CPPCC members gave their very useful views and made good suggestions on reforming and developing China's education. In an interview with station reporter Wen Baowei, Zhang Tianbao, CPPCC member and vice minister of the State Education Commission, talked about major problems in China's education today. [Begin recording] [Zhang] I think one of the problems is that the pace of reform on China's education front cannot keep up with the general situation of China's reform to establish a socialist market economy. This is a fairly serious problem. The second problem concerns practical issues. There are three major issues here. One is the lack of investment in education. This is a fairly difficult problem to tackle. We hope to resolve it gradually. Teachers' pay and benefits will improve considerably in the wake of ongoing wage reform. However, their pay and benefits, especially the pay and benefits of primary and middle school teachers, cannot be expected to reach the standards set in the Teachers' Law before our economy develops. The third issue concerns teachers' housing, mainly urban teachers' housing. The situation of teachers' housing in rural areas is a little bit better. They do not need much investment from the state, as they have their own houses. In urban areas, although there has been great improvement in recent years, teachers' housing is still a major problem. [Wen] Specifically, what important tasks does the State Education Commission plan to accomplish in 1994? [Zhang] The State Education Commission's central task is to further implement China's Education Reform and Development Program and the Teachers' Law. It will focus on achieving two goals for all types of education at all levels: basically making nine-year compulsory education universal and basically eradicating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. These two goals will be at the heart of our work. As far as reform is concerned, the focus is on the structural reform of our higher education, including reform of the management structure, the enrollment system, the employment system for college graduates, the ideology for education, the contents of teaching, and the establishment of special fields of study. The main emphasis of our reform is to make education serve the needs of society under the conditions of a socialist market economy. [end recording] [Wen] (Chen Yiliang), NPC deputy and assistant principal of the Fuzhou First Middle School, said: [Begin recording] [(Chen)] The Teachers' Law was promulgated last year, and took effect on 1 January 1994. The broad masses of teachers place great hopes on the implementation of the law. The Fujian delegation was the first to bring forward a motion on a law for teaching. I was the one who made the motion at that time. Everyone hopes that the Teachers' Law can be truly implemented, that more discussions will be held on education during the current NPC session, and that the present government will be able to adopt some practical and effective measures, to speed up the pace of educational reform, to conscientiously increase input into education, to give full play to the role of teachers, to improve pay and work conditions for teachers, and to bring about a good social climate of showing respect for teachers and attaching importance to education. This is also a focal point of current problems existing in our education. [end recording] [Wen] As a socialist market economy develops in depth, China badly needs a large number of laborers to be engaged in operation and services in the forefront of production, in addition to various professional technicians. All these personnel should undergo strict vocational training to meet the qualifications of different trades and professions. What is the present situation of vocational education in China? Station correspondent (Zhang Xiangyuan) interviewed Comrade Wang Mingda, member of the CPPCC National Committee and vice minister of the State Education Commission on the issue. He said: [Begin recording] [Wang] After China implemented reform and opened its doors to the outside world, a very important aspect of China's educational reform was to reform secondary school education and to vigorously develop vocational and technical education. In 1980, the number of students enrolled by vocational senior middle schools accounted for only 11.49 percent of the total number of students enrolled by all senior middle schools; the ratio reached 57.95 percent in 1993. Thus, we have fulfilled the ratio of 1:1 between the number of students enrolled by vocational senior middle schools and the number of students enrolled by ordinary senior middle schools proposed by the CPC Central Committee in its resolution on reform of the education system adopted in 1985. [end recording] [Ma Lin] In fact, China conducted vocational education as early as 1917. Vocational education was conducted at the Zhonghua Jiaoyu She [China Vocational Education Society], initiated by such famous educators as Cai Yuanpei and Liang Qichao. In view of the fact that education was seriously divorced from social life at that time, they said one of the purposes of running the society was to provide job opportunities for the unemployed and to make the employed work in contentment. Today, the Zhonghua Jiaoyu She has expanded to a nationwide organization for vocational education. It has set up 50 schools offering vocational education. Among them are three vocational universities that boast more than 30,000 undergraduates in all. [Wen] Member Wang Mingda said the objective of China's development of vocational education at secondary schools is to make the number of students attending vocational schools account for approximately 60 percent of the total number of secondary school undergraduates by the end of the century. [Begin recording] [Wang] To achieve the objective, we must further increase the number of students and, above all, improve the quality of vocational education. [end recording] [Ma Lin] At last, Member Wang Mingda said: The comparatively conspicuous problems existing in current vocational education include finding the means to enhance the level of teaching and management, a shortage of funds, and a need to build more vocational education centers. It is necessary to bring vocational and technical education into line with a legal system through legislation. A law on vocational and technical education has been incorporated into the NPC Standing Committee's plan for legislation in the next five years. [Wen] Qu Qinyue, NPC deputy, president of the Nanjing University, and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, expressed his views on the guiding ideology for running a school at colleges and universities in the course of reform and opening up. He said: [Begin recording] [Qu] I think it is necessary for universities to grasp two links at the same time. They must attach equal importance to enhancing academic levels and, at the same time, making concrete and important contributions to national economic construction and social development. These two links apply to the guiding ideology for running a school. Now, I think, it seems that two tendencies exist in universities in the course of reform. One tendency attaches more importance to the academic level of universities to the neglect of making very good contributions to the nation's economic and social development. In particular, the universities have run their schools in a way that closes their doors, instead of opening their doors, to the public amid the implementation of reform in the past few years. Therefore, they took into consideration their academic level only and did not take into consideration social needs. After the implementation of reform, due to difficulties related to policies, confusion over education policy recently encouraged universities to move to the other side of the two links of running a school, namely, divorcing themselves from society. They attached undue importance to maintaining [words indistinct] to the neglect of enhancing the level of a university, which is the most important task. [end recording] [Ma Lin] Listeners and friends, accelerating the development of education in regions inhabited by minority nationalities has a direct bearing on the regions' economic development. Therefore, it is an even more urgent task. When (Qiang Erba Douji Ouzhou), member of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee and vice chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Education Commission, spoke of the relationship between economic development and education, he said: [Begin recording, (Qiang), in Tibetan fading into Ma Lin translation into Mandarin] Tibet is economically backward. Believing that development is sufficient as long as enough food is provided for the people, Tibet set the economy against education for a certain period of time in the past. The focus of our work shifted to the central task of economic construction after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. We must promote the development of science and technology before we can promote economic development. Education is the foundation. While endeavoring to promote economic development, we incorporated education into our plan. Tibet has enjoyed a very rapid development of education in recent years. Last year, the autonomous regional party committee and the autonomous regional government specially held the fourth education work conference, and drew up a magnificent plan. It aims at increasing the percentage of children of school age attending schools from the current 63 percent to over 80 percent by the year 2000. In addition, the work conference also mapped out two plans. They required that every county have a middle school and every township a primary school run by herdsmen. According to the plans, Tibet only has to base itself on areas inside its territory in its efforts to educate trained personnel; meanwhile, continued efforts will be made to successfully run classes in the hinterland for children of Tibetan nationality. At present, there are 11,000 plus Tibetan students studying in the hinterland. [end recording]
