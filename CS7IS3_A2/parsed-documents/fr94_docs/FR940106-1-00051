FR940106-1-00051 FR940106-1-00011 The State Board's adoption of the 1978 Delta Plan, and of the revised Bay/Delta Plan in 1991, were intended to meet the State's obligations to establish water quality standards under the CWA. Pursuant to its mandate under section 303(c)(3) of the Act, on September 3, 1991, EPA disapproved several of the criteria contained in the State Board's plan. For the reasons outlined herein and in EPA's letter of September 3, 1991, the Administrator finds that the water quality criteria adopted by the State fail to protect the designated uses and the criteria proposed below would meet the requirements of the Act. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 303(c)(3) and 303(c)(4) of the Act, the Administrator is proposing the following water quality criteria applicable to California waters. C. Proposed Criteria EPA is proposing three different sets of water quality criteria: Salinity criteria protecting estuarine habitat in the Suisun Bay area, salmon smolt survival indices protecting salmon migration, and an electrical conductivity criterion protecting striped bass spawning on the lower San Joaquin River. Each set of criteria is intended to protect a particular designated use or set of uses in the Bay/Delta estuary. As discussed above, these designated uses were originally established by the regional boards in the individual basin plans and by the State Board in its 1978 Delta Plan, and were reaffirmed and restated in the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan. The discussion below describes each set of proposed criteria in detail and outlines the scientific basis for the proposals. In developing these proposed criteria, EPA has considered the scientific evidence and testimony presented during the State Board's 1992 hearing process, as well as scientific information from other sources. In particular, EPA has relied upon the recommendations of the USFWS, of Dr. Peter Moyle, Professor in the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries Biology at the University of California at Davis and author of more than 100 articles and books on the ecology of the inland fishes of California, and of a distinguished panel of scientists who participated in a series of workshops sponsored by the San Francisco Estuary Project (SFEP). EPA's proposed criteria are consistent with the Interagency Statement of Principles dated June 15, 1992 and submitted to the State Board by EPA, USFWS, and NMFS during the Board's 1992 hearings. This Interagency Statement recommended that the State Board develop a comprehensive habitat protection approach to restore and maintain the ecological health of the estuary, and provided a framework for both interim and long-term standards. The Interagency Statement also emphasized that there is a consensus among the three federal agencies that the existing scientific information is sufficient to set criteria to protect the designated uses of the estuary. The criteria proposed below are similar to those EPA has outlined in letters and statements to State and federal agencies, including in the following: its September 3, 1991 disapproval letter to the State Board; its June 11, 1992 policy statement and its August 24, 1992 closing statement submitted to the State Board's 1992 hearings; and its October 29, 1992 letter to USFWS and NMFS. Throughout this process, EPA has carefully coordinated its actions and proposals with other State and Federal environmental agencies to achieve a consensus on the water quality criteria necessary to protect the estuary. 1. Estuarine Habitat Criteria a. Designated Uses and EPA's Disapproval The State's 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included ``Estuarine Habitat'' as a designated use for the Bay/Delta estuary. As described more fully in the Water Quality Control Plan, San Francisco Bay Basin [2], December 1986, at II&hyph;4, this Estuarine Habitat designated use is intended to provide ``an essential and unique habitat that serves to acclimate anadromous fishes (salmon, striped bass) migrating into fresh or marine conditions. This habitat also provides for the propagation and sustenance of a variety of fish and shellfish, numerous waterfowl and shore birds, and marine mammals.'' Related fish and wildlife uses of the Bay/Delta estuary designated by the State Board include Ocean Commercial and Sport Fishing, Preservation of Rare and Endangered Species, Shellfish Harvesting, Fish Migration, and Wildlife Habitat. To protect these designated uses, the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan included dissolved oxygen and temperature criteria to protect chinook salmon, outflow and salinity criteria to protect striped bass, and salinity criteria to protect the managed (non-tidal) areas of Suisun Marsh. Unfortunately, the specific criteria adopted by the State Board clearly do not protect the integrity of the Estuarine Habitat designated use. Although EPA had already many times noted the inadequacies of the 1978 Delta Plan, the 1991 Bay/Delta Plan made only minor adjustments to criteria protecting striped bass, salmon, and the managed portions of the Suisun Marsh, and provided no criteria specifically addressing the Estuarine Habitat designated use. The shortcomings of the State Board's criteria are reflected by the continued deterioration of the estuary's resources. The SBI, used as a measure of the health of the 1978 Delta Plan's indicator species, has never attained its targeted value of 79, and instead has plummeted to unprecedented low values. Recent testimony by the California DFG indicates that virtually all of the estuary's major fish species are in clear decline (CDFG 1992b, WRINT&hyph;DFG&hyph;8). As noted above in the recitation of the history of the Bay/Delta, many species relying on the estuarine habitat are listed or are being considered for listing under the ESA. One recent report suggests that at least five of the estuary's fish species (longfin smelt, spring-run Chinook salmon, Sacramento splittail, green sturgeon, and Red Hills roach) qualify for immediate listing under the ESA (Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992), in addition to the already listed winter-run Chinook salmon and Delta smelt.
