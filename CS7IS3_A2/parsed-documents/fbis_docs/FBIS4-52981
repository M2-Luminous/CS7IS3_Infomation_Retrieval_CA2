A by-lined article of the paper says: It is a principled requirement of international law and usage that overseas citizens of a sovereign state lead a free life, enjoying legal protection and treatment as foreigners under the protection of their motherland, wherever they may reside. The Japanese authorities must provide the Koreans in Japan with all lawful rights and treatment as foreigners and fully ensure their human rights in accordance with the publicly accepted principles of international law and usage. The Japanese authorities are also under historical and moral obligations to fully ensure the activities of Chongnyon and the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan. They must properly repent of and apologize for the crimes committed by Japanese imperialism against history and they must know that they are under the heavy obligation to ensure the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan in order to atone for the crimes. The Japanese authorities must provide them with all rights including the right to learn, work and lead a dignified life and the freedom of political activity, speech, the press, association, assembly and demonstration in Japan. The Japanese authorities must fully guarantee the human rights of Koreans in Japan to respect at least the basic spirit of the world declaration on human rights and the international statutes of human rights they signed and to abide by the "principle of equality between natives and foreigners" to which they are committed. We who regard the dignity of the country and the nation as our life and soul will sternly counter any persecution and repression of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, considering them to be an infringement on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. The Japanese authorities must immediately stop and apologize for their hostile policy toward the DPRK and the anti-Chongnyon campaign, mindful of grave consequences arising from their reckless action, and must take responsible measures lest repression of Chongnyon and violations of human rights of Koreans in Japan should recur.
