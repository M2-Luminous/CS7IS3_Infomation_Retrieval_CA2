FR940919-2-00141 FR940919-2-00059 3. The Notes, dated January 10, 1974, are twenty-five year promissory notes with interest accruing at a rate of 8-7/8 percent per annum. The Notes are secured by a first deed of trust on the Shopping Center which was valued at $2,200,000 as of March 1, 1994. The terms of the Notes provide that the Employer has the right to prepay the entire indebtedness in full with a prepayment premium required only if the prepayment of the Notes is made in years eleven through twenty of the twenty-five year term. The Employer represents that, as of February 1, 1994, the Notes were twenty-one years old and, therefore, can be purchased by the Employer, without paying a premium, for their outstanding principal balances. As of March 29, 1994, the outstanding principal balance of the Indianapolis Note was $152,238 and the outstanding principal balance of the Columbus Note was $323,515. Prior to the Purchase, the Employer proposes to make a $63,966 payment towards the Indianapolis Note, thereby reducing its outstanding principal balance to $88,272 and the total outstanding principal balances of the Notes to $411,787. Mrs. and Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester (the Applicants) propose to have the Employer, acting as agent for the Accounts, purchase the Interests for the Accounts for their outstanding principal balances on the date of the Purchase provided that the outstanding principal balances of the Notes are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests. The Accounts will purchase the Interests based upon the proportion of their respective accounts relative to the total assets in the Plan. Accordingly, the Accounts will purchase the Notes in the following proportions: ␣ 1Account 1Indianapolis note 2(percent) 1Columbia note 2(percent) Mrs. Chapman 62.20 62.20 Mr. Chapman 30.49 30.49 Mrs. Koester 7.31 7.31 n,s Total 100 100 Accordingly, the Applicants request an administrative exemption from the Department to permit the Purchase under the terms and conditions described herein. 4. The Employer obtained an appraisal of the Interests dated March 29, 1994 from John R. Garvin, MAI-GRE of Continental Appraisal Company of Columbus, Ohio. Mr. Garvin represents that both he and Continental Appraisal are independent of and unrelated to the Applicants and the Employer, although he has provided some consulting services for Mr. Chapman. Mr. Garvin states that, on average in the past five years, he has derived less than one percent of his annual income from the Employer and Mr. Chapman. Mr. Garvin placed the fair market value of the Notes at $419,948. Such amount takes into consideration the $63,966 payment that will be made on the Indianapolis Note by the Employer. In assigning fair market values to the Interests based upon the value of the Notes, Mr. Garvin discounted the two minority interests (Mr. Chapman and Mrs. Koester's interests) by five percent to reflect their lack of liquidity. Mr. Garvin represents that because the majority interest (Mrs. Chapman's interest) could liquidate the investment at any time without the consent of the minority interests, there is no basis for any such discount with respect to the majority interest. The fair market values of the Interests, as of March 29, 1994, are as follows: ␣ 1␣ 1FMV of interest 1FMV after discount 1Percent 1Amount of outstanding balance Mrs. Chapman $261,197 $261,197 62.20% $256,132 Mr. Chapman 128,045 121,643 30.49 125,553 Mrs. Koester 30,706 29,171 7.31 30,102 n,s Totals 419,948 412,011 100.00 411,787 Accordingly, because the outstanding balance of the Notes are less than the fair market values of the Interests, the Accounts will purchase the Interests for their pro rata share of the outstanding balance. 5. The Applicants represent that the Purchase is in the best interests of the participants because it offers the Accounts the opportunity to purchase the Interests at less than their fair market values. Also, the Purchase will allow the Accounts to enhance their current rate of return without additional risk. The Applicants represent that the Purchase will not involve more than twenty-five percent of the assets in each of the Accounts. The Accounts are not required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Purchase. 6. In summary, it is represented that the proposed transaction will satisfy the statutory criteria for an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act because: (a) the terms of the Purchase will be at least as favorable to the Accounts as those obtainable in an arm's-length transaction with an unrelated party; (b) the Purchase price will be equal to the outstanding principal balances of the Notes on the day of the Purchase; (c) the Purchase will occur only if such outstanding principal balances are not greater than the aggregate fair market values of the Interests on the day of the Purchase as determined by a qualified, independent appraiser; (d) the Purchase will not involve more than twenty-five percent of the assets in each of the Accounts; and (e) the Accounts will not be required to pay any fees, commissions or expenses in connection with the Purchase. Notice to Interested Persons Because the only Plan assets involved in the proposed transaction are those in Mrs. Chapman, Mr. Chapman & Mrs. Koester's Accounts and they are the only participants affected by the proposed transaction, it has been determined that there is no need to distribute the notice of proposed exemption to interested persons. Comments and requests for a hearing are due thirty days after the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register.
