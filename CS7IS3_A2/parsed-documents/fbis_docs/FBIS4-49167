New opportunities and new challenges keep presenting themselves one after another. Under these circumstances, it behooves both China and the United States to seize the opportune moment by pushing vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and science and technology. Introducing China's current state of reform, opening up to the outside world, and economic development, Zou Jiahua said: Last year saw China's reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization drive move forward rapidly. The gross domestic product of the year was up 13.4 percent over the previous year in comparable prices, and it was the highest annual increase since 1985. The rapid growth of China's economy has driven reform and opening up to accelerate and overseas investment in China to soar. In 1992, overseas investment actually used increased 160 percent and the figure in 1993 was up 91.5 percent over 1992. He said: In developing its economy, China should rely on its own strength as well as on international cooperation. Opening up to the outside world has long become China's basic policy. Henceforth, China will keep unswervingly to the policy of opening up to the outside world. He quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying: China's opening up policy will not change this century, nor in the first or second 50 years of the next century. It is hard for anyone to attempt a change. China's door is sure to open up even wider and we will do a better job. Zou Jiahua said: An all-directional pattern of openness linking the coast with the hinterland across China is taking shape. "We are ready to develop economic and technological cooperation and exchanges with all friendly countries and people from all walks of life on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." He said: Cooperation can take many forms. We welcome people of insight to develop trade with China, but hope to see more of them come to China to invest and set up their own factories, to enter into partnership with Chinese enterprises or to transfer technology, and to jointly explore China's market. He expressed the hope that foreign investment would conform to the requirements of China's general direction for economic development, adding that China welcomes investors to invest in the fields of energy, transportation, telecommunications, agriculture, and water conservancy for now and in the years to come. Zou Jiahua pointed out: An outstanding feature of the changed international situation is that all countries have given their top priority to economic development. The Asia-Pacific region, by maintaining the best growth records for years running, has caught attention in the world. At the same time, international economic competition, as seen in fierce rivalry for market shares, has become increasingly heated. New opportunities and new challenges are everywhere. Under such circumstances, China and the United States should seize the opportune moment by vigorously pushing for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and science and technology. This is not only in the fundamental interest of the peoples of the two countries, but will help promote peace, stability, prosperity, and progress in the world. He said: In recent years, Sino-U.S. relations have encountered many difficulties. However, through the cooperation and efforts of business circles of the two countries, the bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic and technological cooperation have maintained a powerful developing trend. In 1993, Sino-U.S. trade volume reached $27.65 billion, increasing more than 10 times over 1979, when the two countries established diplomatic relations, with China's imports from the United States up 20.1 percent over the previous year. The United States has continuously maintained its place as China's third largest trade partner. In terms of investment volume, the United States still leads other foreign countries. By the end of last year, the cumulative value of U.S. investment in China had totalled $11 billion, and the number of U.S. funded projects surpassed 8,000. Most of those investment items have achieved success and produced good economic benefits. Facts have shown that it is entirely possible for countries of different social systems and ideologies to actively develop economic and technological cooperation to the benefit of both sides. Zou Jiahua pointed out: There are broad prospects for further developing economic and trade relations between China and the United States, and there is great potential in bilateral trade. Every year China imports from the United States large quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizers, cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment, and equipment for the chemical and petroleum industries. He said: With the continuous development of the economy, the demand of China's domestic market will expand further. It is expected that from now to 2000, China will import $1 trillion worth of commodities. However, competition among various countries in the Chinese market is very intense. Advanced technology and equipment and fine service alone are far from enough. They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable, and friendly environment for cooperation in the economic and trade field. He emphatically pointed out: The annual dispute over the MFN status indeed seriously obstructs [yan zhong gan rao 0917 6850 1626 2371] the development of economic and trade relations between the two countries. The mutual granting of MFN status is the foundation for developing economic and trade relations between the two countries. If this is undermined, it will do harm to the economies and trade of the two countries and to the interests of their consumers. The governments of the two countries have the responsibility to encourage and support business people of the two countries to conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable conditions for expanding economic cooperation and trade between the two countries. Vice Premier Zou Jiahua's speech was enthusiastically welcomed by some 100 people attending the meeting. On 2 May, Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the national committee of the United States-China Business Council, met with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and hosted a reception party for his Chinese guest.
