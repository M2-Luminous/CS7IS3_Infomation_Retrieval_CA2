They caused 1.3 billion karbovantsi [K] of damage. Almost all of these discharges affected water reservoirs. The greatest number of such accidents occurred in the following oblasts: 39 in Poltava Oblast, 27 in Ternopil Oblast, 22 in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, 18 in Kirovohrad Oblast, and 17 in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. One of every nine of the inspected facilities (virtually all those in Lvov Oblast) exceeded the norms for discharging contaminated waste. Reporting these figures, the Ministry of Statistics points out that, last year, inspectors prevented more than 6 million cubic meters of liquid waste from being discharged into natural water reservoirs and 13,000 tonnes of dry harmful waste from being released into the atmosphere. Fines totalling K152 million were imposed for violations of the nature conservation laws and more than 21,000 officials were called to account.
