Arnoldo Anibal Nunez, Catamarca Association of State Workers (ATE) secretary general, confirmed today that public servants are implementing a "business slowdown" that involves the provincial public administration. Nunez reported that the provincial government "has still not paid May wages to public servants in the provincial capital, or April wages to municipal workers in the interior of the province." The ATE secretary general also reported that the government has still not paid the one-time 130 peso school allowance that is usually paid at the beginning of the academic year. Yesterday, Catamarca court employees launched a struggle program involving partial strikes, while municipal employees in the city of Catamarca will begin a "business slowdown" today. Nunez reported that the state workers will carry out a demonstration on 17 June outside the government house. The demonstration has been called by the Argentine Workers Congress (CTA). The teachers, grouped under the Association of Education Workers, which is a CTERA [Confederation of Education Workers of the Argentine Republic] associate, will hold a 24-hour strike tomorrow to demand payment of their June wages. In Salta, public servants will hold a strike and a demonstration tomorrow outside the provincial Congress building to demand a 500 peso minimum wage. Miguel Quiroga, Salta ATE social action secretary, pointed out that the protest "will be held to demand the timely payment of salaries, as health workers and retirees have still not collected theirs." Quiroga reported that the demonstration will be held to protest the decision to transfer the pension fund to the federal government, and to demand education and public health budget increases. In Chaco, the trade unions of state workers will hold a general strike today to reject the provincial government's goal of transferring the pension fund to the federal government. The pressure measure will be accompanied by a demonstration outside the provincial Congress building, where the Chamber of Deputies will discuss a bill on the transfer of the Provincial Social Security Institute.
