It said that if North Korea does not meet the deadline, IAEA director general Hans Blix will call for another meeting of the agency's Council of Governors to press the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Pyongyang. The sources added that the IAEA would abstain from calling the deadline an ultimatum so as not to impede on ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea. "A large number of board members... asked the director general immediately to convene a board meeting in the absence of satisfactory developments in connection with the inspection," said board chairman Ronald Walker. The members had asked that the meeting be called "notably if a firm, early date for the start of the inspection had not been settled by the end of this month," he added. Western diplomatic sources said China in particular had been opposed to setting a specific deadline. Earlier Wednesday, the IAEA Council of Governors meeting here was told by the Pyongyang delegation that North Korea has informed the United States it would be ready to allow inspection of its nuclear sites as of March 1, but on four conditions. The main condition is a public announcement of the cancellation of the annual joint U.S.-South Korean manoeuvres code-named "Team Spirit," Ho Jin Yun, the advisor to the North Korean Embassy in Vienna, announced. He did not specify what the other conditions were, but implied that they were still under discussion in New York. A Western diplomatic source said Pyongyang's proposal "changed nothing" with regard to the IAEA's talks here. The IAEA and North Korea agreed last week on ways of opening up seven nuclear sites to inspection under the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Ho accused Blix Wednesday of orchestrating a "political plot" aimed at casting fresh doubt on Pyongyang's nuclear activities. In a speech to the Council he denounced the IAEA's demand to carry out special inspections as "tantamount to an attempt to drive the Democratic People's Republic of Korea out of the NPT." The IAEA is pressing to carry out inspection of two sites at Yongbyon, where it suspects Pyongyang is stockpiling liquid and solid nuclear waste which could come from a military nuclear programme. In his opening report on Monday, Blix stressed that unless the IAEA were allowed to visit other sites and have access to extra information, it would not be able to verify whether Pyongyang's initial declaration on its nuclear programme was full and accurate. Walker said after Wednesday's meeting that the board "expressed its continuing deep concern at the seriousness of the situation and its support for a negotiated, peaceful solution of the nuclear and other security issues of the Korean peninsula."
