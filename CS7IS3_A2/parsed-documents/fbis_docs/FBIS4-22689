The titanic work for unifying national forces, the constantly failing attempts to keep all of the largely different leaders in the mainstream of the overall idea, the immense mass of believers and people who cannot believe should have been crowned with a triumph. Prokhanov should have been able to see this overflowing hall, to hear the approving voices, to rub elbows and backs with those advisers who for a long time supported him just as he supported them in his newspaper. There were almost no analysts in the hall. They were mainly people who carry on their shoulders the pain and offense to Rus, its traditions and catastrophes. They live in that same "tomorrow" at which the newspaper is aimed, believing in that "tomorrow" and doing everything within their power for it. Attending meetings, burning bonfires in front of the White House, disseminating the newspaper, they give perhaps their last rubles for the holy Russian cause. This is a spectator hall. The people are ready at the will of the leaders to obey the order, to go, to flee, to shout, or to moan. The people, without whom there are no leaders, on whom the leaders rely, without whom the leaders cannot live. The foremost part of our nation. The leaders are on the stage. Anpilov, Konstantinov, Astafyev, Terekhov, Baburin, Pavlov, Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov. On the stage are Ilyukhin, Dugin, Penkov, Bondarenko, Chikin, Filatov. The last six are not leaders themselves. But they are people without whose help and support many of the leaders could not get by. They are people whose advice and actions are necessary, people who are closest, who could independently decide issues within the framework of their authority. Very important leaders of the second level. All of them spoke. The main theme of the speeches was not to allow ourselves to be provoked to armed uprisings which are called "civil war." This was discussed by Dugin on the basis of materials from the Spanish press and Ilyukhin after the meeting of Vybros on 2 March. A peaceful scenario for development is possibly less preferable to the president and his team, but all of his variants have also been played through. And not in our favor. At first Filatov was struck and then he calmed down. He was struck by the fact that the 220,000 criminals to whom the president gave amnesty make up 10 divisions of his supporters, but he was calmed down by the assurance that a victory would require only one division and only because it would be led by the General Staff. It is very important to have the support of the creative intelligentsia in art, which is provided by the Russian part of it. This was in the speech by Penkov, an excellent actor and human being. Terekhov just got out of Lefortovo. He looks tired but ready for more battle. Anpilov, Konstantinov, and Baburin. What is the behavior this year of the leaders of 1992, when their phrases and slogans were valued? Zhirinovskiy is sure of himself. Today is not only a holiday for the newspaper, but also a triumph for the opposition who opened the doors to Lefortovo and Sailors' Rest. He in no way diminishes his role in the Duma. He is the only one who supported the State Committee for the State of Emergency. He is the only candidate for president. In general he is a unique individual. He is not a Russian Hitler--"why pin that label on me?" Zhirinovskiy is a candid human being; he has no secrets. He wants to be first, and he tries. But his openness makes him extremely vulnerable. Mr. Astafyev took advantage of this, teasing Zhirinovskiy a little. Astafyev called for unity. This is not new. A unified front in the Duma, a single president for all to back in the elections. The only thing he did not do was the main thing in such a situation, he did not say: "We have before us the only person I believe in" and give his name. "I give him my vote and the vote of my party. Lead us!" He also failed to say something else: "I will take full responsibility for the future of Russia. I know not only WHAT, but also HOW to do this for all of us. Entrust your fate to me." Nobody said that. The most stirring speech was Nikolay Pavlov's. "We cannot believe the government. They are deceiving us again! They have already outfitted us with our former clothing of a red and brown color! We are again being subjected to the chaos of unemployment and internecine war! We need our own Russian national party!" A person who threw himself under the bullets and APC's. Personally, he is desperately brave. He walks in the vanguard, but he is not a leader. And, finally, Zyuganov. His stated dream is a coalition government. I bought two brochures containing his speeches and articles on the way out. "Peace--to the people, the land--to the peasants, the factories--to the workers"--but for today's conditions. If there is a need we will have to do a detailed critical survey of everything published by Mr. Zyuganov, but what he said on 5 March, in my view, does not answer the question of how to arrive at victory. They are all patriots. They are all Russians. And the same laws of psychology apply to all of them. The first who is prepared to give himself for the good of Russia must cease being an egoist. He must take a risk, giving himself and his party to another leader, admit that he is not the only one with correct ideas. He must agree to be the second or third. But how? Petr turned Russia over to the Romanovs. He went to learn. Nikolay II--to Stolypin. Rozenfeld and Apfelbaum--to Dzhugashvili. There are precedents, and not all unsuccessful ones. If there is no one to whom you can be subordinate and you cannot take the burden on yourself--admit it! That you are weak, that you cannot do it, leave.... The Siberian Petr Romanov in the issue of ZAVTRA printed on the night of 5 March did not say HOW either. But he indicated the bottom line of answers to the question WHAT. I would give exactly the same answer. HOW--the PEOPLE. How are they to act? How much are they to sleep, how much are they to earn, if they are responsible--for what? Incentives. Which? Measures of encouragement and coercion. Who must work and under what conditions? Who must not impede the work and what should be done with them? Who should be taught what? I do not have a party. I give myself and everything I am able to do to Petr Romanov. I believe in him and am prepared to share with him both the work and the responsibility for it.
