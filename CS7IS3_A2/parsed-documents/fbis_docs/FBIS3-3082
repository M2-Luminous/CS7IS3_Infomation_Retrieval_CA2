"To reach this goal, Taiwan should allow mainland Chinese to receive professional training here," said CEPD Vice Chairman Hsueh Chi. Hsueh quoted a survey by the Japanese branch of the US-based consulting firm McKinsey & Co. as finding that many foreign companies have faced language barriers and other cultural problems while developing mainland markets. As Taiwan and Mainland China share a similar cultural background and use same language, hsueh said foreign companies can use Taiwan as bridgehead for mainland investment. "Foreign enterprises can employ Taiwan market research experts and managers to help collect business information and handle investment affairs on the mainland," Hsueh noted. They can also send their mainland employees to their Taiwan headquarters for professional training, he added. Mainland residents are still not allowed to receive training in Taiwan. Hsueh said the government should consider lifting the ban as soon as possible in order to improve Taiwan's prospects of becoming an Asia-Pacific regional operations center. "Continued growth in economic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait is important to our bid to lure more foreign enterprises to set up regional operation bases on the island," he stressed.
