They pointed to the sensitive nature of the current situation and the importance of the Ministry of Culture and Islamic guidance's responsibilities. They considered that Mr. Mirsalim was qualified for the post. Next, Mr. Mostafa Mirsalim, minister of culture and Islamic guidance, explained the main points of his programs aimed at achieving the cultural objectives of the revolution. He described the extensive dimensions of the western cultural onslaught against Islamic culture. He said: In confronting such an onslaught, we should safeguard our indigenous culture and Islamic values with all our being. He emphasized: The most important factor in spiritual growth is to raise the cultural level of the public and this is a priority and an essential part of our work. All programs should be formulated and supplied within the framework of Islamic values. The minister of culture and Islamic guidance said that the lack of clear opinions based on religious jurisprudence that could resolve certain matters concerning the art world, the unequal distribution of art facilities in the country, and also the question of training and retraining of specialized and effective managers for the cultural and art sectors of the country, are among existing bottlenecks. He hoped that through the efforts of relevant officials, these bottlenecks will be removed as soon as possible.
