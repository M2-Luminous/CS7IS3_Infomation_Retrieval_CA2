Before reaching this stage, our people, led by our party, achieved its national awakening and, to attain freedom, it furthered its national liberation war on a fully legal basis at the cost of enormous suffering and sacrifice in northern Kurdistan. The Turkish state's approach has always been one of denial [of Kurdish existence] and justification of this denial by disregarding the historical facts. Any stance against this approach by the Turkish Republic has been rather brutally and cruelly suppressed. Our people's demand for freedom has been choked in blood. Despite the world's close interest in the Kurdish problem, the position of certain European states has made solving it difficult rather than easy. The support given has been such as to encourage the Turkish Republic in its massacres in this unjust war against our people. In addition, these states, motivated by their economic and political interests and an incomprehensible mentality, have branded our party, which has the support of millions and is the real partner in a solution, a "terrorist" movement. Again, the unfounded statements made in a spirit of antagonism against our struggle to the effect that "the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] does not favor a solution," or that "the PKK has no policy other than the establishment of a separate state," are unfounded allegations. During the press conferences held before the eyes of the world especially during the cease-fire period, I tried to explain that we are not averse to a solution and that it is the Turkish Republic that rejects the peace proposals. Such allegations are being constantly and intentionally dwelled upon. In view of this and on the occasion of the conference I find it useful to very clearly reiterate our position: 1. We will remain open to every proposal for a solution, and to the initiatives that might be taken by foreign countries or international organizations on this issue. 2. I want to state with the upmost clarity that we have absolutely no intention of dividing Turkey and that propaganda to this effect does not reflect our real position. 3. I want to state that we will be a participant in a process that might be initiated with the Turkish state on the basis of talks and dialogue within democracy to give expression to our people's legitimate demands and achieve results on this issue. From the very start, we have not opposed or been averse to concrete proposals for a solution. We are prepared to discuss all the alternatives, including the establishment of a federation. 4. We will not avoid or obstruct the establishment of a mutual cease-fire to be followed by talks on a solution under international supervision. 5. Most importantly, I pledge to accept the decisions on a solution that you might make at the conference. I am also announcing that we will pave the way for the total termination of the armed struggle if the ground is prepared for a political solution and free political activity. It is obvious that ours is not a position that seeks solution only in war. Besides, the war is not of our own choosing. It is the Turkish Government that has forced us into this and reduced us to defending our national existence by such methods, and which behaves with intransigence and cruelty to terrorize our people, thinking that it could obtain results only by waging special warfare. With this, I wish your endeavors to be productive and efficacious. I express my conviction that you will reach important decisions for a solution, and wholeheartedly salute the conference. Wishing you success, Abdullah Ocalan, general secretary of PKK."
