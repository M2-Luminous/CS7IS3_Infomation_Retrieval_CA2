According to information received by the KOMMERSANT editorial staff, the Ministry of Economics has submitted, simulatneously to the government and to the judgment of business circles, "On the Concept of State Participation in the Investment Process Through the Use of Stock Market Instruments," This, of course, is only the first step, but that's why it's important. Let's Congratulate Ourselves: The First Pancake is Being Baked Employees of the Central Checking Investment Fund participated with the specialists of the Ministry of Economics in developing the concept, so it seemed natural to make the All-Russian Conference of Checking Investment Funds the site for the document's debut. This was held from 28 March through 1 April in Izhevsk. ChIFs [checking investment funds] approved the basic provisions of the concept, which is natural, as we will soon show. The heart of the concept is a quite complicated mechanism for "attracting the capital of private investors for achieving goals stipulated by state programs" through the concept of state guarantees of investment activity. We will try to briefly -- and consequently in an oversimplified way -- to describe the main points of this mechanism. The state, guided by its priorities, decides to invest in a certain project. It accomplishes this as a purchase from the recipient of the investment of a block of his stock (at face value). The recipient is obligated to subsequently redeem the shares at a price indexed to the dollar (a typical "repo" operation takes place), and also gives the state bills of exchange for yearly payments for interest for credit. For each block of securities redeemed in this manner, the state establishes a trust with a government agency. This agent -- here is the central point of the concept -- "accepts the indicated securities to its balance in exchange for its own obligations which ensure the attraction of additional investment of private investors and the full repayment of funds to the state, as well as a rate of profit equal to the prime rate during the established time period." These government agents (the authors of the concept call them "General Investment Funds" or GRIFs [griffin] -- smells of Freud, doesn't it?) may be of two types. First, a GRIF can be a specially created "state guarantee fund." Then the securities it issues would have the status of state securities and represent, according to the authors' notion, an "absolute guarantee" for private investors attracted to participation in the given projects. These are the GRIFs which would have to attract the population's capital, private pension funds, and so on, "minimizing their risk in long-term investment." Second, a GRIF can be a non-state investment structure. In this case it is delegated "the right to issue state guarantees in the distribution of securities to private investors". For example it could issue bonds to redeem these securities at a certain fixed rate after a certain time period -- but not before the given investment project is completed. "You would never understand what I will get out of this" The scheme, to be sure, works out beautifully. Practically nothing is required from the agent of the government, the GRIF. Remember: it "ensures. . .the full repayment of funds to the state, as well as a rate of return equal to the prime rate (! - KOMMERSANT) in the established time period." And it achieves these results entirely from the profits from investments, for, it is assumed, other opportunities for using the money will be closed to it according to the agreement with the state. There are, it turns out, "wonderful growth areas" in our economy, where investments pay for themselves in less than six months (based on the current annual rate for centralized credits of 210 percent)! What remains incomprehensible is: if the Ministry of Economics specialists concede the presence of such "growth areas" in the economy, then why not just extend credit to them directly -- by using the capital of the Central Bank at a refinancing rate with payoff in the aforementioned "established time periods"? KOMMERSANT's experts (possibly due to their naivete) supposed that the government's Credit Commission, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Economics should have been searching for just such ways of financing through centrally allocated resources. A second unclear point is: why did the document's drafters so blindly believe the credit allocated by the scheme would go to investments, and not to the "idling" which they hate so much? There are so many ways to convert investment money into working capital that it is somehow indecent for the authors of this document to pretend that they are not familiar with at least one. And finally the third unclear point: why is it necessary to create GRIFs to attract the population's funds to the investment process, inventing two types of state agencies? If you don't want to finance investment projects from Central Bank capital, there is still a way out. Why not, for example, raise the rate on deposits to the Russian Federation Savings Bank to the refinancing rate and attract the population's money this way? After all, the "growth areas" will guarantee everything "up to par" and "on schedule." And the question of guarantees is also solved -- deposits in the Savings Bank are guaranteed by the state. There are also other types of profitable and guaranteed assets (GKOs [short-term bonds], gold certificates, "October" and "April" series treasury notes) which the state can issue and put the money into investment projects. In short, KOMMERSANT's experts get the feeling that the proposed scheme does not promise any investment success for either the state or private investors, except for that which could be achieved by quite traditional methods. On failure and this attempt to kill two birds Expressing the same conclusion somewhat differently, the concept is inordinately complicated. It has, to use the term of the medieval philosopher, too many superfluous essences, which is bad for two obvious reasons. One, such an intricate design, requiring the creation of a whole cohort of new institutions from materials on hand, will not work in principle -- or, at best, will take a long time to start to work. Two, if the state agencies put all their strength into this scheme, then there will be no strength left for the more natural (and that means more promising) methods -- as we know, there isn't all that much strength. The good deed of government encouragement of private investment will be left undone. The reason behind the extreme intricacy of the concept seems perfectly obvious to KOMMERSANT experts. The trouble is that the authors were trying to kill two birds with one stone: provide joint state-private financing of priority projects, and save hundreds of ChIFs from impending oblivion, hiring them in the role of GRIFs. Actually, the authors (remember that among them are representatives of the ChIFs) don't hide the "dual use" in the concept. That's just the way they write: "At present the checking investment funds, realizing the difficulties associated with the coming stock market crisis, and the real possibility of total bankruptcy, are completely ready for transformation into investment companies, investment banks, branches and departments of investment banks" -- and so on, and so on. "Such a trend in their development should be supported," but for this reason: "create, based on them, an essential infrastructure of agents of the RF government, who will fulfill the functions listed above." This train of thought is entirely understandable. Up to now, the ChIFs were engaged in a rather unnatural business -- they accumulated certain securities which were artificially invented, not engendered by economic reality, and exchanged them for not very natural shares of stock in enterprises which were to one degree or another doing poorly. Now, when this business has ended with the conclusion of the voucher era, the majority of these economic homunculi, not hoping to survive in a real economy, are hurriedly trying to find another just as unnatural business. But if the ChIFs think the role of government agents in the proposed scheme is just the role which would allow them to survive, then it is hard to agree with them. Reread the list of a GRIFs duties in previous administrations, and you will see that a firm capable of surviving in such work does not need the title of government agent. But actually the ChIFs would like more: they would like a part of the non-liquid shares of privatized enterprises which they have already accumulated to be at least partially exchanged for state securities within the framework of this scheme. This, of course, is pure insanity; we simply don't feel like commenting on such a plan of partial renationalization of the most hopeless of the enterprises which have just been privatized. Bad is the block of wood that doesn't want to be Pinnochio But there is, there is in the document a kernal of truth. If the ministry specialists will rid themselves of their attraction to their entrepreneur partners, who love themselves in business more than the state interests in them (and thank God!), and will chop off superfluous essences, then it is possible to cultivate this kernal. Here is how this agrotechnical operation looks to KOMMERSANT's experts. First of all, about the guarantees to private investors, whose money will be used to finance the projects. Everything that is written in the document in this regard is too complicated. In reality the matter is much simpler. Shares in a project will be bought if they are safe and profitable -- this is obvious. Here no state guarantees are needed. On the contrary, the state has already compromised itself as a reliable borrower and is just now beginning to win a decent reputation (in particular, in the GKO market). For this reason a far more impressive recommendation for potential stockholders in a project is the participation of the private investor who invests his own money in it. From this comes the first conclusion. In each project with shared investment the already invested private capital should be clearly visible, with a minimum of commercial secrets and a maximum of openess. Only this condition will create for potential stockholders realistic prerequisites for return on their money. That's the logic of investing. The state only secondarily attracts private money. It primarily seeks projects on which money has already been spent, evaluates them according to their merit, and offers to help with money -- on terms advantageous to the private investor. It's not bad if foreign capital participates in the project, or if the possibility is at least seriously discussed. In the Soviet mind, the capitalist will not miss out on a profit; an analysis of the results of check auctions confirms this recommendation. Second conclusion. In order to make shares lucrative and attractive to investors, whose funds are needed by the project in addition to the state and private capital already invested, one has to work to improve these shares. It is obvious to everyone, however, that until the project starts to yield a profit, there is no reason to count on dividends. Nevertheless the earning potential of the securities can be ensured if the securities are issued as growth stock. If a dividend is even paid on growth stock, it is purely symbolic; the profit comes as a result of the increase in price of the security. The point is that effective, even potential, investment in a real sector provides a real basis for growth. First, because the value of the project's assets grows in proportion to its development, even if not yet in operation (recall from our investment surveys how costly unfinished projects are). Second, the nearer the project is to completion, the nearer the time it will begin to yield a return and dividends. And the more clearly visible they are, the higher the price -- every child knows this. For this reason, the role of the "agent of the government" which figures in the Ministry of Economics concept in reality comes down to one thing: it must make markets in stock issues. The task of such a market-maker is to price shares of stock, raise their price, earn on margin. The task, clearly, is difficult, but someone will succeed. Some ChIF, let's say, will succeed -- wonderful! (and it's not worth mentioning anything more about checking funds in this context). This may be the basic scheme. It could be dressed up with various decorations, but the essence won't change. Let us comment on one other point in the document. For some reason the bureaucrats of the Ministry of Economics are lately more holy than the Pope; one and all shy away from the growth of the budget deficit as from the Devil's temptation. No deficit is fine, but this is unrealistic. In point of fact the authors estimated the amount of private capital attracted, on which they are counting, to be one trillion rubles. But this is a drop in the bucket -- scarcely more than one percent of the year's predicted investment program. What can you do with so little money? But the idea of shared financing is different. The trick is in return of capital and effectiveness of investments. If shared financing does this, then let the inflated money be invested by the state. Paris, in the end, is worth the mass. And money.
