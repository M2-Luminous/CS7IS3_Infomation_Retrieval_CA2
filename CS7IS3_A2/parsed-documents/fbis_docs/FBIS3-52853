Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik reports that, after the meeting, Ambassador Rabinovich will hold a series of tete-a-tete meetings in Washington with the head of the Syrian delegation to the talks, Muwaffaq al-'Allaf. In Israel, there are rising expectations for a positive shift in the negotiations with Syria following the Clinton-al-Asad summit. A senior political source, however, told our correspondent that the prime minister will have to slow down the pace of negotiations on the Golan Heights because, at this stage, he will be unable to deal simultaneously with negotiations with Syria and the Palestinians.
