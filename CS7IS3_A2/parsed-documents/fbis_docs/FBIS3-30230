Addressing the rally, Zhirinovskiy said he had come from Russia which, although far away in the north, had close fraternal links with the Serb nation. He said: We consider you as our brothers. I represent the party that won at Russia's first free elections. Our party came first. The Russian people elected this party knowing that it was the party of a new Russia, the party of a new foreign policy, the party of cooperation with the Serb people, and added: [Zhirinovskiy] I promise you that I will make radical changes in policy very soon. I have already demanded that Minister Kozyrev tell the entire world clearly that the Russian Government and the Russian parliament are on the side of the Serb people. [Krsmanovic] After this Zhirinovskiy pointed out that there were different countries in the territory of former Yugoslavia bearing different names. He said this territory was once called Bosnia-Herzegovina, but it is the Serbs who are living in this region. They should be asked if and when a new name is given to this country and when the borders of Serbia are determined, said Zhirinovskiy and added: [Zhirinovskiy] Catholics from the West, Muslims from the East, some enemy forces from the North--they all want to take a chunk of Greater Serbia for themselves, and they think that we will agree to it. We will never agree to it and Russia will help you. It will punish those who want to divide the Serb land. This policy has been going on for 100 years now. Every 50 years they start a war in the Balkans or somewhere else, and each time the victims are the Serb and the Russian people. Our message to the whole world today is that a new historic era is in the making. We shall put an end to the policy of playing games with the destinies of the Serb and Russian people once and for all. [Krsmanovic] Addressing more than 15,000 people gathered in the square of King Peter I the Liberator in Bijeljina, Zhirinovskiy said that he was speaking from the center of Serbia, from the seat of the territories which have historically and by right belonged to the Serb people. He made a special note of Russian solidarity. [Zhirinovskiy] I would like to give you some encouragement. The governments of some foreign countries that have applied (?methods of) pressure are now threatening air strikes because their other policy has failed. If one single bomb falls on a Serb town I warn them, on behalf of the strongest party in the Russian parliament, that this is a declaration of war against Russia and that we will punish them for it. They have two standards of democracy: According to them, the destruction of Serbs and Russians is democracy. But when we defend ourselves, they call it fascism. We do not fall for these double standards. I therefore hope that the Serbs become even stronger. I wish you courage, strength, and optimism. Look ahead proudly as a great nation. The great Russian nation is behind you. [Krsmanovic] Zhirinovskiy ended his speech with these words to the rally in Bijeljina today: We have one church, one language, one history--the same destiny. This destiny will be a happy one in the 21st century, and the future will be happy for all Russians and all Serbs. This afternoon Zhirinovskiy is expected to meet Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serb Krajina, in Vukovar.
