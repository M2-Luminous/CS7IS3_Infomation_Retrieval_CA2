President Leonid Kravchuk, a cochairman of the Constitutional Commission, said in his introductory remarks that the conference is supposed to explore avenues for a constitutional process in Ukraine because it "is a state recognized by the world community, hence it should not stand aloof from civilized constitutional norms." According to Leonid Kravchuk, the objective of passing a new constitution should be such a separation of the functions of powers where "each power branch should be authoritative, not authoritarian." Leonid Kravchuk outlined his own pattern of such a separation of the functions of powers: The president is taken out of the system of executive branch to become head of state; the parliament remains the sole legislative organ carrying out the legislative, founding, and control functions; whereas the prime minister, who becomes head of the executive branch and forms the government, shall be accountable to parliament in all respects. In Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, one of the acceptable ways to pass a new constitution is a nationwide referendum which can be held simultaneously with the parliamentary elections on 27 March -- but to enable this, the mechanics for the final discussion and approval of the constitution's text and its passage via parliament should be determined. Leonid Kravchuk named as another condition for putting the constitution to a referendum the elimination of all political inconsistencies in the text of the fundamental law that could aggravate the standoff in society. Leonid Kravchuk specified as other options for setting in motion a constitutional process in Ukraine the passing of a law on power if it proves impossible to put the constitution to a referendum. A draft of such a law elaborated by the president's team was handed out to those present. Much as had been expected, those who spoke after him differed in their opinions. Some deputies spoke for passing the constitution, some spoke for passing the law on power. Gradually one more proposal jelled -- to approve the text of a new constitution by a constitutional assembly, an ad hoc body. But the final decision on this matter would most probably be made by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet, whose ninth session will open on 20 January. Advocates of soviet power, who press for a purely parliamentary republic, will say what they think about the constitution at a conference of the chairmen of oblast Soviets of People's Deputies in Kiev on 18 and 19 January. It is this conference that its organizers think should come to replace the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets. Parliament Chairman Ivan Plyushch, another cochairman of the Constitutional Commission, will deliver a report at this conference. According to Leonid Kravchuk, the adoption of a constitution in Ukraine should be followed by deciding on a system of local power, and a balance should be struck between the powers of the center and those of the regions that could please everyone. Many speakers warned Leonid Kravchuk and Ivan Plyushch against dividing powers between Kiev and oblast centers in such a way that would split Ukraine into 25 autonomous republics.
