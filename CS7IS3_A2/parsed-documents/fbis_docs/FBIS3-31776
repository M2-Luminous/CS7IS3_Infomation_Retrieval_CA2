A Serb from Belgrade and a former general in the Yugoslav Army, he opted for the Bosnian side because he shares the principles of tolerance and multiethnicity that Bosnia and Serbia have always supported. [Vannuccini] General Divjak, a few days ago you were pessimistic. How do you judge the situation now? [Divjak] I was not pessimistic. I was realistic. The interests of Russia, Europe, and the United States intersect in Bosnia. The international community's main fear is that the conflict will spread. As for Sarajevo, very little has changed, because the city is still surrounded, though people are no longer dying as before. [Vannuccini] From the military viewpoint, are you satisfied with the withdrawal of the Serbian weapons? [Divjak] Not at all. They have not withdrawn, or placed under UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] supervision, even 60 percent of those that they had. UNPROFOR said this morning that it was "surprised" to discover some 60 placements that it had not seen before. The Serbs had 100 tanks around Sarajevo, and they have withdrawn 30 of them. [Vannuccini] But, General, it was you who signed the agreement with Serbian Commander Mladic at the airport. [Divjak] This is what happened: On the evening of 8 February UNPROFOR's commander in Bosnia, General Rose, asked us for an urgent meeting. He assured us that the Serbs had accepted all the conditions set by UNPROFOR, from the truce to the withdrawal of heavy weapons or their supervision by the blue helmets. Since I realized that the general was acting in accordance with the British Government's policy, I told Rose that I would prefer to await NATO's decision before meeting with Mladic at the airport. But Rose went to President Izetbegovic and put pressure on him for us to attend. The meeting at the airport lasted 15 minutes. There was nothing on paper, so each side can interpret the agreement however it pleases. The fact is that UNPROFOR tried to create political solutions on the ground in order to implement the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. It is Bosnia's ill fortune that in order to keep the Serbs happy UNPROFOR places Bosnia on the same level as the aggressors. [Vannuccini] Are you afraid that the Serbs could take back their weapons? [Divjak] The Serbs have around Sarajevo 12,000 men who are still fully armed. We have 45,000, but we have only one weapon for every three soldiers. And the Serbian artillery can hit Sarajevo from over 20 km away. They have rockets that have a range of 70 km. Our only real guarantee is NATO's ultimatum.
