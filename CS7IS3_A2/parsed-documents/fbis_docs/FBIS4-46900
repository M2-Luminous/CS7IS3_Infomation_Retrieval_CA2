As of 1 April of this year 38 registered commercial banks with 59 branches, of which 11 were outside the republic, operated in the Republic of Tatarstan. Compared to 1 January 1992, the number of commercial banks registered in Tatarstan increased from 17 to 38, and branches--from eight to 59. During the period in question, the statutory fund of banks grew from R305.4 million to R28 billion. In addition, the Tatagroprombank and 49 of its branches which mainly serve enterprises and organizations of the agro-industrial complex and rural rayons of the Republic of Tatarstan operate in the territory of the republic. As far as the branches of out-of-town banks are concerned, a branch of the Inkotransbank commercial bank (Nizhniy Novgorod) has been opened in Kazan. Of 38 commercial banks, six are public joint-stock companies that offer their shares for unrestricted sale; 15 are privately held joint-stock companies, that is, selling shares only to their shareholders; 17 banks have been established on a contributory basis. At present, 14 commercial banks in the republic hold licenses to perform banking operations with foreign exchange which are issued by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation after at least one year of banking activities. These banks include the Tatsotsbank, the Tatpromstroybank (Kazan), and the Kama Industrial Bank (Naberezhnye Chelny). They hold general licenses with the right to perform foreign exchange operations both in the Russian Federation and outside it. Four commercial banks have an expanded license with a restricted right to foreign exchange operations with just six foreign banks. Seven commercial banks have domestic licenses granting the right to perform foreign exchange operations solely through correspondent accounts at the banks holding general licenses. Based on the results of operations in 1993, commercial banks contributed to the budget more than R23 billion in the form of income-based payments, paid to their shareholders and partners R13.9 billion in dividends, and transferred R8.7 billion to centralized, insurance, reserve, and other mandatory funds. Based on the results of operation in the first quarter of this year, 13 commercial banks turned a loss in the amount of R4.9 billion. An analysis of the operation of banks indicates that the commercial banks generated a loss because of the deterioration of the repayment of credit and the interest on it by borrowers. At the same time, almost all banks met their commitments to pay interest on holdings and the deposits of the population, as well as on interbank credit, which was reflected in the results of their operations and the generation of a loss. The development of the banking system necessitates the further capitalization of the charters [as published] and assets of banks, collateral, and guarantees of their reliability and creditworthiness. At present, 13 out of 38 commercial banks have statutory capital amounting to or exceeding R1 billion, including only seven with statutory capital of R2 billion or more: the Tatpromstroybank, the Tatsotsbank, the Kaminbank (Naberezhnye Chelny), the Interkamabank and the Idel-Ural (Nizhnekamsk), the Selkhozbank (Mendeleyevsk), and the Akbarsbank (Kazan). Attracting funds to accounts in the banks and subsequently placing them in the form of credit extended to enterprises and organizations with all forms of ownership, primarily for measures associated with the development and support for the economy of the republic, is one of the significant tasks of commercial banks. During the period 1 January of last year and 1 April of this year, the volume of funds raised through bank accounts increased from R147.1 billion to R1,061.1 billion, including those attracted in the form of holdings--from R9.1 billion to R100.5 billion, and in the form of deposits of the population--from R0.7 billion to R75 billion. Efforts to attract interbank credit were stepped up, including its attraction through a chain of branches in other regions. As of 1 April of this year, interbank credit from other regions exceeded R65 billion. We should note in particular efforts to attract the deposits of the population and pay to it guaranteed interest rates as protection against systematic inflation and depreciation of the currency. The efforts of banks in this area are not easy; they entail credit risks and direct losses to individual banks. Despite this, such efforts are made in the interests of the entire population. With a view to assisting their clients in overcoming the payments crisis and facilitating the acceleration of settlements with enterprises in other regions, the commercial banks of the republic, in addition to expanding the chain of their branches, are vigorously establishing correspondent relations by way of opening correspondent accounts at other banks and effecting out-of-town payments between relevant enterprises through them. The Volga-Kama Joint-Stock Bank has an extensive network of correspondent accounts which make it possible to perform direct settlements, including in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Izhevsk, Chelyabinsk, Perm, Kaliningrad, Rostov-on-Don, Novosibirsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, Ulyanovsk, and Yaketerinburg. Along with the Volga-Kama Bank, the Tatpromstroybank, the Tatsotsbank, the Zarechye, the Kambiznesbank, the Kama Industrial Bank, the Avtogradbank, and the MNB Continent vigorously operate in this area. Last year, 20 commercial banks floated 32 issues of securities registered by the National Bank in the form of bank shares. The banks placed the securities both among their shareholders and by way of unrestricted sales to the population. At the same time, despite the fact that six public joint-stock banks, i.e. banks whose shares may be freely sold and bought on the on the secondary market (exchanges), operate in Tatarstan at present, only the shares of the Volga-Kama Joint-Stock Banks are quoted on the Moscow Central Stock Exchange. This indicates the poor activity of the banks in the securities market both in the republic and outside of it. In addition to shares, the National Bank has registered conditions for the issuance of deposit and savings certificates of commercial banks; last year, six banks issued their own bank bills of exchange. The aforementioned securities (certificates, bills of exchange) are issued for the purpose of both raising funds in bank accounts and effecting settlements with them without withdrawing the corresponding ready cash from the banks. The unstable economic situation causes changes in the operation of commercial banks. Despite the general growth of the resource base of commercial banks, a number of banks are experiencing a considerable resource shortage. Within the structure of attracted funds, a considerable growth of nontraditional sources of credit resources has been registered, specifically, of credit received from other banks, holdings, and deposits. The extension of credit for periods of no more than three months, and at individual banks for periods of no more than one month, has developed extensively. Complex economic policies necessitate adjustments in the investment policy of commercial banks, too. At present, they prefer to extend credit for operations involving tangible merchandise while formalizing the collateral and insuring their credit. In generalizing the above, we should note yet again that the banks of the republic are now vigorously mastering a broad array of banking services on the basis of perfecting technical support for them and improving the professionalism of the banks.
