Thanks to the joint efforts made by the comrades in the State Science and Technology Commission and comrades in other units, my wish has been finally realized. Science and technology are the important impetus for the development of productive forces as well as the important indication of social progress. A comprehensive look into the history of civilization shows that every major breakthrough in science and technology always brings about profound changes in productivity and leads to great social progress. Since the beginning of this century, particularly since the end of World War II, major breakthroughs and the rapid development of a number of cutting-edge new and high technologies such as electronic information, biotechnology, and new materials have profoundly changed the world outlook and human life. Science and technology have penetrated all spheres of economic activity and social life and have become the most important factors propelling the development of productivity. In the final analysis, science and technology represent a decisive factor in the progress of modern society. Competition in the international arena in modern times is nothing but the competition of overall national strength. Science and technology are the keys to winning the international competition. Comrade Deng Xiaoping had the perspicacity of discerning this great historical trend and stated in a clear-cut manner that "science and technology are the primary productive forces," which is a scientific exposition that has enriched and developed the Marxist theory on productivity and that has provided a major guide for building China into a strong and prosperous, democratic, civilized, and modernized socialist country. The remaining decade of this century and the next 50 years of the next century are a critical period for the invigoration of the Chinese nation. The world's progressive tide of peace and development and the evolving scientific and technological revolution have provided opportunity for China's reform, opening up, and economic development. We must seize this hard-to-come-by historical opportunity, closely track the development of science and technology in the world, accelerate the pace of developing new industries, constantly increase the role of scientific and technological progress in bringing about economic development, and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the entire national economy. A look at contemporary world history will tell us that many poor and backward countries experienced an economic takeoff within a very short space of time. Although they varied in their respective conditions and advantageous factors for development, they did share one thing in common -- that is, they stressed education and were good at adopting advanced science and technology. Because we have a superior socialist system and because our people are known for their hardworking spirit and for their wisdom, we will surely realize the grand objective of socialist modernization in 50 to 60 years if we persevere in our tireless efforts by unwaveringly adhering to the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to the party's basic line, and by resolutely relying on scientific and technological progress. To accelerate the pace of scientific and technological progress in China, it is essential to raise the scientific and technological level of various levels of leading cadres. Since adopting the policy of reform and opening up to the outside world, China has made great strides in training more educated and professional cadres. At present, most leading cadres at the county-level or higher are at least college educated, if not higher educated than that. This, however, does not necessarily mean that leading cadres, notwithstanding their higher educational level, are familiar with or have mastered modern scientific and technological knowledge. Cadres, whether they majored in social science or in natural science in college, whether they graduated many years ago or just graduated from college, need to go through a restudying process. We know that modern science and technology develop at a dizzying pace, that new inventions and new theories emerge one after another, and that old knowledge is being replaced by new knowledge with great rapidity. Only by carrying out assiduous study, by constantly acquiring new knowledge, and by arming ourselves with knowledge can it be possible for use to increase our decision-making power and to improve the art of leadership. Because there is a vast amount of scientific and technological knowledge, it is impossible for our middle-level and high-level cadres to become experts in certain fields and in certain disciplines. But it is completely possible for our cadres to broaden and deepen their range of knowledge or even to become specialized in certain fields. Failing to accomplish that, they cannot be said to be qualified leaders. We now face an important task of stepping up the study and mastery of modern scientific and technological knowledge. All levels of cadres must recognize the importance of acquiring more knowledge and of enhancing awareness of the need to gain more knowledge out of a sense of making the country strong and prosperous and of invigorating the Chinese nation. When acquiring scientific and technological knowledge, we must keep the followings in mind: We must be undaunted before difficulties; we must always show a willingness to ask questions; we must apply knowledge in our daily lives; and we must have perseverance. Because cadres are entrusted with the heavy task of providing leadership in socialist modernization construction, they are indeed very busy. Despite busy work schedules, they should find time for study. This book may serve as "a beginner's" reading for understanding modern scientific and technological knowledge. I suggest that cadres devote a bit of effort to thoroughly reading this book. To always enrich and broaden their range of knowledge, cadres may, after finishing this book, want to read more social science or natural science works, depending on their job positions and work requirements. If mid- and high-level cadres know how to arm themselves with scientific and technological knowledge, to increase their capability for understanding nature, for utilizing nature, and for transforming and protecting nature, they will be able to better lead and mobilize hundreds and millions of people to advance the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and to sketch a newer and more beautiful picture scroll on the vast motherland's land.
