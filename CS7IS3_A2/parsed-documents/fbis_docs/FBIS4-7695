There are lines of wounded in front of the operating theater and the improvised medical facilities are full, while the chetnik rampage continues. Since this morning over a thousand shells have landed on (Batici) alone. The attacks are intensifying from several directions, and the aggressor is again trying to break through with tanks from Ustipraca and (Nezici). The chetniks are firing howitzers, multiple rocket launchers, and mortars of all calibers from (Kotovo), Djakovici, Kozara, (Paljika), (Preljuca), Carevo Guvno, from every hill they control. On the right bank of the Drina their infantry attacks intensified before dawn. At 1025 a major tank and infantry attack was launched north from (Kopaci). The battles are [word indistinct] and the strength of the artillery support from the chetnik forces is unprecedented here. The situation is by far the worst on the free Rogatica territory. Hundreds of tonnes of steel have landed here over the last 10 hours. Despite their losses, the chetniks are intensifying their attacks by introducing fresh forces. All 50 tanks are in full use, as are armored transporters, combat helicopters, and some 10,000 murderers of all kinds from the four chetnik corps. Their intention is obvious: They want the Herzegovina Corps, the Sarajevo-Romanija Corps, the Drina Corps, and the Uzice Corps to link up in Gorazde. They are not much concerned that Gorazde has been made a UN Protected Area with Resolution 824. True, during this morning's flights by two NATO planes over the area, the intensity of their attacks did let up, only to be resumed with even greater ferocity after the aircraft had gone. This is Fahrudin Becic reporting from the Information Service of the Eastern Bosnian Operative Group.
