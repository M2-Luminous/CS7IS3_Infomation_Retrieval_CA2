Under the proposed amendments, legal persons registered in Latvia may become owners of land beneath buildings and constructions they acquired as a result of privatization and land that is needed to build such buildings and constructions. Physical persons who own land should be allowed to sell it to legal persons, the government said. The above regulations could be operative until the adoption of a special law on the use of land. In addition, the government sent the Saeima (parliament) its considerations regarding waivers for public transport users. The new regulations cut the number of eligible passengers considerably. The group also commissioned the Latvijas Nafta state-operated enterprise to reduce by 4.6 million lats the debt of farmers for fuel supplied in the 1992 spring and autumn season. The government proposed the Saeima to fine 100 lats to 250 lats for neglect toward rules of non-cash transactions. Finally, the Cabinet allowed the forestry service to auction 10,000 cubic meters of timber from state-owned felling sites. The acquired resources would be used to reconstruct the Ligatne paper mill.
