Two commissions have just been set up to prepare the different cases in connection with the aborted coup which cost life of President Melchior Ndadaye and some of his close aides, as well as the bloody killings that followed it. Raphael (Njenguye) elaborates: [(Njenguye)] According to an article from the local daily, that is, Tuesday 19th [April], the first commission will have to try to identify and take action against the putschists and murderers of the late head of state and his close aides. The second type of commission is at the provincial level. It will have to inquire into the political and ethnic massacres which followed the aborted coup of last October. [passage omitted] The commission will be back in New York by next week and will draft a report to be submitted to UN Secretary general who will give it the appropriate response.
