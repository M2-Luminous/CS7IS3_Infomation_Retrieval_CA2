The four representatives from the RGC are: "Sok An, Tol Loah, Yu Hokkri, and Chhuo Leanghuot." But this official did not confirm whether there will be any change in this composition before the commission's scheduled meeting is held in Phnom Penh on 15 June under the chairmanship of Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong. The roundtable commission delegation from the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] will arrive in Phnom Penh on 13 June to attend the meeting. According to a report on 10 June by the CAMBODIAN DAILY in English, the four PDK delegates on the commission will be chosen from among the following six officials: "Chan Youran, Mak Ben, Tep Khunnal, Tup Kiem, Meas Chey, and Sok Roeu." The topics on the agenda are: 1) The answer from both sides on whether they will or will not accept a permanent cease-fire in Cambodia. 2) The PDK's proposal on the minimal policy program. Various analysts have expressed doubts that the 15 June meeting will be successful because the Pyongyang roundtable failed despite the fact that it was chaired by the king himself.
