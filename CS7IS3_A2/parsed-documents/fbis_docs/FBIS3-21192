There is no risk for National Semiconductor. We must attack.'' (Mitsubishi Electric Corp. Intellectual Property Liaison Dept.) Having been sued for patent infringement of the patent for semiconductor production technology by National Semiconductor (NS) of the United States, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. took on NS at the end of August and brought a countersuit for patent infringement. Also, the Kilby Patent is the basic patent for semiconductors held by Texas Instruments (TI) of the United States. For the past two years, negotiations with NS concerning cross-licensing of the patent concerning semiconductors continued, but an agreement on price and conditions was not reached and since they were caught on a snag, it was decided to request a public judgement in court. In the background there is a calculation that ``litigation is certainly costly, but even so the cost is about one tenth the settlement money.'' Mitsubishi decided to set out the stance of this attack in their patent strategy three or four years before. Entering Mitsubishi Electric via being the Director-General of the Patent Office, vice-president Kazuo Wakasugi assumed the position of Intellectual Property Department chief in June 1989. Immediately upon taking this position, he mentioned the idea of ``making patents a source of income with the expansion of patent acquisition abroad, beginning with the United States, and broadening claims at the time of application'' and promoted the switch from defense to offense. This change in awareness is related to this countersuit. From Quantity to Quality Emphasis ``Only 5% of the income from technical material is paid. For us to be the `Hitachi of technology,' it must be at least Germany's average 50%.'' The director of the Hitachi, Ltd. Intellectual Property Rights Department, Katsunori Ogawa has never forgotten these words grumbled on a day 23 years ago by Toshihiko Kubo, vice-president at that time. It was Hitachi which introduced the system for evaluating inventions in the second half of the 1960's and the full disclosure system in 1970, but until 1981, the increase in the number of patent applications remained a constant barometer for invention activities. Those results were fruitful and the wish of Kubo was for realization after ten years. Looking back, Ogawa says ``we did not think we could clear the objective in just ten years.'' Along with the advance to foreign markets and the expansion of business zones, disputes among foreign and domestic businesses have gradually increased and the switch of emphasis from quantity to quality seemed to be approaching. Around 1975, in an export project for heavy electronics products, Ogawa, assigned to the processing of banned requests received from foreign businesses, was surprised to find that in the expanding patents of his company, not one patent was effective on partners. This ordeal was instructive and he started the Strategic Patent Redoubling Movement in 1981; in 1985, income and outgo from technical material rare in Japanese business was in the black. In the past several years, patent disputes in US-Japanese business have been increasing and each company is strengthening critical awareness. With the main products being the subject, it is disliked that trials are lengthened just by taking ``actually a form to suppress the first shoot'' (Director Yasuo Nishiguchi of Kyocera) and many cases are also settled with a compromise. Compromise is a Stopgap Measure Vice-president Wakasugi of Mitsubishi Electric appeals for a revision of awareness and says ``in the end there are the problems of the income and outgo and the percentage of victories, but it is necessary not to compromise at once and to claim the rights of this company definitely in a dry manner of the partner.'' Even when compromise is chosen, the fact is that this is just a stopgap measure. This is because resistance is not possible with such a policy in cases of demands to halt business and to ban production and sales. Hitachi is pressing patent activity called a ``fighting patent'' in which ``it is not simply applied for, but fosters individual patents with strong rights. The application claim of the patent is taken broadly.'' Also, the way of Mitsubishi which is taking action with a countersuit is one such model case. (New Technology Establishment News Group)
