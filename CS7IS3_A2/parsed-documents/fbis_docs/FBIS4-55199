Almost three-quarters of the crimes committed in Slovakia are of an economic nature. Representatives from the Financial Police estimate tax evasion during the first three months of this year to amount to nearly 3.5 billion korunas [Sk]. Criminal proceedings are already underway in cases involving losses of about Sk1.0 billion. In scams involving the import of oil products during the first quarter alone, certain importers defrauded the state of some Sk300-400 million in taxes. The Financial Police have reason to suspect that an extensive network of fraudsters with contacts abroad is operating here. The activity of the Financial Police in machinations in the so-called old account between the Slovak and Czech Republics is, at the moment, more of an investigative and informative nature. It is apparent from the investigation, however, that "in scams associated with the old account between the Slovak and Czech Republics during the first three months of the year alone, evasion amounting to Sk1.0 billion is estimated." However, it is still not clear whether such an abuse of the account is really a crime or merely an abuse of what the law does not prohibit. Minister Pittner said, in connection with screenings, that they will be carried out by the Slovak Information Service, because this task falls to it by law. Unfortunately, that part of the "screening law" concerning the candidates for secret collaboration, which the Constitutional Court of the former Federation suggested be removed from the law, has not been amended.
