The country's three main parties have agreed that on 7 March they will install a new transitional council to run the country. The disarmament process will also begin on that same day. In addition a date has been set for multiparty elections in Liberia, 7 September. The three component parties in the agreement are the Interim Government led by Dr. Amos Sawyer, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, NPFL, led by Charles Taylor, and the ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] militia. The coordinator of the peace process there is the United Nations special representative in Liberia, Mr. Trevor Gordon Somers. On the line to Monrovia, Fergus Nico asked him how he felt about the latest agreement: [Begin recording] [Somers] We reached agreement very early this morning-- somewhere around 1 o'clock, 1:15 in the morning-- after slogging away all day, so that this has brought the satisfaction that after hard work the parties were able to reach an agreement. I think it is a good effort on the part of the Liberians. The three parties have demonstrated despite the difficulties that they had faced in reaching certain aspects of the agreement, they had (?certainly) taken the kind of decision, for example, that they have named a date for the installation of their government. As you know the Liberian people have yearned for that forsome time. And I think that is the most important thing that the parties could have done. [Nico] Well, let us look ahead to that-- the 7 March, the installation of their transitional power sharing council. What kind of distribution of portfolios do you think [word indistinct] between the parties? [Somers] At present, you know the parties have managed to distribute 13 of the 17 cabinet posts. The four on which they have not reached an agreement are defense, finance, justice, and foreign affairs. And of the other 13, it is a fairly even distribution among the three parties. [Nico] But the other four are the most critical portfolios, are they not? [Somers] That is correct, that is correct. But I am satisfied that they will continue to work to find a solution to that problem before we get to the 7th. There will be a lot of maneuvering, there will be a lot of discussions. [Nico] Can we just turn to the other aspect of what seems to have been the main success from the early hours of this morning -- the question of disarmament? There's always been this question of whether disarmament should start before the talking or vice versa. Now you seem to have secured agreement that they will start at the same time. Do you think really we will see your troops beginning to collect significant number of weapons? [Somers] The plan is that within approximately three-week period, ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Peace- Monitoring Group] and the UN military observers will be fully deployed throughout the country. Once they are fully deployed then we are ready to lift the arms. And at the moment we start the lifting of arms, that is the moment that the government should (?be seated). And I think the act of disarmament itself is one that will (?roll) fairly quickly, because the various factions will bring their fighters to points, where they will then be moved to encampment centers. And I think this is a kind of thing that will (?rush through) once we get started with the arm lifting. [Nico] Is it correct to say the Ugandans and Tanzanians will be ready to go? No word yet on the Zimbabwean contingent? [Somers] The Tanzanians and Ugandans are already in their (?forward) positions, ready to go. The Zimbabweans, we now have reached the point where we are just checking with the Americans to determine whether sufficient resources are in hand for the Zimbabweans to come and stream as soon as we get the green light.
