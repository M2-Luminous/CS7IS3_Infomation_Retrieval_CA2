Investigations showed that the party's aims and activities run counter to certain constitutional provisions concerning civic rights and freedoms, particularly the right to human dignity, minority rights and the equal rights of citizens. Also, legal proceedings are under way against the leader and another member of the party, on charges of incitement against a community. On the basis of the findings of the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office has filed a petition at the Metropolitan Court to dissolve the party. As previously reported, on January 21 the National Security Office lodged a complaint with the National Police Headquarters against Albert Szabo, a dual Hungarian/Australian citizen who heads the WNPRP, and Akos B., a juvenile activist, for allegedly having committed the crime of incitement against a community. The party, registered in October 1993, held a meeting in Budapest in mid-January where they denied that the Holocaust had ever taken place and defined themselves as successors to the Hungarian fascist arrow-cross party and its leader, Ferenc Szalasi, who was executed in 1946 for crimes against humanity.
