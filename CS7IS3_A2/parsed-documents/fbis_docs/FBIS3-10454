The political analyst added that according to another poll held in December, 41 percent of the electorate would vote for Luis Donaldo Colosio, 20 percent for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and only 11 percent for Diego Fernandez de Cevallos. Nevertheless, he said these results were not published and now none of the political parties that support these candidates (PRI, Institutional Revolutionary Party; PRD, Party of the Democratic Revolution; and PAN, National Action Party, respectively) want any further polls. He explained that the reasons for this are that the PRI's Colosio has sold the idea that he has a 65-70 percent backing, the PRD bases its campaign on an alleged democratic switch that has not taken place so far, and PAN does not want to admit that its rapprochement with the government has cost the party about eight popularity points. Reyes Heroles, who inaugurated a cycle of conferences programmed by Monterrey's Institute of Technology and Higher Studies, which includes the participation of all presidential candidates, said that for some people it seems surprising that 61 percent of the population backs in one way or another the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN), but this can be explained when one takes into account that the government itself cultivated a cult for Emiliano Zapata and the Mexican revolution.
