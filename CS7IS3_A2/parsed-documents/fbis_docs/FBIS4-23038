The Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technical Policy, the Committee for the Problem ``The Brain Drain'' under the Russian Federation Commission for UNESCO Affairs, and the Regional Office of Science and Technologies for Europe (UNESCO-ROSTE) organized it. The Russian and foreign experts discussed the draft of a report, which was prepared for this meeting. It will be submitted in the form, which has been worked out following evaluation by the experts, to the Government of the Russian Federation for decision making. Let us acquaint the readers of POISK with excepts from this document. Introduction: Science of Russia During the Transition Period During the late 1980's and early 1990's a significant abrupt increase of emigration from the country was observed. This wave, which was due, on the one hand, to the intensifying socio-economic crisis of society and, on the other, to the liberalization of the policy of the regulation of departure, encompassed practically all social groups of the population of Russia, including intellectuals. It should be acknowledged that precisely the latter suffered to the greatest degree from the social consequences of the crisis, while the dire straits of science and the higher school of Russia under the conditions of the sharp decrease of budget allocations in 1992-1993 will undoubtedly provoke the intensification of the ``brain drain'' in the immediate future. If the absolute figures of the departure of personnel from science remain at the 1991-1992 level, by 1990-2000 it will cease its existence in Russia. If the relative magnitude of departure remains, by 2000 in science the number of employees will come to about 700,000, that is, 25 percent of the 1992 level. Russian experts regard this version in case of the maintenance of the present course of reform in the country as most realistic. The decrease of employment will be most significant in 1993-1995, then its pace will slow, and a certain personnel stabilization will occur. Thus, it is anticipated that the share of science by 2000 will decrease in the structure of employed people from 3.4 percent to 1 percent. The Scale of the Migration of Scientific Personnel The geography of external migration is rather broad, it encompasses practically all continents. However, an overwhelming portion of the emigrants are heading for four basic countries. Of the total number of people who left Russia before 1993, 45 percent of the emigrants went to Israel, 37 percent went to Germany, 12 percent went to the United States, and 2 percent went to Greece. The flow of emigrants to the United States is characterized by the greatest ``science-intensiveness.'' According to the 1992 data, among those who left 33 percent are people with a higher education and 44 percent are white collar workers. In three years (1990-1993) 4,500 scientists emigrated to the United States. Along with this the emigration of Russian scientists to Third World countries, which in contrast to, for example, the United States and Germany are making a demand for scientific personnel of intermediate skill, increased appreciably. A big demand for Russian scientists, first of all for professors and instructors, exists in China. The arrival of about 1,000 Russian scientists in South Korea is anticipated. Iran and Iraq, which are interested first of all in importing specialists in the field of nuclear technologies and are prepared to pay them significantly more than the average annual salaries of nuclear physicists in the United States, are not concealing their interest in scientists from the CIS. The process of the adaptation of Russian scientists to work in the West is not uniform. The scientific elite primarily gets jobs at universities and other scientific organizations, combining teaching activity with scientific pursuits. The results of a survey among mathematicians and theoretical physicists (96 doctors and 54 candidates of sciences, who work at scientific centers of the United States, Canada, Western Europe, and Australia) show that more than 70 percent of the surveyed scientists adapted easily to the new situation. The overwhelming majority of them (90 percent) believe that work abroad as a whole justified their expectations. At the same time a large portion of the scientific personnel, who left Russia through the channels of ethnic emigration, were forced to leave the sphere of research and development, and this switch is of an irreversible nature. The share of ``unlucky people,'' according to the data of the survey, came to 3-5 percent, but for emigre Russian scientists as a whole it is significantly higher. In the opinion of 50 surveyed executives of leading foreign scientific centers, the problems of the adaptation of emigre Russian scientists are due to a poor knowledge of foreign languages (75 percent of the respondents), difficulties in dealings with colleagues (21 percent) and with students (67 percent), and the ignorance of foreign scientific literature (17 percent). According to the data of a sample survey of the movement of personnel at 10 scientific research institutes of the capital (the total number of scientists is 3,746), which was conducted in 1992, in 10 months 1 percent of the scientific personnel (6.7 percent of all people who got their discharge) got their discharge from the surveyed institutes and went abroad, 60 percent of those who left are scientists up to the age of 40, 41 percent of those who left had degrees, including 12 percent who had doctoral degrees. It is possible to regard an estimate of 1 percent as the maximum value of the indicator of scientific emigration from Russia during 1992. Here the share of foreign emigration in 1992 does not exceed 2 percent of the total departure of personnel from the sphere of research and development for other spheres of activity within Russia and migration about the territory of the former USSR. The share of those leaving, who worked in the sector ``science and scientific education,'' as a whole for Russia during 1987-1992 came to 6 percent. During a sociological survey that was conducted among 18 scientific institutes, 42 percent of the respondents indicated that they were pondering in earnest leaving for work abroad, although the opportunities for this for the present do not exist, 8 percent of the respondents intend to leave in the immediate future, and 5 percent of the respondents are considering the question of their going abroad because an opportunity for work abroad has personally appeared for them. Only 23 percent of the respondents are not considering the possibility of their going abroad. Analyzing the prospects of the solution of this problem, 31 percent of those who responded to the question about the ``brain drain'' indicated that the factors, which are responsible for the departure of scientists from the country, are of a deep-seated nature and cannot be eliminated in the immediate future. The respondents assigned ``the present state of society'' to the overall cause of the difficulties that are being experienced by academic science. As the second set of factors, which are responsible for the departure of scientists abroad, the respondents indicate the formed low level of prestige of science in society, the atmosphere of vulnerability and lack of protection, in which science has found itself, and the uncertainty for scientists of their future. Having a depressing effect on scientists is the lack of demand for their creativity abilities. Forty-six percent of the scientists believe that they are realizing their scientific potential fully, 31 percent believe that they are using only half of it, 13 percent believe that they are using it to a small degree. The theme of the remuneration of the labor of scientific associates as one of the decisive factors, which is responsible for the ``brain drain,'' is touched upon during the sociological surveys by nearly all the respondents. The absolute majority of scientists believe that it is necessary to raise the level of remuneration of scientific labor to international standards, having increased it by 10- to 30-fold. The changeover to a contract system in the conducting of research is suggested as the most important step in this direction. In second place in importance is the underestimation by society of the social importance of intellectual labor (53 percent noted this as a reason for departure). Fifty percent rate nearly as highly the inadequate opportunities to realize oneself as a scientist in Russia. Forty percent of the scientists, professors, and instructors of Moscow higher educational institutions noted the instability of the political situation and the threat of social disorders as a reason for leaving. Thirty-five percent of the respondents name as a reason for leaving anxiety over the fate of their children. Just as many respondents named as a reason for the emigration of scientists the overall deterioration of the economic situation and the threat of unemployment. Another 19 percent of the respondents noted as a reason for emigration the low level of protection of scientists and of the legal registration of the results of scientific activity. The evaluations of the respondents, which were given during this survey, of the social and psychological factors that affect the decision of a scientist to go abroad, are also interesting. Eighty-four percent of the respondents named as such a factor the dissatisfaction with living conditions; 28 percent--the desire to conduct research in a stronger scientific collective; 26 percent--a young age; 22 percent--talent, a high intellectual potential; 13 percent--the existence of scientific contacts with foreign partners and scientific centers. Among the fields of science, which have been particularly affected by emigration, one should name first of all mathematics and computer technology. In recent years the demand for programmers from Russia, first of all young people, has increased on the international labor market. The number of mathematicians leaving for the West today constitutes a significant share (25 percent) of the annual graduation of these specialists by elite faculties. The losses among physicists are also substantial. Of course, the states, which are accepting our scientists, are interested in obtaining not ``ballast,'' but the most talented, promising scientists who have created a name for themselves in science by great achievements. As a result the most actively working, talented young people and middle-aged scientists, who have already achieved significant scientific results and are known through publications abroad, are leaving the country. A large portion of the scientists from the RAS, who have left for permanent residence abroad, have the degree of candidate (55.9 percent) and doctor (16.2 percent) of sciences. Nearly half (48.5 percent) of those who have left the country have not reached the age of 40. As was noted, during 1990-1992 a significant decrease of the number of scientific personnel occurred. In 1993 this process continued, and in five months the number of scientific specialists of scientific and technical organizations (NTOs) decreased, according to the estimates of experts, by 7 percent, which makes it possible to predict an overall decrease during 1993 in the amount of 13-15 percent. This departure is objectively due to the redundancy of the market of scientific and technical labor, which finds its expression in the low level of the wage in science, periodic organized reductions of personnel, the narrowing of the possibilities for the conducting of work that interests the scientist and the specialist, and the stressful psychological atmosphere in scientific collectives. Until recently inadequate attention was devoted to the analysis of this ``internal migration,'' although in scale it is more significant than emigration beyond the country. According to the data of sample surveys of 1992 and 1993, there are 10-15 scientists, who left NTOs in search of better work, for each scientist who has emigrated. What socio-economic consequences can such a pace and scale of migration have for Russia? Under the influence of external and internal (intersectorial) migration the scientific and technical potential is weakening substantially, particularly with allowance made for the long-term consequences for the training of new generations of scientists and specialists. On a broader plane the country may lose the stratum of people, which is necessary for the maintenance in society of a balanced social strategy in the context of the chosen scientific and technical policy. The country is undoubtedly incurring considerable material losses, which it spent on the training of specialists and scientific personnel. The calculations, which were made by the United Nations method (the subtraction from the gross national product of the direct and indirect outlays on the training of the personnel who leave and the lost gain from the activity of emigrants in this country) as of the beginning of 1991, show that in case of the departure of one specialist the country loses about $300,000. If the forecast of the annual migration of the Ministry of the Economy of Russia--200,000-250,000 people annually--is confirmed, the country will annually lose $60-75 billion. The Problems of State Regulation of Intellectual Migration Under present conditions the state cannot pose the task of not only the complete halt of the departure of scientists abroad, but also its significant reduction in the next few years. Attempts to complicate departure from the country by the creation of administrative barriers would be at variance with the legislation of Russia and with international obligations in the area of human rights. The formulated draft of the Federal Program of the Regulation of Intellectual Migration is called upon to unite the efforts of state bodies and alternative structures, international organizations and foundations, and the scientific community in the interests of protecting the domestic intellectual potential. The goals of the program are: the development of the principles and mechanisms of the long-term national policy of Russia in the area of the migration of scientists and specialists and the formation of a set of specific steps on the implementation of this policy; the reduction to a minimum of the harm from the departure abroad of the scientific and technical and the creative intelligentsia by the creation of adequate organizational legal and socio-economic working and living conditions of scientists and specialists in Russia and their effective participation in the international division of labor. The development of a rational mechanism of the management of the process of intellectual migration and the creation of the conditions for its efficient operation are a most important task of the program. The basic measures of the program can be implemented in three stage. At the first stage the task of preserving the scientific elite of Russia and of not allowing the leading scientific schools of the country to perish is advanced. At the same time it is necessary to place the process of the ``brain drain'' in a civilized framework. For these purposes it is planned to make efforts for the change of the form of migration from emigration without return (which still predominates) to temporary contract migration. At the second (intermediate-term) stage a substantial change in connection with the changeover to a market of the structure of science, the forms and sources of its financing, and so on is proposed. Along with the state, the role of which will gradually decrease, independent structures, joint-stock companies, and various structures will become the clients of developments of scientists. The transformation of science in these directions creates favorable conditions for mutually advantageous cooperation with foreign scientific centers and firms, which produce science-intensive products. All this will make it possible to stabilize scientific research and development and then will ensure their development and growth, which will affect fundamentally the migration of intellectuals. The third, long-range, stage of the regulation of intellectual migration can begin when Russia, having overcome the difficulties of the transition period, has formed a dynamic market economy and an efficiently functioning civilian society that makes a great demand for scientific ideas. This stage will afford real opportunities for the extensive return of emigre scientists to the homeland, as well as for the attraction of foreign scientists for work at Russian science centers. The program is a state and long-term one and is approved by a decree of the government. The overall coordination of the work under the program is being carried out by the Russian Federation Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. State participation in the financing of the program presumes: - the allocation of budgetary funds for the development of science, culture, and higher education with allowance for potential aggravations of the problem of intellectual migration; - the establishment of preferential conditions of taxation for enterprises and firms in case of the making by them of investments or the implementation of other projects that contribute to the achievement of the goals of the program; - the mobilization of the assets being received from domestic and foreign nongovernmental organizations. There should become the basic forces of the implementation of the program: first, government bodies, whose activity the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy of Russia coordinates; second, the scientific community, the public, and representatives of commercial structures and the mass media; third, international organizations and foundations, as well as the corresponding structures of the countries which are giving aid to Russian science; fourth, the appropriate subdivisions of the Federal Migration Service of Russia. After the approval of the program at the state level a special subdivision (an administration or an agency for questions of intellectual migration), which performs the functions of the general management of the program, as well as an interdepartmental scientific council with the attraction of representatives of the scientific community, experts of international organizations, and so forth, which is responsible for the scientific, including research, support of the program are established within the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy . The All-Russian Scientific Labor Exchange, which deals on a commercial basis with the entire set of questions connected with the support of the entire set of questions connected with the assurance of civilized conditions of the transfer of scientists and specialists. The exchange in cooperation with the mass media (at the first stage the newspaper POISK) and other structures are publishing in Russian and English a special bulletin (the working name is SCIENCE EXCHANGE) with information on all questions that are important for the participants in the process of intellectual migration and for donor countries and recipient countries.
