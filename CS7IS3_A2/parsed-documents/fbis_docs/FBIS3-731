He told journalists before his departure that he believed creating additional border posts, and involving local leaders and villages next to the Botswana-Zimbabwe border, could curb the problem of illegal border crossings. President Mugabe attributed the problem of illegal border crossings to unemployment, which he said is everywhere, even in Zimbabwe. He also admitted that a bureaucracy problem existed at the Zimbabwe Immigration Department, which he said hindered Batswana businessmen and women to do business. He promised that something would be done about it. Commenting on the former Ethiopian leader's status in Zimbabwe, Mr. Mugabe said Mr. Mengistu Haile-Mariam sought refuge in Zimbabwe in accordance with international law. He said no extradition treaty exists between the two countries and in any case the treaty usually deals with individuals who commit crimes of a nonpolitical nature.
