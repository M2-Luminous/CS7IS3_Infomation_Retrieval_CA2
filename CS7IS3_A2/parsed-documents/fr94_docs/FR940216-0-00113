FR940216-0-00113 FR940216-0-00010 While it is true that any single batch of reformulated gasoline produced by blending RBOB with oxygenate could receive the per-gallon minimum 1.5 weight percent oxygen, the oxygenate blender must offset any gasoline produced at this oxygen level with other gasoline produced with oxygen levels greater than 2.1 in order to meet the 2.1 average oxygen content standard. In addition, EPA believes it is likely that most oxygenate blenders will choose to meet the oxygen standard on a per-gallon basis, rather than on average. The testing, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements for an oxygenate blender who elects the average oxygen standard are significantly greater than for an oxygenate blender who elects the per-gallon standard. Moreover, EPA's oversight experience with the state-enforced wintertime oxygenated fuels program, which includes the option of meeting that program's oxygen standard either per-gallon or on average, is that the vast majority of oxygenate blenders have elected the per-gallon option in that program. This precedent from the oxygenated fuels program is more compelling because the oxygen standard in the oxygenated fuels program is 2.7 weight percent for both the per-gallon and average options, yet oxygenate blenders for the most part still chose the per-gallon option. In contrast, under the reformulated gasoline program the average oxygen standard (2.1 weight percent) is more rigorous than the per-gallon oxygen standard (2.0 weight percent), which is an additional reason to believe reformulated gasoline oxygenate blenders will choose the per-gallon option. All oxygenate blenders, including a blender using any-oxygenate or ether-only RBOB and who uses the average oxygen standard, must follow the oxygen amount instructions contained in the RBOB product transfer documents. These instructions must specify the minimum oxygen necessary for the resulting reformulated gasoline to meet all per-gallon minimum and maximum standards. For example, a particular batch of any-oxygenate RBOB may specify 2.0 weight percent oxygen in order for the resulting reformulated gasoline to meet the 1.3 vol% benzene per-gallon maximum. An oxygenate blender using the RBOB in this example is required to add a volume of oxygenate that is large enough for the reformulated gasoline to have a minimum 2.0 weight percent oxygen (e.g., a minimum of 5.4 vol% ethanol), regardless of whether the oxygenate blender is meeting the oxygen standard per-gallon or on average. A refiner or importer of RBOB who, in lieu of producing ether-only and/or any-oxygenate RBOB, elects to conduct a quality assurance program over downstream oxygenate blending operations may use the actual oxygen types and amounts blended with the RBOB. If such a refiner or importer fails to properly carry out the quality assurance program, however, the RBOB will be deemed to have been blended with 4.0 vol% ethanol (1.5 wt% oxygen), the ``worst case'' oxygenate type and amount that is not constrained by ``ether-only'' or ``any-oxygenate'' designations. Under this assumption the reformulated gasoline would receive a 1 psi RVP boost associated with ethanol (see Section I of the RIA), and the minimum dilution effect of any oxygenate at 1.5 wt% oxygen (for example, 1.5 wt% oxygen results from 4.0 vol% ethanol, or 8.2 vol% MTBE). This assumption is appropriate in such a situation because it is possible the RBOB could be blended with ethanol at the 1.5 wt% oxygen minimum. EPA believes it is reasonable to assume the RBOB will be blended with at least the per-gallon minimum oxygen volume of 1.5 wt% oxygen, because of the requirements imposed on oxygenate blenders, such as recordkeeping, and mechanisms included in the final rule to ensure compliance with per-gallon minimums, such as quality assurance sampling and testing by regulated parties and enforcement by EPA. E. Averaging issues 1. Use of per-gallon and average standards EPA proposed that refiners and importers would be allowed to decide, on a per-batch basis, which regulated parameters will be subject to per-gallon standards and which will be subject to average standards. See 57 FR 13444 (April 16, 1992). For example, under the proposal refiners could decide for any given batch of reformulated gasoline to meet the benzene per-gallon standard and the toxics emissions reduction standard on average. Under the proposal these elections could be made separately for each batch of gasoline produced or imported, and separately for each parameter.
