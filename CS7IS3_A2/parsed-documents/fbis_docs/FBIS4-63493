The Russian guests include Ramazan Abdulatipov, deputy chairman of the Federation Council; Marshal Yevgeniy Shaposhnikov; Emil Pain, member of the presidential council; and academician Valeriy Shchegortsov. Crimean guests include President Yuriy Meshkov and Vice President Yevgeniy Saburov through a link-up studio in Simferopol. Yuriy Meshkov begins by saying: "The name of this television program is How Shall We Live? My reply is that we shall live normally. Those who have packed their suitcases and are planning to go on holiday to the Crimea don't need to unpack. What is happening and what is behind it? Typical political games. In this particular case they have been generated by a forthcoming event in Ukraine -- the Ukrainian presidential elections. And all the games are around this event. It is important not to go too far with these games. "As for the Crimea, all is quiet here. We have no reason to be alarmed. But, naturally, this does not mean that one can forget about us, give us up, and not help us to resolve problems, which Russia's involvement would obviously help in tackling." Ramazan Abdulatipov says: "Most of the Crimean problems are political. They must be resolved by politicians. Yuriy Aleksandrovich Meshkov was absolutely right when he said politicians, instead of resolving the problems...[pauses]. I have dozens of agreements signed by the Russian and Ukrainian presidents. In fact, these agreements are not being implemented by either side. To a larger degree, they are not being implemented by -- I don't want to attack the Ukrainian side now -- they are not being implemented by the Ukrainian side, in fact. "I agree the present problem has been whipped up by the current political struggle in Ukraine. Because Ukrainian politicians were frightened by the fact that socialists and communists were coming back to take part in the parliamentary elections. And under the circumstances a new spur of nationalism is needed -- I would put it that way -- and to stir up nationalism, especially in western areas, the Crimean factor is being used, instead of resolving the matter in the interests of the Black Sea Fleet sailors, in the interests of Russia and Ukraine. ``Moreover, and I would like to stress it again, it is impossible to find a single person in Russia who would admit that the Crimea is part of Ukraine. But this does not mean in any way the problem should be resolved by strong-arm methods destroying the integrity of the existing Ukrainian state. I would like to stress again that people and, above all, the military, become hostages of politicians. These people should be released.'' Emil Pain adds: "I have been studying conflicts for a long time. It happens practically every time that there cannot be one side in a conflict. If there is a conflict brewing, both sides are adding gunpowder to it. Therefore the rule that says look at yourself first and ask yourself whether you are doing everything right should be addressed to the Crimean leaders and the Crimean parliament." Meshkov says: "What circumstance cannot be changed by anyone? The circumstance that geographically the Crimea is connected with Ukraine and Russia. Nobody can change the geographical position and, as far as I know, nobody is going to encroach upon it. ``But there is another circumstance that does not depend on politicians and that cannot be changed by anyone. The circumstance that before 1954 [when the Crimea became part of Ukraine following a decree by Nikita Khrushchev] and after 1954, the people of the Crimea were and remain part of the Russian people. It is another matter that administrative redivisions inside the Soviet Union have introduced new circumstances, and it would be wise to take these circumstances into account. ``From the start, from the moment the Crimean president was elected, our moves, I mean, the moves of the government, and they were fully approved by the Crimean people, were aimed at achieving economic prosperity. And with this aim, economic reforms have been and are being implemented, economic relations are being established, and treaties are being signed with the subjects of the Russian Federation.'' He adds: "In the same way we can and must resolve the mutual problems arising in our relations with the Kiev administration. There is no other way. And we don't want any other way. Our only desire is to solve all problems causing tension in our relations. There is a way and a method of resolving problems by treaty. And it has been tried and approved by Russia already. It is a solution to the problem, and it has already been confirmed that it is possible. It is necessary and it produces positive results. ``We put forward the same proposal to the administration in Kiev. In return, you have already heard what has been taking place and what is artificially being whipped up to implement narrow individual political aims. ``I don't share the optimism of my colleagues in the Russian studio that the Ukrainian president will keep his word. You know, we have had so many opportunities to see the exact opposite. Evidently the efforts of public opinion should be mobilized to alleviate the task of the Ukrainian president in keeping his word.'' Yevgeniy Saburov says: "First of all, misunderstanding around the Constitution should be explained. Some disinformation is being spread that this is an act of secession, so to speak. This is absolutely wrong. The constitution states plainly that the Crimea is part of Ukraine. In fact, only one clause is at issue -- the treaty question. We have been exhausted by the fact that we cannot understand what we can and cannot do." Back in Moscow, the announcer reads out messages from viewers who express concern over the future of the Black Sea Fleet. Marshal Shaposhnikov says: "All these processes began at the end of 1991 and are still going on now. In practice they have not been resolved because of political ambitions. What can I propose? The navy of the former USSR consisted of four constituent parts: the Pacific, Northern, Baltic, and Black Sea. As regards the first three, there are no problems. They belong to Russia and nobody else is laying claim to their constituent parts. ``As for the Black Sea Fleet, there are three sides at present which, in my opinion, are legally aspiring to some part of it -- Russia, Ukraine, and Georgia. As one knows, there are 11 states in the CIS. Most of them signed the CIS collective security treaty. Ukraine did not sign the treaty. Consequently, one-eleventh of the Black Sea fleet should be given to Ukraine. As for the remaining parts of the fleet, ten-elevenths of it should be subordinated to the CIS combined armed forces, which would ensure collective security in the Mediterranean region where, as one knows, there is an American presence with nuclear missiles. This part, the main part of the Black Sea fleet, could watch moves by our partner -- we hope it will be our ally one day but at present peace is fragile, as one knows -- in the interests of the whole of the Commonwealth and not one individual side. With financial quotas and so on. If it is difficult for some CIS states, even members of the CIS security system, to support their one-eleventh of the fleet, they can delegate their part to a third party; for example, in exchange for oil, gas, coal, metal, grain, for anything in fact." Abdulatipov says: "It is a very serious problem. More than 50,000 Ukrainian troops are concentrated in the Crimea at present. Literally a few days ago special purpose troops were redeployed there. The Berkut, Sokol, and other groups have been redeployed there. I received this information from Sevastopol this morning. The situation is that any provocation might lead to a wide-scale conflict. Therefore, it would be a good thing for our politicians to start negotiating and implementing the agreements that have already been signed." Emil Pain adds: "I am ready to admit and I think one should admit that the Russian media are biased in their coverage of the problem. For example, our TV link today is between Russia and the Crimea. Yet we are talking of Ukraine all the time. It would be perfectly reasonable if Ukraine were taking part in the program. ``I don't think we should go into details about the origin of the word Ukraine. It is an independent state at present recognized by the UN. The Crimean constitution says the Crimea remains part of the Ukrainian state. I think certain complaints should be made to the Crimean leadership. And if we are talking here about how to help the Ukrainian president to keep his promise not to use force, to a large degree this depends on the actions of the Crimean leadership. You are talking of negotiations, but unilateral actions are a very bad condition for any negotiations. I am not talking here of the content of the constitution adopted by the Crimean parliament, but it is an absolute fact that the parliament adopted it unilaterally." In return, Meshkov says: "I would like to remind you that the most acute issue, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet, was excluded from the competence and involvement of the Crimea by a decision of the Kiev administration. Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy, he was perhaps the first official in the Kiev administration who isolated the Crimea from Ukraine when he categorically refused to allow the Crimean Republic, representatives of the Crimean president, to participate or at least to be present silently at the talks on the Black Sea Fleet. This situation is unthinkable for any sensible person, and it is quite difficult to understand it from the political point of view, since the problem is being resolved on Crimean territory. This problem concerns the citizens of Crimea and directly touches upon our interests. And not to take them into account is physically impossible, but it seems it is possible politically." He adds: "Our intention is to reach an agreement, to resolve all points at issue, not to walk away from them but to resolve them on mutually beneficial and mutually acceptable conditions. And a treaty would make it possible to define the range of problems and solve them. And I would like it very much if first of all there could be a treaty between the Crimea and Ukraine to stabilize the situation and define and create preconditions for a treaty between Ukraine and Russia, which is inevitable and necessary, I think. But only that way round -- no other way at all -- since otherwise we should be prevented from resolving the points at issue. ``I don't think our non-participation will have a beneficial effect on the results of the talks. We realize our responsibility to the people of Ukraine and to the people of Russia since we are part of it. We are aware of possible consequences of preserving and implementing a tripartite agreement between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States. But we would also like, and, I think, we are entitled to expect, that our wishes to reach an agreement will be supported and guaranteed by all the parties.'' Yevgeniy Saburov says: "The Crimea can make no claims whatsoever on Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. We Russians and Ukrainians are fraternal peoples. We have a lot of Ukrainians here. We do not really make any distinction by nationality. What is under discussion here is a particular Kiev administration that has appeared at a particular time and seems to be a temporary one, rather than confrontation between the Crimea and Ukraine, which is being whipped up artificially."
