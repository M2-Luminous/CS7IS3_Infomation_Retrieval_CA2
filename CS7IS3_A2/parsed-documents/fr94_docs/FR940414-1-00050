FR940414-1-00050 FR940414-1-00010 Lines handling dry products are usually cleaned by flushing with the solid, inert material used as the carrier for the products handled on the line. This may be followed by rinsing with water when additional cleaning is required. EPA has seen one facility which used the dry diluent to clean equipment out on a routine basis. However, the facility thoroughly cleans out the equipment interiors with water prior to product changeover or line shut down for the season. Because the product is dry and this water cannot be reused to recover its product value, this particular facility treats the wastewater and recycles it back for use in the facility. Liquid lines are usually rinsed between changeovers with either water or an organic solvent, depending on the production just completed and the product to be produced next on the line. Water cleaning is also performed for routine maintenance. Changeover cleanings can be eliminated or greatly reduced by dedicating equipment to specific products or groups of products. Although entire lines are not generally dedicated, EPA is aware of many facilities that dedicate formulation mix tanks to specific products, thereby eliminating one of the most highly concentrated wastewater streams generated by formulating, packaging or repackaging pesticide products. Facilities also dedicate lines to the production of a specific product type, such as water-based versus solvent-based products, thereby reducing the number of cleanings required, and allowing for greater reuse of the cleaning water or solvent. Another effective pollution prevention technique identified by EPA is the scheduling of production to reduce the number of product changeovers, which reduces the number of equipment interior cleanings required. Facilities may also reduce the number of changeover cleanings or the quantity of water or solvent used for cleaning by scheduling products in groups or ``families.'' An effective water conservation technique that EPA has observed for equipment interior cleaning is to equip water hoses with hand-control devices (for example, spray-gun nozzles) to prevent free flow of water from unattended hoses, and employing high-pressure, low-volume washers instead of ordinary hoses. One of the facilities visited indicated that the use of high-pressure washers reduced typical equipment interior rinse volumes from 20 gallons per rinse to 10 gallons per rinse. Steam cleaning can also be used to clean equipment interiors while producing less wastewater. Steam cleaning can be a particularly effective method to clean viscous products that might otherwise require considerable water and/or detergent to remove. Many facilities will have access to steam from boilers on-site, however, if there is no existing source of steam, steam cleaning equipment is available for purchase. Although steam generation can increase energy consumption and add NO x and SO x pollutants to the atmosphere, the benefits to be gained by creating a small volume of wastewater and potentially avoiding the need to use detergents or other cleaning agents which could prevent product recovery, make steam very attractive for some applications. The Agency cautions that steam could be a poor choice for cleaning applications where volatile organic solvents or inerts are part of the product as the steam would accelerate the volatilization of the organics. Facilities also clean equipment interiors by using squeegees to remove the product from the formulation vessel and by using absorbent ``pigs'' for cleaning products out of the transfer lines before equipment rinsing. These techniques minimize the quantity of cleaning water required. Regardless of whether or not residual product is removed from equipment interiors before rinsing, equipment interior rinsate can typically be reused as makeup water the next time that a water-based product is being formulated. 4. Department of Transportation (DOT) Aerosol Container Leak Testing The DOT leak test bath water is a source of wastewater at aerosol packaging facilities since it must be changed periodically, due to the buildup of contaminants in the water. Leaking (or occasionally exploding) cans contaminate the water bath with pesticide product. Can exteriors may also contaminate the bath water since they may have product or solvent on them from the can filling step. According to several facilities, pesticide products and solvents can cause visibility problems in the bath water and leave an oily residue on the cans exiting the bath. One of the facilities visited also indicated that bath water must be dumped and refilled periodically to prevent rust particles from fouling steam sparging equipment (used to heat the bath). No method of eliminating this source of wastewater has been identified; however, the volume of water used may be minimized through the use of a contained water bath as opposed to a continuous overflow water bath. A contained water bath is completely emptied and refilled with water when required, based upon visual inspection by the operator. Therefore, the quantity of wastewater generated is dependent on the volume of the bath (200 gallons is a typical volume of the contained water baths at visited facilities) and the frequency of refilling. It is the Agency's opinion that the best practice to reduce wastewater generated by aerosol container (DOT) leak testing is to use a contained water bath where the water is changed out when it is determined to be ``dirty'' by visual inspection.
