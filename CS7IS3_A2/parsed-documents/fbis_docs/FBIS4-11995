In a statement to AL-HAYAH, Rabeh Kebir, chairman of the FIS Executive Committee operating abroad, has said, in the first press statement since the German authorities ordered him to halt his political activities, that FIS leaders have not made any commitments to President Zeroual to halt "armed action." He added that FIS leaders have not made any decision in this regard contingent upon consultations with free FIS leaders. The FIS reaction came less than 24 hours after the Algerian Presidential Office announced that Major General Zeroual had held personal contacts with the jailed FIS leaders, who asked Sheiks Ali Jedi and Abd el Qader Bou Khamkham to work to stop the violence. In a related development, informed Algerian sources informed AL-HAYAH that the Algerian Army continues to "initiate" battles with armed group members, and that it is waging "a calculated" war against them. The Army's withdrawal from a certain area, the sources continued, does not mean that it is incapable of confronting these groups. Any military move hinges upon a full-blown and calculated plan, the sources maintained. The sources declined to delve into military details. Nonetheless, they underscored the Army's cohesion, unity, and ability to keep things under control. They noted that the Army is currently engaged in large-scale pursuit operations against gunmen.
