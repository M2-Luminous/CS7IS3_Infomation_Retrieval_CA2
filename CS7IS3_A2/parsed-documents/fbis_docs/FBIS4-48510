Elected unanimously on Friday, he appealed to senators -- who had just been sworn in by Chief Justice Michael Corbett -- to co-operate in upholding the senate's dignity. "As president of the senate, one of my duties will be to see that the right of freedom of speech is upheld in the house." After the swearing in of the new senators in the historic old senate chamber at Parliament, Mr Justice Corbett asked for nominations for the presidency. The National Party's chief whip Mr Attie Jooste proposed Mr Coetsee and Mr Alex van Breda, former chief whip of Parliament, seconded the proposal. Mr Coetsee was duly declared elected. Mr Justice Corbett then called for nominations for deputy president. Former Rivonia trialist, Robben Island prisoner member of the ANC's National Executive Committee Mr Govan Mbeki was the sole nomination, proposed and seconded by the ANC's Mr Dennis Bloem and Ms Isabella Direko. Mr Mbeki, father of South Africa's first deputy president Mr Thabo Mbeki, was declared duly elected. Mr Coetsee was then escorted to the president's chair by Mr Jooste and Mr van Breda to deliver a short speech to senators before adjournment. "I deem it a great privilege to have been elected to this first senate under the new constitution," he declared. "It is my pleasant duty to express my appreciation to the house for its confidence." He undertook to discharge his duties to the best of his abilities. "Let us never forget that a spirit of tolerance and good humour is conducive to good debate." Mr Coetsee said the Senate would play an important role in South Africa's constitutional development, especially in view of its composition of 10 senators from each of the nine new provinces. Among those watching proceedings from the public galleries was the speaker of the National Assembly, Dr Frene Ginwala; her deputy, Dr Bhadra Ranchod; and the Western Cape premier, Mr Hernus Kriel. The African National Congress occupies benches from the president's right; with the Freedom Front and Democratic Party sandwiched in between the ANC and the National Party [NP] which occupies the first block of benches to the president's left. There are 60 ANC senators, 17 from the NP, five each from the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Freedom Front and three from the Democratic Party.
