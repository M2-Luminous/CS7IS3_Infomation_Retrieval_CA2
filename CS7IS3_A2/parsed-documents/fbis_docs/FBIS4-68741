Richard Layard dwelt in detail on the problem of the decline in production. The professor claims that it is wrong to view the recession in industry -- which in the first quarter of 1994 was 24.9 percent of the first quarter of 1993 -- in isolation from similar indicators in other spheres. Thus, construction volumes during this period fell by 24 percent; production volumes in agriculture fell by 5.5 percent; market services fell by 15 percent; and nonmarket services (services whose prices are state-regulated) fell by 4 percent. In all, the national product in the first quarter of 1994 was 17 percent down on the first quarter of 1993. This means that consumption also fell by 17 percent on average. Admittedly, the question arises of just how accurate these figures are. In general it has to be said that our country has never had access to reliable information that would allow us to calculate the volume of production accurately. In the era of general socialist competition it was advantageous to distort figures. Now, in the era of universal struggle against the tax inspectorate, it is advantageous, on the contrary, to play down output volumes. Moreover, the huge amount of all possible kinds of small producers -- private plots and small-scale cottage and collective labor -- are not officially registered at all. So we have to content ourselves with the figures we have. Incidentally, Richard Layard and his colleagues attempted to get out of the situation as follows. In calculating GDP levels, they took account of Russian citizens' income indicators. Figures from the State Committee for Statistics were used. As were the results of a survey of cottage industries which this organization carried out using methodology recognized around the world. Incidentally, research has shown that working people's real consumption in Russia increased by 21 percent from the first quarter of 1993 through the first quarter of 1994. Consumption by pensioners increased by 11 percent. The overall 17-percent drop in consumption is due to the fact that spending on arms purchases and investment is considerably down. And although the London professor sees this trend as undoubtedly negative and a result of inflation, he sees the fall in arms spending as an indicator of the restructuring of the economy. How long could the recession continue? Discussing this subject, Richard Layard cited the following figures. GDP in Russia has fallen by 50 percent since 1989. The comparable indicator in Poland and Hungary is around 20 percent. In Slovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania it is around 40 percent. Russia's isolation, in Mr. Layard's opinion, is due to the military-industrial complex' greater share of the economy and to the collapse of the USSR. The likeliest extent of the further decline in GDP, in the professor's opinion, is another 10 percent. GDP growth usually comes through two to four years after reforms begin. But Russia, Mr. Layard believes, has already gone halfway and can expect its upturn in 1996. Provided, of course, that the authorities create certain economic prerequisites. Above all in the financial sphere -- in the fight against inflation. But Andrey Illarionov, who spoke next, noted that the achievements have so far been slight. In particular, Chernomyrdin's main adviser sharply criticized the budget discussed by the Duma. First, its revenue. In 1993 revenue came to 10.6 percent of GDP. In 1994 the Finance Ministry is planning for 17.1 percent -- proving that growth is entirely possible, since the methods used to calculate revenue have changed. But, Illarionov noted, average revenue levels have come to just 8.3 percent of GDP in the first three months of 1994. And the deficit is 9.2 percent. Yet the deficit in the first three months of 1992-1993 was either no more than 1 percent, or there was no deficit at all. And in some months there was even a surplus -- budget indicators are traditionally good at the start of the year. The expenditure side is also bad, in Illarionov's opinion. According to the budget, expenditure over the year should be 27 percent of GDP. But expenditure is already nudging 17 percent after the first three months. Andrey Illarionov insists that the government has not made a single reformist decision in the first three months of the year. At the same time, Illarionov noted, many other decisions have been made. And, alongside such well-known decisions as the conclusion of the agreement with Belorussia [Belarus] and the introduction of import tariffs and a state monopoly on the production and sale of alcoholic drinks, there was the little-known Russian Federation Government directive of 28 February 1994 on the presentation to the U.S. and Spanish peoples of two statues to mark the anniversary of the discovery of America -- the "Birth of the New World" and the "Birth of the New Man." Admittedly the works of art will be produced on site, and therefore the Russian Government is so far only presenting the aforesaid peoples with construction materials. But what a lot of materials! Some 60 carloads of cement, 80 carloads of fittings, 66 carloads of steel, 11 carloads of glass, and 170 carloads of copper (or 10 percent of Russia's entire copper exports in 1993) will be exported duty-free. These large amounts of construction materials are intended for the creation of just one sculpture.
