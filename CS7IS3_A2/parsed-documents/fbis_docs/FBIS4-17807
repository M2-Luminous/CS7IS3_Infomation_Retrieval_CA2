Medvedev, leader of "New Regional Policy," and I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma; no date given; carried under the rubric "In the State Duma"] [Text] On 26 April at 2030 hours the life of Andrey Daynisovich Ayzderdzis, an independent State Duma deputy, was cut short in his 35th year. He was shot at point-blank range at the entrance to the ordinary dwelling house in which he lived in the Moscow Oblast city of Khimki. Yet another name is entered on the gloomy list of contract killings increasingly being committed for political motives. For the first time a deputy of the supreme legislative organ, the Federal Assembly State Duma, has been murdered. A Russian citizen has been murdered. A human being, to put it simply, has been murdered. Insolently. Boldly. Mercilessly. Once again -- and at the same time, for the first time -- one of the most terrible crimes against the person, which in recent times have become a common phenomenon in our country, has been committed. Once again a challenge has been hurled to society, the president, the government, and parliament. Once again the helplessness and impotence of the state, the organs of power, and the law-enforcement organs in the battle against crime are revealed in all their nakedness. Once again we all -- all deputies, the whole nation -- are persuaded of this through our own bitter experience. The subsequent inactivity, passivity, and failure to adopt tough, energetic, and decisive measures aimed at scotching and eradicating crime and violations of the law place in ever-growing jeopardy not only the lives of individual people, but the very existence of Russian statehood itself (in any of its forms). Soberly assessing the currently prevailing situation, the scale of the imminent danger, the bounds which criminal elements have transgressed, and the possible tragic consequences for the country's multimillion population, we demand, with all the decisiveness at our command, that the Russian Federation president, as the guarantor of human and civic rights and freedoms, and as himself a citizen, make maximum use of his constitutional powers for the urgent and uncompromising imposition of order in this most important sphere of our everyday life. We express firm confidence that the first step in this complex and difficult battle will be the investigation of the murder of our colleague and the proper punishment of his murderers. Criminals and instigators of murders must be found, convicted, and suffer their merited punishment. Peace must triumph in our country. [Signed] V.S. Medvedev, leader of the "New Regional Policy" deputies' group. I.P. Rybkin, chairman of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly State Duma.
