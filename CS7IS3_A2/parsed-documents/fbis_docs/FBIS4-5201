The Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, which was conceived more than three decades ago and whose construction was funded by Australia, will be formally opened today in a ceremony to be jointly presided over by Their Majesties the King and Queen and Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan and Mrs Phoumsavan. His Majesty will also take this auspicious opportunity to visit Laos -- his first foreign visit in almost 30 years -- and to inaugurate a Royally-sponsored agricultural centre. His Majesty's visit to Laos today shows the importance the Thai monarchy attaches to relations between Thailand and its landlocked neighbour which, in most of the past two decades, have been marred by suspicion, misunderstanding and conflicts which, at times, have turned violent and resulted in bloodshed on both sides. The opening of the bridge will certainly facilitate communication and transport links between Thailand and Laos. It will also improve contacts between Thai and Lao peoples who share several cultural and ethnic similarities. Foreign visitors will also have a better chance to explore the pristine Laotian environment and traditional cultures and experience the friendliness and gentleness of the Lao people. The friendship bridge symbolises the cooperation between Thailand, Laos and Australia which funded the bridge construction. It also stands as testimony that, despite political ideological differences, countries can overcome suspicions and work together for their mutual benefits if they are genuinely sincere enough and willing to set aside their mutual distrust. But it would be totally unrealistic to believe that the first bridge across the mighty Mekong River will suddenly bring to an end all the problems that have long existed between Thailand and Laos. It would also be self-deceiving to expect the two countries to suddenly bury the hatchet, embrace each other affectionately and walk hand-in-hand together towards economic prosperity. Bangkok and Vientiane need to hold talks on a regular basis to settle some outstanding problems which still stand as an obstacle to the improvement of relations between the two neighbouring countries. One sticky problem is the Laotian resistance movement. Vientiane has always harboured the suspicion that Bangkok is clandestinely giving support and asylum to the resistance rebels, several of whom are suspected of having taken refuge in refugee camps in Thailand. However when Thailand suggested that Laos take back all the Laotian refugees in order to remove suspicion, this was rejected by Vientiane, claiming it is not in a financial position to accept them all. Endowed with abundant natural sources, Laos is an ideal source of energy and raw materials for Thai industries. But Thai businessmen who wish to invest in Laos must tread a careful path and must not repeat the exploitative business practices employed by their predecessors who were branded as "ugly" Thais. The days when Thai businessmen could plunder at will and exploit Laos' natural wealth are over. Business deals should be done in a mutually beneficial manner. The opening of the Friendship Bridge should usher in a new era of cooperation, friendship and relations between the two neighbouring countries which are based on the principle of respect of sovereignty and independence, mutual benefit and trust. And to achieve these goals, a lot has to be done by both sides earnestly and sincerely. The task will prove to be more difficult -- yet not insurmountable -- than just building a bridge.
