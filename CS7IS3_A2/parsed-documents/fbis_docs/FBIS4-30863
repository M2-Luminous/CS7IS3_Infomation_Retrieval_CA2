We know that this coalition was a reason for a large part of members to leave the Green Party. Could this not be avoided? [Prascakova] No. We consider the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] to be the heir of the Communist Party of Slovakia, which bears maximum responsibility for the devastation of the country and morals. Also, it is inadmissible, for reasons of principle, for Greens to enter into a coalition with any political party. [Zelenayova] Does that mean that you are preparing the registration of a new Green party? Is that desirable? [Prascakova] We have already applied for registration. It is common throughout the world for two Green parties to exist alongside each other. Usually, they are divided into fundamentalists and realists. [Zelenayova] Do you think that you will gain enough members? [Prascakova] Entire district organizations and groups are declaring their allegiance to us. Only 14 out of 29 districts attended the last meeting of the Coalition Committee where the vote on entering a coalition with the SDL was to be taken. Apparently, the remaining 15 district organizations were opposed to this coalition. [Zelenayova] Will your new Slovak Green Party go into the elections on its own? [Prascakova] Originally, we did not want to join forces with anyone. But as the party's polarization has already been provoked, we will lean toward the nationally oriented parties and movements. [Zelenayova] But [SDL Chairman] Peter Weiss has called the left-wing coalition a patriotic one. [Prascakova] We are not convinced about that. It is through the SDL's fault that the political situation is now under the control of parties of the Hungarian ethnic minority. Some officials of the Green Party in Slovakia, too, are favorably disposed toward the demands formulated in the Komarno appeal [issued by representatives of the Hungarian minority on 8 January 1994]. [Zelenayova] Are you not afraid that Greens will stop taking an interest in Green policies? [Prascakova] Not at all. We are actually creating an alternative for voters who subscribe to the Green philosophy but do not want to vote for the left-wing bloc and [an alternative] for that part of our members who want to work for the environment but are leaving the party because of its coalition with the SDL. We will strive to enlist new members, whereby we will increase the number of people who take an interest in the Green philosophy.
