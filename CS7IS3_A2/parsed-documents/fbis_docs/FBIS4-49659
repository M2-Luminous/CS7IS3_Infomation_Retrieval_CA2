The First Automobile Group I/E Corporation recently held an oath-taking and mobilization meeting to pledge mass effort to complete the project and put it into operation before the end of this year. Zou Jiahua, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and State Council vice premier, who was on an inspection tour in Jilin, attended the meeting and praised the project's fast progress in construction. The project, the construction of which started in 1991, is a major project listed in the state's Eighth Five-Year Plan and is currently the largest joint venture in the country's machinery industry. For this reason, the party Central Committee and the State Council have expressed concern for and paid great attention to this project. Requiring an area of 218,000 square meters, the project will have internationally first-class equipment. When the first phase of the project is completed, the production line will turn out 150,000 sedans a year. The total investment for this project is 1.26 billion yuan. When the second phase of the project is completed, the company will be able to turn out 300,000 sedans a year. When the entire project is completed, the company will become China's largest modern sedan manufacturing base turning out Jetta and Golf sedans. After three years of hard work by 30 domestic and foreign designing and construction units which carried out design construction, installation, and production debugging simultaneously, about 80 percent of the planned total investment has been completed. With the arrival of all the ordered production equipment, 1,552 sets in total, the installation of equipment and the testing of production processes are now in full swing. A modern sedan production base with four large buildings has taken shape. By the end of last year, the company had manufactured more than 20,000 Jetta sedans for sale on the market. When the project is completed and put into operation by the end of this year, the company's self-sufficiency rate in manufacturing [vehicles and their required parts] will reach 40 percent. To complete the project according to schedule, the corporation, with the support of the Jilin provincial party committee and the provincial government, organized eight special construction groups, with workers of the corporation playing the main role, and proposed that "let us work hard for eight months to complete the construction of the 150,000-sedan-capacity plant and put it into production by the end of this year." To strengthen organizational leadership over the project and to accelerate its pace of construction, the Jilin provincial party committee and the provincial government formed a "decisive battle" leading group headed by Governor Gao Yan, and a project command, which will ensure the progress and quality of this project. Speaking at the mobilization meeting, Zou Jiahua praised the rapid progress of the project, saying: While developing the production of sedans, the First Automobile Group I/E Corporation has completed the remodeling of its major product, medium trucks, and it has ensured good quality. It not only has secured a stable share of the domestic market for medium trucks but also has exported a large number of them. The corporation has built a production base capable of manufacturing 60,000 light-duty vehicles a year, and the advantage of large-scale operations is beginning to yield results. Its spectacular achievements in as short a period as several years are the results of implementing the party's line of reform and opening to the outside world under the care of the party Central Committee and the State Council and under the direct leadership and support of the Jilin provincial party committee and provincial government, and these are also due to the concerted efforts made by the corporation's workers and staff members. On behalf of the State Council, Zou Jiahua gave his regards to the 100,000 workers and staff members of the corporation who are working hard to develop China's automobile industry, as well as to the foreign experts working for the corporation. Zou Jiahua said: The automobile industry is a pillar of China's national economy. The First Automobile Group I/E Corporation is one of the country's 10 key enterprises of pillar industries. Facing intense international market competition, the corporation must strengthen itself, enhance its ability to participate in international competition, and turn itself into a large automobile industry group as soon as possible. The First Automobile Group I/E Corporation has already developed in an all-round way the production of medium trucks, light cars, and sedans. Its most crucial task now is to complete the 150,000-sedan production base soon. Although the project had a late start and involves more difficulties, its construction has progressed rapidly. We must complete the major project in two years. Zou Jiahua encouraged the builders to make new contributions to the development of China's automobile industry.
