FR940712-0-00030 FR940712-0-00010 Direct costs for observer coverage are estimated to be about $200 per day per observer. The cost of a second observer on the four mothership processor vessels would depend on the number of days the additional observer was required. The number of observer days for each mothership processor vessel during the 1993 non-roe season ranged from 39 to 58 days. Based on the observer coverage requirements for 1993, a second observer during the 1994 non-roe season could cost from $7,800 (39 days x $200/day) to $11,600 (58 days x $200/day) per mothership processor vessel. Based on the actual number of fishing days, the total cost for all four mothership processor vessels would be $37,400 (187 days x $200/day), if the second observer were required for the same amount of observer coverage days as during the 1993 non-roe season. If the second observer is required for only a portion of the 1994 non-roe season, additional observer costs would be $200 per day per mothership processor. Costs could also be incurred for the acquisition of electronic mail software and a personal computer that satisfies the hardware requirements detailed above. The cost for these items could range from $200&hyph;1200. Mothership processing vessels have the INMARSAT A satellite communication capabilities and necessary computer hardware, and most shoreside facilities have the necessary computer hardware for electronic transmission of data. NMFS will supply the necessary data entry software and will provide installation free of charge. Closure of the salmon savings area to vessels using trawl gear will also affect any trawl vessels that may have otherwise fished in this area in non-pollock target fisheries. However, examination of 1993 catch information indicates that no significant amounts of other groundfish fishing or pollock Community Development Quota fishing occurred in the salmon savings area subsequent to closure of the directed inshore and offshore component pollock fisheries. Management measures responding to the information recently presented to the Council are necessary to mitigate potentially adverse impacts of chum salmon bycatch on western Alaska salmon resources and to reduce chum salmon bycatch in 1994. NMFS is implementing this emergency action for the 1994 pollock non-roe season because the high chum salmon bycatch occurred primarily in the pollock non-roe season in 1993 and a large proportion of this bycatch occurred in the salmon savings area. NMFS concurs that the above regulatory measures must be implemented by emergency rulemaking to prevent high bycatch of chum salmon by catcher vessels fishing for groundfish in the CVOA during the 1994 pollock non-roe season. Classification This rule is exempt from the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis, because it is issued without opportunity for prior public comment, and none has been prepared. This rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of E.O. 12866. NMFS finds that the immediate need to protect and conserve the ``other'' salmon population in the CVOA, as explained in the preamble to this rule, constitutes good cause to waive the requirement to provide prior notice and an opportunity for public comment, pursuant to authority set forth at 5 U.S.C. ยง553(b)(B), as such procedures would be contrary to the public interest.
