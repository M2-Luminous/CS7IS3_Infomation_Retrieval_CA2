FR940328-0-00062 FR940328-0-00013 Location of Information on Label One official establishment and two meat trade associations misread the proposal as requiring that the labels be placed on either the principal display panel or the information panel. One poultry trade association on behalf of an official establishment requested FSIS to permit the safe handling instructions to appear on the back of an insert label with a referral statement on the front informing consumers that the instructions were on the back. One consumer group stated that placement of the safe handling instructions anywhere on the label as to render it likely to be read is ambiguous and will likely result in lengthy disputes regarding its meaning. They recommended that FSIS revert to the original requirement from the interim regulation on the placement, i.e., on the principal display panel or information panel, which will have the same result while avoiding unnecessary disputes and litigation. FSIS is not persuaded by the comments to make any changes in the placement of the safe handling instructions. The instructions may be placed anywhere on the outside label where they will be visible at the time of purchase. Several of the commenters must have misread the proposal when they objected to placement of the instructions on the principal display panel or the information panel. The interim rule required such placement but comments persuaded FSIS to allow flexibility in the placement of the safe handling instructions. We do not believe that the current language is ambiguous or will lead to lengthy disputes. Several commenters stated that FSIS ignored the previous comments that packages would be too small to carry all mandatory information. As stated in the previous final regulation, FSIS is not aware of labels smaller than those on 12 ounce chubs that would likely require safe handling instructions. FSIS believes that labels will be large enough to accommodate all mandatory information due to the flexibility provided by the safe handling and nutrition regulations. FSIS received no comments which provided examples of packages that could not accommodate both features. Rationale Statement Five commenters suggested changes to the rationale statement. One retail store, one grocers association and one meat association recommended that since all meat and poultry sold in commerce was inspected and passed by either Federal or State authorities, FSIS should permitted the following on all products, ``This product was inspected for your safety.'' These groups suggested the second sentence be changed to ``Food products must be handled and prepared properly to prevent potential illness.'' This would emphasize the positive rather than negative aspects of proper food handling. In addition one commenter suggested the option of a singular ``meat'' or ``Poultry'' label. Two consumer groups suggested that the rationale statement did not appraise consumers of the true threat bacterial contamination poses and may even give consumers a false sense of confidence about the safety of the product. Suggested change included eliminating the first sentence of the rationale, the use of a ``warning,'' mentioning the possibility of death, and adding descriptions of the symptoms of foodborne illness. FSIS concluded that the proposed rationale statement strikes a good balance that will neither scare consumers away from meat and poultry products nor cause them to ignore risks of foodborne illness. Given that, and the overwhelming acceptance of the single label message which will reduce the likelihood of errors, no changes are made or further flexibility permitted in the final rule.
