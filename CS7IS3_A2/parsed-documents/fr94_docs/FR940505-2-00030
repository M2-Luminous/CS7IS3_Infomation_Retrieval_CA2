SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 10 CFR 205.282(b), notice is hereby given of the issuance of the Proposed Decision and Order set out below. The Proposed Decision sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $21,764.57, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Remedial Order that the DOE issued to Aptos Shell, et al. (Aptos) on December 14, 1981. Under the Remedial Order, Aptos was found to have violated the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations involving the sale of refined petroleum products during the relevant audit periods. The OHA has proposed to distribute the Remedial Order funds in a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of motor gasoline from any one of the gasoline retailers considered in the Aptos proceeding will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of refined petroleum products they purchased from one of the gasoline retailers during the relevant audit periods. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of 15 U.S.C. 4501, the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA). Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures. Commenting parties are requested to forward two copies of their submissions, within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice. Comments so received will be made available for public inspection between the hours of 1 p.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, except Federal holidays, in the Public Reference Room 1E&hyph;234, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585. Dated: April 28, 1994. George B. Breznay, Director, Office of Hearings and Appeals.
