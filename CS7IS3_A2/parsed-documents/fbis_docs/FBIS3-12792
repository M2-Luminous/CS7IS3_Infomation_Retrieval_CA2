That, he stressed, is the acceptable minimum. He praised the attitude of the Arab and Islamic groups and their full support for the PLO demands. It should be noted that the United States and the PLO were until yesterday evening trying to break the deadlock over the drafting of a Security Council resolution condemning the massacre. Two draft resolutions have been submitted to the Security Council since last Friday. One of them is a Palestinian draft resolution, supported by the Arab and Islamic states and also by some other states, requesting protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territory, in addition to condemning the massacre and being binding on Israel. The other is a U.S. draft resolution just condemning the massacre without any commitment. The council is supposed to have resumed its consultations last night. On the Palestinian draft resolution, al-Qudwah told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: Our position has, from the first moment, been that the council should convene officially and pass a resolution containing the following elements: 1. A clear and strong condemnation of the massacre; 2. Confirmation that the fourth Geneva Convention applies to all the occupied territory including Jerusalem; 3. A call for a UN presence in the occupied territory to provide protection for the Palestinian people there; 4. A request that Israel and the occupation forces take specific measures against the settlers, including disarming them. He added: "At the beginning the Americans insisted that a statement by the chairman would be sufficient, but now their position is gradually drawing closer to ours. We will not change our position because it is not a tactical position. We are asking for the minimum." In response to the U.S. position that what the draft resolution calls for in connection with the protection point is based on the Declaration of Principles on Gaza and Jericho and as such is an attempt to expand its scope prematurely, al-Qudwah said: "My understanding is that there is no qualitative difference between Gaza and Jericho and the rest of the occupied territory. There may be a differentiation only as far as the time factor is concerned, but that does not mean that there should be discrimination on the principle, particularly as the Declaration of Princples stipulates that it is a first step that would extend to all the occupied Palestinian territory." On early participation by the Security Council in measures not agreed on with the Israelis, as the Americans say, the Palestinian representative declared: "As far as we are concerned the Security Council was and remains the body solely responsible for anything connected with Israeli violations of the fourth Geneva Convention whether there is a peace process or not. This is based on the understanding we reached with former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker before the Madrid conference." He added: "We are not trying to find an alternative mechanism to the current peace process, but we stress that the council's role on matters which only it has the power to legislate or confirm should be preserved." On the reference to Jerusalem, he said: "The phraseology regarding it in the draft resolution cannot be changed at all because that is the same phraseology used in all the UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions since 1967. Any change would mean some kind of concession and acceptance of the Israeli position on it. Jerusalem is an integral part of the occupied territory and nobody can deny our right to it." He added: "As regards the claim that, having agreed to the postponement of the negotiations on the status of Jerusalem and the settlements, the Palestinians should drop their advance demands regarding them -- that claim is rejected. The legal status of the settlements is still the same, and there has been no political change that would make it incumbent on us to abandon our position on them. They remain illegitimate irrespective of when the negotiations on them take place. The same thing applies to Jerusalem, which remains an occupied territory regardless of when the negotiations on its final status take place."
