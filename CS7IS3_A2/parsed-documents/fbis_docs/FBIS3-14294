The delegation held two days of talks in Cairo with a Palestinian delegation led by Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, on ways of implementing Resolution 904, particularly with regard to providing international protection to the Palestinians in the occupied territories. A small Palestinian-Israeli drafting committee held a long session last night to formulate a comprehensive agreement on international protection arrangements in Hebron and the Palestinian police force in the city. An agreement between the two sides would open the way to resuming Palestinian-Israeli negotiations aimed at implementing the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement. The negotiations were discontinued on 25 February following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre.
