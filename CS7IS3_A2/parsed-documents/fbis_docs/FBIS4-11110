Sandino, for the Sake of Sandinist Unity" special Congress of the Sandinist National Liberation Front [FSLN]. On 19 July 1993, at a ceremony to mark the 14th anniversary of the triumph of the revolution, I made public an initiative to hold this special congress to consolidate and strengthen Sandinist unity, to ensure we are better prepared to support popular struggles, and to prepare ourselves to win the 1996 nationwide elections. Those who were at Revolution Square supported it and the Sandinist Assembly approved it later. These days there are discussions on the basic documents dealing with crucial issues of our program and our statutes that have in turn enriched them, with proposals and resolutions presented at territorial and sectorial assemblies. The debate is deepening and opening itself up to others to the extent that we fully welcome the FSLN and FSLN members, those who committed themselves to fight -- once and a thousand times -- against the Somozist dictatorship and to defend the revolution, and those who -- at one time or another -- have felt isolated, relegated, neglected, and even attacked. We want them to join the process of discussions at the Congress to turn the FSLN into a more participative political organization with a renewed commitment to the ideals of Augusto Sandino, Rigoberto Lopez, and Carlos Fonseca, by participating in the struggle to defend a national, democratic, and popular program for all Nicaraguans. Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: These lines were written amid a debate that has at times turned vehement and passionate. The debate is there, it is in full force and is charged by politics and ideology. It should produce ideas that will enrich and strengthen Sandinist thought, actions, and unity. Some of us Sandinists have had the privilege of experiencing three great periods of Nicaraguan history. In the 1960's and 1970's we were part of a guerrilla movement whose strength was based on our zeal and devotion, and our willingness to sacrifice even our lives. We were in the government beginning on 19 July 1979, that is, in power and facing another assault by Yankee expansionism and imperialism, which financed and organized the war against Nicaragua. Renew and Modernize the FSLN On 25 February 1990, before Nicaragua and the world, we gave the best example of personal selflessness and democratic exercise when we admitted defeat in the elections and handed over the government. We reaffirmed our respect for the popular vote. Today we are a political revolutionary front that must adapt to new conditions. We must promote change in favor of the people in order to successfully wage popular struggles -- and in due time -- win the nationwide elections of November 1996. Amid these circumstances, we must renew and modernize the FSLN and deepen democracy within Sandinism by promoting changes that will allow us to make contributions -- amid the new situation -- to the freedom struggles of the people who are rebelling against sustained growth policies, sustained consumption, and sustained exploitation that industrialized capitalism or "wild capitalism" is imposing on the world today through its neo-liberal philosophy. As we cling to our roots, culture, history, and principles, we have the obligation to promote an alternative program that will meet the hopes of the Nicaraguan people who are poorer and more debased than ever today. We must find a project for all Nicaraguans who realize that in order to guarantee stability we must ensure the well-being of a great majority of citizens who are roaming the countryside and cities, because they are unemployed, hungry, and desperate. All this will demand clear definitions of our stand toward the policies of the current Nicaraguan Government. We want to consolidate positions and overcome contradictions and confusions that a lack of definition has provoked among the ranks of the FSLN and the Nicaraguan people. Article 4 of the Constitution's chapter on fundamental principles states: "The Nicaraguan people have created a new state to advance their interests and guarantee their social and political accomplishments. The state is the people's most effective instrument for eliminating all forms of human domination and exploitation, giving impetus to the nation's material and spiritual progress, and making sure that the interests and rights of the majority will prevail." Four years into the present government, this principle has systematically and grievously been negated. The social and financial adjustments have become the government's main instrument for denying the people this constitutional principle. The defective judicial system accompanies the policy of dispossessing thousands of Nicaraguan families. Unemployment, poverty, and crime rates get higher and higher in an upward spiral that gradually negates the people's most fundamental rights. For this reason, the Sandinist Front must wage a firm and active opposition struggle against those governmental policies that undermine the people and negate the Nicaraguan Constitution's fundamental principles. In this struggle of the Sandinist Front with the people, we must respect the methods of struggle adopted by the unemployed, those who suffer hunger, those who feel grieved by government policies. This civic and popular struggle, which is determined by the affected sectors, must be backed by the Sandinists, in the street, the National Assembly, and in a dialogue with the government. It is clear that it is necessary to access the government to gain a better position in the defense of the people's interests. It is also true, however, that the vote of the Nicaraguan people is the only way that we Sandinists can gain access to the government. For this reason, we also have to strengthen the people's awareness and win the 1996 elections with the citizens' conscientious vote for a broad democratic, popular, and national program, which guarantees the right for property in all its forms for all Nicaraguans, a program that proposes alternative economic policies vis a vis neo-liberalism. Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: To fight with the people and win the elections, we need a revolutionary party renovated in its members' commitment, with the power of Carlos Fonseca and the heroes and martyrs who gave their lives in and for the Sandinist Front, whose duty it is to stand firm and raise aloft the banners of the people and the national dignity against the onslaughts of neo-liberalism and neo-imperialism. Sandinist brothers, Nicaraguan brothers: In this process of Special Congress debates, we must protect Sandinism's unity, which reaches beyond legitimate personal interests, views, and opinions. Just as we maturely experienced the baptism of fire of a institutional democratic system four years ago, at present we have the moral duty of participating in the democratic exercise as members of the great Sandinist family. The debate is open. Ideas flow powerfully. To the extent that we can listen to one another, refrain from taking positions of force, and take a consensus essential to reinforcing unity, the Sandinists will become stronger and the people will attain more victories. Sandinist brothers: It is your decision. You are the Congress. For the Sandinist unity, everyone to the Augusto C. Sandino congress. [Issued] Managua, 15 April 1994. [Signed] The FSLN secretary general.
