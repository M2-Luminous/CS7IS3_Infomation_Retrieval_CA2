The president made this remark in Mexico City on the last day of his official visit during a breakfast with Latin American and Caribbean diplomats accredited in Mexico. [passage omitted] De Leon attended this breakfast with the officials who accompanied him to Mexico, including several ministers. He said his government is intent on establishing true democracy and preserving institutions. The president assured his government respects human rights, but that the armed conflict represents a constant threat to those rights. [passage omitted] The diplomats attending the breakfast showed great interest in De Leon's remarks. Some ambassadors posed questions at the end of the meeting with the Nicaraguan president; one was about the future dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army. [Begin recording] [Jose Ernesto Fonseca Pasos, Nicaraguan ambassador to Mexico] [Question indistinct] [De Leon] The reduction in the Army in our case is not (?feasible) [words indistinct] in general is not possible because even those countries supposedly without armies have them. Our Constitution clearly establishes its presence and that there should be only one army. It does not accept any other armed or unconventional group. For this reason, this topic has no reason for being. As for the first part, the Armed Forces have discussed a readjustment or even a reduction. We are conducting a study in line with the Guatemalan Army plans and the conditions that will exist. To be sure, the armed conflict has to end to achieve that. It is not possible to ask an army to shrink its size so long as subversion exists or an enemy exists within the country. Much has been said about the Civilian Self-Defense Patrols [PAC], and [words indistinct] that they should be disbanded. They are part of Guatemala's military defense. They are persons who have grouped together. Much has been said about the voluntary nature of these groups. The human rights ombudsman, who replaced me, recently conducted a survey, and the result was tremendously surprising in terms of the voluntary manner in which the members joined the PAC, which are currently called Voluntary Civil Defense Committees. A lot has been said about dissolving the PAC's because of the abuses perpetrated by some of their members -- which is true, I admit. I am aware of this and have issued instructions to the effect that when such abuses are perpetrated, when PAC members take advantage of their position and perpetrate illegal acts or crimes, they must be prosecuted as would any other citizen. However, it would be illogical and naive to eliminate groups that have prevented the progress of subversion. Many groups in Guatemala and abroad have called for the dissolution of the PAC's and I have always said that such a request is the result of either naivete or a desire not to hinder the progress of subversion. The PAC's have demonstrated to the entire world that it is possible to counteract and prevent the progress of guerrilla warfare, so much so that many countries are imitating them. Unfortunately -- and I say unfortunately because this sort of guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries -- they are imitating the actions of a people who, angered by their sufferings, their orphans, their lives, etc., have organized for preventive purposes. An Army in Guatemala, or anywhere in the world, would find it difficult to control the progress of terrorism, but already in those areas where these civilian groups have organized they have unquestionably contributed militarily to the defense effort and have prevented the progress of subversion. This is why, militarily speaking, the war against subversion has been won. The subversives have been militarily defeated. I would like to add, although the minister of defense will discuss this in greater detail, that we have already decided to establish PAC's in areas that are free of subversion. Two-thirds of our nation's territory is free of subversives and there are no PAC's in the remaining third. [sentence as heard] Therefore, the PAC's have gradually become committees of peace and development, they are very well organized and in the future could prove very advantageous, no longer with weapons but for the economic and social development of their communities. I would like the defense minister to expand on this issue. [Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez] [passage omitted] Concerning the dissolution, reduction, reorganization or retraining of the Army, I have certain views, Messrs. ambassadors, regarding the manner in which the Guatemalan Army should be reorganized once we have overcome the insurgent threat, and a bill to this effect will be presented to the president. The constitutional president of the Republic has already ordered the implementation of many of these actions, and besides fulfilling a constitutional mission, I believe this reorganization will allow for (?relocations) and the strengthening of certain areas, such as [words indistinct], which will be protected in a more effective manner and the Army will be able to exchange quantity for quality. These plans are already under way and include the educational systems at our military academy and our university or military training center. No one will be able to graduate as an officer unless he follows the curriculum [words indistinct] of a liberal education. No one will be able to take an (?advanced) course, let alone the General Staff course, if he does not have a bachelors or masters degree in any of the liberal arts. This plan, gentlemen, is already under way. However, this education system will also be extended to specialists and soldiers because our plan is to reduce time in service, to make military service truly voluntary, and to thereby preclude complaints. I am aware that at this time many of our plans for the Army bear the heavy burden of [word indistinct] and depoliticization, but this is because there is still an armed conflict in Guatemala. However, we have planned numerous improvements which include, pardon the repetition, an exchange of quantity for quality within the Guatemalan Army, which the president is aware of and which, moreover, he has approved. I will not speak any further because I do not want to take up any more of the president's time. Thank you very much. [end recording]
