He said Thailand has not supported the Khmer Rouge since the peace agreement was signed in Paris. [Begin Prasong recording, in progress] ...not supporting any party. Our support for the tripartite faction was suspended when the peace agreement was signed in Paris. Those people at the local level in Cambodia who are responsible for such allegations should think about making more constructive comments. Thailand wants to see reconciliation among the Cambodian people so that national reconstruction can be achieved. Comments that are not constructive only cause misunderstanding. [end recording] Touching on the Thai prime minister's upcoming visit to Cambodia, the foreign minister said they would discuss Thai-Cambodian relations with the Cambodian leaders. Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, meanwhile, granted an interview to reporters concerning the call made by Prince Norodom Sirivut, Cambodian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, for Thailand to clarify with Cambodia its position regarding the Khmer Rouge during the Thai prime minister's upcoming visit to Cambodia on Wednesday. Minister Surin said he did not think Thailand would make any clarifications, because the matter is over and Thailand's position is clear. Concerning the weapons arsenal, the deputy foreign minister admitted that Cambodia wanted the weapons left over in Thailand, but this is not the Thai Government's policy. [Begin Surin recording, in progress] ...support from outside. Whatever happened inside Cambodia, we never interfered. We support and recognize only one government; that is, the elected government in Phnom Penh. Concerning the leakage of weapons, this could happen. But we will try to correct the situation. The Thai Government has a clear position and has never deviated from that policy. You can be sure of that. And I believe the world in general has a correct understanding of that issue.
