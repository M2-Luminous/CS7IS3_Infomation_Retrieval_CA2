Now that Christopher has informed His Majesty King Husayn that measures are being taken toward lifting the siege of the Port of al-'Aqabah and acknowledged Jordan has incurred losses as a consequence, follow-through is needed to propel the peace process forward and to advance the cause of security and stability in a region plagued by turbulence and turmoil since the founding of the state of Israel. On the eve of Secretary Christopher's Middle East tour, it is worth making this point: If we are to sell true peace to the peoples of the region, then promises of peace, stability, and prosperity need to be converted into physical realities based on justice and Israel's compliance with what it takes to bring peace to the region; namely, the UN resolutions granting the Palestinian people's right to repatriation and mandating the withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories. The pessimism and frustration that has gripped the region since the negotiations got stuck on all tracks must be laid at Israel's doorstep. For, they are the result of the obstacles Israel has placed in the path of the efforts to promote a just settlement under which Palestinian and Arab rights are assured. If the negotiations are to emerge from crisis and a regional explosion is to be averted, Israel's regimen of terror, aggression, and repression of innocents must end. It is hoped that Christopher's tour will set out to achieve these goals and that the removal of the blockade on the Port of al-'Aqabah will be followed by other steps. One of these would be to shift the pressure on the Arab parties involved in the negotiations to the party where it rightly belongs -- Israel, the true enemy of an equitable peace and stability.
