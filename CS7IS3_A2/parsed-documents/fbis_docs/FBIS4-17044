Hanni said that the agreement will include both Estonian nationals that live in Belarus and have Belarusian citizenship and Belarusians that have Estonian citizenship. She said that the reason the agreement had to be concluded was that there were not enough Belarusians in Estonia to grant them rights according to the law on cultural autonomy, which gives bigger minorities in Estonia rights to found cultural organisations, open schools etc.
