The agenda includes the adoption of a new statute and the party's program, the report on the work of the party in the past period, and the election of the president and the Central Fatherland Administration. Party president Vojislav Seselj submitted a report on the work of the party. Dragoljub Stankic reports: [Stankic] The 672 delegates and 358 guests of the SRS from the Republic of Serbia, the Republic of Montenegro, the republic of Srpska, and the republic of Serbian Krajina tumultuously greeted the arrival of Vojislav Seselj, president of the Serbian Radicals. He submitted a report on the work of the party at the very beginning of the congress. Seselj spoke about the period starting with 1989, the revival of the Serbian national conscience, and the founding of the party in 1990, which was at that time called, as Seselj said, the Serbian Liberation Movement. The party then changed its name into the Serbian Renewal Movement, the Serbian Chetnik Movement, and finally the Serbian Radical Party in 1991. The civil war broke out. Many volunteers from the party went to defend the Serbian lands. About 70 percent of the Serbian ethnic regions have been defended in the republic of Serbian Krajina, and almost all Serbian villages in the republic of Srpska, Seselj stressed. Today, it is only possible to establish peace where the lines of the front are, Seselj said. His message to Radovan Karadzic was to declare the independence of the republic of Srpska and join the Republic of Serbia in a single state. This was greeted with applause. In the 1992 elections, the party was successful, but decided to support the minority government of the Socialists. A year later, the party embarked on overthrowing the government. As Seselj said, the party decided to do this not because of the wish for power, but because of the poor results, mistakes in the economy, and the flourishing crime. Seselj said he was satisfied with the election results in the republic of Serbian Krajina. He announced that the Radicals would form a coalition government with the Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina. At the end of his speech Seselj said that his message to the Socialists of Serbia and Montenegro was that he will not allow the return of ideological premises, which he thought were superseded. His message for the Serbian Democratic Party in the republic of Srpska was that he will not abandon the joint front for the defense of the Serbian land. His speech was followed by a discussion on the report. Nikola Poplasen, Rade Leskovac, Jovan Glamocanin, and many others have already spoken. The delegates are currently in a recess. When they return, they will, as expected, elect the president of the party by a secret ballot. There are seven candidates. The 50 members of the Central Fatherland Administration, a new political organ of the Serbian Radicals of all Serbian lands, will be elected by show of hand.
