Dokholyan: "Flight `In Armenian'"] [Text] The Air Force, one of the most important components of modern armed forces, is, for understandable reasons, a new thing for us. Up until recently we would look at military aircraft appearing in the sky overhead with an interest purely for the hardware itself. We now experience a conscious awareness that those intrepid souls up there are sons of Armenia, our boys. At first our joy was mixed with doubts: would Armenia, which lacks vital necessities of life, be able to handle such a burden? In spite of all this, however, on 26 July we celebrated the first anniversary of our Armed Forces. We are talking with Air Force Aviation Chief Col Aleksandr Abrahamyan. [Abrahamyan] In a structural sense we have essentially stabilized, and we are presently deploying our subunits. Instruction of young pilot personnel has also commenced. [Dokholyan] Military aviation in Armenia is a new thing. How have you resolved the problem of specialist personnel? [Abrahamyan] The fact is that we have started from scratch. Thanks to the efforts of our ministry, however, we received first-rate pilots, pilots who in the former Soviet Union had completed advanced training school. And we ourselves began training pilots locally. Many of these are today flying modern aircraft. We are now operating in Arzni, the Republic of Armenia Ministry of Defense Aviation Training Center. [Dokkholyan] Aviation, especially military aviation, is an expensive pleasure, as they say. And our republic is presently experiencing an economic crisis. I would imagine that this in all probability has an adverse effect on your work as well. [Abrahamyan] Yes, it does. There are many difficulties and basic problems. The government and ministry support us, however. We are allocated an adequate amount of fuel. Otherwise, we would not be able to perform military missions. [Dokholyan] What kind of living conditions do the pilots have? [Abrahamyan] The good news is that in our republic, as was the case in the former Soviet Union, they understand the importance of and give priority to aviation. Only 2 or 3 of our pilots have not received individual apartments. First on our list of tasks is to provide them with an apartment. [Dokholyan] Do you work in cooperation with CIS states, with the Russian Federation? [Abrahamyan] Of course we are working in that direction. Everything, however, depends on Armenia's financial solvency. There are also issues pertaining to internal matters: violations of military regulations, desertions, etc. We are endeavoring to eliminate such things. * * * In the course of an informal get-together with primary-rank enlisted personnel, the latter indicated that they were not so dissatisfied with economic difficulties and difficulties with daily life (although pay is extremely low) as they were upset by the demeanor of "money-possessing" young men (strange as it may seem, even such as these sometimes grace us with their service in our army). At times it is difficult even for command personnel to "communicate" with them. One of the noncommissioned officers came right out and stated: "A person with more money than you can shake a stick at comes and stands in front of you and tries to dictate special conditions for his son." It is a situation with which many of us are quite familiar. We encounter such phenomena all the time. The reasons for and the roots of this phenomenon are well known. The army is not an entity separate from society, and certainly it is subjected to the influence of the moral and ethical standards which exist in society. However, we should have kept such market relations out of the Armenian National Army at any price. In spite of all the problems and setbacks, however, the Republic of Armenia Air Force exists today. Col A. Abrahamyan replied as follows to the question: "If it became necessary today, could they defend our skies?" -- "It is our duty to do so." And it is the duty of all of us to strengthen the National Army.
