FR940426-1-00021 FR940426-1-00004 The proscription of ``inducements to purchase'' is less distinct. It covers activity that causes or is likely to cause another person to bid for or purchase covered securities. 72 One type of inducement, brokerage transactions that are solicited by distribution participants, is explicitly covered in the rule. 73 The distribution of research reports is considered to involve inducements to purchase. 72 See, e.g., Kidder Peabody & Co., 18 SEC 559 (1945) (purchases made as a favor to underwriter); SEC v. Burns, 816 F.2d 471 (9th Cir. 1987) (president of issuer made loan to another person to purchase covered securities). 73 Paragraph (a)(4)(v)(B). Rule 10b&hyph;6 allows offers to sell or the solicitation of offers to buy the security being distributed, i.e., sales in connection with the distribution. See Paragraph (a)(4)(vi). Question 1.13. What activities by distribution participants should be restricted? Should market sales by distribution participants be prohibited at any point during a distribution or in connection with certain types of distributions? 74 74 See, e.g., Hylton, Shearson Suspends Officials for Stock Trade Violations, N.Y. Times, September 6, 1991, at D1 (sale to depress closing price of stock that would be used to price an offering); U.S. v. Regan, 937 F.2d 823, 829 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied sub nom., Zarzecki v. U.S., 112 S. Ct. 2273 (1992) (sales of underlying securities to enhance attractiveness of convertible debt offering). Question 1.14. How should the dissemination of research be treated? What type of research should be allowable during the distribution and what type of research should be restricted? Is the manner in which research is used relevant? 75 75 See 1987 Release, 52 FR at 2995 n.17; 1982 Release, 47 FR at 42718 n.19. 2. Cooling-off Periods Some activities may present greater manipulative concerns depending upon when they occur during the distribution process. The most critical period of the offering is the period beginning immediately before pricing and continuing until the securities have come to rest in the hands of investors (i.e., when the distribution has ended). Thus, Rule 10b&hyph;6 has incorporated the concept of ``cooling-off periods.'' Generally, distribution participants and their affiliated purchasers may continue their trading and other market activities in the covered securities until the applicable cooling-off period begins, at which point they must suspend such activity until the termination of the distribution. The bases for applying cooling-off periods are: (1) Restrictions on bids and purchases during the entire distribution period could unnecessarily distort the market for the offered security; and (2) The effects on the offered security's price resulting from distribution participants' market activities should dissipate within a period of time. The cooling-off periods thus are intended to permit supply and demand forces independent of the market activities of persons with manipulative incentives to establish the market price of the covered securities at the time the offering is priced and when they are being sold to investors. The cooling-off periods also provide guidance to distribution participants as to what period of time is required between the cessation of their market activities (which may have increased or maintained the market price of, or involved substantial trading activity in, the covered securities) and sales to investors. 76 In this context, rather than requiring individual broker-dealers or syndicate managers to determine when to taper off and cease their market activities, the rule supplies uniform guidance. 76 See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3056 (October 27, 1941), 11 FR 10984 (Opinion of SEC General Counsel). Rule 10b&hyph;6 uses market-related criteria to fix the lengths of the cooling-off periods, which are two, five, and nine business days prior to the ``commencement of offers and sales'' in the distribution. For stock with a minimum share price of $5.00 and a public float of at least 400,000 shares (``$5/400,000 Share Test''), the cooling-off period is two business days. For all other securities, the cooling-off period is nine business days. A minimum price per share requirement was viewed as an appropriate criterion in light of the generally greater volatility of low-priced stocks, while a public float standard was viewed as providing a reasonable indication of the depth and liquidity of the market for a security. 77 The Commission also considered a test based on the security's price and public float as having ``the advantage of being relatively certain and easily determinable.'' 78 77 Paragraphs (a)(4)(v), (xi), and (xii). See also Letter regarding the Interpretation of ``Business Day'' (July 29, 1991), [1991] Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) Â¶79,751. 78 1983 Release, 48 FR at 10634. Solicited principal and solicited brokerage transactions by distribution participants are subject to the two and nine business day cooling-off periods. A five business day cooling-off period applies to the exercise of standardized call options on securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test, if such options were acquired after the person exercising the option became a distribution participant. This cooling-off period is intended to minimize the probability that purchases of the underlying security resulting from options exercises would occur during the two business day cooling-off period. No cooling-off period is available for inducements to purchase. No cooling-off period is applied to unsolicited principal transactions: the restriction on such activity begins as of the commencement of offers or sales. The Commission is aware of the perception that by curtailing distribution participant activity, even with the availability of cooling-off periods, the rule can affect adversely the ``normal'' trading market for a security. Because of this concern, the Commission recently adopted an exception to Rule 10b&hyph;6 and a companion Rule 10b&hyph;6A permitting ``passive market making'' (i.e., transactions that follow, but do not lead, the market) by Nasdaq market makers participating in distributions of Nasdaq securities satisfying the $5/400,000 Share Test. 79 79 Paragraph (a)(4)(xiv) and 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;6A, respectively. See Passive Market Making Release. Question 1.15. Do the fundamental principles underlying the cooling-off periods remain sound, and do they provide sufficient assurances that a security's price is based on a market free from the undue influences of distribution participants?
