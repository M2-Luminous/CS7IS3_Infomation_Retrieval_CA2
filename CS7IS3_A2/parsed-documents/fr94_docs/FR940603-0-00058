FR940603-0-00058 FR940603-0-00025 Environmental Correlates to Right Whale Distribution in the SEUS : Environmental features that have been correlated with the distribution of northern right whales throughout the SEUS include water depth, water temperature, and the distribution of right whale cow/calf pairs and the distance from shore to the 40-m isobath (Kraus et al., 1993). The average water depth at sighting was 12.6 m (SD = 7.1). This shallow water preference is consistent with that recorded for southern right whales with calves (Payne, 1986). Also, the significant correlation between the distribution of northern right whales and the distance from shore of the 40-m isobath (referred to as the inner (0&hyph;20-m) and middle (20&hyph;40-m) shelf by Atkinson and Menzel, 1985) indicates that right whales in the SEUS are using the nearshore edge of the widest part of the broad shallow-water shelf characteristic of the Georgia-Florida Bight. The inner shelf is dominated by tidal currents, river inflow, and interaction with the coastal sounds. The middle shelf, which is dominated by winds, has less interaction with the coastal environment but is influenced on the outer margins by the Gulf Stream (Atkinson and Menzel, 1985). This use of the inner and nearshore-middle shelf area by right whales may provide maximum protection from the wave action that occurs over the outer margins of the shelf. Therefore, the occurrence of cow/calf pairs in coastal waters of the SEUS may be due, at least in part, to the bathymetry that affords protection from large waves and rough water. The strong winds and offshore wave activity in the winter SEUS is minimized nearshore by the relatively shallow, very long underwater shelf (extending almost 105 km offshore) (Kraus et al, 1993). The average temperature of 30 ’ blocks of latitude where right whales have occurred is significantly cooler than those blocks of latitude within the SEUS where right whales were not observed (14.5 ○C vs. 18.5 ○C) (Kraus et al., 1993). The inner shelf is not affected by the Gulf Stream during the period when right whales are present; therefore sea-surface temperature decreases as one moves from the Gulf Stream towards shore. It is difficult to separate the effects of temperature from depth and proximity to shore, but sighting data indicate that northern right whales clearly prefer a band of relatively cool water (10&hyph;13 ○C) within the SEUS. This band is affected by the nearshore processes, including cooler freshwater runoff and discharge, as described in several chapters of Atkinson, Menzel and Bush (1985). Although little information is available on right whale physiology, it is hypothesized that the metabolic rate of the whale is affected by water temperature (Kraus and Kenney, 1991). The cooler, coastal water may provide right whales with the optimum thermal balance for calving by cooling the female at a time when offshore, Gulf stream affected warmer waters may be too warm for a female with maximum fatty layers prior to parturition and nursing. At the same time, the coastal waters may be warm enough not to cause problems for a neonate, considering that the insulating layer of a neonate for the first few weeks is minimal, as compared to the adult. Courtship activities have been observed throughout most of the range of the northern right whale, except within the SEUS (Kraus, 1985). Activities That May Affect Essential Habitat Northern right whales are no longer observed in certain areas where they once were found, such as Delaware Bay, New York Bight and Long Island Sound (NMFS, 1991). The absence of right whale sightings in these areas may be due to several factors, including: Increased human activities, habitat degradation, insufficient quantities of prey due to habitat or natural alterations in the physical environment, extinction of an independent breeding group that used these areas or contraction of the species' range as the population has decreased (NMFS, 1991).
