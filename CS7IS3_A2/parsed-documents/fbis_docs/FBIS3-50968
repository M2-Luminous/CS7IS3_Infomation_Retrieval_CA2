The measures include an exhaustive review of the baggage of all the travelers entering the city by land or air. The municipality will also establish an emergency telephone service to protect citizens in case of attacks. "It is not a matter of militarizing the metropolis or frightening the citizens. These are only measures to prevent attacks such as those that have taken place in neighboring cities," Regent (Mayor) Manuel Aguilera Gomez stated. He warned that officials who check baggage will not be allowed to violate the people's right to free movement "because we cannot allow individual guarantees to be trampled upon due to a transitory situation." In addition, police surveillance will be reinforced at schools, places of public assembly and recreation, public transportation centers, sewage an potable water treatment plants, and electricity plants The mayor commented that approximately 20 bomb threats had been received at several government offices, private firms, and newspaper offices between Friday and Saturday, all of which turned out to be false alarms. EL NACIONAL has reported that the Judicial Police took 90 Chiapas residents into custody for questioning. The people arrived in Mexico City on Sunday, supposedly under contract by a firm. The police released them 16 hours later.
