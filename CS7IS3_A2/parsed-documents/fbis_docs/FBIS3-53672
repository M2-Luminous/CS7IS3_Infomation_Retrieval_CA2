They will also lay the foundations for a new U.S.-Syrian relationship as important as Egyptian-U.S. relations, if not more important. President al-Asad has never opposed a settlement, otherwise he would not have gone to Madrid under a formula much smaller than the international conference formula proposed by the late Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev. But he wanted something much more than a settlement. He wanted a stronger relationship with Washington, which is now the sole superpower in the world. He aspires to a new regional role through this relationship -- which explains his agreement to participate in the bilateral negotiations arising from the Madrid formula, and his refusal to participate in multilateral regional negotiations. What is certain is that President al-Asad must have encountered satisfactory answers from the U.S. President to many of his demands in this connection for him to agree to full normalization with Israel, which means open borders and a diplomatic and trade exchange in return for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and the presence of U.S. observation forces there. The Geneva meeting -- which lasted five hours, of which 90 minutes were devoted to a closed meeting between the two leaders without the accompanying delegations -- was the culmination of the previous agreements reached during U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's tours of the region, the most recent of which was last month. It is unreasonable to accept the theory that the understanding was reached in Geneva. Because there was insufficient time to discuss details of complex regional and local issues. The time was sufficient to bless the new agreements and scenarios reached and to tackle what could have been points of disagreements in previous talks. It is wrong to rush to make definite judgments based on a quick reading of some press statements made after the historic meeting, or to interpret some phrases in different ways. Patience helps here to determine the truth. The coming days will reveal many details, whether during the bilateral negotiations and through the positions of the parties participating in them, or through the Syrian Government's positions on numerous matters, especially the opposition to the Gaza-Jericho agreement and ways of dealing with the PLO and the factions opposed to it. Theoretically, after the Geneva meeting all disagreements between the PLO leadership and the Syrian Government should disappear. This is because everyone is now rallying under the banner of the U.S. settlement and has agreed to normalize with Israel and to deal with its government as an original party in the region, and no opposition to this new Palestinian-Syrian orientation has any place in Damascus, at least in the foreseeable future. If this theoretical assumption is correct, the "veto" expressed by the Syrian Government against coordination with the PLO should be lifted after the Geneva meeting, and contacts should resume between the two sides at the highest levels in order to benefit from the new agreements so as to reactivate the peace process on all fronts, especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track, which experienced obstacles and deliberate delays in the run-up to the Geneva summit. Damascus -- which led the Arabs to the war, disagreed with those whom it thought were for a settlement, and allied itself with anyone who opposed it -- finds itself today in a new position at the head of the camp of peace and normalization with Israel -- which will give rise to numerous questions about its old alliances, especially with Iran, and its old hostilities toward Iraq. Will we see Iraqi-Iranian rapprochement against the new Syrian role, or Iraqi-Syrian rapprochement against the clear Iranian hostility toward peace and normalization with Israel?! The coming days will be full of surprises, and perhaps full of the political contradictions for which the region is known.
