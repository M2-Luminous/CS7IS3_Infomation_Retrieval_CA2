Vishnevskiy, A. Maksyuk, V. Aloyan, V. Lebedev, and D. Babich: "Tanks on the Move in Alma-Ata?"] [Text] In addition to the bemedaled veterans, armed military details were to be encountered at all Alma-Ata's [Almaty's] intersections on Victory Day. An unpublicized state of emergency has been introduced in the Kazakhstani capital. Rumor has it that this was due to an attack on Bulat Abilov, president of the Kazakhstani firm Butya. According to other information, the reason was the escape of two convicts. The MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] attributes it to the complex crime situation in Kazakhstan. A city crime-fighting staff has been formed in Alma-Ata. It will operate until the capital of Kazakhstan becomes a safe city. All hotels, hostels, and suspect apartments are being checked over. In the last two days alone 11 kg of opium worth around $55,000 have been confiscated. All urban transport routes have begun to be "processed" as of yesterday.
