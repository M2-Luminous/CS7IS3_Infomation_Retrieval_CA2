Mr. Lamassoure was to complete a three-day tour of the region in Riga (Latvia) on Saturday 22 January, following his visits to Tallinn (Estonia) and Vilnius (Lithuania). The French minister, who had originally not planned to make the tour until the spring, finally decided, after the Russian elections and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's emergence, to bring the visit forward to "try and reassure the Baltic states and convey to them our solidarity at a time when they could be frightened by what they are hearing from Moscow." The French minister was able to gauge at first hand the concern of his interlocutors (not to mention their youth: The Estonian prime minister is 35 years old, and his foreign minister is 27) in the light of recent statements made by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on the subject of the regions, which include the Baltic states, and "which over the centuries have constituted the sphere of influence of Russia." These statements -- even if they have been denied -- added to those of the Russian nationalists, who feel that they have the wind in their sails, show glimpses of a rebirth in Russian imperialism which gives the Baltic states constant cause for concern. Notion of `Close-by Foreign State' In addition, many Baltic leaders consider that certain Western powers, and in particular the United States, implicitly show too much complacence with regard to Moscow's favorite "close-by foreign state" notion. Estonian President Lennart Meri told us on Friday 21 January: "If you accept this Russian notion of the close-by foreign state, then one day it will be extended to France itself...." He added that all indications were that Catherine the Great's imperialist dream had not deserted Moscow: "That is the tragedy of Russia, which has always believed that it had a special mission for the world. This vision is very popular today with the Russian generals." He continued by saying that now there is a great threat of Russia trying to make people forget its domestic problems "by rallying the Russian people around a nationalist flag." At the risk of using "language that is too romantic," Mr. Meri stressed the fact that Europe's problem was not, currently, a question of military strategy but more of a moral problem: "Does Europe still have the will to remain European? Here we are in Europe's front line, but for a front line to be solid we need to feel that behind us we have a Europe that wants to remain faithful to its guiding principles." In Vilnius, former President Landsbergis also stressed to Mr. Lamassoure the need to "not harbor any illusions about Russia." He warned of "the Kozyrev-Zhirinovskiy doctrine" and spoke of his fear that one day Europe would again be split into areas of Russian and American influence. The French minister for European affairs tried to reply to these fears. He assured his interlocutors of France's desire to establish closer ties between Europe and the Baltic states and pointed out that France will play its part in ensuring that the planned trade agreement between the European Union and each of the Baltic states also has a political aspect, the content of which would be similar to the agreements concluded concerning the four countries in the Visegrad group (Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia), and Romania and Bulgaria.
