Asked to comment on the PRC Government's dissatisfaction with countries who have welcomed the Taiwan president, Phaithun said that the Chinese Government should understand this issue well because China itself recognizes Taiwanese investment. The Cabinet, however, has allowed talks with the Taiwan president on economic, cultural, and educational affairs. [Begin recording] [Phaithun] Yes, we have contacts through the private sector for labor issues. The government only extends its cooperation; this has nothing to do with politics. [Unidentified correspondent] Although there are only talks on economic issues, it could upset China. [Phaithun] Mainland China itself recognizes Taiwanese investment. Taiwan also has investments in Thailand. There should be no problem discussing economic affairs. [end recording]
