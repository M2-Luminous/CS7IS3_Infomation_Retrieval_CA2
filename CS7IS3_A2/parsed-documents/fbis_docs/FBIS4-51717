The incident took place during a party of nationwide Singha Beer distributors and their families totaling about 800 people. The governor and the officials concerned inspected the site of the incident. The governor said initial police inspection revealed that the explosive was C-4 and was aimed only at generating noise to frighten the party participants. Two people were slightly injured in the legs. The party continued after the incident. It was learned that the party organizers might have known in advance about a possible disruption plan and had asked for police protection. The governor said the incident is not likely to be politically motivated. Property and lives were not targetted, and it was merely an attempt to intimidate the party goers. However, the overall image of Phuket could be affected since the province will host several international conferences -- the ASEAN police chiefs conference during 1-5 May and the municipal league conference during 9-13 May. In any event, the provincial administration has taken precautionary measures for these events. The people need not worry.
