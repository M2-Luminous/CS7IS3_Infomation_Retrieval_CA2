He may only have got 20.5 per cent of the 19m votes cast in last month's elections, but for a party that carries the stigma and apartheid burden of the National party, it was an astonishingly high figure. Far from consigning himself to the political graveyard and a life of retirement in his Cape Town cottage, de Klerk is already planning a political comeback. "I believe my party is poised as the party with the greatest growth potential," he says, without a flicker of a smile. "We look at the future and in the party political sense -- while fully co-operating with the government of national unity -- we will be looking for a win in the next election." It is a statement which, coming lrom the leader of the National party, the same internationally reviled party that for more than 40 years deprived blacks of their civil rights and stripped the coloureds (mixed-race people) of their right to vote, seems bizarre, even absurd. Yet is it? In last month's election de Klerk's party won almost 4m votes, possibly as many as 1m of them black votes. Fewer than 60 per cent of whites voted for him, but probably as many as 70 per cent of coloureds and 63 per cent of Indians preferred the new, apartheid cleansed National party to any of the other 18 parties that sought their vote. I last interviewed de Klerk in his office in Pretoria a week before the election when his staff were hoping to achieve between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the vote, and some even talked about 35 per cent. Against that, his party's showing might be viewed as a disappointment. But it was still, he points out, the highest figure any opinion poll ever accorded them -- and with the national party machine he is now building, it can do better next time. "The National party has become the leading non-racial party in South Africa," he says, and it is true: the African National Congress's support was almost entire black, and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's support came from the Zulus of Natal and a number of disaffected whites. As such, insists de Klerk, the "Nats" should regain not only the white votes that went to the Democratic party as well as to Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party, keep control of the coloureds and Indians who are mostly Afrikaans speakers (and more anti-black than they were ever anti-white), and attract a growing number of aspiring middle-class blacks. For the moment, however, de Klerk, in London last week to deliver The Sunday Times Nobel Laureate Peace lecture to nearly 3,000 people at the Albert Hall, has the more immediate task of making the new government of national unity work. In the past fortnight he has handed over officially to Nelson Mandela and moved out of the state president's office suite once occupied by Smuts, Malan, Verwoerd and Botha. His new office will be a mirror suite on the other side of the same building, on the same floor as Mandela and only a short walk to the office of his fellow "executive" deputy president, Thabo Mbeki. The "executive" bit of the title, he says, has been recently added to emphasise the fact that the two deputies will play key roles in managing the new government. After the election Mandela took a brief holiday, leaving de Klerk and Mbeki in joint charge, and so far they have not come to blows. "We've already struck a very good working relationship," says de Klerk, and most observers believe that to be true, the two men forming a respect for each other in the months of tough negotiation that led up to the election. The two deputy presidents are now effectively the joint chief executives of South Africa, with Mandela assuming the role of non-executive chairman. They have not yet settled into a work routine, but have spent the hours and days since the election trying to thrash out a system of cabinet committees through which their powers will be exercised. Mbeki, like all the ANC, has no experience of government and seems prepared to be guided by his more seasoned partner. How long the smooth partnership will last under the strains that lie just around the corner is another matter, but de Klerk is putting an optimistic gloss on it. One of the key points, he insists, is that he is not a Mandela appointee. "I'm not there because I've been invited to be there. I'm there because the constitution says I've a right to be there. because 4m voters said they wanted me there. Even if President Mandela disliked me intensely, he would have had to accept me." Mandela, in fact, seems to hold him in even greater respect than Mbeki does, and although there have been some signs of friction between them over several of the cabinet appointments, all three of them seem determined to work together. The constitution, says de Klerk, insists that the president must consult his deputies on a whole series of important issues, notably appointments, and he will make sure that happens to the letter. "I see us being involved in the totality." The first real cabinet session takes place tomorrow with Mandela in the chair, flanked by his two deputies, and down the table the brooding figure of Buthelezi, who has been seen striding the floors of the Ministry of Home Affairs where he is in charge. This is where the first real tensions could surface. De Klerk has gone out of his way to keep Buthelezi informed about the way in which the cabinet committees are developing, seeking his support not as a minister but as the head of one of the three political parties that make up the government. Mandela, he indicates, has done the same and so far Buthelezi seems to be settling down to his life as a national minister, as opposed to his years of being chief minister in his own little fiefdom of KwaZulu. If Buthelezi, says de Klerk, is not drawn into the process of government, there would be a real danger that the cooperation of the parties within the cabinet would falter. "There is a commitment from me and from Mandela to make that work." On the other hand, de Klerk and Buthelezi are allies against what could be the overpowering might of the ANC. "We are not there, and Buthelezi isn't there, to implement to the letter ANC policy," he says. "That would make a farce of the concept of a government of national unity."
