Shakhray tried to dispell fears of conservative lawmakers that the treaty may ruin the federative structure of the country and is an infringement on its territorial intergrity. The fact that Tatarstan had agreed to hold new parliamentary elections to the Russian parliament "is the recognition of the Russian sovereignty on the territory of the Republic of Tatarstan, as well as that Russian laws are acting there", he told lawmakers on Friday adding that "accusations of separatism against Tatarstan had also been lifted". December 12 elections in Tatarstan failed mostly because of the opposition of its leadership to them. However, Russia and Tatarstan then reached a compromise that the federation agrees to sign a bilateral treaty with its republic, on which the latter insisted, while Tatarstan's leadership would hold new elections to the parliament. The signing of the treaty became possible after the sides dropped their political and national ambitions and switched to concrete agreements to settle the disputes, according to Shakhray. It turned out that "it is possible to evade political tensions at negotiations", Shakhray said. The treaty does not raise the status of Tatarstan, he added. "Relations by agreements (between Russia and Tatarstan) is a mechanism of self-tuning of the Russian Federation, while federation for Russia is a way of democratic organisation of society which is the only possible way of the development of the multi-national people of Russia without a crisis", Shakhray stressed.
