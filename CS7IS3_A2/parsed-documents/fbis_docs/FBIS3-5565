His work to create opportunities for Malaysian businesses, in turn, may hold some lessons for Korean government officials and perhaps President Kim Yong-sam himself. Since the beginning of the year, Kim has said he will put top priority on boosting national competitiveness and urged his administration officials to spare no efforts to support businesses. Frequent overseas working trips low on official protocol are said to exemplify his efforts to achieve the goal of placing Malaysia in the ranks of the most advanced countries, with a per capita income of $16,000 by the year 2020. The Malaysian prime minister recently made such a trip to Korea with the sole purpose of business talks. His three-day private visit at the invitation of the Hyundai Business Group made Koreans realize again why he is called the "business premier." In December 1991, he had made a similar visit to Korea, also at the invitation of Hyundai. Mahathir arrived in a southern airport Saturday in a small private airplane, accompanied by only three Malaysian businessmen and no government officials. During his visit, he declined any protocol. Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong received and saw him off at the Kimhae International Airport in his capacity as former ambassador to Malaysia, not as the vice foreign minister. Mahathir inspected the group's auto plant and shipyard in the southeastern port of Ulsan. He checked a model of a small truck Hyundai plans to produce in a joint venture with a Malaysian business. He focused on business talks with Hyundai Chairman Chong Se-yong and other top executives of the group about the plan for the joint production of small trucks and another plan to order ships. A Hyundai official said Mahathir asked the group to keep his visit unpublicized so that he could concentrate on objectives. Besides the two business-only visits, Mahathir has made four other trips to Korea, including his first visit in 1980 when he was trade and industry minister. He made two official visits here as prime minister in August 1983 and in September 1990. Mahathir came to Seoul in May 1992 to speak to a meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council, a group of regional private economic leaders. A Foreign Ministry official said business trips by Mahathir should be a stimulus for Korean officials. The official, however, said, it is hardly imaginable for a Korean president in the near future to visit a foreign country at the invitation of a private business. "Korea is different from Malaysia in many ways, such as social atmosphere and people's attitudes," he said. There can also be a gap between words and attitudes of Koreans on the matter, the official said. "I don't think, despite what they say, that Koreans will accept it as natural for their president to visit a foreign country only for business talks with a private enterprise," he said. The official pointed out one thing that hinders Korean trade officials from going all-out to support a Korean business in overseas markets. In many cases, competition among Korean companies is fiercer than competition with foreign firms, he said. "The President has told us to be salesmen for the nation's businesses," the official said. "But whose products will we have to help sell if Korean companies compete with each other?"
