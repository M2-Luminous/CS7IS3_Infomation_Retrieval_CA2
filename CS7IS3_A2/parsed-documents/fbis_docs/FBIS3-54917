The declaration emphasizes that Deputy Lukashenka's report provides facts already known to the public. The accompanying report by S. Antonchik was more principled because it revealed the major causes of corruption -- the preservation of the old political system, an absence of economic reform, and chaos in the legislature. These factors provide favorable conditions for the ruling nomenklatura's embezzlements. The BSDH Executive Committee believes that the three-day debate on the issue demonstrated that all echelons of power, from village soviets to the Supreme Soviet and from local executive committees to the Council of Ministers, are involved in corruption. The Latin meaning of the word "corruption" is bribery, and it is no exaggeration to say that our officials are corrupt. This is the only explanation for the reign of crime, especially organized crime in the Republic. Officials and deputies bribed by dealers of the shadow economy cannot adopt appropriate laws and take practical measures to put an end to evil. On the contrary, they are interested in disorder and confusion, for this gives them a chance to grow rich at the expense of the people. The data on corruption in all echelons of power force us to draw practical conclusions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the Council of Ministers should resign. The demands for a coalition government and for holding early elections, voiced by democratic parties and movements, remain as urgent as ever. To ban people access to information on corruption in the organs of power, the Supreme Soviet majority made a decision to continue the session behind closed doors. The rest of the session turned into an ordinary row aimed at answering one question -- who stole more. At the session, some deputies insisted that the Supreme Soviet rescind its resolution adopted in October 1992. At that time, disregarding the demand of 380,000 electors to hold a referendum, the Supreme Soviet promised to expeditiously adopt a new constitution and hold early elections in spring 1994. Clutching to their posts, the communist majority in the legislature is ready to annul this decision. The closed session on 16 December was used for attacks on Stanislav Shushkevich and to voice further demands for his resignation. The BSDH Executive Committee calls upon all Belarusian residents to demand early Supreme Soviet elections in spring 1994 and support the initiative of strikers' committees to form a coalition government.
