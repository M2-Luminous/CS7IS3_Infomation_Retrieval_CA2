"We are working on all these cases in close contact with head of the president's office Sergey Filatov," Stepashin added. Some people who established contacts with foreign intelligence officers, have been released from their posts. According to Stepashin, 20 people were arrested on espionage charges in 1993. Several dozen more espionage cases are still under investigation. Stepashin specially stressed that, apart from countries outside the former Soviet Union, the Baltics and countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States with which Russia has an understanding on refraining from intelligence operations against one another, are actively engaged in intelligence work against Russia. The deputy director confirmed that Russian security officers arrested last summer five Georgian spies fulfilling intelligence tasks. An Estonian intelligence agent was detained in the Pskov region. Apart from all else, he committed a grave criminal offence -- a murder.
