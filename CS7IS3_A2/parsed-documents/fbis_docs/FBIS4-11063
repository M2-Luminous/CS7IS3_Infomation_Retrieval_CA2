The "blue helmets" are now in Nairobi in UN service, and are awaiting orders before returning to their country. The Uruguayan Army public relations office noted that the United Nations was reducing its personnel in Rwanda, and that a small mission alone would remain. Another four Uruguayan officers, among the 25 Uruguayan officers who were acting as observers in Rwanda, are in the interior of the country and in border areas, ready to leave for Uganda. Two Uruguayan officers were injured in Rwanda two weeks ago by a machine-gun burst shortly after the tribal fighting began. The two injured officers, who are out of danger, have also been evacuated by the United Nations. The Army reported that another five officers had left for Uganda before, and that a similar number was in Montevideo on vacation when the conflict broke out, and received orders to not return to Rwanda.
