To ensure the quality of listed companies, the securities authorities now require enterprises to accept a six-month-long coaching by relevant departments before they publicly issue and list shares. The coaching programme is intended to help enterprises convert their operations to those of shareholding companies, said Sun Xiaoliang, president of the China Shareholding Company Consulting Co. Sun noted that shareholding has spread rapidly in recent years. By the end of 1993, 189 State companies had become listed companies. But some have not substantially changed their operational systems. Instead, they still conduct business under the original system and regulations. According to the initial instruction plan, said Sun, the coaching period will be divided into two stages. The first stage is to be finished before companies issue shares to the public. This stage will focus on establishing new corporate systems that will make the enterprises responsible for their financial losses and profits. The second stage, to be completed before companies are listed, will mainly examine the newly established corporate systems to ensure that they are put into effect, while studying problems in how they are run. As to what kind of institutions are qualified to coach enterprises, Sun thinks they should have the following characteristics: Firstly, they should understand precisely the purpose of the reform of the State economic system. Secondly, they should be quite familiar with the substance of the various economic reforms. Thirdly, they should fully grasp the policies, regulations and details of the modern corporate system. Finally, they should have experience in helping enterprises transform their operational systems. The institutions' qualifications should be formally examined by the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.
