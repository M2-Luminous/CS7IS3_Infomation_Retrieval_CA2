Pakhomov is quoted in UKRAYINA MOLODA] [Text] Yuriy Mykolayovych, our State has entered the next stage of its transformation. This time this stage is related to elections of the new Parliament which, one hopes, will approve a new Government, and the latter will be pulling the reform cart further. However, who these people will be and whereto they will be pulling is a problem with a lot of unknowns. At least one does not want the cart to be pulled in all directions, which has been the case so far, so as a result the cart has been oscillating rather than moving. But apparently the blessed moment has arrived when one can "stop and look back" to understand where we have found ourselves and where we are going. - First of all I would like to say that everything is going as planned. - ?.. - Well, this is a special plan that no particular person approved, but according to the plan everything is happening as irreversibly as a certain plant grows out of a certain seed and a different plant grows out of a different seed. January 1, 1992, the Rubicon had been crossed, and objectively inherent processes began unwinding... - In other words, you mean price liberalization. - Yes, and as far as the implementation of this project is concerned I cannot even give the garland to anybody in Ukraine or in the CIS. And not because the project had no adherents. Quite the opposite, it hardly had any opponents. And those who understood that the project was ruinous to Ukraine were more realistic than Don Quixote and did not take to fighting windmills. The more so that the "windmills" were portraying these folks almost as enemies of the people or at best as conservatives. And as far as the project we have been implementing in recent years - one cannot even call it an International Monetary Fund project. It is a version of one of IMF directions. This model has its peculiarities. It was developed for certain debtor countries in Latin America - countries that don't have a highly developed industry, science and education. Then big capital buys up their mineral resources and land, and rapid development begins. The land's wealth slips away, while financing -somebody else's capital - comes in. And the country is surely, if not for good, trapped in debt bondage, and the people become impoverished. Still, in undeveloped countries this model has rather limited capability of destruction, moreover, there is development, albeit one-sided. But the story is different when such a model is thrown over a country with a highly developed technical basis and high scientific potential - the model's destructive force increases substantially and yields terrible results. Liberalization, which the model envisages as the most important task, begets wide-scale inflation and with it the reign of momentary and loss of strategic interest. Science, state-of-the-art technology, basic education - they are all rejected as unnecessary and are rapidly destroyed. This especially happens in countries where the State sector rules and the production and technological space is deformed. The main thing is the model has not brought prosperity to any country that adopted it. They are all debtors, all of them experience, one way or another, recession and lose their education and S&T potential (if any). There is an entire history of countries' resistance to this model. In particular, Japan has blossomed not due to but in spite of this model. Southeast Asia countries, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, and now Malaysia also have rejected this model. And at the time so did the post-WWII Europe. Unlike us, the maximalists, the 1917 people ("we will burn to the ground, and then..."), the wise Europe did not allow price liberalization for 10 to 15 years. The free market pricing mechanism only began working as the necessary conditions were being created, first of all mastering and widening the range of competitiveness of their industrial and agricultural products, although under the Common Market conditions new restrictions on all of this were imposed. A prominent reformer Erhard (FRG) had started not only with a monetary reform, but also with directives. Acting a "Soviet way" he renewed severed contacts and by directives forced economic mechanisms to spin. There was planning there - at a macroeconomic level. And only when everything had been spinning did the economy begin transition to the market regulation mode, and only then were prices freed up. By the way, in Japan almost until recently rice had been distributed on a plan basis. Price liberalization began in 1984. And this was accompanied by strict regulation and monopolization of major industries. Powerful corporations, with the State standing above them like a cat above a mouse. This is how they had shot forth - under State protection, by concentration of effort and prevention of chaos. One of Ukraine's, as well as Russia's, peculiarities is an ugly structural and production space. Prices and the entire financial mechanism had been "fitted" to this ugliness and deformed accordingly. The balance demanded correction, but via technical modernization rather than via prices. And as far as "freeing up" prices, under those conditions these measures, being just the start, could only produce an explosive effect and ruin the economy. First one should have evened out the proportion of heavy and light industries, of MIC [military-industrial complex] and "civil" sectors (the MIC is an immovable rock that can wreck any reform). One should have gotten rid of multiple production structures which included everything - from archaic structures of the late 19th century to supermodern technologies the world did not even suspect existed. In other words, our economic structure first should have had to undergo internal transformation through pre-market structural changes, whereas the freeing up of prices resulted in paralysis of the economy. Hence the crisis of payments, clots, the recession, barter and other distortions. And now we cannot do what we could and should have done before. There can be a way out, but one must use different methods - surgical ones. - It was not our initiative to start price liberalization. So did we have a choice and was the Government able to actually correct anything under these conditions? - The foundation for adopting this destructive for us model had been laid as early as during the M.S. Gorbachev time. It is then that the criminogenic revolution had begun and economic power shifted from the State to a legalized shadow economy. It is then that the wave of liberal market euphoria had risen, and the people were told to expect a miracle from completely unlimited economic freedom. Ideas of statehood and its decisive role in the transition to market were rejected. Instead of ideas of State renewal and market transformations slogans "The less of the State the better" were reigning. And we finally had found ourselves in a wild stream of market chaos. This was not a confession of modernity but rather of the passing archaic market. And those who looked innovative were in essence conservatives. Because the modern market is an integral combination of market and State forces. - So what is one to do now - loose heart? "Don't waste your effort, buddy..."? - Well, first of all every wild stream has an end. But, as long as it is carrying us, the faster the better. And the more market mechanisms we adapt for the economy the better hope there is that the necessary critical mass will be created in individual places. But there are things that have to be subdued. For instance, prices in the production sector will not stabilize on their own - they depend on technological skewness. Their explosive movement is not leading to an emergence of motives for improving the situation in the economy. At present prices in the consumer sphere have been stopped using a purely monetary method. But at what price? No credit had been extended, so no payments were made - and prices stopped. - Are you against monetary methods? - I am against excessive reliance on them. Besides, their action here is fairly limited to the consumption sphere while the sources of inflation are in production. There is a certain hierarchy of tasks and methodology for achieving them. Here is an example. First of all one must stop hyperinflation. And not in the consumption sphere but in the huge ocean of State facilities where expenses are increasing unceasingly, taking prices with them. Nothing can be done here by using direct regulation and command economy methods. It is necessary to form a new type of self-organization that would combine market centralism and market self-regulation. Market centralism is not just a certain action by the State. This is also centralization using financial institutions, as well as regulation of the economy on the part of transnational companies, industrial-financial groups, syndicates, corporations etc., which, by using their internal mechanisms and because of complex hierarchy and synchronous interaction, affect processes of price stabilization along complex technological chains. I have no doubt that in the end the very mechanisms of market centralization combined with market self-regulation will facilitate successful implementation of those individual anti-inflation measures that at present under the market chaos conditions have no effect. - So who will personify this strong authority? The President? The Verkhovna Rada? The Prime Minister? - He who controls executive structures. If it is the Cabinet, then not a pocket-size one but a Cabinet that has complete authority to tame the situation. - Similar to the authority Kuchma had a year ago? - Maybe even greater. - And an Erhard-like person at the helm? - The further down we fall the more chances there are such a person will emerge. Despair always begets new ideas and new leaders. So far there has been mainly demand for populists and destroyers... Among the creators of the new way there was no strong reformer, both in terms of ideas and strong character, as well as experience. I especially regret that we did not "recall" from Moscow Yuriy Yaremenko of Ukrainian extraction. As far as I am concerned he had no match within the former Union. Even Shatalin, a whimsical egoist, even he considered him a first-class figure of unattainable stature. - So how should such a person act? - First alternate centralist economic and purely market decrees on inflation quenching measures. Then the long-term mechanism of gradual straightening of structural and technological deformations and transition to market regulation comes into action. I would also like to caution our reformers against their belief that free prices will regulate everything by themselves. This too is ancient archaism and ignorance. At work in the world are mechanisms of market decentralization that cover entire industries and industry complexes. General Motors, as well as well-known German companies are multi-industry structures that include thousands of enterprises. Within chains of technological links, each depending on another, everybody who is ahead holds in check the trend to increase prices exhibited by the one who is ahead of him [per original]. This is how mutual regulation works. Competition, as well as a fight for profits are concentrated at end points of long technological chains. There are companies that represent industries of the entire world, not just of their countries. In these companies competition works in the end product at the world scene. - What do you think: will we have our house in order in about ten years? - It will happen sooner. What is destined to rise will rise as if it has been leavened. World capital immediately supports a rising country. It becomes extremely profitable for investment. We should only take the right steps.
