However, the negotiations should be held in the Trilateral Commission and in teams negotiating social guarantees. "S" is waiting for the RM to make a statement on the talks of the union and government experts. "Any delaying of the date will be treated by us as a breach of the agreement," we were told by "S" Experts' Team Chief Stanislaw Alot. Today [30 March] in Katowice, the "S" Protest Headquarters will convene. It is possible that, if the government rejects this information, we will decide to stage a general strike. In the context of the above-mentioned statement by Cimoszewicz, National Committee Press Spokesman Piotr Zak stressed that, "during talks with government experts, the `S' experts proved that all demands submitted by our union, except those demanding state property for citizens and the introduction of a 40-hour workweek, must be negotiated only between the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union `S' and the government." "By making a statement on the issue of representativeness, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a lawyer, justice minister, and deputy prime minister, demonstrated compromising ignorance. One cannot mistake the representativeness of a party in parliamentary elections for the representativeness of organizations of employers and employees--that is, trade unions," declared Zak. It is worth recalling that Cimoszewicz said in the television program "Panorama" that the issue of representativeness had not been resolved so far, and that "the labor world decides through its membership, paying subscription fees, and voting in parliamentary elections": "Because of that, the representativeness of "S" might be questioned. We are not doing that; we are treating this union seriously; however, we will not allow anyone to dictate anything to us," said Cimoszewicz. "S" demands that the representativeness of unions be observed, especially in the Trilateral Committee negotiations. "For the time being, the deputy prime minister is not the RM," stated Alot, and added that they are awaiting the government opinion. "The declarations were unequivocal: The information will be submitted at the next RM session." According to Alot, the "S" demands have been presented in a better form than the election programs of some parties: "We expected to be treated seriously."
