FBIS4-533 "drafr070_c_94030" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Details on Vote Counting, Announcement of Results Details on Vote Counting, Announcement of Results MB0804112894 Johannesburg THE STAR in English 8 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 MB0804112894 Johannesburg THE STAR English BFN [Report by E. Waugh and H. Grange] [Text] If all goes according to plan, South Africa's new government will be in office by mid-May. The dramatic moment will follow the May 6 election of a new president by the National Assembly and the formation of a multiparty Cabinet of national unity. It will be preceded by a series of important steps, triggered by the election. Below are the major stepping stones on the path to the future, gleaned by THE STAR from negotiating documents, the various agencies involved and political parties. -- On April 26 special voting will be held for people who are pregnant, aged, disabled or sick. South Africans overseas will vote on the same day. -- On April 27 and 28 ordinary voting will take place. April 27 will be a public holiday, and schools will remain closed on April 28. Voting hours will be from 7 AM to 7 PM over the three days. -- The votes will be counted at 1,200 counting stations around the country by electoral enumerators. -- It is expected that the counting should be completed within two days. In terms of electoral legislation, the results will not be announced earlier than 48 hours after the polls close -- and not more than 10 days later, by May 8. -- The national and provincial results are likely to be announced simultaneously by Independent Electoral Commission chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler in Midrand. The names of the candidates who will go to the national parliament and the provincial legislatures will also be made public at that time. -- The country will then enter the so-called "interregnum", where the current government will act as a caretaker until the new government takes power. -- The nine provincial legislatures will convene for the first time on May 5, while the National Assembly will be convened by the Chief Justice in Cape Town on May 6. The president will be elected by the National Assembly, and the provincial assemblies will elect their premier. -- Barring any delay in counting, the current Government will formally leave office on May 6. This will follow the convening by the new president, in conjunction with leaders of other parties with more than 5 percent of support, of a Cabinet of national unity. -- It is understood that the new parliament will continue sitting until May 10. At this point the new president will be inaugurated at a high-profile ceremony, due to be held in Pretoria.
