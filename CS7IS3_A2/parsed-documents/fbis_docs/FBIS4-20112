FBIS4-20112 "drweu082_a_94001" FBIS-WEU-94-082 Daily Report 27 Apr 1994 AUSTRIA Vranitzky: No Need for Higher Taxes in EU Vranitzky: No Need for Higher Taxes in EU AU2704121394 Vienna WIENER ZEITUNG in German 27 Apr 94 pp 1-2 AU2704121394 Vienna WIENER ZEITUNG German BFN [Unattributed report: "No Tax Increases"] [Excerpt] On Tuesday [26 April] Chancellor Franz Vranitzky stated that, not least because of the transition measures envisaged in the agreement between the Social Democratic Party of Austria and the Austrian People's Party, raising taxes will not be necessary in the eventuality of accession to the European Union [EU]. The planned financial means serve to support economic development and thus revitalize consumption. This automatically leads to higher tax revenues. Vranitzky also expects a positive effect on purchasing from planned stricter price controls to make sure that price reductions resulting from EU membership are indeed passed on to the consumer. The government has passed on to parliament the necessary documents to discuss accession to the EU in time so that both the government and the opposition have a "sufficient cushion of time" to discuss the matter. Thus, in his view, there is nothing that speaks against holding the referendum on 12 June, Vranitzky stressed. Austria has decided to hold the referendum before summer because his understanding of democracy indicates that the people's positive decision should be made by the time the EU Treaty, with the four new members, is signed at the end of June. No one should get the impression that the government is signing such an important treaty over the heads of the people, Vranitzky said. In deciding the amounts set down in the agreement to finance the balanced package for professional and social groups, the government relied on the official figures provided by the Economics Research Institute [WIFO]. Asked about the statements by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss to the parliamentary EU committee, Vranitkzy said that there is a "wide range of expert opinion"; he can, however only rely on official figures. Vranitzky thinks that the figures used in the agreement are appropriate, but he admits that it has been clear from the very start that during the first two or three years after accession to the EU there will be a difficult budget situation because of the economic stimuli, which, however, will also ease because of the better economic prospects in the EU. In Vranitzky's view, in addition to agriculture and manufacturing industry, the most important items of the agreement are improvements in labor law and health, the introduction of the European shop council, the reactivation of Article 39a of the Labor Market Promotion Law, and the promise to support the Austrian steel industry with money from the budget if analogous measures are introduced in the EU. Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] Chairman Joerg Haider sees his negative attitude toward the EU confirmed by the information provided by WIFO expert Fritz Breuss. In Breuss' view, the budget deficit threatens to rise to 135 billion schillings and tax increases cannot be avoided. In the view of Greens Deputy Johannes Voggenhuber, WIFO expert Breuss is telling the truth about the consequences of EU membership for the budget. The government is covering up this matter and exerting pressure on the WIFO, Voggenhuber said. WIFO chief Helmut Kramer distanced himself from Breuss' statements at the parliamentary EU hearing. "We did not arrive at these figures," Kramer said. This is the "private opinion of the expert." The Ministry of Agriculture also rejected Breuss' statement and stressed that the claim that 100 billion schillings are to be paid to Austrian agriculture over the next four years for adjustments to the EU is completely unfounded. In addition, the theory that solidarity leads to budget problems is untenable, nor can one speak of excessive compensation for losses in agricultural income. FPOe politicians Walter Meischberger and Holger Bauer called the chancellor's statements an "incredible faux pas" and said that the head of government is ridiculing WIFO experts. Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina and State Secretary Johannes Ditz also made it clear that Austria's accession to the EU will not entail higher taxes.
