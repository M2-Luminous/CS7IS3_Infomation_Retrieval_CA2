But Where Are the Laws?"] [Text] The State Duma has been working for just over three months now. Its deputies were elected in December -- a cold, overcast time of year, but, astrologically speaking, an extremely propitious one for the future deputies. After all, those born under the sign of Sagittarius are energetic, active, independent, like reading and traveling, and attain great success in their work.... Fine characteristics for a parliamentarian! That parliament has assembled professionals, and not afficianados of the "talking shop," can be seen, if by nothing else, by the recent parliament hearings on the federal budget. The executive can no longer get away with things that the Supreme Soviet swallowed uncomplainingly. Duma deputies decisively rejected the draft budget for 1994, explaining to representatives of the Ministries of Finance and the Economy and the Central Bank that it was simply ridiculous to discuss the budget without a breakdown by regions, and the ill-considered, insulting division of the regions into three classes could only provoke interregional conflicts. The discussion of problems connected with the budget showed that we should expect no improvement in our lives this year; funds are needed, and considerable ones at that, for stabilization. What holes must be darned in the first place? Just one example, made public at the Russian Academy of Sciences' Annual General Meeting: Science was promised 933 billion rubles [R] for 1994, but in the first quarter was given just R45 billion. Hence the Russian Academy of Sciences is sending the Duma a plaintive appeal for help. Nevertheless, the difficult dialogue between the two branches of power on budgetary problems kept within civilized bounds. After a businesslike exchange of opinions, having little in common with the old rivalry and disputes and still less the feuds and enmity so memorable in relations between the former executive and legislative branches, the government did not even insist on parliament's approval of the draft budget. There are not so many variations in the Duma's strategy, the last three months have shown. One or two continue to campaign for the course of reforms in their current experimental form. However, many are convinced that it is capable only of destroying, not of creating, and runs the risk of losing the people's trust. The second variation, whose mouthpiece in the lower chamber of parliament is above all Gennadiy Zyuganov and other Communists, is a call for the country to go back to socialism, to the USSR, and, therefore, to the administrative-edict system. Alas, history has already given them the opportunity to bring the country prosperity, and the results are well known. More and more deputies incline to another path -- the implementation of professionally executed reforms with the creation of a temporary system of social protection for those who have lost their jobs. A difficult path, but a realistic one that corresponds to the laws of the market. In this, the legislature's influence on the course of events could prove extremely great. Parliament, Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin stated, "firmly intends to undertake the legislative support of intelligent political, economic, and social reforms." The choice of priorities is also evidence of the thoroughness of these intentions. The 23 Duma committees -- effectively miniparliaments -- in which all factions and groups are proportionately represented have already got down to their direct task: creative legislation. This work is multifaceted, painstaking, and -- so it may seem to the bystander -- rather tedious. The deputies do not think so, engaging in expert analysis day after day and participating in open parliamentary hearings and discussions. The only pity is that not one of the problems discussed has yet found concrete embodiment in law. Such a low productivity level in the Duma is worrying. And if you take into account the fact that the Law "On the Status of the Deputy" has still not been adopted, it is extremely difficult to divine what consequences decisions adopted within the walls of parliament may have. Of course, we must also allow for the relatively short time of the Duma's existence -- just 100 days -- the confusion over its premises, and other organizational difficulties. But the fact remains that, apart from confidently executed "softening-up exercises" -- a highly sensible plan of legislative activity -- nothing else has been accomplished. The Duma inmates score real points perhaps only for helping the president to modify his savings compensation edict. And there is plenty of work to do. Finally our society is starting to realize that the only way to achieve political goals is through peaceful means, with the aid of elections and the will of the people. Boris Yeltsin singled out the evolving new climate of collaboration with the Federation Council and the State Duma. "Dialogue is developing," he said. "I will do everything incumbent on me to see that this constructive mood takes root, to see that parliament serves out its term and that the next elections take place at the appointed time and in conditions of stability and a higher level of political culture." Let us add to the president's words: It would be a good thing if the constructive mood were constantly reinforced by creation. So far the deputies born under the sign of Sagittarius, the Archer, "shoot" and hit target extremely rarely. The Duma is still only just beginning normal work, and its deputies have so far only managed to shine in foreign excursions and parliamentary hearings. To be fair, many such hearings are packed with content and interesting. In particular, one of the most recent hearings, devoted to local self-government reforms, deserves special attention. The issue was that, according to the norms enshrined in the Russian Federation Constitution, the organs of local self-government do not form part of the system of state power, and hence do not square with the existing structures of the representative and executive organs in the localities. The future law "On Local Self-Government," which should avoid this contradiction, could untie this knot. A timely notion, in our view, and a fine one, but it does not solve the problem. And yet, because of this problem in some regions local self-government elections were aborted, and in many localities they were postponed till the fall on the president's recommendation. The parliamentary hearing on the "Partnership for Peace Program," which dealt with the possibility of Russia's participation in the NATO program and attitudes to opposing military blocs, also provoked a great deal of dispute. The Duma's activity is directly linked to the resolution of vexed questions. All the same, deputies are obliged to justify the hopes of those who voted for them above all through consistent, effective legislation. In this area the 100 days of the Duma's power can clearly be assessed as a "flop." ...Three months of intense work have past. The drama of the election contest and the preelection pledges and promises of mounds of gold have evaporated, and have been replaced by routine parliamentary service, deprived of the halo of rallies and election campaigns. Fears that the Duma would plunge into factional polemics have proved unfounded. Of course, the preposterous antics of the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia introduce a shrill note into the polyphonic deputies' chorus. Although the Duma is not a place to settle personal scores, from time to time scandals erupt there -- the latest involving fisticuffs. Well, parliamentarians are also people, nothing human is alien to them. Of course, neither Shakhray's ripostes, Lukin's puns, or Zhirinovskiy's antics determine the import of decisions adopted by the Duma or influence the disposition of political forces in parliament. However, the relations of the Duma deputies, it seems to me, are extremely indicative. The disposition of forces in the Duma is a kind of reflection of the situation in society. For instance, the strengthening of the Communists' positions in the Duma, the vague rumors around the ultranationalists, in my view, by no means reflect dissatisfaction on the part of the Russian people over the fall of the communist regime or nostalgia for the past. The majority, it would appear, have already gauged the true price of "protest voting." People today are not frightened by the advent of the market, but by the degradation of the economy and the falling standard of living. They are far less concerned by the verbal interchanges between leaders of the multiplying parties and movements. However, "political work" and the factional get-togethers in the Duma will continue. I. Rybkin said that he sees nothing reprehensible in such activity. The main thing is that a limit is kept.... The time has come for people's deputies -- they must by no means forget who elevated them to the parliamentary benches -- to slow down their pace for a moment and look back at the road they have traveled in the first 100 days: a short road, but one packed with events both in parliament and in a great country which has acquired its own name once more. The formation of the new, or to be more precise, long-forgotten, body in Russian power is complete. For all its organizational difficulties, failures, and inconsistency, and a certain degree of passivity in its legislation, the Duma has not engaged in contemplation of life, but is dynamically trying to realize its innate intellectual potential. In order not to put the evil eye on, and so doom to an unenviable future, the present Duma, which is a mere 100 days old and was born under the size of Sagittarius, which promises success, it is being called a transitional parliament. Where will the transition lead deputies and those who stand behind them (the Russian people)? To oblivion once again, or to a dignified existence? However banal it sounds, much depends on us ourselves, on how demanding we are, on our civic activity. After all, we ourselves elected this parliament.
