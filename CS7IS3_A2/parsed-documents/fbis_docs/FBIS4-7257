Presiding over the monthly economic meeting to review the five- year "new economy" development plan at the Kwachon government building complex, Kim said construction of airports, roads and other public utilities should draw on private as well as public funds, like in Japan and Europe, because of the enormous costs. He reiterated the need for industrial peace, stressing that labor-management cooperation is a major factor in increasing a country's competitive power on the world market. Kim then instructed the ministers to act against inflation and the increasing balance-of-payments deficit, relax rules governing economic activity on a continual basis, and complete economic reforms within the year. "It's good to note the economy is recovering rapidly," he said, "but I'm concerned about the increasing balance-of-payments deficit and I want you to solve this problem not by reducing imports but by increasing exports." The chief executive also directed the ministers to take special steps to create an environment in which civil servants can work well, noting that some public servants wrongly think that the harder they work, the greater their losses. Vice Economic Planning Minister Han I-hon reported that the government would complete a rural development plan by the end of May to help farmers overcome difficulties stemming from the farm market opening under the Uruguay Round accord. In June, the government will formulate a supplementary budget of 300-400 billion won (about 500 million U.S. dollars), based on the special rural tax to be levied in the second half of the year, to finance the plan, he added. Over 1.3 trillion won will be provided to small- and medium-sized firms to boost technological innovation and sharpen their products' competitive edge on the world market. Because parliament will need time to pass the pending legislation on private investment in infrastructure and to amend related laws, the government will prepare guidelines on such investment so that private firms can get involved in infrastructure projects during the first half of next year, Han reported. Toward the end of the meeting, President Kim exhorted the economic ministers to unite around Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok, indicating that the coming cabinet reshuffle after parliamentary approval of Yi Yong-tok as the new prime minister would not affect the economic team.
