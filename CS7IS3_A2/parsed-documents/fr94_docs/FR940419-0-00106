FR940419-0-00106 FR940419-0-00020 In response to a number of inquiries, this interim rule provides clarification of the adjustment of HOME rents. Section 92.252(a)(1) requires that in order to qualify as affordable housing, a project must bear rents not greater than the lesser of FMR or 30 percent of the adjusted income of a family whose gross income equals 65 percent of the median income for the area. Section 92.252(a)(2) requires further rent limitations on the 20 percent of units in each project which must be occupied by very low-income families. The adjustment of qualifying rents is addressed in §92.252(d), which is amended to clarify that the rent ceilings for HOME projects do not fall below the HOME rent for the project in effect at the time of project commitment. This is permitted to ensure the continued financial viability of the project and for consistency with the low-income housing tax credit statute. Section 92.252(a)(2) includes as a rent limitation for the qualification of projects with three or more rental units as affordable housing that not less than 20 percent of the units be occupied by very low-income families and bear rents not greater than 30 percent of the gross income of a family whose income equals 50 percent of the median income for the area. The Department has received indications that, depending upon the FMR or the differences in adjusted and gross income, the use of this formula, which is intended to produce a lower HOME rent than that computed under §92.252(a)(1), results in a higher rent than under §92.252(a)(1). To prevent very low-income families from potentially paying more rent than low-income families, a new §92.252(a)(2)(iii) is added to specify that the lowest rent computed under either §§92.252(a) (1) or (2) is applicable to units occupied by very low-income families. A correction is made in this interim rule concerning the foreclosure provisions of §92.252(a)(5) to parallel the revision made in the June 23, 1993 interim rule to §92.254(a)(4)(i)(B). A number of clarifying amendments are being made to the homeownership affordability requirements of §92.254(a). In response to comments criticizing the length of the affordability period imposed upon first-time homebuyers regardless of the amount of HOME assistance received, this interim rule amends §92.254(a) to make it conform to the §92.252(a)(5) table that provides differing affordability periods for rental units depending upon the amount of the HOME investment. The 20-year affordability period for newly constructed housing, regardless of the amount of HOME funds invested, has been eliminated for homeownership activities. Two additional clarifying changes are made to §92.254(a) in this rule. A sentence is added to §92.254(a)(4)(ii)(C) to specify that the HOME investment subject to recapture is the HOME assistance that enabled the first-time homebuyer to buy the dwelling unit, including any HOME assistance that reduced the purchase price from fair market value to an affordable price, such as subsidizing construction financing costs or other development costs. The second change to this section provides guidance with respect to two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects. New paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(D) states that when HOME funds are used in two-to-four unit first-time homebuyer projects, upon recapture of the HOME funds the affordability periods on the rental units may be terminated. Technical corrections to change the references to 24 CFR 203.18(b) in §§92.254(a)(1)(i) and 92.254(b)(1)(i) to 24 CFR 203.18b are made by this rule. Six comments were received regarding the ``floating'' units amendment to §92.255, all of them favorable. As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the Department is amending the procedure for housing project owners to designate those units in a property that are HOME-assisted units. Formerly, specific units were designated as the HOME units, and that designation was fixed for the term of the affordability period. To provide more program flexibility, this interim rule adds new language to §92.255 that permits the participating jurisdiction to use a system of ``floating'' units that may be changed over the affordability period, so long as the total number of units remains the same and the substituted units are at least comparable in terms of size, features, and number of bedrooms to the originally designated HOME-assisted units. Additional guidance is provided in §92.256 by clarifying that the requirement that residential living space must constitute at least 51 percent of the project space is significant only for purposes of counting the contribution in the non-residential portion of the property as match. The concern in making this change is that this section was being misinterpreted to mean that a project required at least 51 percent residential living space to permit the use of HOME funds. The ECHO housing provisions of §§92.259 and 92.625 were addressed in two comments that were generally favorable. One of the comments pointed out differences in the two sections and recommended that they be made uniform. The two sections are, in fact, identical except for the differences necessary to accommodate the general HOME program and the program as modified for Indian tribes in subpart M of the rule.
