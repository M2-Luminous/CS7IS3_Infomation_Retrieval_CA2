It is part of a premeditated criminal plan to stop the popular current, which is opposed to the regime's criminal practices against our struggling people. According to the information we have received from our strugglers in the region, the authority's troops conducted a large offensive along several battlefronts, using tanks, artillery, and infantry troops from four divisions and backed up by regiments from the Republican Guards. They overran a large area of the marshes following concerted artillery bombardment using internationally banned napalm bombs, which caused huge fires in several villages in the region that left several villagers dead. The following facts emerge from the recent treacherous Saddamite attack against our people in the south: 1. The isolated regime in Baghdad has launched the attack to liquidate the bastions of Iraqi jihad and popular resistance, which pose an increasing threat to the regime, have become rallying points for the people, and provide a ray of hope for salvation now that the international threats to bring down the regime have vanished. 2. Saddam and his gang continue to act with hatred toward the people and a desire to harm and muffle them, despite the catastrophes, perils, and calamities caused by this gang to the people; this increases day after day without any hope of change in the gang's bloody and inhuman practices. 3. The new world order, led by the United States and backed by its allies, does not care much about the constant deaths, general starvation, and utter misery in Iraq caused by Saddam's gang. They also do not care much about the violations of human rights in the south. Among the Security Council resolutions, they only care about the destruction of Iraq's strategic weapons. For this reason, they focus their entire attention on destroying these weapons, a goal that has turned into the standard criteria for judging the Iraqi regime's attitude and discipline. 4. The annihilation, destruction of the environment, and devastation of the populated areas in southern Iraqi are part of a comprehensive Zionist scheme, which closely resembles the campaigns of annihilation and demographic changes carried out by the Zionist entity in Palestine and is intended to be standardized throughout the Islamic countries. 5. The silence of world public opinion at what is happening in Iraq is part of a multifaceted collusion against the gigantic Islamic trend, which started during the blessed uprising of 1991. Let us all announce a general mourning throughout the world over the March 1994 massacre, which is still in progress. Let us all participate in organizing permanent and vocal marches in front of the Saddamite regime's embassies throughout the world. Let us intensify our protests over the world's murderous silence on the annihilation of our people. Let us do everything we can to help save our people, who are dying inside Iraq, and not just sit with our arms folded and accept the work of destiny.
