Mr. Niehaus said in Parliament that this was necessary to complete the process of reconciliation and forgiveness. However, he emphasized that it should not be translated into a process similar to that used in the Nuremberg trials. Mr. Justice Richard Goldstone, also speaking in Cape Town, called for the establishment of a truth commission on apartheid atrocities because, as he put it, the victims would not be able to forgive without openness. He said multiple prosecutions had to be avoided and that it was essential to expose the past as part of the process of healing.
