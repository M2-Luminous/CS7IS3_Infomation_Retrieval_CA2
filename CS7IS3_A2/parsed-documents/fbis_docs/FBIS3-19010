"It is a certain fact" that growth will be lower than expected in 1994, Spaventa said on the sidelines of a conference here, but if gross domestic product does increase even by just 1.4 percent, as predicted by Confindustria, it would be a "consistent" improvement and would "produce noticeable effects." Spaventa appeared wary of comments by International Monetary Fund officials, who said the government will be forced to approve additional austerity measures in spring to offset a runaway deficit. "I am against so-called clinical measures aimed at patching up the differences in forecast growth caused by international economic cycles," Spaventa said. He admitted that "the last word will be up to the IMF," which will probably recommend new measures to contain spending and possibly some indirect tax increases. But interest rates are the key to balancing state finances, according to Spaventa: "The battle against the public debt will be fought with interest rates," he said. As for the effects in Italy of recovery in other countries, Spaventa said he was pleased to see that the German central bank had not increased interest rates along with growing monetary mass; "in the past they would not have hesitated to do so."
