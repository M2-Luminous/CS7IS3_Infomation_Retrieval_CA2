"We have set a certain deadline and it is 2400 [2300 GMT] tomorrow, regardless of other deadlines," Karadzic said. He added that the Srpska army had already withdrawn a number of convoys of heavy weapons and that they were still withdrawing. Those that cannot be withdrawn due to the snow will be under full UN control, Karadzic said. "From noon tomorrow [1100 GMT 19 February], UN members will control seven locations where heavy weaponry will be assembled," Akashi told journalists. This refers to five locations where the Serbs ought to assemble their artillery and two locations where the Muslims are to assemble theirs.
