FBIS4-23360 "drafr107_b_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 EAST AFRICA Kenya Minister Calls Bank, Railroad Strikes `Illegal' Minister Calls Bank, Railroad Strikes `Illegal' EA0306075094 Nairobi Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Network in English 1600 GMT 2 Jun 94 EA0306075094 Nairobi Kenya Broadcasting Corporation Network in English 1600 GMT 2 Jun 94 English BFN [Text] The minister for labor and manpower development, Mr. Philip Masinde, has declared the strike by the employees in the banking industry as illegal. In a press release today, Mr. Masinde said that while negotiations are still under way through conciliation, the workers have unilaterally taken industrial action contrary to the spirit of the industrial relations charter and the provisions of the Trade Dispute Act Chapter 234. He therefore said that under such circumstances, the workers' action was untenable and called on them to resume work immediately. Touching on the strike by the Kenya Railways Corporation locomotive drivers which started yesterday, the minister also declared their strike illegal. Mr. Masinde pointed out that there exists a machinery for settlement of industrial disputes which must be adhered to by the parties, an action which, he said, the employees of the railway did not follow. He called on the striking railway employees to resume work immediately. Meanwhile, nearly 30 train drivers currently on strike have been sacked. In a letter signed by the district mechanical engineer, Mr. Mithamo, the drivers were summarily dismissed for deliberately absenting themselves from duty on June 1st this year. Subsequently, the striking drivers have been evicted from the staff quarters and ordered to vacate the premises of the corporation. As part of the contingency measures, the public relations manager, Miss Njeri Luseno, said locomotive inspectors and instructor drivers from the railway training institute had been redeployed. She said business at all stations had fully resumed, adding that all passengers and cargo trains would continue to operate as usual. Miss Luseno pleaded for patience from the staff saying that the management was currently pursuing negotiations with the Kenya Railways Workers Union to review the remuneration package of the unionizable staff. Those striking are demanding a monthly salary of 25,000 shillings for junior drivers from the current 2,900 shillings and 45,000 shillings for senior drivers from their current pay of 5,000 shillings. As they packed their belongings the drivers vowed to pursue their grievances through the industrial court.
