Defence, ironically, continues to remain a low priority area for a country which has fought four wars and still faces a proxy war. In the present defence environment, each of the three arms is important. Ignoring one at the cost of the others would be far from judicious. For the navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF), the prevailing resource crunch and the low budgetary allocation is an issue of particular concern. While the army is manpower-oriented, both the navy and the air force are dependent on technology and capital. Both these requirements go together, ruling out any scope for compromise on either. For the IAF, the going has been particularly worrisome. Even the air chief had conceded at a news conference at the Bangalore air show last December that managing the IAF with the prevailing resource crunch was "damn tough". The reality is indeed harsh. Not only have modernisation plans suffered, but also the operational capabilities of the air force, which had performed heroically in the 1971 Indo-Pak war. Worse, the IAF has become an aged air force, with a fleet that is almost obsolete in today's state-of-the-art en vironment. And tragically for the IAF, the onset of the decline has coincided with the Gulf war, which has left no doubt about the vital role air power will play in future wars. Most of the IAF aircraft are Soviet-made and very old. Over half of the IAF's combat aircraft need to be replaced or upgraded. The IAF, like the other two services, is faced with a severe resource crunch following the collapse of its long-standing defence ally, the Soviet Union. Further, it lacks an advance jet trainer (AJT), is short of spares, lacks adequate modern electronic equipment, weapon systems and force multipliers, and needs a better air defence ground environment system (ADGES), including more sophisticated early warning systems and surface to air missiles (SAMs). There is an absence of any strategic thinking on the part of defence ministry policy-makers, who are mostly bureaucrats with little experience or professional understanding of defence issues. The three services have been reduced to begging for bare essentials. The bulk of the IAF's 39 combat squadrons comprises the MiG-21 fighter-intercepters. Nine of these squadrons, which are of 1960s vintage, are beyond upgradation and ought to have been phased out years ago. But there is simply no money. Also, the MiG-21 bis squadrons urgently need upgrading with modern avionics and weapon systems. Unfortunately, the government continues to procrastinate, paying little heed to the cost and time-sensitive frame needed for this frontline defence aircraft. These need to be operational for at least 15 more years so as to be replaced with the Light Combat Aircraft (LCA), scheduled to fructify by 2005. The four MiG-23 BN (ground attack) squadrons are similarly outdated and are in the process of being replaced by the MiG-27, an updated version, currently being assembled by HAL [Hindustan Aeronautics Limited] at Ozhar (Maharashtra). The MiG-27, of which the IAF has squadrons, is a uni-role tactical air strike aircraft (TASA), which again has a limited range. About four years hence, these too will require upgradation. Thus by 2005, the MiG-27 fleet is more likely to resemble today's MiG-21 fleet, with little scope for replacement. A similar picture is that of the Jaguars. This British strike aircraft, currently being assembled by HAL in Bangalore, is of early 1970 vintage. The 4.5 squadrons available to the IAF comprise half a squadron of the maritime strike version, the only squadron of its kind in the IAF. Of the remaining four Jaguar squadrons, two squadrons require urgent upgrading. Thus, the only modern aircraft with the IAF today are the two squadrons of the French state-of-the-art, fly-by-wire, multi-role Mirage-2000 aircraft and three squadrons of the Soviet MiG-29 uni-role air superiority aircraft. In January, the IAF had lost a Mirage-2000 to a bird hit, taking the total of Mirage-2000s lost so far to four. In early February, the IAF lost a MiG-29 taking the number of MiG-29s lost also to four. While the Mirage-2000, then valued at Rs 43 crore, was inducted in 1985, the MiG-29 entered the IAF only in 1987. While the IAF continues to maintain its aged air force, the Pakistani and Chinese air forces, by contrast, have been involved in a steady modernisation programme. Despite the Pressler amendment, not only has the PAF [Pakistan Air Force] managed to regularly service and get, spare parts for its F-16s, but also reportedly managed to increase flying hours on its F-16s by about 10 per cent. The IAF top brass is convinced that the US, will find some way to deliver 71 more F-16s that are being sought by the PAF, the Pressler amendment notwithstanding. Should that happen, the government will have no option but to provide funds to buy additional aircraft in order to make up for the imbalance caused by this induction into the PAF. The IAF has already submitted a proposal for inducting a squadron each of the Mirage-2000 and the MiG-29. A tempting option is to reduce the force level of the IAF and make it into a leaner and meaner force. This would mean compelling the IAF to think carefully about its roles and missions and start taking tough decisions. But the IAF rules out this option, pointing out that threat perceptions have only increased and not reduced. They point to India's vast border and the huge army which will need air support in case of a war. The only option, according to them, is a more realistic budget in keeping with the security environment that prevails in India's neighbourhood. While the government confines its concerns to the intentions of a foreign government, the armed forces are more concerned with the capabilities of real and potential adversaries. Intentions can be temporary, but capabilities take time to build and are permanent.
