In his words, as of today there are no AIDS sufferers in the Russian Army and Navy. However, since 1989 15 carriers of this illness, that is to say, HIV-positive persons, have been detected by military medics. Five are continuing service in the troops, under constant medical supervision. Ten have been discharged to the reserves and transferred to the supervision of the civilian health organs. The virus was detected in officers up to 40 years of age, and the majority were infected while on leave or tours of duty. Viktor Kolkov said that work on diagnosing AIDS in the Russian Armed Forces began back in 1987, and in 1989 laboratories for research into infection and immunization were set up. (According to information not confirmed by the chief physician, these laboratories exist today in dozens of hospitals, and a special department for the treatment of HIV-positive patients operates in Podolsk Military Hospital.) Kolkov also said that servicemen giving blood, foreigners studying in military academies, Russian servicemen returning from foreign tours of duty, and persons infected with venereal diseases and also certain other clinical illnesses are subject to compulsory testing for HIV. Induction commissions, according to Kolkov, are not yet charged with testing draftees for AIDS, except in cases where commission doctors have reasons for suspicion. "We have already tested more than 1.5 million persons; we are simply unable to test all draftees and personnel," Kolkov said. At the same time Viktor Kolkov rejected forecasts that the number of AIDS and HIV sufferers in the Army will increase dramatically in the near future. In his words, there are no grounds for panic, and conditions in this respect are incomparably better in the Russian Armed Forces than in the U.S. and other Western countries' armies.
