With the formal confirmation of the transition of the coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the Slovak National Party (SNS) to the opposition the parliament house order has also been changed. Since June 1992, of the HZDS 74 deputies only 56 were left after the withdrawal of the eight deputies supporting former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko, the other eight members of the former Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism, a faction within the HZDS, and the other two HZDS deputies who became independent. The transfer of former Deputy Premier Jozef Prokes into parliament after he left his post in the government increased the number of the SNS deputies to the nine while the opposition lost one vote at the same time as Prokes replaced Milan Janicina who together with the National Democratic Club of the SNS former Chairman Ludovit Cernak went into the camp of Meciar's opponents. The current opposition surrounding Meciar has 67 votes in the 150-member parliament. The camp of the arising government coalition could rely on 83 votes at the best while a three-fifths majority of votes (90 from 150) is required for the key constitutional laws, for example, the law on early elections, to be passed in parliament. From the five parties which will be represented in the new government, the Democratic Left Party (SDL) is the strongest parliamentary party with 28 mandates, followed by the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) with 18 deputies. "The Center Bloc" is made of eight deputies from the Alliance of Slovak Democrats (ADSR), eight representatives of the group surrounding Moravcik and Roman Kovac and five deputies from Cernak's National Democratic Club. Egyutteles (Coexistence), a Hungarian minority movement, and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) are also participating in forming a new government with their nine and five deputies respectively. The new cabinet can apparently also count on the votes of Marcela Gburova, an independent deputy, and deputy Imrich Mori, who left the HZDS deputies' group. The parliamentary arithmetic reflects, however, just the momentarily state of things, which is quickly changing.
