Implementation of the Budget for 1993 In 1993, people throughout Jiangsu, under the direct leadership of the provincial party committee, studied in depth Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his southern inspection tour along with the 14th CPC National Congress guidelines on seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation and control, readjusting economic structure, accelerating scientific and technological progress, and raising economic efficiency, thereby promoting rapid and sound development of the economy. Finance and taxation departments at all levels in Jiangsu earnestly consolidated financial and taxation order, reinforced financial and economic discipline, improved the collection and management of tax revenue, promoted financial and tax reform, and made energetic efforts to ensure revenue, thereby overfulfilling the task of revenue. They also actively allocated funds for various financial expenditures and basically ensured funds needed for economic construction and development of social undertakings in Jiangsu. The revenue budget deliberated and approved by the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 16.435 billion yuan. According to preliminary statistics, total revenue came to 22.13 billion yuan, or 134.65 percent of the budgeted figure. The state's decision to raise the business tax rate by two percentage points added 192 million yuan to Jiangsu's revenue budget. In the second half of the year, the state tasked the province to strive to overfulfill the budgeted revenue by 1.8 billion yuan. As a result of these adjustments, the budgeted revenue was 18.427 billion yuan. Thus, 1993 revenue amounted to 120.1 percent of the adjusted budgeted figure, up 6.899 billion yuan or 45.3 percent from the previous year. The big growth in Jiangsu's revenue in 1993 can be attributed primarily to the following factors: First, rapid economic growth and thriving markets brought about increased revenue. Second, we earnestly implemented the central authorities' No. 6 document and the guidelines of the national financial work conference and resolutely curbed tax reductions and exemptions for taxpayers in temporary difficulty and the contracting of turnover tax, thereby conspicuously reducing revenue losses. Third, we strengthened tax collection and management of individual industrial and commercial units by launching a general taxation and accounting inspection, thereby increasing revenue. Fourth, implementation of the state policy to hike the business tax rate also resulted in increased revenue. Moreover, because of natural disasters in 1991, base figures for Jiangsu's revenue for 1992 were low, resulting in a relatively big rise in the 1993 revenue. Of the total revenue, tax receipts came to 22.005 billion yuan, 122.67 percent of the adjusted budgeted amount, and 7.456 billion yuan or 51.25 percent more than the previous year. Of these, receipts from industrial and commercial taxes totaled 21.273 billion yuan, 123.63 percent of the adjusted budgeted amount, and 7.497 billion yuan or 54.42 percent more than the previous year. Receipts from enterprises were minus 840 million yuan, as compared to minus 289 million yuan of the previous year. Revenue from other sources came to 220 million yuan, 116.4 percent of the budgeted amount, and 50 million yuan or 28.96 percent more than the previous year. Revenue from special projects amounted to 563 million yuan, 116.63 percent of the budgeted figure, and 57 million yuan or 11.2 percent increase from the previous year. The portion of the fund for key energy and communications construction projects retained by the local government came to 71 million yuan, 50.71 percent of the budgeted figure, and a decrease of 52 million yuan or 42.38 percent from the previous year. The portion of state budget regulating fund retained by the local government was 111 million yuan, 61.67 percent of the budgeted amount, and a decrease of 60 million yuan or 34.87 percent from the previous year. Budget expenditures for 1993 approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress amounted to 9.787 billion yuan. After adjustment -- adding funds transferred from the previous year, special funds appropriated from the central treasury, funds allocated by local authorities from overfulfilled budget revenues, and funds transferred from other sources earmarked for expenditure -- the total budgeted expenditures came to 18.794 billion yuan. Based on initial figures, actual expenditures for the year totaled 16.258 billion yuan, an increase of 3.673 billion yuan, or 29.18 percent, over the previous year. The relatively large increase in expenditures was largely due to implementation of the contracted financial responsibility system, which stipulates that localities, after fulfilling their contracted financial responsibilities, may spend more if they get more revenue. Thus, large increases in local revenue inevitably brought with them corresponding increases in expenditures. Major expenditures that registered increases were: investment in technological transformation of state-owned enterprises and village and town enterprises; investment in agriculture, education, science and technology, urban infrastructure, and social welfare; and subsidies to workers through the increase of subsidies standards. The major categories of expenditure were implemented as follows: 1) Expenditure for capital construction amounted to 955 million yuan, an increase of 234 million yuan or 32.53 percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of enterprises and for technological transformation amounted to 1.360 billion yuan, an increase of 1.101 billion yuan or 4.25 times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and technology amounted to 240 million yuan, an increase of 96 million yuan or 67.07 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of agriculture and for water conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry amounted to 1.798 billion yuan, an increase of 709 million yuan or 65.11 percent. 5) Expenditure for urban maintenance and construction amounted to 1.233 billion yuan, an increase of 540 million yuan or 77.97 percent. 6) Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health amounted to 4.984 billion yuan, an increase of 1.156 billion yuan or 30.19 percent, of which 3.069 billion yuan were spent on education, an increase of 738 million yuan or 31.65 percent. 7) Expenditure for administration, procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings amounted to 2.255 billion yuan, an increase of 580 million yuan or 34.62 percent. 8) Expenditure for pensions for the disabled and for families of diseased and for social welfare and relief amounted to 478 million yuan, about the same as the previous year. This was largely because some of the relief funds for 1991 disasters were established in 1992, making the base figures higher for 1993. 9) Expenditure for price subsidies amounted to 597 million yuan, a decrease of 1.694 billion yuan or 73.95 percent. This was mainly because the state reduced subsidies to workers for increased grain and edible oil purchase prices and for price differentials in the purchase of special grain reserves. In 1993, following the lifting of controls on grain, edible oil, and coal prices, the state gave workers appropriate amounts of subsidies. Some of the subsidies were borne by enterprises, while others were allocated from the budget. Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented quite successfully. It is expected that revenues not only will be able to cover the year's expenditures, they will also be able to make up for some of the past deficits, thereby reversing the perennial deficits registered since 1989. The 1993 provincial level budget was implemented as follows: Provincial-level expenditures approved at the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress totalled 2.047 billion yuan. After adding additional funds transferred from the previous year's balance and special funds appropriated from the central treasury and deducting special funds allocated to cities and counties, the adjusted expenditures totalled 3.040 billion yuan. According to initial figures, provincial expenditures for the year were 2.528 billion yuan, a decrease of 1.144 billion yuan, or 31.16 percent over the previous year. This was largely because of the reduced subsidies to workers to cover grain and edible oil price increases and to cover price differentials in the purchase of special grain reserves. The major categories of expenditures were as follows: 1) Capital construction totaled 602 million yuan, an increase of 68 million yuan or 12.81 percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of enterprises and technological transformation amounted to 82 million yuan spent, a decrease of 19 million yuan or 18.53 percent. The decrease was largely the result of one-time loan discounts for the technological transformation of large and medium- sized enterprises made in 1992. If this factor is excluded from consideration, the budget would have shown an increase of 6 million yuan or 11.76 percent. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and technology amounted to 91 million yuan, an increase of 16 million yuan or 22.01 percent. 4) Expenditure spent in support of agriculture and on water conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry amounted to 217 million yuan, an increase of 49 million yuan or 28.95 percent. 5) Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health totaled 673 million yuan, an increase of 128 million yuan or 23.48. 6) Expenditure spent on pensions for the disabled and families of the diseased and on social welfare and relief amounted to 15 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 million yuan or 9.57 percent. 7) Expenditure on administration, procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings amounted to 159 million yuan, an increase of 24 million yuan or 17.57 percent. 8) price subsidies totaled 324 million yuan, a decrease of 1.513 billion yuan or 82.35 percent. The provincial level budget was basically balanced with some surplus. To better implement the 1993 budget, we put emphasis on the following aspects: (1) Conscientiously carrying out the CPC Central Committee's policy of strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and strictly observing the "three rules." Last year's Central Document No. 6 put forward the policy of strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and set precise demands for financial work. Last July, leading cadres of the State Council put forward three rules: tightening finance and taxation order, strictly placing tax exemptions and reductions under control, and strictly controlling financial deficits. Various localities in Jiangsu vigorously carried out the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, effectively managed financial matters and tax revenues according to law, and improved the provincial financial situation. First, they persisted in managing tax revenues according to law. In accordance with the CPC Central Committee's guidelines, governments at all levels and taxation departments earnestly checked various regulations governing tax exemptions and reductions and governing the budget regulatory fund and energy and communications construction funds formulated by localities themselves. All regulations established without proper authorization were suspended. Examinations and approvals of temporary and contingency tax exemptions and reductions were halted. Second, they continued the general inspection of tax revenues and financial matters. By the end of last year, the amount of money found and seized under tax evasion and other illegal acts reached 626 million yuan. Out of 441 million yuan to be turned over to the treasury, 417 million yuan, or 94.6 percent, was actually turned over to the treasury. Third, they intensified their efforts in collecting, managing, and inspecting tax revenues from individual businessmen. In 1993, tax revenues from individual businessmen totalled 2.708 billion yuan, up 973 million yuan or 56.01 percent. (2) Vigorously raising and allocating funds to support economic development. Over the past year, under the leadership of party committees and governments at the corresponding levels, finance and taxation departments at all levels tried every possible means to raise and allocate funds and made vigorous efforts to promote sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the provincial economy. To develop industrial production, finance and taxation departments at all levels, first, vigorously transformed their functions and created conditions to help enterprises change their operating mechanisms. Having trained a large number of qualified personnel and made sufficient preparations, on 1 July, finance and taxation departments smoothly implemented the "Enterprise Accounting Norms," the "General Rules for Enterprise Financial Affairs," and the accounting systems for different professions. This granted more decision-making power to enterprises and enabled enterprises to develop on their own. Second, they promoted technical transformation. The provincial government allocated 13.9 million yuan to 19 small enterprises that produce nitrogenous fertilizer and encouraged them to conduct technological transformation to conserve energy by changing coal consumption methods. The provincial government also provided loan discounts worth 25 million yuan to 83 key technological transformation projects. Third, province financial institutions continued to increase investment in production that is in line with the state industrial policy and structure and in enterprises that produce high technology products, products with high added-value, exchange-earning export products, and products in great demand on the market. Province financial institutions granted these enterprises small loans worth 155 million yuan. Better economic efficiency was realized. In developing agricultural production, governments at all levels conscientiously carried out various measures promoting agriculture that were launched by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and made efforts to increase agricultural investment. First, they earnestly implemented the "Agricultural Law of the PRC" and the "PRC's Law Governing Agrotechnology Popularization," and increased investment in agriculture. Second, they rationally adjusted the utilization structure of funds supporting agriculture and ensured the smooth progress of key agricultural projects. In the past three years, they invested 173 million yuan of construction funds through various channels to quicken the construction of unified seed supply projects at township level across the province. To promote infrastructure construction of irrigation, financial institutions at all levels vigorously collected 400 million yuan for the flood prevention security fund. Of this, 82 million yuan was collected by province financial departments. Third, to continue efforts to develop the economy in poverty-stricken areas and change their outlook, province financial departments allocated special aid-to-the-poor funds worth 22.93 million yuan, supporting a total of 130 economic development projects to help 61 poor towns, townships, and old revolutionary bases such as Maoshan and Huangqiao develop their economies. (3) Increasing input into social undertakings to promote their development. In 1993, finance departments at all levels across Jiangsu energetically raised and allocated funds and made overall and rational arrangements to promote the development of various social undertakings. While ensuring regular expenditures, finance departments allocated funds to help institutions and units solve a number of outstanding problems. For example, the provincial government allocated a portion of the fund to poor counties in northern Jiangsu to pay teachers' salaries; it allocated 17.6 million yuan to support the construction of laboratories, specialized departments, and teachers' living quarters in a number of institutes of higher learning as well as key research institutes affiliated with the provincial government; it allocated 11 million yuan and, together with funds raised by localities through various sources, repaired and built health clinics for 100 towns and townships in poor areas; it continued to allocate funds totaling 2.5 million yuan to improve drinking water in rural areas and, by raising funds in different sectors, improved drinking water for 2 million rural residents; it allocated a 6.59 million yuan special fund to support 25 key projects to fight snail fever in Yangzhong, Haian, Yixing, and other areas, and completely eliminated snail fever in three pilot areas of Dantu, Jiangpu, and Hanjiang. Finance departments at various levels also allocated necessary funds for housing construction for intellectuals and for sports, culture, and radio and television facilities. (4) Launching the anticorruption drive and earnestly screening wanton collection of fees. In line with the provincial party committee's plans to fight corruption, a campaign to screen the wanton collection of fees was launched throughout the province and achieved interim results in 1993. According to statistics, 2,266 of the 2,409 fees charged in Jiangsu were abolished through the campaign, thereby lightening the burdens on enterprises and people in general and reassuring the public. Despite achievements in financial work in 1993, quite a few problems remain. They are reflected largely in the following: Regulatory capability at the provincial level was relatively weak; even though expenditures and revenues were balanced for the fiscal year, a handful of counties (cities) in northern Jiangsu continued to suffer deficits and were unable to pay teachers and administrators from time to time; failure to improve the economic efficiency of some enterprises resulted in aggravating deficits; and while conducting financial management, we failed to exercise effective supervision over waste and extravagance in enterprises. 2. The Draft Budget for 1994 Financial revenues and expenditures in 1994 will be affected, to a certain extent, by the largest number of reform programs ever to be launched in China this year. As the economy and work in other fields of endeavor develop, more input from the budget will be needed for expenditures. Newly increased revenues will be difficult to satisfy the needs of newly increased expenditures, and localities will continue to face extremely tight budgets. In accordance with the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the guiding principle for the 1994 budget is: To subordinate to and serve the overall interests -- put forth by the central authorities -- of "seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and ensuring stability;" to actively implement fiscal and tax reform to ensure the smooth progress of reform measures; to concentrate efforts on raising funds and strictly collecting and managing tax payments; and to strive to strike a balance between revenues and expenditures by persisting in doing things within the limit of financial capabilities, improving the management of expenditures, readjusting their pattern, ensuring key expenditures, and reducing routine expenditures. In accordance with the above principles, the objective of national economic and social development for 1994, as well as the program for fiscal restructuring toward establishing a tax assignment system, the 1994 provincial budget is drafted as follows: (1) Fiscal revenue budget Based on the circumstances of economic development in the province, provincial revenue is projected to grow by 7 percent, reaching 23.527 billion yuan in 1994, if calculated according to the parameters before implementation of the tax assignment system. Calculated according to the parameters after the tax assignment system is implemented -- i.e. after deducting all the consumption tax revenue and 75 percent of the value-added tax revenue to be turned in to central authorities and after allowing for other adjustment factors -- the 1994 provincial revenue is budgeted at 0.638 billion yuan, up 9.53 percent over the corresponding amount calculated the previous year. Various itemized revenues are budgeted as follows: (I) Tax revenues are to total 11.476 billion yuan, an increase of 1.165 billion yuan or 11.3 percent over the previous year. These include industrial and commercial tax revenues totaling 9.126 billion yuan, up 924 million yuan or 11.27 percent. (II) Loss subsidies [bu tie fu shu 5943 6317 6298 2422] to state-owned enterprises are to total 1.728 billion yuan, up 165 million yuan over the previous year largely due to a rise in policy-related subsidies for enterprises' losses. (III) Other incomes are to total 250 million yuan, up 13 million yuan or 5.33 percent from the previous year. (IV) Income derived from contributions to special funds is to be 290 million yuan, an increase of 6 million yuan or 1.95 percent over the previous year. (V) Income derived from contributions to development funds for key energy and communications projects is to be 30 million yuan, down 41 million yuan or 57.63 percent from the previous year. Income derived from contributions to the budget regulatory fund is to be 40 million yuan, down 71 million yuan or 64.1 percent. The decrease in contributions to these two funds is a result of the abolition of mandatory contributions by state-owned enterprises beginning this year. (VI) Income derived from additional fees for education is to be 280 million yuan, up 19 million yuan or 7.37 percent over the previous year. (2) Fiscal expenditure budget After adding to the budgeted fiscal revenue for 1994 the consumption and value-added taxes to be returned by the central authorities based on the 1993 base figures and deducting from it the revenues turned in, according to the original procedures, to the central authorities in the form of special-fund contributions or progressive contributions based on the contracted financial responsibility system, the province's expendable fund for 1994 comes to 14.6 billion yuan -- an increase of 4.813 billion yuan or 49.18 percent over the previous year -- all of which will be allocated to budgeted expenditures. The 1994 expenditure budget is much larger than that of 1993 mainly because extra revenue for 1993 was not included in the fiscal revenue budget formulated at the beginning of that year, coupled with a certain growth in fiscal revenue for 1994 itself. Major expenditures are budgeted as follows: 1) Expenditure for capital construction accounts for 556 million yuan, an increase of 151 million yuan or 37.33 percent from the previous year's budget. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of enterprises and technological transformation accounts for 705 million yuan, an increase of 519 million yuan or 2.79 times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and technology accounts for 149 million yuan, an increase of 55 million yuan or 58.82 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of agriculture and for water conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry accounts for 1.326 billion yuan, an increase of 448 million yuan or 51.08 percent. 5) Expenditure for operating industries, communications, and commerce accounts for 232 million yuan, an increase of 71 million yuan or 44.37 percent. 6) Expenditure for urban maintenance and construction accounts for 1.148 billion yuan, an increase of 376 million yuan or 48.61 percent. 7) Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health accounts for 5.394 billion yuan, an increase of 1.389 billion yuan or 34.68 percent, of which 3.843 billion yuan is for education, an increase of 54.1 percent. 8) Expenditure on pensions for the disabled and for families of the diseased and for social welfare and relief accounts for 396 million yuan, an increase of 76 million yuan or 23.89 percent. 9) Expenditure for administration, procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings accounts for 1.968 billion yuan, an increase of 442 million yuan or 28.96 percent. 10) Expenditure for price subsidies accounts for 253 million yuan, an increase of 35 million yuan or 15.83 percent. (3) Provincial-level budget In 1994, province-level financial resources available for expenditure stand at 2.460 billion yuan, largely from province-level revenue and revenue delivered to the provincial government by various localities. A total of 2.460 billion yuan is budgeted for province-level expenditures, an increase of 413 million yuan or 20.17 percent over the previous year's budget. Excluding increased expenditures resulting from wage adjustments, the budgeted expenditures represent an increase of 14 percent. The provincial budget strikes a balance between revenue and expenditures. Major expenditures are budgeted as follows: 1) Capital construction accounts for 306 million yuan, an increase of 30 million yuan or 10.87 percent over the previous year's budget. 2) Expenditure for tapping enterprises potential and technological transformation accounts for 60 million yuan, an increase of 3.58 million yuan or 6.3 percent. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and technology accounts for 60 million yuan, an increase of 9.04 million yuan or 18.06 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of agriculture and on water conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry accounts for 422 million yuan, an increase of 59 million yuan or 16.28 percent. The increase amounts to 19.01 percent if the 10 million yuan for new water conservancy and capital construction projects is included. 5) Expenditure for operating industries, communications, and commerce accounts for 115 million yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan or 21.42 percent. 6) Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health accounts for 789 million yuan, an increase of 144 million yuan or 22.42 percent, of which expenditure for education is 385 million yuan, up 27.94 percent. 7) Expenditure on pensions for the disabled and the family of the diseased and on social welfare and relief accounts for 47 million yuan, an increase of 7.15 million yuan or 17.94 percent. 8) Expenditure on administration, procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings accounts for 176 million yuan, an increase of 30 million yuan or 20.46 percent. 9) Price subsidies total 122 million yuan, an increase of 11 million yuan or 9.4 percent. 10) Reserves account for 60 million yuan, an increase of 9 percent. 3. Deepen Financial and Taxation Reform, Promote Economic Development, and Strive To Successfully Accomplish the 1994 Budget 1994 is a crucial year for reform and development. To accomplish and overfulfill the task in implementing this year's budget, we will work effectively in the following main areas: (1) Earnestly implement the plan for financial and tax system reform. Ensuring smooth implementation and achieving the expected results in financial and tax reform measures is this year's central task. Therefore, we must do a realistically good job in the following three aspects. First, we must actively and firmly promote tax system reform, study and formulate specific implementation details, as well as establish a tax system and operating mechanism that corresponds with the demand of development of the socialist market economy. We must strictly enforce the new tax law and strengthen tax collection management to reduce revenue losses for a steady growth in revenue. Second, we must effectively implement the financial system of separate tax collections for the province and localities. We must arouse the enthusiasm of localities and gradually regulate financial distribution as well as ensure that the province financial authorities retain certain financial regulation capabilities at the same time. Further, we will give appropriate assistance to a small number of localities with actual difficulties so as to promote coordinated economic development in various localities. Third, we must do a good job in reforming the enterprise profit distribution system. Beginning this year, income tax collected will be based on the specified uniform tax rates without exceptions, and the contract method of submitting enterprise profits is abolished. Finance and taxation departments at all levels must earnestly publicize and explain this year's three major financial and tax reform measures, as well as forge a uniform understanding and work for the overall task to ensure smooth implementation of these measures. (2) Impose strict control in tax collection and management to ensure that the task is accomplished and overfulfilled. As this is the first year for implementing the new financial and tax system, there is significant meaning in accomplishing and overfulfilling this year's task in financial and tax collection. This is because, first, this is a crucial year for promoting and achieving key breakthroughs in the reform of China's economic system. The financial and tax system reform will prove decisive in various reforms. Financial and tax reform as well as economic development and social stability must be successful to accomplish and overfulfill this year's task in revenue collection. Second, localities must increase their incomes while maintaining the financial capability that they have already achieved. Third, because expenditures for this year have increased, increased revenues are necessary to meet essential expenditures. Therefore, we must do our utmost to build up income sources, uphold law enforcement in tax control, improve the collection and management of taxes, and undertake vigorous efforts to increase revenues. All localities must fulfill the task in revenue collection, and those with good income sources must strive to overfulfill their collections. (3) Promote economic development. In accordance with the demand of the provincial economic development plan, we must uphold the strategic principle of upholding the role of the foundation of the national economy, stressing industrial development, and vigorously developing tertiary industry in this year's task of promoting economic development with financial capability. First, we must do an active good job in supporting agricultural undertakings with financial resources. Jiangsu will increase an investment of 10 million yuan in water conservancy construction and appropriate spending for other agricultural undertakings. The entire province must strive to collect for the agricultural development fund, food risk fund, anti-flood and security fund, as well as the newly introduced land value appreciation tax. It is necessary to raise funds by all means to increase investment in agriculture. The funds should be invested and utilized in key areas, primarily in constructing agricultural infrastructures, supporting commodity grain production, building high-yield cotton growing bases, implementing comprehensive agricultural development projects, and developing comprehensive trade, industry, and agricultural enterprises, as well as constructing agricultural service systems. It is necessary to effectively develop the "shopping basket" project to increase non-staple food supply in market and bring market prices under control. Second, we must actively experiment in the modern enterprise system and reform the state-owned enterprise shareholding system. We must promptly study and handle financial issues that crop up during the reform process. Third, we must appropriately increase investment in science and technology, improve the financial subsidy method, quicken scientific and technological progress, promote enterprise product mix and industrial restructuring, assist enterprises in turning losses into profits, and strive to raise economic efficiency. Fourth, we must support governments at all levels, departments, and enterprise units in every possible way in making full use of their conditions and advantages to vigorously initiate and develop tertiary industry and in building up local financial resources. Fifth, we must continue to ensure sound financial foundations for enterprises and assist enterprises in developing sound internal financial control systems, as well as further implement the general financial rules, accounting principles, and branch accounting system for enterprises. (4) Implement rational plans for various expenditures and realistically strengthen spending control. In this year's budget, it is necessary to implement wage reform for enterprise units and ensure the funds needed for key spending in agriculture, science, and education, as well as for the 26 practical projects the Jiangsu government will undertake this year, apart from imposing strict control over other routine expenditures. Financial departments at all levels must bring into play the spirit of arduous struggle and thrift, oppose extravagance and waste, strive to increase income while reducing spending, and not draw up budget deficits. We must regulate funds by ways and means to ensure prompt wage payments for teachers and grass-roots cadres. In line with the party's basic policy on organizational reform, we must strive to reduce staffing, vehicle purchase, and meeting expenses. Enterprise units should continue to strengthen and perfect various budget control systems. We should encourage and support these units in rationally increasing their income within the limit allowed by policies and laws. Units with capabilities that receive their entire budgets from the province should gradually transform into units that receive differential budgets. Units receiving differential budgets should gradually transform into units that generate their own income for expenditures. We must further perfect the multiple forms of budget contract system as well as strengthen quota control and efficiency evaluation. (5) Strengthen the management of state assets. This year, we must continue to formulate effective policies and laws to strengthen the management of property rights (shareholding rights) income and prevent the loss of state assets, as well as ensure that the costs and appreciated value of state assets are preserved. We must implement plans for gradual inspection and evaluation of the assets of 800 large and medium-sized state enterprises as well as regulate the relations between owners of state assets and enterprise corporations in property ownership. We must effectively reorganize state assets and the management of property rights as well as vigorously cultivate and develop the property rights market. Through effective methods such as joint-venture, joint operations, auctions, mergers, transfers, leasing, sales, and bankruptcy, we will promote the rational circulation of state assets and optimize their distribution and restructuring to further bring into play their economic efficiency.
