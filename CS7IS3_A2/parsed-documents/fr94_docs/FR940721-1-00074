FR940721-1-00074 FR940721-1-00014 (ii) Selection Factors. To determine eligibility for inclusion in the system, the qualified CLO system shall utilize selection factors that are fair and impartial and are designed to contribute to the efficiency and quality of the system. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the date of the lender's application for participation on the qualified CLO system, the quality of services and capabilities the lender provides to consumers, the types of loan products offered by the lender and its pricing practices, and the extent to which the lender's participation will increase the variety of loan products offered to consumers by the system. Qualified CLO system owners shall have a reasonable justification for selection decisions, supported by documentation which they must maintain. (iii) Neutrality. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system and the qualified CLO system shall provide borrowers with information in a neutral manner. No lender shall be favored or disfavored by the manner in which information regarding the lender or its products is utilized or is presented to the borrower, is used on the system, or is presented by the CLO operators, or by the scope of information that one lender is permitted to include as compared to another lender. No payments, disincentives, or penalties may be provided directly or indirectly to CLO operators of qualified CLO systems by any person, including the CLO operator's employer, to influence the CLO operator to favor any lender on the qualified CLO system. (iv) Disclosure Statement. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall provide a CLO disclosure form to the borrower before CLO services are performed. The CLO operator shall require the borrower to sign on the CLO disclosure form an acknowledgment that the borrower has received the disclosure. An enlarged, completed copy of the CLO disclosure form (no smaller than 16'' by 20''), including any applicable fee, shall be displayed prominently within 5 feet of the CLO terminal. The CLO disclosure form shall: (A) Be in the format established in Appendix E of this part; (B) Specify the fee and services being provided; and (C) Include statements that use of the system is not required; space on the system is limited; the full range of products meeting the borrower's needs may not be listed on the system; and other lenders not listed on the system may offer better terms and conditions, including lower rates. (v) CLO Access Fee. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall charge all borrowers using the qualified CLO system the same CLO access fee(s) for the same service or the same components of service. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system shall require the borrower to pay any CLO access fee outside of and before the closing of any loan that may be obtained through use of this system. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may only waive the CLO access fee based on business considerations of the operator and not on any action of a lender. If the payment of the CLO access fee is contingent on use of a loan product on the qualified CLO system, the contingency shall apply equally to all loan products and lenders on the qualified CLO system. (vi) Lender Charges for Access. The CLO operator of a qualified CLO system may charge lenders for access to the qualified CLO system if: (A) Charges are set forth in a written schedule of charges; (B) Charges for the same services and components of services are the same for all lenders on the system; and (C) The charges are reasonably related to the costs of maintenance and operation of the qualified CLO system ( i.e., the facilities furnished or the services actually performed). (4) Any payment by a borrower to a CLO operator for services from a nonqualified CLO system, and any payments by a third party settlement service provider to a CLO operator for access to any CLO system in relation to a federally related mortgage loan, will be subject to examination under Section 8 of the Act and this part. The disclosure format set forth in Appendix E of this part and Box 2 of Appendix E of this part shall be utilized by all CLO operators for all CLO systems and shall be completed before any CLO services are performed. * * * * * 4. Section 3500.15 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(1); by removing the word ``and'' at the end of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A); by removing the period at the end of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) and replacing it with ``; and''; and by adding paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C), to read as follows: §3500.15 Controlled business arrangements. (b) *␣*␣* (1) The person making a referral has furnished to each person whose business is referred a written disclosure, in the format of the Controlled Business Arrangement Disclosure Statement set forth in Appendix D of this part. This disclosure shall specify the nature of the relationship (explaining the ownership and financial interest) between the provider of settlement services (or business incident thereto) and the person making the referral, and shall describe the estimated charge or range of charges (using the same terminology, as far as practical, as Section L of the HUD&hyph;1 or HUD&hyph;1A settlement statement) generally made by the provider of settlement services. The disclosure must be provided on a separate piece of paper at or no earlier than 3 business days before each referral, or, if the lender requires the use of a particular provider, the time of loan application, except that: * * * * * (3) *␣*␣* (i) *␣*␣* (C) No agent or employee may accept any payment from his or her principal or employer or any other source when that payment is correlated on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referrals of business from his or her employer or principal to an affiliated entity. For example, no person shall pay any managerial employee or any employee or agent who is in direct contact with the public a bonus or other compensation correlated on a one-to-one basis or calculated as a multiple of the number or value of any referral of settlement service business by the employee or the employee's organizational unit to an entity affiliated with the employer or principal. In addition, no compensation of an employee or agent who is routinely in direct contact with the public may be based in whole or in part on the number or value of referrals that the employee or agent makes to affiliated entities. 5. Appendix B to part 3500 is amended by revising Illustration 11 to read as follows:
