According to the same communique, practically the only thing left is to fix the date to establish the new institutions, which will be done, according to the communique, after consultations are held with the RPF. On Monday, 28 February, the RPF made known in a press release its reaction to Mr. Enoch Ruhigira's communique. It is a categorical refusal to take part in institutions which would only be an extension of the dictatorial rule of Major General Juvenal Habyarimana, and thus the very negation of the spirit of the agreements signed in Arusha seven months ago. The RPF communique reads as follows: [Passage omitted] It was in a climate of fear that the leaders of these parties agreed on 27 February to decisions which they had rejected on 23 February. As it is clear that President Habyarimana resorted to terrorism and intimidation -- with the murder of one opposition leader and the massacres perpetrated throughout last week -- to weaken the leaders of these political parties, the RPF challenges the conclusions of the so-called compromises won by President Habyarimana under these conditions. These compromises are all the more unacceptable as their spirit contradicts that of the Arusha peace accord, which was aimed at initiating radical reforms in the structures and functioning of the Rwandan state in order to eradicate the dictatorial practices President Habyarimana wants to safeguard by manipulating political parties, imposing on them elements loyal to him as representatives within these institutions. The RPF once again condemns the barbarous acts perpetrated by militias in the pay of President Habyarimana and announces that it will not take part in a government put in place on the basis of compromises reached by means of terror. Concerning the deputies at the transitional national assembly, the RPF will not accept any list other than the one approved by the constitutional court on 4 January. Similarly, the RPF requests that the right of the prime minister-designate of the broad-based transitional government to choose the ministers for his government team -- as was planned for 5 February -- be restored before President Habyarimana launches a policy of escalating intimidation.
