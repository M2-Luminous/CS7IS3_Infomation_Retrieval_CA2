The meeting was chaired by Director Lourdes Mijan and included many municipal representatives. One of the topics, among others of great interest, was preparations for the tariff and metering system that will go into effect on 1 October. I was hoping you could tell us more about this. [Mijan] We are currently preparing for the preparatory work needed before 1 October, when we are supposed to start charging for water with the tariffed service. The metering system will remain in effect in Havana -- that is, those who have meters will be charged according to the meter. We will incorporate those who have broken meters or those who do not have metered service into a fixed rate system. People with metered service have the advantage that if they conserve water, they may not have to pay anything because the limit is 100 liters per person per day -- that is, those who have working meters will only have to pay for sewage service, which is 30 cents per person in cases where they are connected to the sewage service. In case they do not have this service, then they will only be charged for metered water consumption when it exceeds 100 liters. As for the rest of the population, they will be charged a fixed rate at one peso per person plus 30 cents for sewage where they are receiving that service. [Gonzalez] I do not have time to cover everything our listeners would like to know, but I think it would be important if you spoke about those zones that are traditionally without water, such as some areas of Habana Vieja, Centro Habana... [Arredondo, interrupting] We can continue this topic tomorrow if you feel it is necessary. It is fine if you can finish today, but we can extend the report until tomorrow if you need more time. [Gonzalez] It would be a pleasure, but that is something that Lourdes must decide. We will talk about this at the end. Many people are waiting for this information. What more can you tell us? [Mijan] We are currently having difficulties with the water service, difficulties caused by this situation because of the period of the year. We are just entering spring. Rainfall in Havana City was very bad last year. We only had 79 percent of our standard average rainfall. We are entering spring, when there are always many difficulties with the water supplies. [Gonzalez] Excuse me, but there is some confusion among the population. They believe that when it rains, there should not be a water shortage. [Mijan] The problem is that the water supplies do not recover that fast. It will take one month before we feel the effects of the spring rains and our water supplies will recover. Right now, we are having the greatest difficulties in Centro Habana and Habana Vieja because we have a deficit of 90,456 cubic meters per day for the area of Centro Habana compared to last year's figures. This great deficit is also caused by other water sources that supply water to the capital, which at the moment have low water levels. We have made adjustments to the water supply operations in the municipalities that have the greatest water supply problems. We have begun working on a schedule in some places -- such as Vedado, Plaza de la Revolucion, and Diez de Octubre -- in an attempt to conserve water for the two municipalities with the greatest problems. As far as this goes, we believe our sources should recover in the next 15 to 20 days and that the situation will be, more or less, normal. [Gonzalez] I have been following the meeting that just ended. We know of the efforts, the achievements, and the solutions that are about to be implemented. Can you be with us tomorrow? [Mijan] I will have to make an extra effort because I had other things planned for tomorrow. Nevertheless, I will try to be here tomorrow to give you more information on the metered service and the water supply. [Gonzalez] Friends, that is all for today. We will continue tomorrow.
