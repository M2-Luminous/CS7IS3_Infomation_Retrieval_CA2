Choe Myong-hak, 34, and Kim Tae-pom, 32, arrived at Kimpo Airport carrying Russian passports, the NSP said. Kim was born in Songchon, South Pyongan Province, and Choe is from Najin, North Hamkyong Province. Both of the men left behind families in North Korea. In 1989, they were dispatched to a lumber factory near Khabarovsk, Russia, where they worked as drivers. They left the factory last July and gained Russian passports using the names of ethnic Koreans there. Sunday's incident marks the first time that North Koreans have entered South Korea by plane and defected.
