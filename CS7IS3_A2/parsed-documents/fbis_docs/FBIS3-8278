Vychodil (ODS), head of the parliamentary mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, by Nada Adamickova; place and date not given: "The World Does Not Perceive the Controversial Statements by Our Representative All That Dramatically"] [Text] [Adamickova] Do you agree that, in foreign policy and related matters, party interests should not dominate? [Vychodil] I agree absolutely. As a matter of fact, if the party interests dominated somewhere, which is not the case, I would consider it fatal for our foreign policy. [Adamickova] So, you do not consider the big ado regarding Foreign Committee Chairman J. Payne, when even the Civic Democratic Party [ODS] itself had significant objections to his statements but defended him on the outside because his "recall was demanded by the opposition," to be a promotion of party interests? [Vychodil] I will take the liberty of answering this direct question diplomatically because what you are referring to is actually diplomacy. The matter in question is really a parliamentary experiment with a coexistence of fire and water, with the provision that the fire must not be extinguished and water must not be heated up very much. Hence, it is a certain type of art, which man must learn to command. He has to learn in what area and on what topic he is to comment. Regarding the statements by colleague Payne, then, I know his views because he is a friend and colleague of mine, one of the most diligent people in this Chamber. What has been published does not completely correspond to his opinions. [Adamickova] Nevertheless, at the session of the Foreign Committee, at which Payne was explaining his trip and statements he made in the United States, a detailed recording was heard of the meeting with compatriots, including precisely the phrases that appeared in the Czech press. [Vychodil] Unfortunately, I did not take part in this session because I was abroad. Therefore, I cannot comment. [Adamickova] Would you not agree that the Foreign Committee chairman should be more careful with what he says because he could possibly damage the interests of the Republic abroad? [Vychodil] The question is how the statements by our politicians are perceived in the world--namely, I do not believe that statements made by the representatives of our parliament are perceived as neuralgically as we imagine. That is hardly the case. I believe that it is rather an internal affair. It is certain, however, that, given certain circumstances--i.e., if there were some hostile feelings against our Republic, it cannot be ruled out that the effect of some statements could be used against us. In this instance, however, it certainly did not happen. [Adamickova] Do you believe it proper that your committee dealt with Payne's statements? [Vychodil] I believe that the Foreign Committee is an autonomous body of the Chamber and can deal with whatever it sees appropriate. This right cannot be questioned. As far as my personal opinion goes, I do not believe it good if it deals with the statements of its chairman in his absence. [Adamickova] The second time around, however, your committee dealt with the statements in the presence of its chairman, who declared that they should deal with foreign policy rather than matters of personnel.... [Vychodil] I repeat again that the committee can deal with whatever it considers appropriate. It is simply a question of majority democracy. If the opposition holds a majority on the committee, it is a different matter entirely. [Adamickova] How do you feel about our foreign policy suffering the malady of dearth of coordination? [Vychodil] Of course, I am of the opinion that foreign policy should be coordinated and clear-cut. We have to realize one thing, however: Disparate statements by different representatives of the same state are nothing unusual. That is again overestimating something on our part. Let us take a specific example of the North Atlantic Alliance ultimatum to Bosnia, for instance. It is possible that, in statements for the press, various sides of the same problem are emphasized. One more, one less. Thus, it depends on what is more important from the point of view of that representative. Personally, I do not see it as a tragedy, and it is not perceived dramatically in the world. On the other hand, I must say frankly that our Republic is judged from a different perspective. What is only recorded in the instance of traditionally democratic countries is occasionally dramatized in our instance. Fortunately, this trend exists only here. [Adamickova] Excuse me, but I cannot agree with you regarding the specific example of the Bosnia ultimatum when you speak about the unequal emphasis. The difference between the statements by the president and the prime minister certainly was not one of emphasis but of a completely different stance. [Vychodil] Allow me to polemicize. We have here the resolution adopted by the Foreign Committee on the situation in Bosnia. When you read it, you will find that both aforementioned views fit in there, and it really is just a matter of emphasis. It is one thing if we emphasize the force of the ultimatum, and another the bombing itself. We know that it is a dangerous thing, and the consequences can hardly be imagined. [Adamickova] How do you, as the head of our parliamentary mission to the North Atlantic Assembly, view this problem? [Vychodil] I do not believe that the conflict in Bosnia was brought there from without but, rather, that it is a problem that was dormant there. It is a very complex issue, where the Catholic civilization meets with the orthodox and the Muslim ones. The entire local history is very complex, and I see it as a conflict of cultures. I believe that the conflict cannot be solved in simple terms, and, to be frank, I do not know a responsible person who could imagine such a solution. I am convinced that the conflict cannot be solved from without. In any instance of a simplification, it may result in a threat to the security of not only that region but also the entire Balkans and, by extension, Europe. And we are only a six-hour drive from there. We must realize this and be very careful with various strong and unqualified statements. [Adamickova] Do you believe that, if I accept your theory of different emphases, Czech interests could not have been damaged? [Vychodil] It certainly was recorded, but just as certainly it will not damage our interests. [Adamickova] Several days ago, your committee dealt with the preparations of a trip to Germany. This occurred after the parliamentary delegation began its visit to the German Parliament last December in a rather awkward way. Do you not believe it late to prepare a trip at the time when a faux pas takes place? [Vychodil] I believe that preparations for a trip should be a matter of fact. Nevertheless--and do not take this as an excuse but, rather, as a statement of fact--we learn certain things by the hit-and-miss method. The misses are sometimes painful; at other times they are not. [Adamickova] In a RUDE PRAVO interview, former Foreign Minister Dienstbier criticized some of our politicians for their opinion that what is happening east of us should not be at the center of our attention. Do you agree? [Vychodil] I am deeply convinced that what is happening east of us must be at the center of our attention rather than not. Not to care about it could be fatal. I insist on this, regardless of what the politicians Dienstbier mentioned are like. [Adamickova] At the same time, Dienstbier said that we had the opportunity to become the country we claim to be on the occasion of Bill Clinton's visit, but we did not use it. What is your opinion? [Vychodil] Our country gained respect by the U.S. President's choice of it as the place to go. That speaks for itself. Regarding the respect per se, it is necessary to follow foreign press and statements by foreign politicians, who tend to agree that the Czech Republic is the best off of all of the postcommunist countries. That, I believe, is the best evidence. Moreover, I cannot imagine how we could prove this respect. By a one-time act or a declaration? After all, the world is not moved by opinions but, rather, by people and their cooperation, if I am to phrase it in a somewhat elevated manner. [Adamickova] Do you agree that the belief that if someone is admitted to NATO, it would be the Czech Republic first, and no one will joint the Alliance without it is exaggerated? I am referring to Payne's statements made in the United States. [Vychodil] I am not talking about entry into NATO but, rather, an integration of world security structures. If countries are to join, they must know everything it involves. That is not just having a protecting umbrella. It also means a certain economic burden and, especially, a certain way of assuming responsibility. In other words, if countries want to join the Alliance, they must be democratic and economically stable, and membership can be built on that. I emphasize again that it is not some act or declaration but a process. [Adamickova] You have not answered my question.... [Vychodil] I tried to answer it fully. Regarding your question, it is possible that we will be first to join NATO. It is also possible that it will be someone else. I would applaud him and certainly not envy him.
