Samper Pizano, a 43-year-old Bogota attorney and economist, former financial leader, former senator, former minister, and former ambassador to Spain, won the ruling Liberal Party's "internal primary" and became the presidential candidate for the 1994-98 term to replace President Cesar Gaviria. "I am satisfied and happy with the results," Samper said, thanking those who voted for him in the primary, which was held simultaneously with the legislative elections. He said he is "committed with all Colombians of goodwill." "Our challenge is to seek a new opportunity so the liberal ideas will continue to prevail to the benefit of all Colombians," Samper said. He vowed to return to the policy of credibility. If he wins in May he will head the third consecutive Liberal administration since 1986. Ernesto Samper, whose victory will be affirmed on 18 March during his party's national convention, obtained 46 percent of the votes, beating Humberto de la Calle, Carlos Lleras de la Fuente, Carlos Lemos, Rodolfo Gonzalez, David Turbay, and Gloria Gaitan. Samper urged his rivals to "set aside our differences to join in the common task of reuniting, renewing, and transforming the party, to achieve a rapprochement," not in exchange for bureaucratic posts, rather, through "basic understanding." He also announced the economic opening carried out by current President Gaviria, under whom Samper was development minister and ambassador to Spain, must be complemented by creating more jobs and "improving many Colombians' standards of living." "The people have spoken and have shown they still trust Liberalism, its principles and ideas, as the best way to govern Colombia," Samper said. He said the liberal majority elected in the Congress today "must be confirmed by a triumph in the presidential elections." "The people of Colombia, as in other parts of Latin America, want a change of course. They want more job opportunities and better living conditions for their families," the Colombian candidate stated. Although the 8 May presidential elections will have 10 candidates from different parties, Samper and Conservative presidential hopeful Andres Pastrana are favorites and have registered a "technical tie," according to recent polls.
