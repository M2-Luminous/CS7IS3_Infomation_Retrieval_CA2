Informed sources said the ceasefire request was made by the Thai-Cambodian Border Coordinating Office to the two warring factions. The ceasefire, which took effect yesterday, was observed by the two rival factions permitting farmers of Tambon Tha Kham and Tambon Klong Namsai to harvest rice crops and move out rice stocks from Nong Ian, a small piece of Thai territory which juts into Cambodia. Several artillery and mortar shells as well as rockets fired by both the Cambodian Government and Khmer Rouge have smashed into Nong Ian, which is uninhabitated [as published] since fighting broke out a week ago. One Thai villager was recently killed by shrapnel from a stray shell. A Border Patrol unit yesterday went into Nong Ian where they found two unexploded shells which were eventually detonated. Quoting Thai traders who travelled into Cambodia, informed sources said the two warring factions had taken advantage of the ceasefire to regroup and beef up their forces. Trucks carrying supplies and troops were seen rumbling on highways in Ban Nimit and Battambang.
