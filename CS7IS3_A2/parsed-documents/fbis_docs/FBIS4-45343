His appointment was a surprise, given the official's personal background. While he was governor of Jalisco, the drug traffic began to thrive in that state. The "narcos" were operating under the protection of Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, who had total impunity. As attorney general, Alvarez del Castillo admitted having had "the misfortune to learn, during my term as governor of Jalisco, that Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was the brains of the group" formed by Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Carrillo. However, he said nothing about the 14 arrest warrants against Felix Gallardo, three of which were issued while he was governor, without ever being implemented. During the trial for the murder of the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] agent, Enrique Camarena Salazar, Javier Vazquez Velasco, an ex-judicial policeman and aide of Caro Quintero, claimed: "Alvarez del Castillo was involved in the drug traffic." At the time, the official responded: "That is loose talk, attempting to implicate me." During his brief stay (a year and a half) in the PGR, Alvarez del Castillo was accused of systematically violating human rights and tolerating corruption and impunity among PJF [Federal Judicial Police] agents. For that reason, he had serious confrontations with the National Commission for Human Rights [CNDH], especially in connection with the cases involving Norma Corona and Francisco Valencia Fontes. [passage omitted] Ignacio Morales Lechuga arrived to replace him and, as soon as he took office, asserted that the PGR must be an agency promoting legality. He also promised to do an effective job in maintaining absolute respect for human rights and in forcefully combating impunity, "which is defeating our legal standards and has undermined the rule of law." The now Mexican ambassador to France immediately revised plans and work programs, dismissing some 100 federal agents and remanding others implicated in human rights violations. The latter included Mario Alberto Gonzalez Trevino, accused of being the brains behind the death of Norma Corona. Nevertheless, the cleanup did not include police chiefs who later were accused of illicit acquisition of wealth and of giving protection to drug traffickers. They included Guillermo Gonzalez Calderoni (a fugitive from justice), Fulvio Jimenez Turengano, and Adolfo Mondragon Aguirre. Despite Morales Lechuga's intentions of making the PGR an institution promoting legality, it was soon realized that his words were having no repercussions on his subordinates. Human rights violations prevailed, although to a lesser extent. The first Morales Lechuga-Carpizo confrontation occurred over the case relating to political columnist Victor Manuel Oropeza, murdered in Ciudad Juarez. The CNDH accused the PGR of having fabricated the charges against those blamed. The CNDH opinion in the Tlalixcoyan case (a confrontation between the military and the Federal Judicial Police involving a drug trafficking matter) was another severe blow to Morales Lechuga. After this incident, which occurred on 6 November 1992, his right-hand man, Federico Ponce Rojas, was dismissed, just as Javier Coello Trejo had been in Alvarez del Castillo's time. Morales Lechuga became embroiled in more problems when the PGR exonerated Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain, after the Los Angeles court suspended the trial being held against him as a presumed participant in the death of DEA agent Camarena Salazar. On 27 April 1990, Alvarez del Castillo had claimed that the PGR had more than sufficient evidence to take action against the Jalisco physician. At the end of 1992, the battle among various drug trafficking groups intensified, causing a heightening of the violence in the northern part of the country. The shooting confrontation occurred at the Christine discotheque in Puerto Vallarta, persons close to Caro Quintero were killed in Iguala, and bombs exploded in Culiacan. It was later learned that in all these cases the PJF had given protection to drug trafficking rings. Displeased by this situation, Salinas de Gortari decided to oust Morales Lechuga. To replace him, he named Jorge Carpizo, the present secretary of government, then head of the CNDH. Direct, and without misgivings, the ex-rector of the UNAM [National Autonomous University of Mexico] and minister on leave from the National Supreme Court criticized the performance of his predecessors. He declared: "It is impossible for agents of the law and of society to violate legal standards in combating crime." He maintained that this battle must be waged based on the legal system and human rights: "Mexico demands a better prosecution of justice and better public safety. Crime, especially that associated with the drug traffic, must be fought with complete firmness and total determination." Carpizo's first victims were the PGR agents linked with the drug traffic and engaged in acts contrary to the law. Over 100 policemen were dismissed, removed, or subjected to penal remand. Rodolfo Leon Aragon, chief of the PJF, was one of the first to leave the PGR. The departure of the police commander who had survived the first two shakeups in the PGR enabled Carpizo to create the National Institute To Combat Drugs, with Jorge Tello Peon as director. Upon Carpizo's arrival in the Government Secretariat, Tello Peon was transferred to the National Center for Investigation and Security. Then Carpizo, contrary to his principles of acting with the law as his criterion, directed a campaign against journalists presumably implicated in the drug traffic. Congressman Cesareo Morales, Mario Munguia, Mario Rivas, and Heriberto Deandar Martinez, among many others, were accused. In all four cases, the judges rejected the evidence submitted by the PGR. The weakness in remands submitted by the PGR during the Carpizo era also enabled gunmen and small-scale drug dealers to obtain their release. For example, there was the case of Ramon Alcides Magana and Adan Segundo Canales, gunmen for the "capo," Amado Carrillo Fuentes. Both were later arrested and remanded in connection with the incidents that occurred on 24 November 1993 at the Ochoa Bali-Hai restaurant. After this, Carpizo charged that members of the Federal Judicial Branch were acting suspiciously when they were required to issue their court decisions. [passage omitted] Dedicated to capturing drug traffickers, Carpizo disregarded the criminals engaged in kidnapping, which has increased considerably in the country. Salinas de Gortari removed Carpizo from the PGR, sending him to the Government Secretariat. Diego Valades, who was in the capital's attorney general's office, became head of that department, in the fourth shakeup of officials in five years. Like his predecessors, Valades promised to guarantee the population's public safety. The recent incidents occurring in Tijuana and Mexico City, where crime has risen five percent over last year's level, according to official data, prove that there has been little progress in that area.
