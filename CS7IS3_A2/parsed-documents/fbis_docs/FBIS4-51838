The consumer sentiment index for the first quarter stood at a seasonally adjusted 38.1, up 5.6 percent from the October-December quarter, said the Economic Planning Agency. The index is a gauge of consumer expectations as to whether or not things will improve in six months' time in five areas including labor, income and prices. An agency official said the recovery in consumer sentiment was mainly because the number of people with pessimistic outlooks was declining, rather than those with optimistic projections increasing.
