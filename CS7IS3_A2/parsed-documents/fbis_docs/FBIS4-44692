The accord was signed by the general director of the French space agency, Jean-Daniel Levi, and his ISA counterpart Marcel Klajn. It had been discussed during the visit of French foreign affairs minister, Alain Juppe, to Israel in February. Israel and France have already collaborated in the past, since the Amos satellite was built by Israeli Aeronautics Industries, Alcatel (France), and Dornier (Germany). It is slated to be launched next year by an Ariane rocket. The two agencies will work together "to use space for peaceful ends and for economic and scientific development," in accordance with the terms of this "arrangement defining a framework for collaboration in space." The accord should also stimulate joint space projects between the two countries and their industries. It will cover space research in the fields of astronomy, solar system exploration, Earth sciences, biology, space medicine, and microgravity physics. It will also involve applications in Earth and environmental observation, weather forecasting, systems for collecting and localizing environmental data, communications, and the positioning of satellites. The two agencies will work together on space techniques relative to robotics, small satellites, space technology, and quality-reliability problems. A mixed committee bolstered by expert working groups will coordinate their work.
