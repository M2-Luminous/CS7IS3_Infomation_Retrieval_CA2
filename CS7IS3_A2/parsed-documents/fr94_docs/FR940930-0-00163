FR940930-0-00163 FR940930-0-00028 b. Certification requirements. Dedicated, dual, or flexible fuel conversions of light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles/engines may qualify as CFVs. CFV conversions must meet the CFV emission standards (LEV, ULEV, or ZEV) prescribed in 40 CFR Part 88 (as described in the previous section on light-duty and heavy-duty standards) and must also meet the applicable emission standards and provisions of Part 86 which apply to all vehicles to the extent they are not superseded by the requirements of Part 88. In addition, the conversion must comply with the requirements of the regulations being promulgated today to qualify as a CFV. A separate certification is required for each conversion configuration to be used with a given model year vehicle/engine for each certifier desiring to perform such a conversion. The conversion configuration certification will also be eligible for carryover to future model years only if the OEM vehicle/engine is also certified under carryover provisions and no changes occurred in the conversion configuration. A dual-fuel or flexible fuel conversion must be certified according to the general requirements for dual-fuel/flexible fuel vehicles discussed in section A.1.a above. It should be noted that a certificate issued for a given model year expires on December 31st of that calendar year, after which time a conversion under that certificate may no longer be performed. A conversion for a given model year may be introduced for sale prior to January 1st of that year, but in no case may a conversion be introduced prior to January 1st of the preceding year. i. Small-volume manufacturers certification program_volume limits. Consistent with the Gaseous Fuels Rule, today's rule establishes that a conversion configuration may be certified according to the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program (55 FR 7178, February 28, 1990) and that certifiers of conversion configurations will be treated the same as small volume manufacturers for this purpose. In the Gaseous Fuels NPRM and in the proposal for this rule, EPA proposed that all certifiers of conversion configurations be permitted to use the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program, regardless of the annual volume of conversions. Public comment on the gaseous fuels NPRM 33 was received that suggested that the production volume limits that currently define a small volume vehicle manufacturer under 40 CFR 86.092&hyph;14 should also apply to parties seeking to certify a conversion configuration. The Agency agrees with this comment and believes that given the anticipated increase in demand for conversions in response to a variety of federal and state programs, it is reasonable to believe that existing or future manufacturers may produce more than 10,000 converted vehicles annually at some point in the future. (No current company produces this number of conversions). EPA does not believe it would be equitable for certifiers with sales or production of more than 10,000 converted vehicles to take advantage of the Small Volume Manufacturer's Certification Program when that program is not available to manufacturers of more than 10,000 new vehicles. EPA believes it would be inappropriate to provide relief designed for small volume manufacturers to entities that sell or produce more than 10,000 converted vehicles annually. 33 Materials relevant to the Gaseous Fuels NPRM have been placed in the public docket, No. A&hyph;92&hyph;14. Thus, consistent with the approach taken in the Gaseous Fuels Rule, EPA believes that the volume limits that currently apply to manufacturers seeking to certify under the provisions for small volume manufacturers should also apply to parties seeking to certify under the CFF program. Small-volume aftermarket conversion certifiers will also have the option of using the EPA full certification program prescribed in 40 CFR 86.094&hyph;23. Aftermarket conversion certifiers with annual sales or production volume of more than 10,000 converted vehicles should be required to use the EPA full certification program. While the sales volume limit in the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program applies to sales for a particular model year, conversion companies may certify conversion configurations based on engine families from older model years. To accommodate this, the 10,000 vehicle limit will apply to the aggregate total of all vehicles converted within a calendar year by a given aftermarket conversion certifier at all of its installation facilities without regard to the model year of the original vehicles upon which the configurations are based. All vehicle conversions within a calendar year will be considered when determining whether the 10,000 vehicle limit is exceeded including those converted under the CFF program, the Gaseous Fuels Rule, and Memorandum 1A. Apart from this difference, all provisions related to the sales volume limit under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program would apply (40 CFR Part 86, as promulgated by 55 FR 7178, February 28, 1990).
