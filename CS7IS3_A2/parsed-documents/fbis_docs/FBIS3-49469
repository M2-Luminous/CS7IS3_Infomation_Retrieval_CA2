It is justifiable to say that this is not a decisive viewpoint because, after all, it makes no difference what the applying parties want from the club if its statutes and rules have been laid down without them and will not be changed for their sake. However, it is an essential viewpoint that the "Visegrad" countries do not wish to take a common stand or act as a "group exercising pressure" on behalf of their own future and, let us admit, this does not strengthen their position. Even if the assertion of the will originating from this side would be extremely limited anyway. The lack of such a will is basically to be found in the attitude of the Czech Republic, or more exactly in the attitude of Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. I would like to remind readers that the independent Czech Republic was exactly five days old when, in an interview given to LE FIGARO, Klaus expressed his lack of interest in the "Visegrad" cooperation, and made it clear that, by becoming independent, the Czech Republic did not only "get rid" of the Slovaks, but also of Poland and Hungary. Consequently, the Czech Republic does not want to share the common label that might characterize the "Visegrad" Group in one way or another either at the NATO level or the EC level. In Klaus's view, such a label would harm the Czech Republic. It would harm them, because Klaus regards his own republic as being in a much better condition than Poland or Hungary; as for Slovakia, he does not even consider it worth mentioning. I would not comment on this view but, from the viewpoint of NATO membership, I would point out the advantageous situation obviously enjoyed by the Czech Republic. A glance at the map is sufficient to show that, of the "Visegrad" countries, only the Czech Republic has no direct borders with the former Soviet Union; consequently, Moscow, which continues to think in "empire" terms, can have much less of a quarantine feeling in connection with the affiliation of the Czech Republic than with the possible NATO membership of Hungary, Poland, or Slovakia. In other words, if Moscow's sensitivity is the basic reason for NATO's reluctance to accept the "Visegrad" Group, then the Czech Republic, which is in a geopolitically favorable position, is the least to blame for causing this sensitivity. However, one can easily predict that, after the NATO summit and for the time being, the "Visegrad" countries will fall under the "uniform label" so much criticized by Klaus; it is unimaginable that the NATO would offer more to the Czechs than to us, for example. However, this will definitely not hinder Vaclav Klaus in continuing his tough struggle for the priority of the Czech Republic, and it is to be feared that, just like the Poles, Hungarian diplomacy will seek "sponsors" for the same thing. For quite some time, Brzezinski called Poland "candidate number one" and we should also consider the strong Polish lobby in the United States. To unsuspicious eyes, the "summit" in Prague could give the impression that "Visegrad" -- an existing formation -- is actually not something alive and its members are not bound by a solidarity of the type of "either together or not at all." And the selfish and arrogant Klaus is to be blamed for all this.
