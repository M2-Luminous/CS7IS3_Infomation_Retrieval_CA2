Pol Lt Col [Police Lieutenant Colonel] Nithi Charucharit, deputy commander of mounted police, said he has already submitted a letter to acting police chief Prathin Santiprapop seeking a review of the reshuffle list. Nithi said his seniority met the criteria for advancement, but he was overlooked. He is a law graduate of Ramkhamhaeng University. He said he has been a deputy superintendent for nine years without any sign of being advanced. Some of the officers promoted in the reshuffle had far less seniority. Metropolitan police commissioner Pol Lt Gen [Police Lieutenant General] Chamlong Iamchaengphan had recognized his abilities in a certificate, Nithi said, but did not have the authority to change the reshuffle. Pol Lt Col Thawisak Tuchinda, deputy superintendent of a special unit, has also petitioned Prathin to reconsider the reshuffle. Pol Maj Gen [Police Major General] Suwan Suwandecho, a senior police of General Affairs Division, also said he will forward a protest letter to deputy interior ministers Suthat Ngoenmun (Democrat) and Chamni Sakdiset (Phalang Tham) requesting the reshuffle of 130 police generals be reconsidered. Suwan said justice should prevail in every reshuffle.
