The committee met overnight Saturday under the chairmanship of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat to listen to briefings by the organisation's political department chief Faruq Qaddumi on the Jordan negotiations and Ahmad Quray', the head of the delegation holding economic talks with Israel in Paris. The Jordan-Palestine Liberation Organisation accord, signed Friday, followed the broad outlines of a draft economic deal Amman had wanted signed. Both sides have praised the agreement which calls for setting up Jordanian banks and using the Jordanian dinar in the occupied territories as the main currency, cooperating in trade and investing jointly in industry, agriculture, tourism, health and other domains. The executive committee endorsed the Jordan declaration, member 'Ali Ishaq told AFP. King Husayn had become increasingly irritated by 'Arafat's handling of the peace process and warned the PLO that he was giving it a final chance to agree on cooperation. Stock market officials in Jordan said Sunday the accord had triggered a 3.7 percent rise in Amman's stock market activity. The volume of exchange transactions has also registered an increase with an average of 11.3 million dinars (about 16 million dollars) per day, approaching the 1992 record of 16.5 million dollars daily. The size of exchange had been stable at around 15 million dollars per day during 1993. The PLO executive also reviewed the latest achievements in talks held with Israel on economic cooperation, based on a report by Quray', who is also known as Abu-Ala'. The next round of economic talks will be held Monday and Tuesday. "We have not registered tangible progress," said a member of the PLO executive who requested anonymity. "Any progress in the economic talks remains dependent on the evolution of the political negotiations process," Ishaq said. The economic cooperation talks have snagged over the question of finance and money with the PLO insisting on issuing its own currency and central bank as part of the future autonomy.
