This necessitates selection of priority pollutants which must be analyzed in critical ecotoxicological situations (KETS) when the contamination sources are unknown and there are no data on the chemical compounds which led to the critical ecotoxicological situation. The principal criteria which determine the chemical substance priority (or ranking) depend on the medium for which its danger is being assessed. The danger classes of organic compounds and danger classes of organic compounds based on their persistence and sorption ability in the soil are summarized; altogether, five classes are identified on the basis of lethal doses (LD[.sub]50[/]) and lethal concentrations (CL[.sub]50[/]) as well as maximum permissible concentrations (PDK) established by the Public Health Ministry. The study made it possible to identify the principal list containing 82 substances and eight compound classes and a supplementary list of 47 compounds which are to be analyzed in the soil during critical ecotoxicological situations.
