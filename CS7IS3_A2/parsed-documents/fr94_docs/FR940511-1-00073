ACTION: Proposed rule and request for comments. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to amend the regulations for hazardous waste management under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) by listing as hazardous waste solids and filter cartridges from the production of 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The Agency is also proposing to add 2,4,6-tribromophenol to the list of commercial chemical products that are hazardous wastes when discarded. As a necessary part of this hazardous waste listing EPA is proposing to add 2,4,6-tribromophenol to the RCRA list of hazardous constituents. This proposed regulation, if promulgated, will subject the listed 2,4,6-tribromophenol wastes to regulation as hazardous wastes under Subtitle C of RCRA. In addition, 2,4,6-tribromophenol and the listed wastes will automatically become hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). EPA is proposing for purposes of immediate release reporting under CERCLA section 103 a reportable quantity (RQ) of 100 pounds for 2,4,6-tribromophenol and the listed wastes. Also, EPA is proposing not to list as hazardous nine waste streams from the production of bromochloromethane, ethyl bromide, tribromophenol, octabromodiphenyl oxide, decabromodiphenyl oxide, and to defer action on one waste stream from the production of tetrabromobisphenol-A. DATES: EPA will accept public comments on this proposed listing determination until July 11, 1994. Comments postmarked after this date will be marked ``late'' and may not be considered. Any person may request a public hearing on this proposal by filing a request with Mr. David Bussard, whose address appears below, by May 26, 1994.
