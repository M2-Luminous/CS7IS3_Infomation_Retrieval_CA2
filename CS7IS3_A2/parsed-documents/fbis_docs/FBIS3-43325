Despite this, we are still using the Ethiopian currency. When will we stop using this currency? [Isayas, in Arabic followed by Tigrinya translation] We will continue with the said currency until an ongoing study has been accomplished. Eritrean currency will be printed after all the requirements have been fulfilled. [passage omitted] [Reporter] What is the objective of this so-called jihad movement? Are there any religious problems in Eritrea? [Isayas, in Tigrinya] What we should understand here is that the problem is not the political situation in Eritrea. [passage omitted] Even if the jihad movement objectives are to intensify religion in Eritrea, we are not new believers. Religion has strong roots in our society. [passage omitted] We should not see this new incident as a problem because this issue is not the problem of Eritrea. It is a problem that is coming from outside Eritrea. What we should understand is that this issue is of a foreign origin. There is no reason for foreigners to come and fight here. The objective is to destabilize the prevailing peace and stability of the region. [passage omitted] It is not a big threat to us. Our fear is that we do not want the existing relationship we have with our neighbors to be affected as a result of the prevailing situation. [Reporter] Eritrea is one of the countries of the region which is actively working to safeguard peace and stability in our region. If we turn to the question of Sudan, Eritrea is one of the countries which is working hard to solve the problem of southern Sudan peacefully, so why is Sudan taking a hostile stance? [Isayas] It is not a secret that the Sudanese Government and its political forces are the ones who are supporting them by giving them space to (?organize). It is also no secret that the (?movement) is supported by forces from other regions. It is difficult to name them and they are not officially connected with countries. However, it is not the right time to name them. The war was declared a long time ago. We could have responded negatively, but this is not our wish, because the consequences would be very bad. [passage omitted] Despite all these things, we will not stop supporting Sudan or strengthening our relations with Sudan. We will continue to maintain our tolerant relationship with Sudan. Those who are actively involved in the jihad movement are the frustrated ones. If the movement had the people's support it could have not declared such a war against the people. [Reporter] There are some forces who want to destabilize the stability of this region using religion as a cover. The jihad in Eritrea is coming from Sudan. Kenya and Ethiopia are said to have the same problem. Is there any plan to solve this common problem jointly? [Isayas] Our policy is to include these matters in our bilateral relations, and we will continue to do so. It is appropriate to issue this message on the regional and international level. Since the problem is coming from Sudan, we will try to solve it with Sudan. If other countries are facing the same problem, then I think those countries should also try to solve it on the same basis.
