After completing the academy, he was assigned Russian Federation Ministry of Defense Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate liaison chief. The RF Ministry of Defense Information-Analysis Center was founded in 1992. Pavel Semenovich became its Chief -- Deputy Chief of the Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Pavel Semenovich, I recently had the opportunity to meet with many leaders of defense enterprises. We all know that the defense industry is in an economically difficult position that is associated with the reduction of orders. The leaders understand the need for these reductions, however, they are making complaints against the state which has not defined what it will buy from them. This, as I understand it, is associated with the absence of a military doctrine in the Russian Federation and with the uncertainty of the future structure of our Armed Forces. There probably should be an Armed Forces structural development program that will be supported by an arms program. What is the situation in the Russian Federation on this issue? [Zolotarev] You are correct, the absence of an officially adopted Russian military doctrine is already making itself known. There never was a military doctrine in the Soviet Union as an integrated, officially adopted document that reflects the system of fundamental views on the possible nature of war, the methods for conducting it, military structural development and preparation of the country and the Armed Forces for war. It was thought that these issues found adequate reflection in the speeches of Party and state leaders and in Party and government decisions. Therefore, the question on the need to formulate a military doctrine as a separate document was practically never raised. All the more so that the opinion existed and exists that this approach can also be preserved in Russia. However, that point of view is erroneous. And the fact is not only that the speeches of the representatives of the federal organs of rule are frequently contradictory in nature and cannot permit us to compile an integrated picture of views on issues of military doctrine. The essence is something else. The period of global confrontation of the two ideologies and the two irreconcilable systems has quite naturally resulted in adequate clarity of doctrinal positions. Now the state's policy in accordance with the RF Law "On Security" must be structured while proceeding from the need to ensure the protection of the interests of the individual, society and the state. Military doctrine must also be subordinate to that goal. This approach is characteristic for the majority of the world's developed countries. However, it suggests the presence of an established mechanism of activity of the organs of state rule for the analysis of vitally important interests of the individual, society and the state and the detection of existing and potential threats to these interests, the determination of directions for their neutralization in all spheres of security -- economic, military, ecological, etc. These directions are normally reflected in the national security concept. In turn, the national security concept must serve as the basis for planning the state's activities in the spheres of politics, economics, military policy, ecology, etc. In the military policy sphere, the security concept serves to form the military doctrine and the Armed Forces structural development concept. While considering that changes of the above-named interests and threats to these interests are sufficiently dynamic in nature, the security concept is made more precise each year. When necessary, changes are made to military doctrine and to the Armed Forces structural development concept. Unfortunately, that mechanism of activity of the organs of state rule has not yet been formed in Russia. However, we do have the fundamental law for the realization of that mechanism. That is the Law "On the Security of the Russian Federation". The key organ in that system -- the RF Security Council -- is building up its capabilities. Therefore, I suggest that in the near future our organs of state rule will also operate along that same classic scheme as other of the world's most developed countries. Nevertheless, in Russian Armed Forces structural development we cannot wait until they give us a Russian security concept and military doctrine. We are also not waiting. The RF Ministry of Defense Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate was formed practically simultaneously with the decision on the formation of the Russian Armed Forces in May 1992. This was the very first directorate in the Russian Ministry of Defense. Two months after the issuance of the RF Presidential Edict on the Formation of the Russian Armed Forces, their appearance in the immediate future and long-term was discussed in the Security Council. The Ministry of Defense was assigned the task of submitting an Armed Forces structural development concept to the RF President by 1 September 1992. The Military Structural Development and Reform Directorate, jointly with the General Staff and other Ministry of Defense directorates, developed that concept and submitted it for the review of the Russian President on 31 August 1992. It did not receive official approval but Armed Forces structural development is proceeding in accordance with its primary provisions. Active work on the military doctrine began during the spring of this year under the aegis of the Security Council. The Ministry of Defense very actively participated in this work. The primary provisions of the Russian military doctrine should have been reviewed in the Security Council in October 1993 in accordance with the President's task. At the same time, work is proceeding in the Ministry of Defense to make more precise the previously developed Russian Armed Forces structural development concept. So, toward the end of 1993, we will have all of the primary documents that define military policy and Armed Forces structural development. However, in your question, you linked military doctrine and the Armed Forces structural development concept with the plan for weapons and military equipment orders. The interrelation is obvious but the difficulties with the defense order are associated not so much with these documents as with the absence of a defense budget and with inadequate financing of the Armed Forces. Requirements for weapons and military equipment are known but the order is being determined not by our requirements but by the state's capabilities. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Can you note some of the distinctive features of the draft military doctrine? [Zolotarev] Yes, I can. It encompasses not only the Armed Forces, the concept of military force is being introduced which includes the Armed Forces, the internal troops, the border troops, and all other military security support men and equipment which are prescribed by the Law "On Security". Therefore, aspects of not only external but also internal security are reflected in the military doctrine. The experience of recent years has taught us that the Armed Forces should not participate in the resolution of internal problems with the exception of participation in the elimination of natural disasters, catastrophes, and the transportation of required men and equipment to reinforce and supply the internal troops but no more. However, it provides for the accomplishment of peacekeeping missions by the Armed Forces as it occurred in South Osetia, Moldova, and also within the framework of the UN decisions in Yugoslavia. The military doctrine is based upon the concept of the state's defense capabilities and not on defensive sufficiency. Right now we have been compelled to utilize this concept due to the severe economic situation in the country. When the economy is stronger, then we will probably return to the concept of defensive sufficiency. While assessing possible military threats to the state, the draft military doctrine views local wars and armed conflicts as more probable than a large-scale war. A large-scale war is viewed only as a possible variant of the undesirable development of an armed conflict or local wars. Primarily deterrent functions are assigned to nuclear weapons, that is, they are seen not as a weapon for conducting war but as a political weapon that is designed for deterrence from unleashing a large-scale war. A section dedicated to the political goals of the utilization of military force and the state's missions in the sphere of defense in peacetime, in a threatened period and in wartime is contained in the first portion of the draft military doctrine. The new issues of socio-political support of military security are included in this section. The second section contains the doctrine's purely military bases which reflect the purely military aspect. This section characterizes the possible nature of wars and military conflicts, the goal of the employment of the Armed Forces, the distinctive features of the initial period of war and the missions of the Armed Forces in a large war and in military conflicts. The principles and directions of military structural development are reflected in classic form. The draft doctrine does not provide for revolutionary structural changes of the Armed Forces. The task is assigned to scientifically substantiate, by 1995, military reform until the year 2000, while taking into account the state's material and financial capabilities. The section on military-technical policy reflects the principles of its conduct while considering the fact that the form of ownership is changing in our state. The RF military-industrial complex's principles of development are reflected here. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] What is the fate of the Unified Armed Forces that the CIS previously planned to have? [Zolotarev] The cooperation of the RF Armed Forces with the armed forces of the states that we call the "near abroad" is being carried out both on a bilateral basis and on a multilateral basis within the CIS and now within the framework of the Treaty on Collective Security. We think that it is this Treaty that can and should become the center of military-political cooperation of all CIS states. Right now, when all 15 states that signed the treaty on 15 May 1992 have ratified the Treaty on Collective Security, we face the task of more rapidly stepping up the mechanism for its implementation. Definite steps in that direction were undertaken at the Council of Ministers of Defense and Foreign Affairs sessions that recently took place. Specifically, decisions were made to reorganize the CIS Unified Armed Forces High Command into the CIS Member-States Military Cooperation Coordination Staff. We have in mind that this staff will become the working organ of the Council of Ministers of Defense. Its functions will specifically include summarizing the proposals of the ministries (committees) of defense of the Commonwealth states on issues of military cooperation, preparation of draft agreements on these issues, development of the plans for their implementation and monitoring the accomplishment of these plans. Decisions were also made on initial steps for the implementation of the Treaty on Collective Security and on preparation of a draft Agreement, in accordance with which the member-states of the Treaty on Collective Security will --in the event of the emergence of the appropriate threat -- create Coalition Defense Forces. So, a separate decision was made on the creation of Coalition Defense forces on Tajik territory and the mission, composition and functions of the Unified Command Authorities of these forces were defined for the purpose of adopting urgent collective measures to stabilize the situation in the Republic of Tajikistan. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] How do you assess Russia's interests in the south of the CIS? [Zolotarev] First of all we are interested in the stability of these states and the restoration of economic ties with them. Unfortunately, we still haven't been able to totally preserve stability. Therefore, interests arise that are associated with the Russian Federation's military security. We have been compelled, along with the other CIS countries, to provide not only protection but also defense in a number of sectors of the state border of the former USSR. The last CIS Council of Ministers of Defense session was dedicated to providing security of the border in the south of the CIS. I think that the CIS countries have very many, first of all, common economic interests. Already right now these interests are beginning to objectively facilitate integration processes and strengthen stability in the CIS and also dictate positive progress in politics. It is easier to negotiate the economic and political crisis together than to get out of it alone. [VOORUZHENIYE, POLITIKA, KONVERSIYA] Do you propose to have a document on military reform in the near future? [Zolotarev] There will not be a separate document. These issues will find reflection in the Armed Forces structural development concept.
