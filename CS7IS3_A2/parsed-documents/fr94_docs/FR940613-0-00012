FR940613-0-00012 FR940613-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;139&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8937; AD 94&hyph;12&hyph;09] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that requires inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. This amendment also requires modification of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints. This amendment is prompted by a structural review of Model 747 series airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent rapid decompression of the airplane and the inability to carry fail-safe loads, due to the problems associated with fatigue cracking and corrosion. DATES: Effective July 13, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of July 13, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on February 24, 1994 (59 FR 8875). That action proposed to require inspections to detect fatigue-related skin cracks and corrosion of the skin lap joints in the fuselage upper lobe, and repair, if necessary. That action also proposed to require modification of certain lap joints and inspections of modified lap joints. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. One commenter requests that proposed inspection requirements be revised. This commenter requests that, if the visual inspection [proposed in paragraph (a)(1) of the AD] reveals any evidence of corrosion, operators should be allowed to perform a low frequency eddy current (LFEC) inspection of the entire length of the lap joint to determine if corrosion exceeds 10% of the skin thickness. If this LFEC inspection is accomplished, the commenter also requests that the visual inspection repetitive interval specified in paragraph (a)(1) be extended from the proposed 2,000 landings to 3,000 landings so that the interval corresponds with other major structural inspection intervals. The FAA cannot concur with this request, since the commenter provided neither specific inspection instructions nor data to justify the effectiveness of the proposed procedures. Under the provisions of paragraph (i) of the final rule, however, operators may apply for the approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD, or adjustment of the compliance time, if sufficient justification is presented to the FAA. Two commenters request that proposed paragraph (a) be clarified with regard to the inspections and inspection interval required after a lap joint has been modified. These commenters request that, for lap joints that have been modified by either the full or partial modification procedures described in the referenced Boeing service bulletin, operators be allowed a period of time during which no inspections are required for those lap joints. The referenced Boeing service bulletin, as well as proposed paragraph (f), state that post-modification inspections are to start at 10,000 cycles, 7,000 cycles, or 5,000 cycles after modification of the skin lap joints, depending upon the type of modification that has been accomplished. However, as worded in paragraph (a) of the proposal, the same inspections meant to detect cracks and corrosion in unmodified skin lap joints would be required to be performed on modified skin lap joints until the inspections specified in proposed paragraph (f) begin. The FAA concurs that clarification of this requirement is necessary. It was not the FAA's intent to require that the initial-type of inspections of unmodified lap joints be performed on modified lap joints. Accordingly, paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) have been revised to indicate that the inspections of the specified lap joints are to continue at repetitive intervals only until the lap joints are modified in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e). Several commenters request that the compliance time for accomplishing the ``full'' modification on certain lap joints, as specified in paragraph (b)(2), be extended from the proposed 15 months to 18 months. Additionally, these commenters request that the compliance time for a similar requirement specified in paragraph (c)(2) be extended from the proposed 30 months to 36 months. The commenters state that, by extending these compliance times, operators would be able to accomplish the modification during a scheduled maintenance interval (``C'' check), and thereby eliminate the need to schedule special times for the accomplishment of this modification, at additional expense. The FAA concurs. It was the FAA's intent that the modification be performed at a main base during regularly scheduled maintenance where special equipment and trained maintenance personnel will be available if necessary. Accordingly, the final rule has been revised to specify compliance times as requested by the commenters. The FAA has determined that this extension will not adversely affect safety since the affected lap joints will be subject to repetitive inspections in the interim. Two commenters request that paragraph (e) be revised to extend the compliance time for accomplishment of the ``full'' modification of the specified skin lap joints from the proposed 1,000 cycles (for airplanes that have accumulated nearly or more than 20,000 total flight cycles) to 4 years after the effective date of the final rule. These commenters consider the proposed compliance time to be too short and not consistent with compliance times provided for similar actions in other AD's pertaining to aging aircraft issues. The FAA does not concur. The 1,000 flight cycle compliance time is consistent with the mandatory modification of a lap joint that has been found to have corrosion or cracking, as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this AD. Cold bonded lap joints such as these have a history of numerous findings of fatigue cracks and corrosion. In light of this, and the fact that fatigue cracking is cycle-related, the FAA has determined that modification of these lap joints cannot be delayed any further than 1,000 flight cycles, especially on those airplanes that already have accumulated 20,000 flight cycles, without compromising safety. One commenter requests that the applicability of proposed paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), and (f)(3) be revised to clarify that it is the ``lap joint,'' rather than the ``airplane,'' on which the particular modification has been accomplished. The FAA concurs and has revised wording of the final rule to clarify this point.
