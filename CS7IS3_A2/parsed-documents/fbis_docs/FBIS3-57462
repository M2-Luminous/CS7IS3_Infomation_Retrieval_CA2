Soskovets denied mass media reports accusing the government of attempts to overhaul the reform plan. He said the programme will be corrected to make it more socially oriented. "As for the government, having received all levers of economic control from the president, it is ready to bear the responsibility for the transformations in the country," Soskovets said. He described the current economic situation as extremely difficult. To exemplify his point, he said that out of 650 enterprises in the Yekaterinburg region only 130 pay taxes. To make other enterprises do the same would mean to ruin them. Additionally, the government has only one trillion roubles in tax revenues, while expenditures in the first quarter of the year alone are excepted to reach 8.5 trillion roubles. Soskovets denied reports that Academicians Leonid Abalkin and Nikolay Petrakov are preparing a new economic programme for the government. "There is only one programme approved by the government last year. It is that programme that the government sticks to," the vice-premier said. Soskovets said the number of the members of the government Presidium has been reduced by five people. On January 23 Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed a document on the new composition of the commission for operative questions. It will include representatives of tax inspectorates, hard currency organisations and bank managers. He pointed out that the government's orientation to non-monetaristic methods of economic management means its "intention to link the economy with the industrial sphere." He ruled out "spasmodic financial injections in separate industries" in the future, adding that the government will toughen relations with enterprises. Soskovets said he did not believe former Soviet Vice-Premier Vladimir Shcherbakov have chances of taking up the post of finance minister in the Russian government. Speaking about the government's relations with the parliament, Soskovets expressed the hope that "members of the cabinet are set to work constructively."
