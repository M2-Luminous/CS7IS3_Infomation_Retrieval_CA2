FR941019-0-00046 FR941019-0-00006 Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the type certificate for that model be amended at a later date to include any other model that incorporates the same novel or unusual design feature, or should any other model already included on the same type certificate be modified to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Discussion There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from HIRF. Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are needed for the Model F28 Mark 0070 that would require that the electrical and electronic systems which perform critical functions such as the EFIS be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of HIRF. High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) With the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics systems, such as the EFIS, to HIRF must be established. It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below: 1. A minimum threat of 100 volts per meter peak electric field strength from 10 KHz to 18GHz. a. The threat must be applied to the system elements and their associated wiring harnesses without the benefit of airframe shielding. b. Demonstration of this level of protection is established through system tests and analysis. 2. A threat external to the airframe of the following field strengths for the frequency ranges indicated. ␣ 1Frequency 1Peak (V/M) 1Average (V/M) 10 KHz&hyph;100 KHz 50 50 100 KHz&hyph;500 KHz 60 60 500 KHz&hyph;2 MHz 70 70 2 MHz&hyph;30 MHz 200 200 30 MHz&hyph;100 MHz 30 30 100 MHz&hyph;200 MHz 150 33 200 MHz&hyph;400 MHz 70 70 400 MHz&hyph;700 MHz 4,020 935 700 MHz&hyph;1 GHz 1,700 170 1 GHz&hyph;2 GHz 5,000 990 2 GHz&hyph;4 GHz 6,680 840 4 GHz&hyph;6 GHz 6,850 310 6 GHz&hyph;8 GHz 3,600 670 8 GHz&hyph;12 GHz 3,500 1,270 12 GHz&hyph;18 GHz 3,500 360 18 GHz&hyph;40 GHz 2,100 750 The envelope given in paragraph 2 above is a revision to the envelope used in previously issued special conditions in other certification projects.
