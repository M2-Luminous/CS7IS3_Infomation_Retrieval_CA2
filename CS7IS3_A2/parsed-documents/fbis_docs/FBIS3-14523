According to this opposition leader, the demonstrations broke out after Libyan television broadcast false confessions extracted under torture from army officers implicated in a military rebellion in Bani Walid last October. According to the director of Libya's foreign information service, the claims of this opposition leader are hardly credible, given his collaboration with foreign information services, in particular the CIA.
