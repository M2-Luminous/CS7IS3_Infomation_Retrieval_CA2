[Thierse] Good evening. [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, I do not think you will admit that the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] is in a crisis. But is it not a critical situation to lose European elections in an election year when Bundestag elections will be held? [Thierse] It certainly is a critical situation, even though I would differentiate here. We lost the elections in the west rather than in the east, because in the east we won several percentage points in the European elections and even more in communal elections, where we even won an additional 6-8 percent. We should note this difference, which shows that the defeat is not the same everywhere. [Hochner] Chancellor candidate Rudolf Scharping has admitted that he made mistakes. He has also been accused of keeping the party rather disoriented, regarding a possible future coalition, for instance. You reportedly would like to see the SPD state very clearly that a coalition with the Greens/Alliance 90 should be formed. [Thierse] I think we have decided for good reason not to conduct an election campaign of coalitions. What we tell the citizens -- and I still think this is correct -- is that those who want a change of government in Bonn in order to achieve a change in policy, must help ensure that the SPD becomes the strongest party in the Bundestag. This is the only way to bring about a change of government. The voters and the other parties' programs will decide with whom we should and could bring about such a change in government. I say quite frankly that the programmatic closeness between the SPD and the Greens is greater than that between the SPD and the Free Democratic Party [FDP], which has totally subordinated itself to Helmut Kohl and the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]. [Hochner] You said the situation in the east was different from that in the west. In the east, the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] has achieved very good results. In East Berlin, where the writer Stefan Heym will be your rival, the PDS even reached 40 percent. Is there not the danger that, on the one hand, you will be worn down between Chancellor Kohl and his CDU, and on the other, between the discontented who will then vote for the PDS, in particular in the east? [Thierse] The danger is really very great. We must keep in mind, however, that this almost incredible result of 40 percent in East Berlin is also explained by the fact that the voter turnout there was less than 50 percent, which relativizes the figure somewhat. But we are in a very difficult situation. We are fought by both sides. The CDU is happy about the PDS election successes, because they weaken the SPD. The only thing we can do is make clear to the citizens, in a very passionate and emotional way, what our alternative to the present government policy is, and tell the east Germans that east German problems can only be solved within an all-German framework or not at all, and not by a party that cultivates resentment against west Germans and wants to make such resentment the basis of its own party policy success. In the final analysis, this will only harm rather than help the east Germans. This is a sober and realistic message that we should tell the people who are furious and disappointed with Kohl's policy and the huge economic and social problems of German unity in eastern Germany, and who vote for the PDS rather than for a party like the SPD which is trying to make feasible suggestions and rejects a populist approach. That is why I think we need a much more aggressive party and a much more aggressive election campaign, which would make the alternatives to Kohl clearer and show that the Social Democrats are the only ones to address east German interests within an all-German framework. [Hochner] But for such an aggressive election campaign, you need an aggressive top candidate. From the Austrian perspective, it looks -- excuse me for saying so -- like [Lower Saxony Minister President] Gerhard Schroeder would have been the right man, whereas Rudolf Scharping certainly is not. [Thierse] We made a truly democratic decision in the SPD, a poll among members. The grassroots members made a decision on the party chairman and thus also on the chancellor candidate. I would consider it political suicide for us to exchange the chancellor candidate now. No, I think Rudolf Scharping is really doing a good job. It must be clear, however, that the SPD does not consist of one candidate only, but of many people. It is led by a very resolute and very energetic candidate who is in excellent shape. He is not nearly exhausted, he is a very great fighter. I am sure of this, I have seen it in recent weeks. [Hochner] His opponent, Chancellor Kohl, is of course also a very great fighter. [Thierse] Certainly. [Hochner] He is a great fighter who should not be underrated. We have the impression that Chancellor Kohl is now being carried by the wave of an incipient or imagined economic upswing. Could it be that the Germans believe that things are improving anyway, and that they could try it again with Helmut Kohl this fall? [Thierse] We must look at this very realistically. The upswing about which people are talking is a phenomenon of the media, because this upswing is not a recovery for all. It does not create jobs. Now the CDU, or Helmut Kohl, must discuss this recovery for four months, and then the citizens will start asking questions. Where is the upswing; will it create a job for me or my neighbor? The difference between the euphoria and optimism that Helmut Kohl is systematically trying to spread and the real situation will become even clearer. But I stress that the SPD should not try to conduct the election campaign by painting a gloomy picture, but by offering a convincing political program that really makes credible suggestions to overcome the most important German problem, namely mass unemployment, and second, a program by which more social and human justice between Germans can be created. I think this is the most painful experience for Germans, in particular the east Germans -- the experience of injustice regarding the distribution of the burdens and advantages of German unity; the economic crisis and ways to overcome it. [Hochner] Mr. Thierse, thank you very much for this interview.
