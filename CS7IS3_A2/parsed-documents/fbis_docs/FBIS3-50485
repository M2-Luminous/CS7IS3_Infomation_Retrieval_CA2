This is the final version, and the executive branch can now promulgate the bill. The Senate ratified its original position because legislative proceedings do not allow for a partial acceptance of the Chamber of Deputies' amendments. The figures contemplate differentiated salary increases for public employees not affected by the Labor Code, just as was originally proposed by the Senate the first time it studied the document. As a result, teachers and health workers will have two adjustments next year, one in January and one in July. Each adjustment will be of 10 percent. This final congressional decision might reestablish good relations between teachers unions and the Education and Worship Ministry, and allow the training of teachers who will start the educational reform in 1994. The adjustments would also prevent strikes from disturbing the teaching schedule during the school year. Military and Policemen Military salaries will have a single adjustment of 10 percent as of January, plus a bonus of 85,000 guaranies for each food coupon. The National Police will have differentiated salary adjustments: Officers will receive a single 10 percent salary adjustment, while noncommissioned officers will receive a single 20 percent adjustment, both as of January. Both groups will also receive 85,000 guaranies for each food coupon, just as does the military. Lastly, all other public employees not affected by the Labor Code will receive the following adjustments: Those now receiving a salary of up to 500,000 guaranies will be granted a single adjustment of 10 percent in January, while those earning more than 500,000 guaranies will receive a 7.5 percent adjustment in July. The Senate rejected the Chamber of Deputies' amendments to the Central Bank and Social Security Institute (IPS) budgets. As a result, the Central Bank will not be able to dispose of 9 billion guaranies for loans to bank employees and local contribution to foreign credits aimed at supporting small businesses in the country. The IPS will be able to dispose of 20 billion guaranies broken down as follows: 15 billion for loans to companies, and 5 billion for loans to insurers. The figures approved by Congress will not be objected to by the executive branch if we believe the last Finance Ministry message to Congress, containing a request to the Chamber of Deputies to ratify the salary adjustments proposed by the Senate. Budget Deficit Besides approving each public company budget, the Senate also approved the legal authorization for the Finance Ministry to cover eventual deficits with Central Bank emissions or public or private commercial bank credits (BNF [National Development Bank], BNT [National Workers Bank], and other banks). These financial aids could be considered as taken on account from Itaipu royalties when the royalty disbursements are delayed.
