On 12 May, Mondale, U.S. ambassador to Japan, met separately with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa and International Trade and Industry [MITI] Minister Eijiro Hata. "During his meeting with Foreign Minister Kakizawa, the U.S. ambassador took a flexible attitude toward resuming the stalled framework talks by putting forth no conditions for their resumption" (says a U.S. Government source). Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is eager to resume the stalled framework talks and pave the way for Japan and the United States to reach a set of agreements at the talks prior to the Naples summit scheduled for July. However, "It is impermissible to break off the framework talks again" (according to a senior MITI official), and Japan and the United States are expected to continue to negotiate the resumption of the stalled framework talks through informal behind-the-scenes contacts. The full-fledged resumption of the stalled framework talks, however, hinges on whether or not the two countries will reach an agreement on the interpretation of the objective criteria and whether or not Japan will be able to put forth concrete plans for income tax reductions and a macroeconomic policy. During past Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the United States asked Japan to implement macroeconomic measures to expand Japan's domestic demand and reduce Japan's current account surplus, continue income tax reductions, and establish an "objective criteria" under which numerical targets are set for the three priority sectors of the government's procurement (telecommunications and medical equipment), automobile and auto parts, and insurance. In response, Japan reacted against the U.S. proposal for establishing the objective criteria that premises numerical targets, breaking off the framework talks. Since the beginning of this month, however, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor has repeatedly stated: "The United States is not seeking any numerical market share." During a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Hata on the evening of 9 May, President Clinton stressed the need to resume the stalled framework talks at an earlier date. According to the same U.S. Government source, during a separate meeting with Foreign Minister Kakizawa and MITI Minister Hata, U.S. Ambassador Mondale stated: "It is good even if the objective criteria to be applied to the three priority sectors is not all the same." In this way, the U.S. ambassador's statement can be taken as the readiness on the part of the United States to make concessions to what Japan has advocated. Both Japan and the United States are said to have no disagreement on the continued income tax cuts, but it still remains unclear whether or not the government will set forth clear plans for the continued income tax cuts by the end of June because of a problem with financial resources. The same senior MITI official warily says: "We do not expect the United States to drop its proposal for the objective criteria so easily."
