A fax was received from Nabil Sha'th, in which the PLO was practically backing out of some of the agreements achieved in Cairo -- at least agreements on the issue of the crossings on the Jordan bridges. [Rabin] True, we are faced with a problem, but things should be put in the right perspective. Both sides, the Israeli and the Palestinian -- the PLO -- are committed to the Declaration of Principles [DOP] agreement, to the negotiations, to the implementation of the first stage of the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. And there are disagreements. Following the Paris and Oslo meetings, the nucleus of the Israeli-Palestinian liaison committee met in Cairo, with the Israeli side headed by Foreign Minister Peres and the other side by Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh in Paris and Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas] in Cairo. We received the impression that they had arrived at a draft reflecting the agreements on some of the main disputed issues. The agreement was naturally contingent on the endorsement of both Tunis and Jerusalem. It transpired, however, that so far Tunis has not endorsed the draft. For that reason, there has been no endorsement from Jerusalem, because it is inconceivable that we should agree to approve something Tunis has not approved. Had we done it, the draft which required reciprocal endorsement would have become a unilaterally endorsed draft, and that would have made it the starting point of negotiations, triggering new compromises beyond anything the two sides had agreed on. Two faxes have been received. One was from Nabil Sha'th, written after the meeting with President Mubarak in Cairo, after Nabil Sha'th and Major General Amnon Shahaq were tasked with elucidating several points in the draft. Shahaq and Sha'th had a conversation, but due to time constraints, they agreed that a fax reflecting the agreements would be sent. Another fax from Nabil Sha'th which arrived yesterday contained far-reaching remarks by the chairman and, although they were defined as remarks, they practically overturned the contents of the first fax. In these circumstances, I would like to spell out my stand. We are committed to the DOP. We are ready to negotiate the interpretations of whatever is written in the DOP agreement. I absolutely refuse, however, to make additional compromises on the agreements achieved in the DOP agreement. Interpretation -- yes, another compromise -- no. [Raz] And does that interpretation of 'Arafat -- the chairman, as you referred to him -- reflect a retreat from every previous agreement on the issues of Gaza, the scope of withdrawal from Jericho, the bridges, and the crossings? [Rabin] They are remarks implying a retreat. They are not presented as demands, but the implications of the second fax are clear to me. Therefore, although we would like to continue the negotiations, we would like to ponder the matter and to elucidate a few things at the beginning of next week, before the negotiations are resumed, in order to avoid departing from a new starting line each time, because we believe that the agreements should bind both sides. [passage omitted] [Rosenfeld] Recently there have been reports about Israelis and Syrians participating in a workshop in Washington. Do you have any information about this track of talks? Does it operate with your knowledge, your sanction, your consent? [Rabin] Neither I nor the Government of Israel have authorized anyone to conduct negotiations with the Syrians. We were very interested in holding quiet contacts with the Syrians, because the experience of the Dayan-al-Tuhami meeting in Morocco had proved that this kind of meetings can pave the way. Oslo has proved the same. We wanted very much to hold such meetings, but the Syrians refused. Therefore, I do not know what the newspaper reports were based on. Israelis may have met with Syrians on occasion, but not one of these Israelis had been authorized by either me or the Government of Israel to speak on our behalf. [passage omitted]
