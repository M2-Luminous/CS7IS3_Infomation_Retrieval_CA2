FR940124-1-00023 FR940124-1-00006 40 CFR Part 52 [IL83&hyph;1&hyph;6155; FRL&hyph;4826&hyph;3] Federal Highway Funding Assistance Limitations and Emissions Offset Requirements; Illinois AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on Illinois under the discretionary authority provided to the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by the State to meet its commitment to adopt a basic and enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as required by the Act for certain ozone nonattainment areas. On November 11, 1992, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment to adopt (Committal SIP) an I/M program to meet the requirements of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption and implementation of a basic and enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of US EPA's I/M regulations and includes an implementation schedule. On December 2, 1993, US EPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision including State legislative authority to implement the program was required by November 15, 1993. The Illinois General Assembly adjourned on November 4, 1993, for the second time this year without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of the basic and enhanced I/M programs. On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either the requirements of the Act and its commitment to adopt and implement the required I/M programs as promised in its committal SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review provision of the Act. DATES: Comments on this proposed action are to be submitted by March 15, 1994. The USEPA will hold two public hearings on March 2 and 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule should be addressed to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (5AR&hyph;18J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. The hearings will be held in Illinois as follows: March 2, 1994 in Chicago, at the Harold Washington Library on 400 S. State Street in the multipurpose room at 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; and March 4, 1994 in Collinsville, at the Holiday Inn on 1000 Eastport Plaza Drive at 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Copies of Illinois' I/M Committal SIP submittal, USEPA's proposals and rulemakings, and other documents pertinent to this proposed rule are available at the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, Regulation Development Branch, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604.
