Waigel told the regional conference of the Bavarian Young Union [CSU's youth organization] here today that the "criminal SED/PDS" ought to be "turfed out of the parliaments." "If we do not tolerate former Nazis or neo-Nazis in politics, then we should not tolerate any former communists or neocommunists," the head of the CSU said. He is not, he said, fighting against the Republicans' leader Franz Schoenhuber so that "a Mr. Gysi [leader of PDS] can travel from talk show to talk show." Just as the CDU [Christian Democratic Union]/CSU ruled out any cooperation with the far-right Republicans, so it should distance itself from the PDS as well, Waigel said.
