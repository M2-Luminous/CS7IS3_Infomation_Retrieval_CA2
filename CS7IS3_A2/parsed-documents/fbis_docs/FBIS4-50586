Since reform and opening up, our system has experienced great changes. However, the relationship between planning and the market is still a kind of contradiction which hinders our efforts to deepen reform and rapidly develop the productive forces. When this contradiction is manifested in the area of opening up to the outside world, it mainly shows that many of our practices are still unable to converge with the international market. Fixing the goal of establishing a socialist market economy system will help enable our country's open-door policy to enter a new stage. The main features of this new stage are: 1. Use the opportunity arising from the restoration of our country's status as a signatory to the GATT to foster closer and firmer economic and trade ties between our country and various countries in the world, and to enable our country to play a more active role in economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. Our country's work in struggling for the restoration of its signatory status to the GATT has made important progress. China has formally raised the goal of building a socialist market economy system, thus removing the biggest obstacle which has hindered our country's "entry to the GATT" for a long time. We have also committed ourselves to increasing the transparency of our foreign trade system and reducing non-tariff protective measures, and this shows that at the same time as we enjoy the rights which come with the GATT, we have the ability to shoulder and discharge the various obligations associated with the GATT. "Entrance to the GATT" will enable our country's trade relations with various countries to be built on a foundation which has multilateral protection and is more stable. 2. Further implement the strategy of diversifying our foreign trade markets and winning competition with quality. China's status in world trade will rise further. In 1992, our country's total import and export volume surpassed that of Spain and the ROK, and we leaped two positions among the major world trade powers, to 11th position. In the 1990's, when engaging in export trade, we must attach importance to exploring new markets in the developed countries and regions and pay even more attention to markets in the developing countries and neighboring countries and regions, including markets in East Asia, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, the Gulf countries, and the CIS. For this reason, we must earnestly tackle the acute contradiction which constrains our efforts to expand exports--the problem of product quality. Poor quality products are not salable in the international market even at low prices, while good-quality products are marketable even though they are sold at high prices. 3. Participate more actively in the international division of labor. Along with a marked increase in the proportion of high-tech and value-added products among exports, and with the gradual opening up of the domestic market, the development of the national economy will have a greater degree of linkage to the international market. In the 1990's, the application of new technology in the world will make a series of breakthroughs, and materials technology, biotechnology, information and communications technology, astronautics and aeronautical technology, marine exploration technology, and energy technology will all be used in industry. This will cause a new revolution in the production domain, while the focus of competition in international markets will concentrate more on high and new technology, while the status of resource-intensive and labor-intensive industries will decline in the international division of labor and technology-intensive and knowledge-intensive industries will acquire an increasingly dominant position in the international division of labor. Facing this grim challenge, we should grasp the opportunity arising from the adjustment of the industrial structure in the international community to give full play to our country's scientific and technological strength, integrate self-determined scientific and technological exploration with the importation of advanced technology from abroad, and form our own high and new-technology industries. At the same time, with an eye on the adjustment of the industrial structure at home, we must selectively open up the domestic market, introduce competition, and gradually cancel the protection of an absolute majority of enterprises which have some foundation and competitive ability in order to allow them to develop themselves during their participation in international competition. 4. Further expand the scale of the utilization of foreign capital. There will be a marked increase in large-scale investment projects, more capital-intensive and technology-intensive investment projects, and investment projects which can promote the development of tertiary industry. This can help adjust the structure of industries which have foreign investment and enable foreign capital to flow to those sectors whose development is being encouraged by our country's industrial policy; and this can help change the structure of regions which have foreign investments and increase investment in central and western China. 5. In the course of foreign economic and technological exchanges, the "great economic and trade" pattern in which commodities, funds, technology, and labor are combined, promote one another, and develop together will emerge. Enterprises will be able to operate businesses which transcend different trades, to combine trade in industrial products and trade in technology with trade in commodities and trade in science, and to follow the road of professionalism, conglomeration, and internationalization. 6. Opening up to the outside world will lead to a "network" in which coastal areas, borders, rivers, and transportation routes are opened up, and the policy of opening up the regions will change to one which covers the whole country. 7. Participate in regional cooperation with an active and pragmatic attitude. Economic and trade links among the mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan will become closer, and an economic cooperation pattern characterized by reciprocity, mutual support, common development, and common prosperity will gradually emerge in South China. Between the "global unification" of the world economy and regional groupings are relations of mutual promotion and mutual restraint. The process of regional grouping itself has a lot of unclear factors due to the meeting and contradiction of state interests and group interests. China is a developing country in the Asia-Pacific region and is enthusiastic about participation in economic cooperation of various types in the region; at the same time, China agrees to the establishment of a nonpolitical and nonmilitary regional cooperation plans and to the idea that economic cooperation should be open and development should be orderly and practical. In the 1990's, efforts will be made to further develop cooperative relations. We must create conditions for continuing to develop economic and trade exchanges across the strait, realize the goal of direct and bilateral "three links" step by step, and foster closer economic ties with Hong Kong and Macao. 8. Enterprise groups specializing in trades and enterprise groups specializing in industries will become the backbone force in the development of an export-oriented economy, and a number of enterprises will walk through the country's door to carry out international operations. Transnational operations by enterprises is a major trend of global economic development, and our country is still at the starting stage. By the end of 1992, excluding the Hong Kong and Macao regions, our country had some 2,400 overseas enterprises and the Chinese had invested $1.85 billion, but most of these enterprises were small in scale and had poor returns. In the 1990's, when a number of large enterprises will walk through the country's door to invest in larger projects and industries, such as resources, construction, processing and assembling industries, trade, and overseas commerce, the advantages of enterprises' transnational operations will be more fully embodied. 9. When the market's role in allocating resources increasingly expands, when a managed exchange rate mechanism in the market is eventually established, and when direct government intervention in economic activities, such as the import and export trades, is reduced, the domestic market will gradually converge with the international market. The goal of reform is to establish a managed foreign exchange market, practice a unitary market exchange rate, and gradually allow the yuan to be freely exchanged with foreign currencies. To expand opening up, we must more effectively develop the regulatory function of the interest rate mechanism, expand the scope and function of the foreign exchange adjustment market, and establish a stabilization fund. On the basis of narrowing the difference between the two exchange rates step by step, this year, our country eventually combined the two exchange rates into one. The merger of the two exchange rates and the establishment of a foreign exchange market indicates that the domestic market has begun to converge with the international market. 10. A new operation and management system in foreign trade in which the state formulates policies and measures and carries out indirect macroregulation and control; enterprises operate at their own discretion, take sole responsibility for profits and losses, and develop and restrain themselves; and chambers of commerce carry out coordination and provide services according to the interests and demands of members, will take shape. The above-mentioned 10 features are only a rough sketch of the great blueprint of our country's opening up to the outside world in the course of building a socialist market economy in the 1990's. But from this we can also see that when China upholds reform and opening up, it has a series of concrete arrangements and solid actions.
