The circular points out that, in recent years, all levels and departments throughout the Army have conscientiously implemented the spirit of the instructions of the Central Military Commission on stepping up army building at the grass-roots levels. Given the shortage of funds, they have done a great deal of practical work for the troops and have been well received by them. However, the problem of heavy financial burdens is still fairly conspicuous. Now that combat units below the army level are no longer engaged in business production, the financial reserves at their disposal have correspondingly decreased, and the contradiction between fund supply and demand has become even more apparent. For this reason, all levels and departments -- especially the leading organs -- should conscientiously reduce meetings and documents and work vigorously to cut administrative expenditures. When holding exchange-experience meetings, on-the-spot meetings, and commendation meetings, when running training classes, and when launching goal-reaching activities, they are not allowed to apportion the outlays to Army units or do it in a disguised way, because the expenditure of higher levels should not be reimbursed by lower levels. No organ (unit) or individual is allowed to indiscriminately demand reimbursements or aid from Army units for whatever reason or in whatever name. Army units have the right to refuse, in accordance with the relevant state regulations, the apportionment of charges or aid requests by the local authorities. The circular specifically prohibits the diversion of surplus company funds for any other purpose. It is necessary to supply in full funds allocated to the grass-roots units according to certain criteria. The surplus food expenses of company units should be concentrated and placed in safe-keeping at units above the regimental level. Company units should nevertheless be given ready access to the funds, and the diversion of the funds for any other purpose is strictly prohibited. The circular says that, when inspecting work in Army units, higher-level organs should make overall arrangements, improve planning, have a clearer objective in mind, and pay attention to practical results. They should travel with a minimum of pomp and pay table expenses according to regulations. Army units are not allowed to give special treatment to people from higher levels, including leading cadres. Financial departments have the right to refuse to reimburse expenses incurred in violation of the regulations.
