Because of their difficult, desperate, and defeated position, (?the puppets) have spread a premeditated rumor that the wife of a high-ranking commander in the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] was killed during fighting in Anlung Veng and that this high-ranking commander then fled to Takeo Province. We would like to confirm that the Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are very far away from Anglung Veng. As a matter of fact, the aggressive attack forces stationed in the eastern part of Samraong are over 50 km away from Anlung Veng; those in the area north of Sre Noy are over 80 km away; and those in Kulen are over 100 km away. Elsewhere, the Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are under attack and are pinned down by the NADK and the Cambodian people. II. This is a despicable lie on the part of the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance. They are bogged down in the military, political, diplomatic, and social fields -- both in the countryside and in Phnom Penh. This is an attempt by our enemies -- who are facing an impasse and are suffering serious defeats -- to fool others. The purpose of this psychological propaganda is: To threaten and frighten those who seek business contacts with Democratic Kampuchea [DK] in this zone; and to encourage the Vietnamese communist ringleaders and their troops, who are being routed and demoralized on every battlefields across the country, especially the Samraong-Anlung Veng battlefield. But this self-deceiving propaganda by the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance cannot encourage the Vietnamese communist puppet commanders and their troops. On the battlefield, the aggressive attack forces that launched operations against the DK's liberated zone were counterattacked during January by the NADK and the Cambodian people. They suffered heavy defeats: Over 400 of them were killed or wounded; over 700 others deserted; and 36 tanks, armored personnel carriers, and military trucks (?were seized). The Vietnamese communist puppets' aggressive attack forces are currently being smashed to pieces by the NADK and the people [words indistinct]. Under these circumstances, these savage elements are suffering from a shortage of food, ammunition, [words indistinct]. III. During the January fighting, dozens of the Vietnamese communist puppets' military commanders were killed or wounded. These included over 30 commanders between the rank of colonel and first lieutenant as well as six generals. General Prum Samen of the Vietnamese communist puppets' General Staff was seriously wounded and his tank was totally destroyed by a mine explosion east of Samraong. Gen. Nhoek Bunchhai, first deputy chief of the Vietnamese communist puppets' General Staff, was wounded during the fighting in Samraong on (?24) January. On 25 January, Gen. Long Sopheap, chief of the Vietnamese communist puppets' 4th Military Region, was seriously wounded as his tank was moving from Ba Noem to Samraong. He was quickly sent to a hospital by helicopter. To summarize, the situation on Route 68 -- covering Samraong, Siem Reap, Anlung Veng, Kulen, Choam Khsan, Rumchong, and Ampil Districts -- shows that the puppets are suffering serious and successive defeats on this battlefield. It shows that the puppet commanders and their troops are being encircled; cut off from each other; and cut off from their supplies of food, [word indistinct] and assistance from the outside. They are in a serious state of desperation, and are waiting only for their doom. [Dated] 31 January 1994 [Signed] NADK spokesman
