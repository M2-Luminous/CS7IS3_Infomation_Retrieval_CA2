Among other things, it will discuss the government decision to repatriate Palestinian deportees and to place foreign observers in Hebron. Our correspondent Hayim Hecht reports that the Likud faction this morning submitted the 30 Knesset members' signatures, required to summon the house for a session during its recess. The Likud says that stationing observers gravely violates Israel's sovereignty and attests to the fact that the government is losing control at this time.
