FR940504-1-00026 FR940504-1-00005 For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;8849 (59 FR 11531, March 11, 1994), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows: Jetstream Aircraft Limited: Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;25&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849. Applicability: Model 4101 airplanes having constructors numbers 41004 and subsequent on which Modification JM41307A or JM41307B has not been installed previously; certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent failure of the bearings in the aileron quadrants, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), perform a detailed visual inspection to detect damage of the bearings in the aileron quadrant in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control, in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994. (1) If no damaged bearing is found, repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. (2) If any damaged bearing is found, prior to further flight, replace the damaged bearing with a new bearing in accordance with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection, thereafter, at intervals not to exceed 7 days. Note 1: Paragraph (a) of this AD restates the requirement for an initial and repetitive inspections contained in paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. Therefore, for operators that have previously accomplished at least the initial inspection in accordance with AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, paragraph (a) of this AD requires that the next scheduled inspection be performed within 7 days after the last inspection performed in accordance with paragraph (a) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. (b) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), adjust the aileron secondary stop in the pilot's and co-pilot's aileron control system in accordance with Jetstream Aircraft Limited Alert Service Bulletin J41&hyph;A&hyph;27&hyph;026, Revision 1, dated December 7, 1993; or Revision 2, dated January 17, 1994. Note 2: Paragraph (b) of this AD restates the requirement to adjust the aileron secondary stop contained in paragraph (b) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated. (c) Within 7 days after March 28, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10, Amendment 39&hyph;8849), revise the Abnormal Procedures Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following. This may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. ``Where abnormal aileron control backlash is experienced by one pilot, the other pilot should assume control of the aircraft without using the disconnect facility. The disconnect facility should only be used in accordance with published procedures in cases of control restrictions or jamming.'' Note 3: Paragraph (c) of this AD restates the requirement for an AFM revision contained in paragraph (c) of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10. As allowed by the phrase ``unless accomplished previously,'' if that requirement of AD 93&hyph;25&hyph;10 has been accomplished previously, this AD does not require that it be repeated. (d) Within 180 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, install new swivel bearings in the left and right aileron quadrants (Modification JM41307A) in accordance with Jetstream Service Bulletin J41&hyph;27&hyph;027, dated January 17, 1994. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the requirements of this AD. The AFM revision required by paragraph (c) of this AD may be removed following accomplishment of this modification. (e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. Note 4: Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM&hyph;113. (f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. Issued in Renton, Washington, on April 28, 1994. James V. Devany, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service.
