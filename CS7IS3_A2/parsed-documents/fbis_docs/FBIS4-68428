We can only welcome this candid statement issued by Oksana Dmitriyeva, chairperson of the State Duma Subcommittee on Financing for the Territories. Finally the Russian parliament has gotten the opportunity to translate the unintelligible groaning of the opposition into normal language with an intelligible vocabulary. The results of parliamentary hearings on the draft budget for 1994 presented by the government are as follows: The most competent Duma members have shown that state income in the budget is overstated due to the fact that production volume decreased more heavily than was presumed (by 25 percent instead of the 8 percent contained in December calculations of the Ministry of Economics), while additional state investments should be added to the expenditures. The State Duma will not be able to create a full-fledged conciliation committee capable of reaching consensus together with the government. According to Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma Budget Committee, this would mean "violation of the principle of separation of powers." On the other hand, Sergey Shapovalov, chairman of the Committee for Regional Policy, insists that a common working group is needed--true, its decisions would be "advisory in nature." In other words, the State Duma is attempting to find roundabout ways, having come into conflict with the statute it readily adopted on procedure for adoption of the budget. This statute prohibits the adoption of additional expenditure resolutions without either a confirmation of supplemental sources of income or the reduction of expenditures with respect to other budget lines. In point of fact, taking into account growing pressure on the part of intragovernmental groups aimed at increasing outlays, an "advisory"--i.e., unofficial--working group might "convince" the Ministry of Finance to a possibly greater degree than would open confrontation during the course of the official procedure for adopting the budget. Especially since there seem to be additional sources through which the government can obtain income--the removal of tax benefits for exporters, estimated by Sergey Glazyev, chairman of the Economics Committee, to amount to R24 trillion, and by Aleksandr Pochinok, deputy chairman of the Budget Committee, at approximately R10 trillion. But as Mr. Pochinok noted, it would be more proper to first repeal the legal resolutions affording such benefits, and only then introduce the new income into the budget... The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Duma has assumed the responsibility to begin examination of the budget at the end of next week. In the meantime, according to the Budget Committee chairman, the draft presented does not conform to selected excerpts from the president's correspondence with the parliament--there is no line in it about additional funds which must be expended on the closure of a number of coal mines, for example, or the readjustment to be made at military plants, etc. In Mr. Zadornov's words, "the affording of additional funds must be conditioned upon plans for a framework restructuring of the economy." This requirement does not presently appear to be entirely realistic, however--and not only because an effective concept of framework restructuring is lacking. It also proceeds from the insincerity of politicians who strive to effect institutional changes in words, while in fact sustaining bankruptcy and conserving the Soviet industry. Claims of the State Duma to the effect that new methods are being used to finance the regions out of the federal budget appear to be quite justified. As we know, the government has adopted a system of transfers, accumulating income in the federal fund for support to the regions from value-added tax, and then transferring it to the most needy regions. However, coefficients used by the Council of Ministers either were calculated employing incorrect methodology or proceeding from political considerations. For example, Kemerovo Oblast finds itself in first place in the list of needy regions, and of 66 subsidized regions it will receive almost half the funds accumulated. Objecting to this is not only Yabloko, but the Russia's Choice faction as well. However, competent opponents of the government's program from the "Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin" bloc have additional, nontechnical objections to the principles of regional financing proposed by the Ministry of Finance. Mrs. Dmitriyeva stated yesterday that since the decline in production should lead to reduced volumes of value-added tax, the source of financing for the subsidy fund for the regions must be different--direct credit emission, to be precise. In this regard, observers are proposing that taxes be repealed entirely and that the economy be financed from a computation of minimum necessary outlays, but that in such event the parliament be dissolved as the source of idle talk about this minimum and the government be cleansed of officials who attempt to defend sector interests.
