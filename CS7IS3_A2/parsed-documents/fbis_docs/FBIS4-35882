Generations after generations in nations after nations, leaders have faithfully followed the ancient Roman maxim. Over the centuries, society's ability to wage war has become an institutionalized permanent integer with large resources devoted to armies. Today scores of countries are engaged in building the nuclear missile empires. Their lust for acquiring weapons of mutual assured destruction is rapidly increasing and despite incessant calls for shrinkage in lethal weapons, they are as diehard as they were ever. In this deadly arms race, not only the developed and advanced first world countries are contenders, but some poor countries from third world [word indistinct] are equally active participants. India, for example, with a population of 900 million people, of whom over 50 percent are homeless, jobless and foodless, is spending more than four percent of its GNP [Gross National Product] on defense. This time for the year 1994-95, India raised its defense budget from rupees 192 billion to rupees 230 billion. It means straightaway 20 percent increase, which is unprecedented for any country in peace time. When this budget was being announced by the Indian finance minister, Mr. Manmohan Singh, the pressmen, who were attending the budget session, were whispering about the Indian nuclear program and missile technology. As a proof to that India has accelerated its efforts to build yet another intercontinental ballistic missile named Surya [Sun], which is nearing its final test at Orissa. According to the latest information, Indian defense scientists are busy day and night to perform an early testing of Surya. The lethal missile will have a range of 12,000 km, but later on, the scientists say that its range will be enhanced to 20,000 km. The new Indian missile will not only be a constant threat to the Asian region, but it would have even Washington well within the total devastation precision limit of New Delhi, which means that it will be much more formidable than the Agni-3, which was tested in February this year despite mounting apprehensive feelings of the defense analysts of Pentagon and Pall Mall. It will be five times heavier than Prithvi and 10 times powerful in destructiveness. According to reports, India will spend over 200 million rupees on Surya's first test which will be performed in the mid of 1995. With Trishul, Indira, Agni, Prithvi and now Surya, India has emerged as an aggressor in the world. It neither accepts words of advice from the International Atomic Energy Agency, nor peace instructions of Carnegie Endowment For International Peace. It has no other peaceful pursuits either. It has its own pros and cons if it makes economic blockade of Nepal or bullies Maldives, interferes with internal affairs of Sri Lanka or intimidates Bangladesh, or kills tens of thousands of innocent Kashmiris, or for that matter holds Pakistan responsible for heat wave in Bombay. All it considers are very just and appropriate actions. How cynical it is to visualize that Russia and the United States, the two inveterate super rivals, are destroying their stockpiles of dangerous weapons as a service to international peace, but India still is building up its military empire beyond limits. Aggression against whom? Military build up against whom? Lethal weapons and deadly arsenals against whom? India still has not learned a lesson from Russia. It is a matter of great concern for the United States and the United Nations who are devoted to make the entire world nuclear free. So, such an extraordinary increase in stockpiles of deadly weapons is the blatant violation of the principles of global peace.
