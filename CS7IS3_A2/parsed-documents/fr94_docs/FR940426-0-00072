(b) The cover may draw the offeror's attention to specific limitations on who may submit offers, such as the Small Business Set-Aside provision. (c) The cover may include a general reminder that representations and certifications must be carefully read and completed, but should not include specific listings of individual provisions from Section K, Representations and Certifications. (d) The cover may include specific listings of clauses that are not located in Section K, but which contain boxes or fill-ins that must be completed as part of the offer. (e) The cover must contain a statement that in the event of a conflict between the cover and the solicitation, the solicitation takes precedence. (f) The cover may include a very brief description or ``executive summary'' of the requirement.
