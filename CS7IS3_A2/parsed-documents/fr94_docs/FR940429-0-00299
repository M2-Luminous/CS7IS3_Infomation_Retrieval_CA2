FR940429-0-00299 FR940429-0-00016 Discussion : The discussion following comment 16 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change : Section 682.414(a)(2) has been amended to add a false certification discharge. Section 682.402(e)(3) 47. Comment : Some commenters recommended that the Secretary prescribe a standardized form for the false certification discharge application and associated sworn statement from the borrower. Discussion : The discussion following comment 17 also applies to a false certification discharge. Change : None. Section 682.402(e)(3)(ii)(B) 48. Comment : Some commenters objected to the proposed regulation that would limit a false certification discharge to only those cases where a student admitted to a school on the basis of a purported ability to benefit from the school's training did not meet the applicable requirements for admission on the basis of ability to benefit. The commenters believed that the HEA did not envision any restriction as to what would constitute a school's false certification of a student's eligibility to borrow under the FFEL Program. Other commenters believed that some restrictions should apply, and proposed additional acts and certifications of a school that should be construed as false certifications. Some commenters were pleased with the regulations as written, and recommended no changes. Discussion : The additional acts and certifications by a school that the commenters proposed were the same as those discussed in the NPRM published on January 14, 1994 (FR 59, No. 10). For the reasons stated on pages 2488&hyph;2490 of the NPRM, and for the additional reasons discussed earlier in response to comment 5, the Secretary believes that the term ``falsely certified,'' when used for purposes of a false certification discharge, applies to cases involving a school's invalid certification that a student had the ability to benefit from the training offered by the school, or cases where the school signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, and certain cases where the school wrongfully endorsed a person's name on the loan check, or the borrower's authorization for electronically transferring loan proceeds. The Secretary believes that if the school rather than the student signed a person's name on the loan application or the promissory note, the putative borrower is not aware that a loan was being applied for and had no intention of entering into an agreement to repay a loan. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that a borrower who did not sign the application or promissory note could not have completely understood that a check later presented for endorsement would represent the proceeds of such a loan, and would not have intended to signify by endorsing such a check or authorization to release funds that he or she agreed to become obligated to repay a loan. A school that signed a person's name on a precursory document (the loan application or the promissory note) effectively prevented the person from being fully aware of the relationship normally apparent to a borrower who first completes an application for a loan and later receives a loan disbursement as a result of that application. The Secretary understands that in some cases, an unscrupulous school may obtain the valid signature of a borrower on the loan application or promissory note and will later sign the student's name on the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer. However, despite these actions, a student could have materially benefitted from the loan proceeds by a reduction of the charges owed to the school or by otherwise receiving proceeds of the loan delivered by the school. The Secretary believes that a person who signed the loan application and promissory note should be considered an individual who was aware that he or she requested a loan. Therefore, if the borrower (or student on whose behalf a parent borrowed a PLUS Loan) was enrolled at the school during the period of time that the loan (or an installment thereof) was intended to cover, and someone other than the borrower signed the borrower's name on a loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, causing the loan proceeds to be applied to the student's account to satisfy a liability for tuition and other charges owed to the school, or to be delivered to the borrower, it is reasonable to conclude that the borrower by that action received the proceeds of the loan he or she had applied. Because that borrower obtained the benefits of the loan disbursement, even though the borrower realized that he or she did not sign the loan check or the authorization for electronic funds transfer, that borrower would be legally obligated with respect to that disbursement. In this case, the Secretary does not believe that a loan discharge was contemplated by Congress. However, if it is determined that the borrower or student did not benefit from the loan proceeds, the Secretary believes that the borrower should be relieved of any obligation to repay the amount of the loan proceeds transmitted as a result of a falsely signed loan check or authorization for electronic funds transfer, and that such relief can be included in the procedures adopted for discharges under section 437(c) of the HEA.
