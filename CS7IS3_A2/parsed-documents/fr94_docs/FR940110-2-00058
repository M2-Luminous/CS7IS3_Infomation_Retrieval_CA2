FR940110-2-00058 FR940110-2-00044 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION Public Information Collection Requirement Submitted to Office of Management and Budget for Review January 5, 1994. The Federal Communications Commission has submitted the following information collection requirement to OMB for review and clearance under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). Copies of this submission may be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Service, Inc., 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037, (202) 857&hyph;3800. For further information on this submission contact Judy Boley, Federal Communications Commission, (202) 632&hyph;0276. Persons wishing to comment on this information collection should contact Timothy Fain, Office of Management and Budget, room 3235 NEOB, Washington, DC 20503, (202) 395&hyph;3561. Please note: The Commission has requested expedited OMB review of this item by January 7, 1994, under the provisions of 5 CFR 1320.18. OMB Number: None. Title: Implementation of sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93&hyph;252, First Report and Order. Action: New collection. Respondents: Individuals or households, state or local governments, federal agencies or employees, non-profit institutions and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: One time filing requirement due by February 10, 1994. Estimated Annual Burden: 50 responses; 2 hours average burden per response; 100 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;66, title VI, section 6002(b), 107 Stat. 312, 395 (1993), amended sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees and will be treated as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of section 310(b) of the Communications Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, in new section 332(c)(6) permits the Commission to grant waivers of section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline. The Commission will use the waiver petitions to determine whether each given petitioner should be permitted to retain foreign ownership or control, pursuant to statute. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;518 Filed 1&hyph;7&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6712&hyph;01&hyph;M
