FR940318-1-00013 FR940318-1-00004 Development of New Equipment Several commenters request that the proposed rule provide for a method to encourage the development of new, more reliable equipment, and extend the leak check intervals for that equipment. The FAA agrees that the industry should be encouraged to develop improved hardware that will better address the unsafe condition presented by problems associated with blue ice. As one method to achieve this goal, and to provide assurance of a high degree of reliability of the hardware involved, the FAA has proposed in paragraph (c) of this supplemental NPRM, a method of data collection relative to the reliability of valves. This approach is not intended to supersede existing methods for equipment qualification and certification. However, this method of data collection is intended to ensure the collection of unambiguous data, which will provide the FAA with adequate resources and information to determine appropriate leak check intervals for new and existing designs. The FAA intends to use the data that are eventually collected to determine if extensions to the currently proposed leak check intervals are justified, specifically for those operators who choose to incorporate certain maintenance and training requirements into their FAA maintenance programs in accordance with paragraph (b) of this supplemental NPRM. The FAA specifically requests additional suggestions as to methods that will further ensure the validity of the data gathered. Implementation of a New Maintenance and Training Program Numerous commenters request that the proposed rule be revised to provide for an alternative to the fixed leak check intervals by permitting the implementation of a program in which operators could incorporate a schedule of maintenance actions, training, and periodic leak checks into their FAA-approved maintenance program. These commenters state that merely performing more leak checks at greater frequencies will not, by itself, address the blue ice problem. Instead, other maintenance tasks, such as replacing seals at regular intervals and establishing effective communication procedures between maintenance personnel and the flight crew, play more significant roles in addressing blue ice safety concerns. The commenters request that compliance periods for leak checks be adjusted in accordance with existing FAA-approved reliability programs, or be increased to ``C'' check intervals, provided that certain maintenance and training programs were initially included in the maintenance program. The FAA concurs that these commenters' suggestions have merit. The FAA has determined that an increase in the leak check intervals could be justified if the equipment is demonstrated to be highly reliable, and a program of regular maintenance and training is implemented. The FAA has revised proposed paragraph (b) of the supplemental AD to include specific procedures considered to be essential in such a program. These procedures include: (1) Repetitive replacement of seals, (2) leak checks at various intervals depending upon the valve configuration, (3) leak checks of flush/fill line caps, (4) visual checks conducted by maintenance personnel at regular intervals to detect leakage, (5) procedures for reporting discrepancies, and (6) training programs for maintenance and service personnel that include information on ``Blue Ice Awareness'' and the hazards of blue ice. The proposal specifically would extend the leak check interval for certain valves to 5,000 flight hours (which is equivalent to a ``C'' check for the majority of affected operators), provided the specified program of maintenance and training is implemented. Recordkeeping Some commenters request that proposed paragraph (b) of the NPRM be revised to specify that, once operators have acceptably revised their maintenance program to include the specified actions, the AD is no longer ``applicable'' to those operators. In effect, the maintenance program revision should be considered ``terminating action'' for the AD. These commenters would prefer to accomplish all of their AD-required leak check tasks within the parameters of their FAA-approved maintenance program, since ``operators have more flexibility in adjusting leak check intervals in accordance with their FAA-approved reliability programs and recordkeeping requirements are less cumbersome.'' The commenters point out that paragraph (b) of the previous NPRM denies operators the opportunity to integrate their leak check tasks into their maintenance program, since ``the NPRM fails to indicate that AD recording procedures are not in effect, and disallows the opportunity to ever adjust the leak check intervals without seeking approval under the alternative method of compliance provision.'' The commenters request that, for these operators, the proposed rule provide for the use of an alternative method of recordkeeping to that otherwise required by Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 91.417 (``Maintenance records'') and 121.380 (``Maintenance recording requirements''). The FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the proposal to indicate in any way that it is ``no longer applicable'' once the revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program is implemented and the appropriate logbook entry made. The FAA considers that, even though this proposed AD would affect the maintenance program, it is of such importance that it warrants other than ``normal'' procedures to be followed in certain aspects. Specifically, under ``normal'' maintenance program procedures, the PMI is authorized to approve any revisions of the maintenance program, including adjustments of the leak check intervals. However, for reasons detailed below, the FAA has determined that the PMI is not the appropriate FAA official for adjusting the compliance intervals for leak checks specified by the terms of this AD. Likewise, the FAA does not concur with the commenters' request to revise the proposal to provide specifically for the use of an alternative method of recordkeeping. Although the FAA has included such a provision in other rulemaking actions [reference, for example, AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;08 R1, amendment 39&hyph;8591 (58 FR 32281, June 9, 1993); and AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;09 R1, amendment 39&hyph;8590 (58 FR 32278, June 9,1993); both of which require the implementation of a corrosion prevention and control program on certain transport category airplanes], the FAA has been unable to confirm that there has been any case in which an operator has found it necessary to use such alternative recordkeeping methods. Therefore, the FAA concludes that the recordkeeping methods currently required by FAR 91.417 and 121.380 are sufficient, and there is no need to include a specific provision in this proposed rule for alternatives.
