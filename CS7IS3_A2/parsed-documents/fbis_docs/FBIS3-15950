According to Shevardnadze, one of the main problems is financing. True this issue was practically decided during Eduard Shevardnadze's meeting with the U.S. congressmen and the President in Washington. It is precisely the United States that will take upon itself the main part of the financing of the international peace-keeping forces. After ending his visit to the United States, Eduard Shevardnadze set off for Canada.
