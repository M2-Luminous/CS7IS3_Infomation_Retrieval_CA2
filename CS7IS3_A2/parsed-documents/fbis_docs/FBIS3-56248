(5)"] [Excerpts] Last spring, National Defense Ministry [KAM] leaders were preoccupied with the purchase of helicopters. The occasion was very convenient -- Lithuania was preparing for the visit of Pope John Paul II. To this end, the commanders of the Lithuanian Air Force applied to the leaders of the Ministry of Transportation with the request of assessing whether a helicopter from Palukne airport was suitable for this purpose. On 28 April, the helicopter MI-8 MTV offered by the private firm "Akvel" was inspected. However, the conclusion about the helicopter's suitability for the pope's mission, submitted by A. Raklevicius, chief of the Civilian Aviation Department Aircraft Section, did not seem to cheer up KAM Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius. The decision was categorical: "The helicopter cannot be used during the pope's visit in Lithuania." As representatives of the Transportation Ministry noted, the "Akvel" commodity was not new. [passage omitted] This closed stock company expected to earn more than $1 million on its helicopter. Sensing that such a price was unrealistic, the "Akvel" manager blurted out in a private conversation that he would sell it to the National Defense Ministry for $700,000 or $800,000. The problem was that there was no place to store this helicopter in Lithuania, and some of its necessary documentation was missing. It seemed that this deal would be buried, because the KAM leaders did not apply to experts for help any more. They kept silent on any helicopter purchases, intentions to buy them, and partners. The fact that the same helicopter offered by "Akvel" had already been bought for $1,100,000 was discovered after the deal. The price paid for another two helicopters sold by the closed stock company "Mingrin" was also revealed then. Lithuania had paid from its pocket even $2.4 million for two MI-8T helicopters. The latter, which Z. Vegelevicius hopes to use for rescue operations, in motorized landing subunits, consignment, and reconnaissance, seem to be totally unsuitable for such purposes. The two MI-8T are designed to fly KAM commanders or some other high-ranking officials rather than for combat purposes. [passage omitted] New helicopters MI-8T and MI-8MTV, bought directly from the Russian association "Aviaeksport," cost $1.2 and $1.7 million, respectively. This Russian enterprise itself delivers aircraft to customers, issues the necessary technical documentation, provides a full set of spare parts, gives a guarantee for three and a half or four years, and assumes the commitment of repairing all failures over this period. The aforementioned prices apply to all CIS states and the so-called "near abroad" countries. Certainly, similar Western helicopters are more expensive, however, their quality seems to be ten-times higher. The Transportation Ministry experts' commission, which had the instruction to inspect and assess the aircraft acquired by the KAM, noted that one could buy cheaper and brand-new MI-8T or MI-8MTV from Russia. For example, the aircraft plant in Kazan can sell helicopters of these types at contract prices ranging from $900,000 to $1 million. Prices at other Russian enterprises dealing in helicopters are similar. And one more thing. The air company "Cheremshanka" from Krasnoyarsk offered the same type of helicopter for sale to Lithuania as the one bought for $750,000-800,000 as far back as March of 1993. However, the KAM leaders were not interested in any other partners or offers of cheaper and newer aircraft for some reason. On 10 June 1993, [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius informed Prime Minister A. Slezevicius that the "KAM had received a number of commercial bids to acquire MI-8MTV helicopters of different models" for prices ranging from $900,000 to $1.6 million. According to A. Butkevicius, one of the most acceptable offers had come from the closed stock company "Akvel." The helicopter proposed by this company was in Lithuania. Moreover, the KAM Air Force had received all documentation, the helicopter had undergone technical inspection, and there had been several test flights. A. Butkevicius reported to the prime minister that the helicopter was suitable for operation, and that the Air Force was ready to take it. A. Butkevicius requested the additional millions of dollars from the prime minister. Did the government show any interest in what helicopter offers the KAM had received? Was it really positive before assigning millions of dollars that these helicopters would be new and with all the necessary parts and documentation? Was it not possible to acquire newer aircraft for the same amount of money abroad?... The government did nothing of the kind. It seems that its leaders trusted Minister A. Butkevicius and his relations with people of dubious reputation. The certificate signed by Air Force Commander Z. Vegelevicius, which RESPUBLIKA has today, reads that the helicopters offered for sale by both "Akvel" and "Mingrin" are new. However, it was noticed on 17 September 1993, while receiving the first helicopter from the company "Akvel" in the Siauliai region, that it lacked dozens or even hundreds of spare parts and some equipment. The same applied to the helicopters acquired from the "Mingrin" company in November. These aircraft were received by ordinary local air base employees -- a commission headed by Captain A. Baskevicius. The statements of transfer did not indicate the suppliers' names. The fact that the helicopters worth millions of dollars were accepted by local air base employees is surprising. The entire leadership of the Air Force and the Defense Ministry itself avoided the signing of any documents at that time. It was such a responsibility and a risk! One could understand that the leaders would have to account for this deal sooner or later. Law enforcement officials, to whom I have talked recently, doubt whether the companies "Akvel" and "Mingrin" had acquired those helicopters legally. They might have been stolen! No provisional certificates of their suitability for use or a document that they had been erased from Russia's state air register were provided during the transaction. Nor is there any such documentation as of today. In addition, the Transportation Ministry experts' commission, which was authorized to assess the state of the helicopters, the legal basis and the expediency of the deal, believes that the KAM price commission behaved frivolously by approving the decision of the ministry's leadership to waste millions of dollars from the state's pocketbook.
