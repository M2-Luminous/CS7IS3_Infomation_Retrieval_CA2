On the morning of 20 May, Premier Li Peng inspected the plant, which produces 5,000 buses annually. Despite a fall in the bus market last year, the plant still produced and sold 4,350 buses with a sales income of 560 million yuan, paid 50.08 million yuan in profit tax, and made 41.62 million yuan profit, a growth of 105 percent over 1992. Because of the success in various technological transformation projects, the plant's principal economic indices have been ahead of its counterparts nationwide for five consecutive years. After viewing the production assembly and workshop, Li Peng held a discussion meeting with the plant's staff in the conference room. After a brief thought, Ju Baocai answered the premier's question: "The primary requirement is to have a good policy. The city committee and government have given us preferential treatment..." After noting down the main points of Ju Baocai's remarks, Li Peng asked again: "What you have said is correct, but what is the key issue?" Comrades attending the discussion meeting became very interested in the premier's quiz of the plant director. Yangzhou City Mayor Shi Guoxing added: "I think the main issue is whether the operating mechanism is flexible or not." Li Peng said: "This is also an important reason." Communications Minister Huang Zhendong, who accompanied the premier on his inspection, said: "The key lies with the market." Li Peng said: "That is correct! I think the key to efficient operation of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises lies with the market. Enterprises must gear themselves toward the market and satisfy market demand. In a market economy, state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises must exploit their edge by producing salable products with the batch processing method. Only then can enterprises be competitive and have their economic efficiency upgraded." Citing the development of Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant as an example, Li Peng further explained: "In the past, your plant repaired automobiles and later produced small-sized trucks. But now you are the nation's largest bus producing plant. Had you chosen trucks, not buses, as your principal products in the first place, could you have won the competition against the First Automobile Works and Second Automobile Works? State-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises not only possess the edge in technological setup and higher quality of their personnel, but also in fine traditions. If they gear themselves toward market demand based on their actual conditions, select correct development strategies, and actively open up the market, they can definitely move onto the path of vitalization." The premier's remarks won Ju Baocai's agreement. It is exactly the market that has brought about profound changes to Yangzhou Bus Main Manufacturing Plant. The 3,000-worker bus plant produces its "Ya Xing" buses in six series of large, medium, and light sizes as well as high, medium, and general grades with 45 various models. The products are sold in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities nationwide, with part of the products exported. In 1991, Premier Li Peng presented 40 large-sized buses from the plant to the Philippine Government as a gift. Li Peng offered an analysis: "Of course, we should realize that in the process of deepened reform and transfer to the market economic system, some enterprises have met with some difficulties to varying degrees, and their economic efficiency is low. This is caused by various factors. We should have full confidence in efficiently operating state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises as well as attach importance to their present difficulties." Li Peng said: "To efficiently run state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises, it is necessary to tackle three areas: First, enterprises must be geared toward the market so that their products continue to correspond with domestic and foreign market demands; second, enterprises must establish a good mechanism suited to the socialist market economy; and third, enterprises must attach importance to technological progress as well as enhance their staying power in development and competitiveness." Ju Baocai told the premier: "During the `Eighth Five-Year Plan,' our plant invested 150 million yuan in technological transformation in stamping [chong ya 0394 1090], chassis, seat, body works, and assembly line, and we will soon enter the market with a new posture." Li Peng affirmed: "Good! I have many reasons to believe that through the efforts of everyone, we can definitely run state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises efficiently. It is groundless for some people to correlate state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises with poor economic efficiency." Li Peng left the conference room to view buses of various categories which the plant produces. He entered a double-decker bus with reclining seats, and asked about its performance and price. He also tried the reclining seat and said: "It is very comfortable and suitable for long-distance travel. How is the market for this type of vehicle?" Li Bingcai, secretary of the Yangzhou city party committee, replied: "Supply cannot meet demand." The plant happens to be a contact point for Li Bingcai, who is very familiar with its operations. Boarding a medium-sized station wagon, Li Peng tried the clutch and brake before starting the vehicle. Under the premier's control, the "Ya Xing" station wagon moved forward slowly, and hearty laughs and applause filled the plant.
