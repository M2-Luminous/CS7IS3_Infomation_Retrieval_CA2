Long Live the Speaker! Myechyslaw Hryb Has Been Elected Chairman of the Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet"] [Text] Commenting on his departure, Stanislav Shushkevich, former speaker of the Belarusian parliament, said: "I am not acceptable to the majority in this parliament. They do not want to form a new society, the majority of the present deputies want to go back to the old ways. I still do not understand how I managed to become head of the Supreme Soviet at all. The communist majority suffered a tremendous shock in the fall of 1991 and my election was a great stroke of luck, not an objective inevitability." At the same time some local observers see several reasons for what happened. Specifically that there was no centrist group in the Belarusian parliament, that it was split between an overwhelming majority and a small opposition, and that the parliament which is unprofessional in status has become an adjunct of the executive. Be that as it may, last Friday [28 January] the Belarusian parliament got a new leader -- Mechyslaw Hryb. Contrary to the predictions of many observers, who thought that parliament would take a long time over the election of a new speaker, this election took just two days. Consultations were held in the groups and factions on 27 January, and on the morning of 28 January the Supreme Soviet Presidium put Mechyslaw Hryb to the deputies as a candidate. Of course, the parliamentarians did not agree to uncontested elections. The list of nominations for the secret ballot included the candidacies of People's Deputies Viktor Hanchar and Mikhail Marinich. Even though none of the contenders managed to obtain the 174 votes necessary for election in the first round, hardly anyone was in any doubt that Hryb would win. Incidentally, the left-wing parliamentary majority gambled on him. They were not wrong. In round two Hryb received 183 votes against 55. The new speaker is 56 years old. He hails from the village of Savichi, which is in Grodno Oblast's Dyatlovskiy Rayon. His father died in the war. In 1959 he graduated from the Interior Ministry's Fire-Fighting Technical School in Lvov. He served in the organs of the Interior Ministry where he rose to the rank of lieutenant general and chief of the Vitebsk Oblast Soviet Executive Committee's Internal Affairs Administration. In 1990 Mechyslaw Hryb was elected a Belarusian people's deputy. He headed the parliamentary commission on questions of national security, defense, and the fight against crime. He is a supporter of a strong authority and advocates the introduction of the presidency. He supported the ratification of the CIS Collective Security Treaty, which led to serious frictions with Stanislav Shushkevich. At his first news conference following the election, Myechyslaw Hryb told journalists that he sees his main task as the consolidation of all the forces in parliament. "I have no other program to extricate the republic from the crisis than that which was adopted by our Supreme Soviet and government," he said. "I do not believe that there should be any adjustments to our foreign policy course. Belarus will remain a sovereign, independent state, will strive for non-nuclear status and neutrality, and will conscientiously fulfill all previously signed treaties and agreements." Myechyslaw Hryb's election as chairman of the Belarus Supreme Soviet has been unambiguously assessed by many observers as a victory for the left-wing forces in Belarus. In their opinion this may have quite a powerful impact on the republic's foreign policy and in particular could introduce ideological aspects to it. After all, voices have already been raised in parliament on several occasions calling for "opposition to the West" and its influence. As for relations with the eastern neighbor, they will most probably become even closer.
