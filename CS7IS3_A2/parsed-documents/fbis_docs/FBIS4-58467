FBIS4-58467 "drnes086_s_94007" FBIS-NES-94-086 Daily Report 3 May 1994 Iran UK Group Accused of Supporting `Terrorists' UK Group Accused of Supporting `Terrorists' LD0305191294 Tehran IRNA in English 1454 GMT 3 May 94 LD0305191294 Tehran IRNA English BFN [Text] London, May 3, IRNA -- A UK parliamentary group, known to be actively involved in supporting anti-Iran terrorists, renewed its campaign of smears against the Tehran government Tuesday by trying to widen the offensive into an international conspiracy. In a letter to THE TIMES, president of the so-called Parliamentary Human Rights Group, Lord Avebury, supported the paper's call for a "tougher policy" against Iran but made no mention of his links with mojahedin terrorists. The close association of Lord Avebury and others, including the London-based United Nations Association Director, Malcolm Harper, in supporting the fomenting of anti-Iran terrorist activities come as an embarrassment for the UK in making fresh smears against Iran. A new propaganda campaign was launched last week by Foreign Office Minister, Douglas Hogg, claiming that the Iranian intelligence service had connections with the IRA, who are waging an armed struggle against British rule in Northern Ireland. Hogg himself has been accused by the friends and family of human rights solicitor, Patrick Finucane, of being at least partially responsible for the 1989 assassination of the Belfast lawyer by loyalist terrorists. One of the focuses of Lord Avebury has been to promote the image of mojahedin terrorists and to present the Iraq-based grouplet as a `legitimate' opposition movement under the banner of `The National Council of Resistance of Iran.' Last month, he was photographed by an MKO publication meeting one of its leaders, Maryam Rajavi, for two-hours at her residence in France. He was quoted "praising" the policy of the terrorist group. In the same publication, a review was made of numerous armed attacks and bombings carried out by the terrorist group in Iran over the past year. The group has been responsible for hundreds of innocent lives since failing to overturn the 1979 Islamic revolution. A report published by the so-called parliamentary human rights group in March, entitled `The Tehran Murder Machine,' like Amnesty International reports, is understood to be largely based upon the propaganda disseminated by the terrorist group. Lord Avebury's letter to THE TIMES Tuesday was also seen containing many of the crudities of the MKO literature both in language and in allegations. Other political groups, including the Labor Party, which in the past have supported the MKO, have generally distanced themselves from their known associations with the terrorist group, since its headquarters were moved to Baghdad in the late 1980. Many MKO members are still harbored by the UK, and even allowed to parade their literature that has included explicit instructions on making bombs and explosives that apparently have been ignored by the British campaign against terrorism.
