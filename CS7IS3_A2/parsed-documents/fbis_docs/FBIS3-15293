The detainees are suspected of premeditated murder. All four are members of the Russian Party. Firearms were discovered at their homes and workplaces, and these have been confiscated. Nikolay Bondarik is an advocate of Hitlerite ideas. He stated: "The global task facing the Russian Party is to create a single racial area from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean.... Why not set up...reservations for the Yakuts and the Uzbeks? Likewise, a national park for Jews will be set up in Birobidzhan, where our children will go for days out, to have a look." This scandalous piece of news may have a noticeable impact on the disposition of political forces in St. Petersburg on the eve of the elections to its City Assembly. How will the "Great Russia" bloc (which comprises the St. Petersburg branches of the Russian Party, the Russian National Alliance, and the Russian National Assembly) behave now? How will the Russian Party itself react to what has happened? For now, its supporters intend to picket the building of the St. Petersburg Main Internal Affairs Administration.
