The 11 members of Premiere Urgence were imprisoned in a Serb barracks at Lukavica, a suburb of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, on April 8 after their aid convoy was intercepted and on Monday, three of them were indicted for transporting arms to the Bosnian Moslems. Spokesman Pascale de Lomas said judicial investigation of the case against the three would likely end on May 8 and their trial would follow immediately. The eight others would be freed. The parents of the only woman in the group, Patricia Ettouati, said the 11 were being held in the same room and were in good health, but had lost weight because of "foul food". The Bosnian Serbs first proposed swapping the aid workers for 11 Serb doctors and nurses held in Sarajevo by the Moslems. Premiere Urgence, which has been active in Bosnia transporting food parcels to Sarajevo with the agreement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, will send lawyers and observers from Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights to the trial, to be staged in the Bosnian Serb capital of Pale. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has called the arrest of the 11 "hostage-taking" and demanded their "immediate and unconditional" release.
