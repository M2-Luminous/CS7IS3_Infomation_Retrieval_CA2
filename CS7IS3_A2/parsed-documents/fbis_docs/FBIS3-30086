FBIS3-30086 "dreas038_d_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-038 Document Type:Daily Report 25 Feb 1994 South Korea Kim Yong-sam Holds 25 Feb News Conference Answers Journalists' Questions SK2502031294 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network in Korean 0018 GMT 25 Feb 94 SK2502031294 Seoul KBS-1 Television Network Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [News conference by President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and domestic reporters on 25 February at the presidential residence, Chongwadae, on the occasion of the first anniversary of his inauguration--live ] [Text] [Reporter Kim Chung-il from the KYONGHYANG SINMUN] The North Korean nuclear issue which, as you said, is closely related to the destiny of 70 million fellow countrymen has now been handed over to the talks between the United States and North Korea, let alone the issue of North-South dialogue. However, in view of the positions and attitudes of North Korea and the United States toward these negotiations, it seems very difficult to expect that the nuclear issue will be completely resolved at an early date. Are you ready to hold summit talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song in an effort to settle such a deadlock and to Koreanize the nuclear issue? Also, various reports and speculations regarding the North Korean issue have run rampant recently, and this has driven the people into confusion. So, Mr. President, please make public before the people, if possible, any intelligence concerning North Korea's nuclear development. [Kim Yong-sam] Thank you. Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, I received reports even until right before I came to this news conference room. I mean I received reports from the United States on the U.S.-North Korean contact which is now being held there. The U.S.-North Korean contact which was scheduled to be held this morning has been delayed. In the relations between the ROK and the United States I can clearly say that the ROK and U.S. Governments have maintained and are maintaining closer and friendlier relations more than ever before. The two governments are fully consulting with each other on all issues under the pricinciple of mutual respect. Regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, in particular, the United States has fully consulted with the ROK in advance and sometimes in the course of its negotiations with North Korea. So, the two countries have made full discussions and consultation before and after the United States held negotiations with North Korea. Therefore, there is no case where our sovereignty is ignored or anything like that. In other words, I can clearly say that our opinions have been reflected. Let me mention something about nuclear intelligence. As you know, as the president I hear and receive much intelligence from various channels at home and abroad. Summing up numerous intelligence reports we have received so far we have been unable to find clear evidence that North Korea has nuclear weapons. We cannot clearly say that North Korea has nuclear weapons. Another clear fact is that North Korea has continuously pushed ahead with nuclear development without renouncing it and without delaying it. This is also a clear fact. By the way, although no agreement was reached until this morning, North Korea is destined to accept the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] inspections, and North-South dialogue and exchange of special envoys will be realized after all. On the question on summit talks with President Kim Il-song, I will push ahead with holding summit talks with President Kim Il-song only when holding the talks is considered to be conducive to making North Korea renounce its nuclear development. [KBS reporter Kim Hong] You said that you will hold summit talks with President Kim Il-song when it is judged to be of help in restraining the nuclear issue. Does that mean that South-North summit talks can be held with the exchange of envoys of the South and North in addition to the contacts that have been held heretofore, even before the nuclear transparency is guaranteed? [President Kim] Yes. Originally, the North Korean side proposed the exchange of envoys of the South and North. The exchange of envoys was a precondition to holding summit talks. Therefore, the exchange of envoys itself is part of holding summit talks. [KYONGHYANG SINMUN reporter Kim Chung-il] The proposal for summit talks is an epoch-making proposal that may even be said to be a change in our policy toward North Korea. Was there special background to this matter? Also, how do you view the timing of summit talks against the backdrop of proposing the South-North summit talks? [President Kim] I believe that you all know of the tug-of-war that was carried out during the past year to resolve the nuclear issue. However, the most important duty for me as president is to defend the country, protect the people, and to protect the 70 million people of the Korean peninsula from war. Therefore, one of my important goals was to prevent nuclear development at all costs. At the same time, I was of the strong will that a war must not break out on the Korean peninsula. This is a very difficult issue. Therefore, there are aspects that need to be strongly pushed ahead as well as other aspects that we need to strategically withdraw on. I believe that the most important duty of the president is to allow the people to live in security. Therefore, we must prevent North Korea's nuclear development for strategic reasons. This must be achieved not only for peace on the Korean peninsula but also for peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. It is also necessary for South-North co-existence and prosperity. I have deeply contemplated over this matter from various aspects. [HANGUK ILBO reporter Choe Kyu-sik] Can your remark on the South-North summit be explained as acceptance of the proposal made by President Kim Il-song last year? Also, the South-North summit talks brought up by President Kim Il-song is centered on the reunification issue. Do you plan to include economic cooperation and your three-stage reunification plan in addition to the nuclear issue in the discussion? [President Kim] If summit talks are held, we cannot just talk about one issue. All issues as well as the nuclear issue will be discussed. I believe that a deep exchange of opinions on all issues including the issue of economic cooperation and reunification can be held for South-North co-existence and prosperity. [CHUNGANG ILBO reporter Kim Hyon-il] You said that there have been sufficient consultations between the ROK and the United States on all issues. However, there have been various rumors as to the deployment of Patriot missiles, which are defensive weapons. Will you please tell us about the reason of such rumors? You also said that if the North Korean nuclear issue is resolved, the Team Spirit exercise will be suspended. Please tell us whether there will be no problem in our security posture even in time of emergency, if the exercise is suspended. [President Kim] Some press organs have publicized this issue in various forms. However, there are many incorrect reports. Some papers even reported that the ROK wants to receive Patriot missiles. However, we have never asked them. I want to clarify at this point that the ROK has no plan to purchase Patriot missiles. The ROK and the United States have been conducting close consultations on this issue, including the time of introduction. As you know, Patriot missiles are not offensive. They are totally purely defensive. Therefore, this is not an issue to which one, including North Korea, should pay sensitive attention. I believe, however, that the issue should be decided from the political point of view, instead of the military aspect. Thus, discussions are ongoing on this issue. I think there will be no great problem pertaining to this, because the United States fully respects our sovereignty. Unlike the past, cooperation is being attained 100 percent. As for the issue of the Team Spirit exercise, we conducted the exercise every year in the past. However, we are tentatively withholding it in order to make North Korea accept IAEA inspections and to hold sincere North-South dialogue. Therefore, in the event that all these conditions are met, the ROK Government will announce the suspension of the exercise. The suspension will be announced on certain conditions. We do not mean complete suspension. Only when everything is met, the exercise will be suspended completely. We can conduct the Team Spirit exercise at any time we want. As the exercise usually begins in March, a considerable amount of troops and weapons should have already departed from the U.S. mainland if the exercise is to be conducted. However, it is being withheld tentatively, not being suspended forever. We will start it again if the conditions are not met. Therefore, even if we announce the suspension, there will be no problem in the defense of the ROK. [MBC reporter Cho Chong-min] I would like to ask a few political questions. A survey revealed that the degree of support for the president, which reached 90 percent after your inauguration, recently declined to 60 percent. This means that the critical view is increasing, although the figure of 60 percent itself is enormous. What reason do you see for this? In particular, some people observe that those who were your supporters from the past are leaving your (?camp). How do you assess all of this? [President Kim] I thank you the people for your continuous over 90 percent support for me since my inauguration. It's amazing that one could get over 90 percent support from the people. The support was so dazzling that I felt an enormous burden and pressure. I felt it somewhat abnormal. I thought it should be lower than that. There should be a certain degree of opposition in a democratic society. Now, therefore, it is returning to normalcy. I, therefore, feel gratified for it. I think I can work with a sense of relief now. The decisive contributing factors to the dwindling of my popularity were the major accidents, the contamination of drinking water from the Naktong River--which have in fact been the result of undesirable practices over the past 30 years--and particularly the recent hike in the cost of living, in which the people are concerned about most. What I would like to say to your question is that, since I am not going to run for the presidency four years from now and since my convictions do not allow me to do anything for the sake of winning temporary popularity, if I think something is right and is necessary for the people, I will not hesitate to do it. This is what I have done in the past as well. As for the real name financial transaction system, for instance, it was far from a policy of attracting popularity. Many around me then advised me against the real name financial transaction system, on the ground that it should be instituted after the recovery of our then slack economy. I turned down the idea because it would postpone the system indefinitely, perhaps for good. I stressed that we should do it for the sake of economic justice. We should do it to justify wealth. We should institute the real name financial transaction system, the key point of reform. We should not postpone the system until the economy recovers, to win the people's popularity. Thus, we implemented the system. The term of the U.S. President is four years. Although one can remain in the office for a second term, there were quite a few presidents who did not serve a second term. For instance, President Bush and President Carter. Today, I begin the second year of my office as if I were making a new start. I will not do anything to seek temporary public popularity. If I think it beneficial to our country and people, I will not shrink from doing it. [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-on] I will ask you a question on reform as a whole. Despite the sweeping audit and inspection activities for the last year and despite the general reform you have conducted for society as a whole, the people do not feel tangible effects of reform in such areas as the cost of living, environment, and transportation. Some also noted the lack of the general program for reform. Please give us a general outline of the program for reform for the next four years of your term, giving us the priority list and the method of reform. [President Kim] Many references are made to the lack of a program, civilian dictatorship, and one-man rule. I much doubt the credibility of such references. During the era of military dictatorship, dictatorship was enforced. The government of civilian democracy is the government given birth to by the people. It is literally the government of civilian democracy. Under a president-centered government, the president takes the responsibility and leads the state. The president is the person who takes the supreme responsibility for managing the state. He is responsible for leading the state. If anyone says this is civilian dictatorship and uses the description One-Man Politics, I can hardly understand it. Does he mean that we should return to dictatorship under which we were in the past? I hope that you will make efforts to help the people properly appreciate matters related to this question. As for the issue of the rise in the cost of living, I am very sorry that there was such an increase. The government will concentrate its efforts to check the increase in the cost of living. An important reason for the increase in the cost of living was that the cold weather last year caused an increase in farm produce prices. That has had a lot to do with the present situation connected with the hike in the cost of living. As you well know, some increase in prices is a common sight in January every year. I think it is very difficult to assess a price increase in one full year based on the price increase in such a short period of time, that is, January. So, our government is making every possible effort to prevent price increases. However, what is important here is the people's cooperation with the government's efforts. In other words, the people should not perpetrate the practice of cornering goods or being indisposed to sell goods. Early in January a phenomenon of excessive spending was seen among the citizens. We can say such a phenomenon is an act of hoarding goods and being indisposed to sell goods. Therefore, if our people are to worry about an increase in prices they should join the government's efforts in settling the price problem. I urge our people's cooperation in settling the price problem. In dealing with economic matters, I think that we should set priority according to the degree of importance. In connection with the Uruguay Round issue, in addition to 42 trillion won annually, the government plans to invest 1.5 trillion won each year in the structural improvement project for our rural villages by establishing special purpose taxes. At the same time, the Agricultural Development Committee has been formed. So, we will see to it that this committee will study in detail how to use these funds for rural villages. Of course, in the rural improvement project, too, we will set priority. [TONG-A ILBO reporter Song Yong-ho] I will use the term one-man rule in the form of a different expression because I know you dislike that term. During the past year you have directly and personally dealt with everything, and as a result, the word of politics devoid of power was spreading among the people. What do you say on this? What is your plan, if any, for the revitalization of politics? In your opening remarks you stressed the need for creative relations between the government ruling party and the opposition party. You also urged the opposition party to become a sincere partner for reforms. For this end, do you think it necessary to hold talks between the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties? [President Kim] It has been one year since I was inaugurated. However, I told you that this one year seems to be 10 years for me. I come to my office in Chongwadae between 0720 and 0740 every morning. That is when my work begins. My work varies greatly. There are many, many things for which I as the president should be responsible. This situation has made it inevitable for me to directly and personally deal with everything. However, I did these things according to my conscience. As you know, right after my inauguration I declared that I will never receive money, not even a coin, from anyone in five years while staying in the presidency. I will keep this promise. While staying in the presidency I will never be involved in any concessions. My faith is that I should become a clean and morally dignified president. By becoming so, I think, I can dignifiedly ask and appeal to the people to do for the country. This is why I have such faith. I have mentioned many times the need for clean politics and for the revitalization of politics. Spending money for politics is a bad thing and should be done away with thoroughly. A genuine democracy cannot be expected in those countries where people spend money in politics. Only when clean elections are conducted can genuine democracy be enforced. I would not point out the name of a specific country which has been known to spend much money in elections. Those countries which spend money in politics are corrupt countries. This finally leads to dictatorship. It also leads the people to ruin. So, politics should be clean, and elections should be clean. On the issue of our political party, the Democratic Liberal Party, I have already handed all and absolute power over party management affairs and other affairs regarding the National Assembly within our party over to Kim Chong-pil, chairman of the party. I have transferred all powers over to Chairman Kim Chong-pil. I will not meddle in the management affairs of the National Assembly. So, Chairman Kim Chong-pil has been operating our party with all authority. Speaking of the matter on meeting the representative of the opposition party, I think we can meet any time, if necessary. [Reporter Ed Paisley for FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in English] I would like to ask you questions about the government's privatization program. You have an ambitious schedule of selling all state-owned companies. Will the Federation of Korea Industries be involved in this process as they are now in telecommunications industry privatization or will the (?industries) be excluded from the process, leaving the decision-making in the hands of some self-interested bureaucrats? [President Kim] Our government will decide on the privatization plan. I think the operation of state-run enterprises in our country may have been loose or faulty in the past. Therefore, I plan to actively push the privatization program. You asked about the issue of the second mobile telecommunications corporation. I see many Japanese reporters here. For example in Japan, this issue was not handled by the government but autonomously by the National Federation of Japanese Business Corporations. Believing this method to be very desirable, our government plans to remain detached from this issue and to leave the decisionmaking in the hands of the Federation of Korea Industries. [Reporter Kim Chang-ki for CHOSON ILBO] In your opening remarks earlier, you pointed out that political reform is most urgent, and in fact, many people sympathize with this. Reform of the system is also important to political reform. However, many people emphasize that people must be replaced first of all. Will you tell us of your plans, if any, to foster a new political generation for political reform, as well as your plans on the succession structure [hugye kudo]? The issue of reorganizing political circles and of revising the Constitution to institute a cabinet system has recently been raised among the people. I would appreciate hearing your opinion on these issues. [President Kim] You have asked several questions at once. People are key to all work. Through lessons learnt from history, we know that the history of a nation can change according to who becomes the leader of that country. World history shows that a nation's history changed according to who its leader became. Therefore, the issue of the leadership of a nation, which includes assemblymen, dominates all problems. Because the previous era of dictatorship lasted so long in our country, various improper customs and practices of the people were propagated. Values have now changed. I hope that more reform-oriented, progressive figures who can dedicate themselves to the nation will come forward in political circles. I was asked some time ago about the succession structure, but I am being asked again today. One year has passed since I came to office, and four years, the length of a president's term in office in the United States, still remains. If one were to think about one's successor only one year into one's term with four years remaining, that person would be considered strange indeed. It is a little too early to bring this issue up. Allow me plenty of time to think over this issue. Currently I am not considering political realignment at all. This is not a matter which can be solved artificially. Also, I believe that the parliamentary government system is not at all appropriate in our country's situation. If our country carries out a responsible parliamentary system, it will only result in misfortune in a situation in which our country is already divided. I believe that this system is of absolutely no value to us. I'll be frank with you. When I met Hosokawa in Kyongju and at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, he said to me that he earnestly felt a president-centered system to be favorable in politics. [YONHAP reporter Kim Song-su] I would like to ask you two questions regarding the election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies. The 1995 election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies can be regarded as an important election that will prove the success or failure of political reform. Nevertheless, there is already concern regarding elements of corruption in regions on the issue of candidates. Do you have a measure to deal with such corruption? Also, in connection with the election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies, is there a more desirable way to restructure the administrative district and regulate the government structure? [President Kim] I think the most important aspect in the election of chiefs of regional autonomous bodies is to carry out clean elections. Only then can the chiefs of regional autonomous bodies sincerely and honestly work for that region. I will mobilize all of our administrative power to strictly punish those carrying out illegal elections. I would like to say that confidential inquiries are being made on rumors that candidates are carrying out corrupt acts. The issue of restructuring the administrative district is an issue to be decided upon at the National Assembly. I hope that political circles will deal with this matter in a just way and in accordance with the people's interest. [SEOUL SINMUN reporter Kim Yong-man] I would like to ask you a question on the economy. As you noted, many people are worried about price instability. The government's policy on price control is moving from indirect regulation to direct regulation. What is the government's policy on prices and can this year's inflation be kept at six percent? What is your view on this? [President Kim] I talked about the price issue a short while ago. The government regards the price issue as its most important task. We are making utmost efforts. I mentioned that the people's decisive cooperation is necessary. Related to this, certain people are talking about the issue of carrying out tax investigations. Tax investigations are carried out on businesses that unjustly raise prices. Such tax investigations are not illegal, and must be carried out. Also, public utility charges of those that were inevitable were raised. We will continue to work to control various matters that stimulate price increases such as the rise in public utility charges. The rise in public utility charges will be absorbed through rationalization of management. The government will exert efforts regarding this matter but we also need the people's voluntary cooperation. [SBS reporter Chon Yong-hak] You talked about measures for price stability. You said that tax investigations will be carried out on unjustly raised prices. However, measures that are being taken resemble those of the past which contradict overall economic liberalization. What is your view on this matter? Late last year you said you would reduce land prices, interest rates, and wages and work to revitalize the economy. However, recent trends indicate that these prices are also on the rise. What is the reason for this? Also, do you have any measures for this? [President Kim] I think that the issue of price stability is of great interest. As I said before, I apologize to the people once again regarding this matter. I had expressed a strong will to be absolutely intolerant of unearned income [pullosotuk] and increasing land prices. I believe that the three elements [land prices, interest rates, and wages] were kept considerably under control last year and expect that to be the case this year also. I will take strict measures regarding this matter. Also, workers have shown a tendency to restrain themselves in demanding wage increases. We must cooperate at this important time when we must improve the nation's competitive edge. I have met numerous workers and talked with them over lunch many times. I have visited many small- and medium-size business corporations, though I have visited a few big ones, as well. Officials in those small and medium-size corporations have told me what difficulties they are facing. During my recent regional tours, I have witnessed many changes that the small- and medium-size corporations are undergoing. I have always thought that small- and medium-size corporations form the foundation of our economy. They play a very important role in our economy. They employ over 50 percent of our workers. Some people say the government has been negligent in assisting small- and medium-size corporations. This is not correct. Last year, we completely froze the wages of government officials. I am very sorry for the government officials and their families. The government assisted small- and medium-size corporations with 1.3 trillion won, a portion of the funds saved by the wage freeze. When the government heard that they were facing very serious difficulties because of the implementation of the real-name financial transaction system, it assisted them with another 2.2 trillion won. No other regime has given such a massive monetary assistance to small- and medium-size corporations. As a result, small- and medium-size corporations have become very active, and many companies have declared that this year will be the first year of labor-management harmony. I am very pleased to see many companies where management and workers are working in a family-like atmosphere. [Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL in English] Thank you, Mr. President. I am Steven Glenn of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL. You have made internationalization a prominent theme of your administration in your speech this morning. As you know, that means Korea will have to open its markets to foreign competitors, goods, and services. That could create some business failures here and rising employment. And, I am wondering if you are willing to accept short-term sacrifices for long-term benefits of internationalization. I would also like to ask you if labor relations this year do not proceed as smoothly as you would like, would you be willing to reform the labor code? [President Kim] Globalization and internationalization constitute a trend that we cannot reserve. All countries of the world are moving in this direction. And, I think this is a road we must move along without fail. And, we are at an important point at which we must win victory without fail on this road. The point is: Even though our markets have been opened, markets of other countries have opened even wider. Winning through competition in these widely open markets is the only way for us to survive. We must win in the competition by manufacturing the best- quality goods in the world. Given our people's potential and ability, I am confident we can win. Having confidence is the most important thing. Being confident in what we can do is the most important, I think. Having a dream is also very important. I think we can win in worldwide competition. I think both long-term and short-term prospects are not grim. As for labor-management relations, because both businessmen and workers firmly believe they must win in this difficult era of international competition, they declared this year would the first year of labor-management harmony, while restraining themselves, seeking common interests, and seeking national interests. I hope labor-management relations will go smoothly this year. I do not plan to reform the labor code for now. [KUNGMIN ILBO reporter Kim Song-chin] Just now, you mentioned internationalization. Therefore, I would like to ask you about two matters regarding the Uruguay Round negotiations. First, what measures will the government take against the possible strong pressure by the advanced countries, including the United States, to open the banking and service markets, in addition to the agricultural field? Second, now the National Assembly must ratify the Uruguay Round negotiations: How do you persuade the opposition parties or farmers' organizations to support it? If you have any plans, will you please tell us about them? [President Kim] You used the term pressure of opening. This does not mean that we will give in to other countries' pressure. We will decide on a policy to meet the interest of our nation. I believe that we will never give in to pressure. It is unthinkable. Our country's position is very firm. It is not the position of our country to give in to pressure. We could not but to decide, however, if we were to become an isolated state or compete with other countries in the international arena. During the Uruguay negotiations, we had to consider the national interest. I hope you can understand it. Furthermore, I have been to rural communities on many occasions. I found that there were many changes in farmers' position. They have greatly changed. Of course, farmers must change on their own. It is an indispensable global trend to adopt the so-called Uruguay Round negotiations. Therefore, we must survive, at any cost, in the international arena by raising competitiveness. In this respect, we must change our thought. As mentioned earlier, we will provide support to rural communities by establishing a special tax bill to save 1.5 trillion won per year. By forming the agricultural development [nongbalwi] committee, the government will make every effort to provide support to rural communities based on the idea that to save the rural communities is to save the country. I believe that our farmers have a considerable understanding of this and have changed on their own everyday. In this respect, I think, it is very fortunate. [SANKEI SHIMBUM reporter Kuroda] Thank you. I have two questions for you. You have strongly stressed internationalization. However, there is an argument regarding the introduction of the Japanese culture. What do you think of it, upon your upcoming visit to Japan? First, do you think that Japan must be excluded from the internationalization of your country? Second, the ROK papers reported that North Korean loggers escaped from a lumber camp in Russia, and that they have asked the ROK Government for asylum. However, your government refused it. What do you think of it? [President Kim] Thank you. In moving forward the internationalization, as I mentioned earlier, it is our position that we will open all markets. There may be problems in opening the markets. I believe that it is right to open the market. However, we must carefully consider the method and time of the opening. As you talked about my upcoming visit to Japan, I will visit Japan and China next month. Of course, needless to say that our relations with the United States are very important, but, at the same time, our relations with the three countries, such as Japan, China, and Russia -- which are neighboring countries -- are very important as well. I believe that it is very significant for me to visit the two countries, Japan and China. Not only for the common interest between the ROK and the two countries, but also for the settlement of the nuclear issue, economic cooperation with them, and the cooperation between their people -- in particular, Japan and China are members of the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] -- my upcoming visit to the two countries is very significant. Regarding your last question on the North Korean workers' request for asylum, I have received the detailed reports. As of present, a great number of people are engaged in lumber cutting work in Russia. It is true that North Korea have sent many people there. Many of them have visited our country's embassy or consulate in Russia and asked for asylum. The number of people who asked for asylum is tremendous. However, the majority of them do not have passports. In order words, they are stateless. This is strange. We may think that they are Koreans because they speak the Korean language. It is very easy and simple for us to accept their asylum if they ask for it directly from North Korea. In this case, we can easily decide on it. Because they have asked for asylum from other country's territory, the so-called Russia, there are many international problems. Therefore, we must consider those international issues in the light of international law. However, we are basically carefully and positively dealing with them in the light of humaneness and human rights. [Kim Ki-ung from HANGUK KYONGJE SINMUN] Mr. President, since being sworn in, you have paid particular attention to economic affairs. Every time such serious problems as the opening of the rice markets, the shortages of the social overhead capital, and the contamination of portable water arose, you said solving those problems would be the top priorities in state affairs. Some people wonder whether these problems can be solved at a time no budget is appropriated for solving those problems. Would you comment on this? Also, many people point out some government ministries announce new policies without coordinating views with other pertinent ministries. Would you comment on this, as well? [President Kim] Each project is being carried out depending on its priority. We have established a special tax for solving the rice problem. We have also proposed a bill on inducing private capital. As for the social overhead capital, we will decide on which infrastructural problem should be solved first and which should be later. The water problem and the agricultural problem must be solved on a priority basis. I again say people will help the government solve these problems. [Yun Chang-chung of SEGYE ILBO] I will ask you a question on your philosophy on operating the national economy. In the early days of your presidency, you repeatedly stressed the spirit of sharing pains. However, you have recently given us the impression that you attach importance to big businesses. What is your genuine philosophy on operating the national economy? Seeing the economy not improving, some people say the efforts to share pains have reached their limit. They also criticize the government for not presenting concrete goals, for example, the goal of national economic growth. Would you comment on this? [President Kim] I think I have answered a similar question. I have stated I attach importance to small- and medium-size corporations. I have also stated how much the government assisted them. My government has attached the greatest importance to small- and medium-size corporations. I have met more workers than any other president. I have had lunch with them and talked with them wherever I have gone. I think you cannot stress too much the importance of small- and medium-size corporations. I hope you understand this. Why do we not have goals? We are going toward the set goals. The goal of economic growth for this year is 6 percent. The notion that there is no philosophy on operating the national economy is not correct. We will make every effort to fulfill those set goals. [Andrew Steele of REUTER, in English] Mr. President: We have heard many times now the government's plans for liberalizing the economic markets. But, recent events have shown that the government has, in fact, been intervening heavily in the economy. I mention two factors here: price controls and the recent measures to cool the stock exchange, which has, in fact, infuriated a lot of foreign investors who are barred even further from getting into the Korean markets. Why is the government saying one thing about liberalization when, in fact, it continues to intervene heavily. Thank you? [President Kim] As for the market opening, we are planning to open everything to ensure that foreigners think Korea is the best place to do business. I think providing conditions to ensure that foreigners invest in Korea without anxiety is very important. The government facilitates utmost autonomy in all sectors. I think the notion that the government heavily intervenes in everything is a misunderstanding. Some people tend to suspect that if anything happens, the government must have done something. Those days have passed. I hope there is no misunderstanding on this matter. [Shinogawa of MAINICHI SHIMBUN] During your news conference held at the beginning of this year, you said signs of peace were visible in North Korea. What has happened to those signs of peace? And, what do you mean by signs of peace? [President Kim] Though I have much information on this, I think it is not good to tell you about it here. As you know, changes are taking place in North Korea, are they not? North Korea, which had stated it would never receive inspections from the IAEA, notified the IAEA and the United States that it would receive inspections from the IAEA and issue visas in a few days. This was unimaginable last year. I once said North Korea would change. I think this [acceptance of nuclear inspection] in itself is a great change. [Han Myon-taek of the Christian Broadcasting System] My question concerns educational reform. The Education Ministry and the Educational Reform Committee will map out reform plans. What is your basic plan on the high school and college entrance examination systems, foreign language education, and other matters? [President Kim] I think education is the most important in our society. I know the quality of education determines the destiny of a country. I realized this upon reading a book written by Paul Kennedy. Someone says Korea owes its current prosperity to education. There are daunting problems in education not only in Korea but also in the advanced countries in the world. We have reporters here from Japan and the United States. The United States has very difficult problems in education. Japan is no different. Because educational reform is very important, it took almost one year to form the Education Reform Committee. Education is not a matter on which decisions can be made quickly. It takes much time to decide on educational reform. I think we must examine various factors to map out far-reaching plans. I have my own ideas. I will fully discuss this matter with the newly established Educational Reform Committee and the education minister. We will make decisions on how to reform education to ensure that our country survives. [Unidentified reporter] You will soon visit China. Telephone exchange systems, automobiles, and aviation are matters of concern between the two countries. Would you tell us if it is possible to reach any agreement on these matters? People say the Chinese leader should visit our country this time because President No Tae-u visited China the last time. What do you think of this? [President Kim] I and the Chinese leader met during the APEC summit talks and discussed telephone exchange systems and aviation. It is not correct to mention these issues now. As for protocol, I think you should know which leader should visit the other is not that important of a matter. Since the two countries established diplomatic relations, the Chinese head of state had never sent a letter, for example, a letter of invitation, to the ROK. This time, China sent an official letter of invitation for me to visit China. China invited me to visit China as a state guest. During a news conference held early this year, I told people that I would go anywhere in the world as a salesman if it is beneficial to our state and people. I will go anywhere if it is beneficial to our country. As I told you before, now is a very important time, I think. Therefore, visiting Japan and China in the era of the Pacific basin is very significant. Thank you.
