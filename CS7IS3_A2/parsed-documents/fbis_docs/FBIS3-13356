Four divisions were used in the attack. Reports from SAIRI sources in south Iraq have confirmed that this large attack was launched on several fronts in the direction of the residential areas and villages of the marshlands triangle in the al-Basrah, al-Nasiriyah, and al-'Amarah Governorates. The tyrant's forces prepared for this attack with intensive artillery shelling of the residential areas of the marshlands, killing and wounding dozens of civilians who fled in panic from their villages and houses and are now living among the reeds without food, water, or medicine. The regime's forces are continuing to chase the fleeing citizens by firing their long-range artillery on them at random. Citizens coming from these areas have confirmed that the regime's forces are continuing their acts of destruction and burning in the areas of (Nahr Salih), (Abu Julan), al-Dal'ah, al-Badriyah, [words indistinct], (Abu Jawlanah), (Abu Subat), (Abu al-Nirki), and (al- Sihabi). The afflicted families fled deep into the marshlands where they are now suffering from thirst and hunger due to shortages of food and water. The SAIRI reports added that the Republican Guards forces remain in a state of maximum alert and deployed on the edges of the marshlands in preparation for launching a still larger attack than the current one. The reports also said that criminal 'Ali Hasan al- Majid, tyrant Saddam's defense minister, personally led the current offensive from the former headquarters of the 11th Division which lies between the areas of Umm al-Shuwayj and (al-Khuyut) in the (al- Mudaynah) Governorate. Tyrant Saddam's regime aims with this barbaric crime to implement a new stage in its infernal scheme to destroy the marshlands areas completely and turn them into a desert not fit for habitation and to force its people who have been living there since the dawn of history to leave so that the regime can have full control of these areas which are known as centers of steadfastness and resistance to Saddam's regime and his criminal gang. The Saddam regime's real war of genocide against an historic area known for its human civilization constitutes a blatant challenge to the will of the international community and the UN resolutions, including Security Council Resolution 688 of 8 April 1991, which prohibits the Iraqi regime from suppressing the civilians of Iraq. This is a direct and grave threat to security, peace, and stability in the region and the world. The current situations in southern Iraq's marshland areas have reached the stage where it has become difficult to remain silent or maintain the position of spectator. Hence, we call on the international community, its bodies, its humanitarian organizations, and its media to condemn the barbaric aggressive action of Saddam's regime and to support the Iraqi people in its tribulation. A responsible SAIRI source has also appealed to the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, to act quickly to take measures to stop the genocide being waged against the inhabitants of the marshlands, especially as the Security Council and other UN organizations have the documents and evidence that confirm that the marshland areas are being subjected to a real war of genocide. This was also confirmed by the reports of the rapporteur of human rights in Iraq [words indistinct] who has repeatedly called for sending UN observers to Iraq to monitor human rights violations in this country. The source said: We call on the Security Council to implement the rapporteur's report and to speed up the dispatch of inspection and observer teams to the marshlands and south Iraq where there is an urgent and persistent need for them more than ever since there is no security for the civilian citizens as a result of the oppression, campaigns of annihilation, killings, and the economic and military siege. He added: We appeal to the Security Council to compel the Iraqi regime to comply with and implement the clauses of Resolution 688, the most important of which is the clause on stopping the suppression of civilians. As previous experiences have shown, this regime complies with the Security Council only when it is forced and coerced to do so because it has rebelled against the international will and does not respect the laws and norms approved by international law. We also call on all the world humanitarian organizations, especially relief organizations, to act quickly to relieve the inhabitants of the marshlands in the south and declare our readiness to cooperate with these organizations so as to get food, medicine, clothes, and other relief to the afflicted citizens. On this occasion, we address our appeal to the countries and governments of the Arab and Islamic world and to all the Muslim brothers in the world to condemn the Saddam regime's savage actions against their Arab and Muslim brothers in south Iraq, show solidarity with them, and to give them succor.
