At the rally, Mr Mandela told thousands of supporters that senior state officials were perpetrating violence. The ANC leader also charged that the NP was fomenting violence. "I hope that before April 27 there will be sufficient evidence to show that there is a `third force'," said Mr Mandela. Dr Steenkamp said the ANC president's statement was an "insult to the intelligence of the public". The Goldstone Commission had conducted a thorough investigation and found no proof of the existence of a "third force". "It is common knowledge that the ANC itself is involved in by far the majority of cases of violence and intimidation throughout the country." Dr Steenkamp said if Mr Mandela was serious about intimidation he would acknowledge his own party as the "main culprit, and do something about it". Mr Mandela's hard-hitting statement also undermined his stature as a Nobel peace laureate, Dr Steenkamp concluded.
