G. Apostolopulos's medical center has been interacting closely with Russian medical personnel for a long time. He opened a first aid station in Moscow equipped with special machines for outpatient care brought in from Greece, there is a diagnostic center, and other forms of cooperation are developing. One other act of humanitarian assistance was carried out in G. Apostolopulos's Athens clinic--an extremely complex heart operation free of charge on Kseniya Lukidis, a girl from St. Petersburg whom doctors in Russia were unable to cure. ``Russia is a country with extremely rich resources, with talented people who like to work,'' said the Greek businessman. ``Having gained their freedom, your people will be able to progress and flourish very quickly. The West needs to do more than just provide humanitarian assistance: It should also cooperate with Russia, it should not fear investing capital into its economy, and it should supply new technology. All of this will ultimately be advantageous to both sides.''
