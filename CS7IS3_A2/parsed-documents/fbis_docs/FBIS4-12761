In contrast to the haste in restricting us, we are witnessing a slow down in the Palestinian-Israeli rounds of talks aimed at working out the arrangements for implementing the self-rule plan on the basis of the Oslo accord. Because there have been so many rounds, we are no longer counting them, nor do we know their exact number, or when will they end and for how long will they continue, especially after the sanctity of dates has been ignored. The Israeli side is keen on engaging in endless squabbling over the details and formalities and in Byzantine discussions, allowing this land that is thirsting for peace to be a fertile ground for tensions and explosions. Irrespective of how long the security siege continues, it will not achieve security, safety, and stability for anyone in this region, which in fact needs a peaceful siege before which the shackles of sieges and military closures break down. The Palestinian people, who are being subjected to the most powerful pressures and to warfare in obtaining their livelihood, have not lost their faith in the inevitable victory of a just peace; the realization of their legitimate rights; liberation from dependency in the political and economic spheres; and the formulation of a sound basis for an infrastructure over their land. These people are determined to cling to and persevere on this land regardless of the storms raging now and then. The important thing is that we must not allow frustration to penetrate into our ranks, and we should always remember that the darkest nights are followed by the light of dawn. Finally, if we really want to safeguard our expected independence, we must build an integral economy and launch investment projects that ensure the absorption of our laborers; secure for them a decent life; spare them the need of working inside the Green Line; and keep them on our green land.
