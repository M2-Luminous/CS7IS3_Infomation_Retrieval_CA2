Srebrenica, which was declared a protected zone by Security Council Resolutions 824 and 836, had been quiet for some time. However, the Serbian aggressor has recently started attacking the town again and is brutally violating the obligations contained in these resolutions. Exploiting the changeover of two contingents of peace forces, Karadzic's Serbs occupied the villages of Tjeskovici, Ursici, Jasenovo, and Podravanje on 2, 3, and 4 March. These villages are inside the protected zone. On the night of 4-5 March, they attacked the camp settlement in Slapovici. The settlement is being built with the donations of the Swedish and Norwegian Governments. In doing so, they killed and captured a fairly large number of civilians. Approximately 1,000 people who moved in in the finished part of the settlement were forced to flee toward the town. It transpires from the aforementioned facts that the Serbian aggressor is continuing to ignore all the decisions of the international community. On the other hand, UNPROFOR [United Nations Protected Forces] is unable to effectively protect the civilian population in the demilitarized zone of Srebrenica. Esteemed sir, we beg you that the Security Council take appropriate measures so that the units of Karadzic's Serbs withdraw to the previous lines of the protected Srebrenica zone and ensure firmer control of the situation on the ground so that the refugees could at least be guaranteed elementary safety in their settlements.
