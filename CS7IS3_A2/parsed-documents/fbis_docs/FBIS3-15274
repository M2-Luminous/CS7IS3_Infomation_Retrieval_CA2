The amnestied themselves also expressed their views concerning the State Duma decision. Interfax's correspondent Vyacheslav Terekhov interviewed the last USSR President, Mikhail Gorbachev, in this connection. Corr.: What is your attitude to the State Duma decision on dropping legal proceedings against those who plotted the August 1991 coup, those responsible for last May's bloodshed, and the leaders of last October's disturbances in Moscow? Mikhail Gorbachev: In my view, it was not too easy for the State Duma to take such a decision. Nevertheless it's noteworthy that three-fourths of the deputies in the lower house of Russia's parliament voted for it. As a matter of fact, each of the Duma members realized that the voting will not be secret, and that the stand taken by each of them will become known to the public -- the names of all of them will be mentioned. Seeking to be unbiased, I cannot disregard this fact. Nevertheless, my attitude to this problem is ambivalent. In the first place, the amnesty concerned a group of people involved in the events connected with the attempted coup of 1991 -- people whose actions led to breaking up the country. As for the events of last September and October, when Russia's Supreme Council was abolished, Moscow was virtually bathed in blood. These two issues should be clearly distinguished. As for my own attitude, I have always stood for carrying the trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup through, and with maximal openness. Otherwise the country will learn no lesson from that sad experience. Corr.: Pointing to the need to observe openness in the coverage of the trial, you evidently wish to be absolved from the charges that you were aware of the plotters' plans, and shared their intention to impose a state of emergency in the USSR, as some of the plotters claim? M.G.: Indeed, during the trial some initiators of the coup came out with such charges against me at the advice of their lawyers. I have repeatedly refuted them, in interviews with journalists also. Another issue I would like to draw attention to concerns the conduct of Ivan Rybkin (Interfax's note: the chairman of Russia's State Duma). I am not acquainted with him, I have never met him. However my impression is that he is a tactfull and reserved man, who can control his own emotions. I would not say that he is prone to extremism. I saw Rybkin act rather sharply for the first time precisely when he was upholding the need to grant political amnesty to those who had taken part in the 1991 and 1993 events, which was supported by a majority of Duma members. Some considerations prompted me to conclude that the resoluteness of his actions could be explained by the circumstance that the speaker of the lower house of parliament had settled this issue with Russia's president... Corr.: But a majority of political analysts do not share this viewpoint. M.G.: I expressed my own opinion. I believe that the resolution on political amnesty Rybkin was "pushing through" the Duma was too serious not to have been discussed with the Russian president preliminarily. The circumstance that Boris Yeltsin paid no attention to this topic and seemed to distance himself from it when the amnestied were released, while the presidential team reacted to the amnesty as if it were a kind of coup d'etat, must delude no one. Please believe me, that I cannot get rid of the thought that all these steps had been agreed with the president, since the commission for investigating the October 3-4 events set up under the Duma, and the very trial of those who plotted the 1991 coup, are questions too serious to be resolved without discussing them with the head of state. I would like to draw attention to the fact that this involves an amnesty, not full pardon. In other words, in legal terms these issues have not been finally settled. No one has cancelled the criminal cases instituted against some defendants and the verdicts pronounced against other participants in the events of August 1991, last May and last September-October. That is amnesty does not signify rehabilitation. Corr.: But the main thing is that the legal proceedings are stopped, isn't it? M.G.: No one calls this fact in question. What really matters is this -- lawyers believe that not only those who have already been convicted can be granted amnesty. I am a jurist myself, and that is why I believe that this amnesty, which is a constitutional prerogative of the State Duma, spreads to those who are already serving their sentences, to those whose cases are being considered by courts of law, and to those who are under investigation. The amnesty "closes" all these cases. Therefore the jurists -- they even include professors -- who maintain that the State Duma resolution is unlawful are not right. In my opinion, from the legal point of view it's hard to describe the resolution issued by the lower house of parliament as faulty. However the main problem does not lie in this, but in the motives for announcing this amnesty. If its goal was to promote national reconciliation, it can only be welcomed. Russia is on the brink of an abyss now -- disintegration is threatening it. Time has come to put all quarrels aside and save the state and the people from discord and strife. This is how the consequences of the civil war in Spain were liquidated under Franco. In August of 1991 irreparable damage was done to the country -- I mean the Soviet Union. The coup affected myself directly. But I place the interests of Russia and Russians above my own, provided that the amnesty will really help to preserve the country's integrity. But the amnesty will bring only a disaster, if representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party or communists begin to declare that the amnesty is their victory over the democrats, if Russian Choice starts to urge people to take to the streets and call for dissolving the Duma. However I am an optimist by nature, and I hope that political accord in the country will be gained; at least I wish very much that this would happen. Russia can be saved from disaster only on this condition. But if the conflicting sides begin once again to look for winners and losers and revert to mutual threats, then the chairman of the State Duma's defence committee, Sergey Yushenkov, who said that to adopt that amnesty was a step toward a civil war, will prove to be right. Corr.: Don't you think that there is a third way to cope with the situation -- to hush it up and pretend that nothing important has happened? M.G.: In my view, such manner of behavior would create conditions for continuing to topple presidents, dissolve legislatures and shoot parliaments with impunity. This should be openly explained to the people, since a precedent for disbanding a constitutional organ with impunity must not be created -- this would be very bad for the country and for the Russian people. However I hope that history will put everything in its proper place.
