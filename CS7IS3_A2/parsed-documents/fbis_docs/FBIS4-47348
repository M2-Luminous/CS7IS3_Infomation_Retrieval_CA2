Klyuchnikov, Moscow Energy Institute; UDC 658.511.2.004.18] [Abstract] In all stages of production and conversioN of primary sources of energy, transport, and final use of the energy potential of primary energy sources there are considerable energy losses. It is crucial to determine the actual losses and quality of use of primary fuels. This paper presents an estimate of energy loss in the complete cycle of using the energy potential of primary fuel in material production. Examples of the quality of use of fuel-energy resources in various thermal technological systems in energy-intensive areas of industry are examined. A particular example presented is cast metallurgy. Schematics are presented to organize the consideration of energy conservation measures so that no options are overlooked. The principal possibilities for large-scale reduction of fuel-energy use are established based on intensive energy conservation measures. Figures 7.
