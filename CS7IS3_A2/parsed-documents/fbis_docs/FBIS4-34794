The outcome of the congress was logical and foreseeable, given the intense preparatory activity carried out by Commander Daniel Ortega and his sympathizers, who took advantage of their strategic positions in the party apparatus. But does this mean that the front is irredeemably doomed to division and failure in the civic battles that lie ahead? We sincerely believe it is not. Everything will depend on how and in what manner pending issues are dealt with, on how the Sandinist comrades led by Dr. Sergio Ramirez Mercado are treated, and on how they react. In spite of everything, we believe that the seeds for unity in diversity were planted, and the only reason more was not accomplished was the lack of time and space. If Daniel's deeds match his words, he will find a way to stanch possible wounds and to prevent the cracks that threaten to widen from irreversibly destroying the unity that is so badly needed. It is not a question of approaching the problem of unity from romantic positions, but of standing firmly on the principles that demand viable unity as a sine qua non for solving the myriad problems that are assailing most Nicaraguans. We are alarmed by Comrade Monica Baltodano's statement threatening to oust Sergio Ramirez as head of the Sandinist delegation at the National Assembly, rather than appealing to him to try to coordinate the effort. The same is true of BARRICADA Editor Carlos Fernando Chamorro. If the threat of removal materializes, it will be a demonstration of ayatollah-like intolerance that will have an adverse impact on our people's mentality, and as a consequence, it will be another nail in the coffin of the Sandinist Front's aspirations to return to power. That is why we said yesterday that we must put an end to vengeance, that virulent disease that has plagued us Nicaraguans and prevented us from reaching a consensus to save our country. It is necessary and positive for all the factions in the Front, be they large or small, majority or minority, to avoid exaggerating their differences. Each person should do his part to contribute to the spirit of brotherhood that should prevail in a revolutionary organization. The congress adopted positive resolutions that at least challenged the old rhetoric. Sandinists should take heed and continue working on this unfinished task.
