The statement branded them as reckless acts to put the youth and students and other people of South Korea on the altar of war and plunge the whole nation into a nuclear scourge. The statement said: Despite strong protest and denunciation from people at home and abroad, the South Korean authorities are introducing Patriot missiles from the United States and [are] going to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercises with their U.S. master and inciting a dangerous war fever after issuing a "special alert order" to the puppet Army. Frequent sparks kindle a flame. The bellicose elements of South Korea must refrain from a rash act, clearly knowing that confrontation and war will precipitate their own destruction. We have the might of singlehearted unity with which to smash any aggressor forces at one blow. The entire youth and students in the Northern half of the country will never tolerate the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's confrontation row and war provocation moves. The Korean people are fully prepared to answer a war with a war.
