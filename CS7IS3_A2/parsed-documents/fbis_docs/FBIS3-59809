To make the sons of pigs taste the bitterness of losing a dear one, to make them swim in their own blood." Such were the words of a spokesman for the Fatah Hawks, an armed gang in Gaza belonging to Yasir 'Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO, as reported in the LOS ANGELES TIMES on November 30. The reference, of course, was to the Jews. With the 13 Septembe signing of the Israel-PLO agreement, one would have expected the Palestinians to at least moderate the tone of their utterances. A look at the organization's rhetoric since the handshake on the White House lawn, however, reveals that it continues to wage a war of words against Israel. The commander of PLO forces in Lebanon, Lieutenant Colonel. Munir Miqdah, told a Reuters correspondent on 8 October, just three weeks after the White House ceremony, "We will not lay down our weapons until complete liberation...sooner or later we will throw the Zionists into the sea." The Voice of Palestine, broadcasting from Algiers on October 24, six weeks after the handshake, reported: "Yasir 'Arafat stressed the continuation of the struggle until the Palestinian flag is hoisted over Jerusalem's walls." Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these statements is that PLO spokesmen make no effort to hide their intentions regarding the future. They continue to speak openly of implementing the "phased plan" adopted by the Palestine National Council in 1975 and calls for the elimination of Israel in stages. Indeed, Yasir 'Arafat himself, on 1 September, referred to the phased plan on Radio Monte Carlo when he said that the agreement with Israel, "will be a basis for an independent Palestinian state in accordance with the Palestine National Council resolution issued in 1974." He subsequently referred to the phased plan on several other occasions as well. Faysal al-Husayni, the senior PLO figure in Israel, has also emphasized the phased plan repeatedly. Al-Husayni told the BEIRUT TIMES on 16 September that, "Gradually, stage by stage, we will reach an independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital." The frequency and forcefulness of these statements lead one to conclude that the Palestinians have not put aside their dreams of destroying Israel. In fact, they clearly indicate that the agreement with Israel represents a change in the PLO's tactics, but not its goals. Al-Husayni himself admitted this in a speech to Bi'r Zayt University on November 22, when he said, "Everything you see and hear today is for tactical and strategic reasons. We have not given up the rifle" (reported in MA'ARIV, 24 November). Moreover, the PLO continues to resort to blatant antisemitism in its pronouncements. A leaflet distributed in Gaza by the Fatah Hawks in November asserted, "We will continue our rebellion against the governmnet of the dogs. We will escalate our military attacks everywhere against the Zionists" (AP, 29 November). In the lexicon of the PLO, Jews are "dogs and "sons of pigs." These can hardly be described as words of peace. PLO spokesmen insist that the intifadah will continue. A statement issued just two weeks ago by 'Arafat's Fatah faction in Sidon said, "The revolution of stones is the only real face of our struggle to put an end to the Zionist presence. The intifadah is the Palestinian people's choice" (AFP, 18 November). On 13 September, just hours after shaking Yitzhaq Rabin's hand, 'Arafat gave a speech on Jordanian television in which he said, "Palestine is only a stone's throw away for a small Palestinian boy or girl." Nothing has changed in the PLO's rhetoric--praise for the intifadah, virulent antisemitism, talk of throwing the Zionists into the sea. The political leadership in Israel is making a grave mistake if it continues to ignore the PLO's pronouncement on these matters. True, actions speak louder than words. But these words are loud and clear enough.
