Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, at a working luncheon with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Gallucci, stressed that the immediate task is getting Pyongyang to agree to further checks by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The two sides agreed that the ball is in Pyongyang's court, predicting that a reaction will come soon since the celebrations for supreme leader Kim Il-song's 82nd birthday have just ended. IAEA Director-General Hans Blix is due to report to the U.N. Security Council on North Korea's nuclear program in early May, and officials here say that unlike previous monitoring activities, this deadline doesn't allow for much leeway. "A couple of weeks is the most we can give North Korea next month," said one official on condition of anonymity. "Either Pyongyang accepts the IAEA team by then or faces U.N. action." "There isn't much time," he emphasized. Han and Gallucci stressed the importance of inter-Korean dialogue in defusing the nuclear crisis and promised to work together for successful talks between the two Koreas, the officials said.
