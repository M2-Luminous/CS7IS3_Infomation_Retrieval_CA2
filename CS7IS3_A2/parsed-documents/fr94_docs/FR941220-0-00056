FR941220-0-00056 FR941220-0-00010 C. Disease or predation. Predation upon the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter undoubtedly occurs. However, there is no evidence to suggest that predation threatens these species, except possibly in altered stream reaches immediately below dams. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. The Official Code of Georgia Annotated 27&hyph;2&hyph;12 prohibits the taking of these fish without a state collecting permit. Federal listing provides protection under Section 9 of the Act by requiring Federal permits for taking the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter. Additional protection is gained under Section 7 of the Act by requiring Federal agencies to consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize, or conduct may affect these species. E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence. The range of the Cherokee darter has been fragmented, and a significant portion of the middle Etowah River system has been permanently altered by Allatoona Reservoir. The streams inhabited by the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter exhibit, on average, moderate to heavy degradation from poor land use practices and small impoundments. These strong negative forces have caused local extirpation of both Cherokee darter and Etowah darter populations and have induced range fragmentation and subsequent isolation of the Cherokee darter into small populations. Genetic diversity has subsequently been lost due to these population losses. The genetic diversity of all populations may be needed to provide the species enough genetic variability to adapt to environmental change and thus assure long-term viability. The restricted distribution of both the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter also makes populations vulnerable to extirpation from catastrophic events, such as an accidental toxic chemical spill. Range fragmentation and loss of genetic diversity, independently and in concert, clearly threaten the continued existence of these species. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by both darters in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Cherokee darter and Etowah darter as threatened and endangered species, respectively. The Cherokee darter is now known from approximately 20 tributary systems of the Etowah River, but healthy populations are known from just a few sites. The Etowah darter is known from only the upper Etowah River mainstem and two tributary systems. Both species are restricted to the Etowah River system in north Georgia. These fish and their benthic habitat have been, and continue to be, impacted by range reduction, isolation by impoundment, and general habitat destruction. Despite its wider distribution and greater number of known populations, the Cherokee darter appears to have more of its habitat threatened by these factors, which have already resulted in a higher level of population fragmentation and isolation relative to the Etowah darter. The restricted distribution of these two species also makes localized populations susceptible to catastrophic events. Because of these factors, endangered appears the most appropriate status for the Etowah darter and threatened appears most appropriate for the Cherokee darter. Critical Habitat
