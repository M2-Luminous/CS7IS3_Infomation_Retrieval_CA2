The general economic outlook to change for the better has not appeared. Hsueh Chi, Deputy Director of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, not long ago described the current economic situation as "strange." He pointed out the following four particular situations in the economic sphere at present. (1) The global economy is gradually recovering, but our exports show no momentum. Our exports during the first quarter this year only registered a growth rate of 0.4 percent over the same period last year. Taiwan found itself trailing others among Asia's four little dragons. This was quite unusual. (2) The export orders during the last quarter of 1993 posted an annual growth rate of 4.9 percent. It can often be used to predict the figure for the first quarter of this year. Although it was not high, it should be much better than the 0.4 percent rate of growth for the first quarter of 1994. (3) The exports during the first quarter this year were at the lowest level since the third quarter of 1990, but the industrial production index rose 5.9 percent, which is the highest since 1992. If there are weaker demands abroad, how can our industrial production maintain a higher rate of growth? (4) Our textile industry received 20 percent more export orders in March this year. If our textile mills, a large number of which had already moved out, can still receive more export orders, why are other industries less competitive? If we carefully analyze the data regarding the four particular situations pointed out by Hsueh Chi, we will understand the reasons. Let us take item two as an example. The growth rate of export orders is greater than that of actual exports. That was not something which only began from the first quarter of this year. It happened two years ago. This is apparently the result of orders being sent to Taiwan, while goods were shipped out from the mainland. The third item is that Taiwan is still able to maintain a high rate of growth in industrial production, while there are less demands abroad. If we divide the manufacturing industry into two major categories -- the heavy industry and the light industry, our labor-intensive export industry belongs to light industry. The growth rate of light industry during the first quarter this year is merely 0.7 percent. Apparently this is the result of sluggish exports. However, the heavy industry registered a growth rate of 8.8 percent, which were mainly composed of products made of basic metal and nonmetallic mineral as well as petrochemical products mainly for the domestic market. Products of the first two categories are mainly related to major engineering and housing projects. That means the percentage of manufactured products for domestic consumption increased. As for the fourth item, we must first understand how our textile industry is relocating its assembly lines out of Taiwan before we study the issue of why this industry of ours may register a high rate of growth in export orders. Most of the assembly lines of the labor-intensive dress and clothing industry have moved out, but only a limited number of cotton yarn manufacturing mills which need a great deal of capital are still in Taiwan. Most of them have improved their production quality and become automated. The relocation of the downstream processing industry has brought about the sustained growth in the export of cotton yarn. For example, the export of garments reached a peak of $4.4 billion in 1987, but dropped to $2.8 billion in 1993, suffering a decline of $1.6 billion. However, the export of cotton yarn rose from $2.8 billion in 1987 to $7.4 billion in 1993, marking an increase of $2.8 billion and far exceeding the decline in the garment export industry. The export of cotton yarn during the first quarter this year was 16.3 percent higher than that of the same period last year. Therefore, the large increase in export orders for textile products is truly connected with the relocation of cotton mills. However, there is no doubt that the relocation of the downstream mills has caused the increase in exports for the upstream cotton yarn. The issue concerning item one that the global economy is gradually recovering, but the fact that our exports show no momentum merits attention. In our 25 March editorial, entitled: "Seize the Opportunity of U.S. Economic Recovery To Create Better Achievements," we had issued a warning and reminded our businessmen in the textile industry of our need to increase the exports of some of our products which are still quite competitive in the U.S. market just like what we did about 10 years ago when the United States was recovering from its economic recession. We had also analyzed the effects in relocating our labor-intensive industries in the past six to seven years. Such relocation has made the export of labor-intensive products such as garment and shoes decline on a large scale. However, our total volume of exports still registered an satisfactory growth despite the world economic slowdown. We discovered that there are two reasons for this. On the one hand, the trade effects caused by our investments abroad have driven up the exports of our production facilities, raw material and semi-finished products and parts from Taiwan, while on the other hand, businessmen in Taiwan have adjusted themselves well by investing more in the manufacture of technology-intensive products. Thus, in the past six years with the exception of 1990, double-digit growth was reported in the export of technology-intensive electronic components, computers, communication equipment, machinery, electric motors and means of transportation. Such growth not only makes up the decline in the export of labor-intensive products, but also helps maintain the appropriate growth in the total value of exports. In addition, it also helps rapidly readjust the industrial structure. However, during the first quarter in 1994 when the exports of labor-intensive products continuously dropped, the rate of growth in the export of technology-intensive products dropped to 4 percent from its usual double-digit growth in the past six years. It only makes up the decline in the export of labor-intensive products, but fails to maintain the growth in the total value of exports. Why is that? We can study this issue from two different angles: 1. From the point of view of the supply, is it possible that lack of investments in the manufacturing industry has made the technology-intensive products less competitive in the export market and thus greatly lowered the growth rate? 2. If we analyze this issue from the point of view of demand, we find that in making investments abroad, particularly in the mainland, Taiwan has shifted from labor-intensive to capital- and technology-intensive manufacturing. When the factories are completed one after another, they would be able to produce some production facilities, parts and components and some types of raw materials themselves without having to import them from Taiwan. Would that cause an import-substitution effect? If we cannot tackle this issue and make improvements in a timely manner, it would have an extremely adverse impact on Taiwan's current and future economic situation. If we fail to seize this favorable opportunity at a time when the world's economy is recovering, it is possible that Taiwan's ranking in exports will drop from the 12th to the 13th behind Korea or even to the 14th behind Singapore to find itself at the tail of Asia's four little dragons. Moreover, if Taiwan fails to maintain an adequate growth in exports, its trade may go from a surplus to a deficit under the pressure of the GATT entry. All this would shake our nation's strong position in handling economic affairs and trading in the world. This issue merits the attention of our highest authorities. They need to take immediate action to rectify this situation.
