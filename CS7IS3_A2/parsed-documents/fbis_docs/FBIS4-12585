[Peres] I do not accept his view. There is an agreement that must be implemented. This is what we will do. Anyone attempting to achieve permanent peace today might only create a permanent dispute by bringing up unresolvable issues. [Makhlev] Sir, PLO circles are demanding immediate negotiations over the permanent status in the territories instead of holding talks on autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho. [Peres] I do not know what you mean by circles. We are conducting negotiations with the PLO leadership and with Mr. 'Arafat. We are holding talks with him and have not heard any such demands at the negotiating table. [Makhlev] Do you plan to meet Mr. 'Arafat after Independence Day in order to clarify these issues? [Peres] If necessary, I will meet with him, but nothing has been scheduled yet. [Makhlev] Meretz is demanding to limit the closure and to be generous in issuing work permits. What is your reaction to this? [Peres] My response is that the place to discuss this issue is within the framework of the cabinet. [Makhlev] Environment Minister Yosi Sarid, some of your colleagues in Meretz are requesting to ease the closure and to be more generous in issuing work permits to laborers from the territories. [Sarid] First of all, I would like to say that I support the closure; however, I do not think that the government should tie its hands now by making definitive decisions on the duration of the closure. We know that closures have their limitations which we have to take into account. There are humanitarian needs of the first degree, and there is no need to make far-reaching decisions only to later backtrack from them. Therefore, the government should tomorrow evaluate the closure, which I support, and examine its duration and limitations.
