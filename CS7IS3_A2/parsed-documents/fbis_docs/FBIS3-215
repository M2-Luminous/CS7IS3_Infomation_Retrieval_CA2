Braid] [Text] Cape Town March 2 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk on Wednesday [2 March] advised Freedom Alliance parties to register for the election to ensure their voice was heard and so that they could participate in negotiations. "My advice is for them to register and participate. They will not be giving anything away but will ensure their voice being heard; that they will be represented; and will fully become part of the continuing negotiation process," he said at Tuynhuys after meeting Portuguese Foreign Minister Dr Jose Barroso. "Participation does not prevent anyone from continuing with negotiations." He said that after his talks on Tuesday evening with Freedom Alliance leader Gen Constand Viljoen, the ball was now in the Alliance's court. "We would like some specific proposals and then negotiations can continue. These can be concluded before the elections for implementation after the elections. I believe such an agreement would be better for all concerned. "Reneging after the election will be visible for everyone to see, will leave more than a bad tase and would have international focus." A signed agreement could contribute to defusing tensions. Mr de Klerk would not comment on his discussions with Gen Viljoen except to say he had the impression there was a move for the election date to be shifted. He had stressed the process had reached the stage when it had to continue on its course. He did not foresee Parliament being recalled again soon because "the strength of the amended constitution which we passed for federalism is such that there is no reason for them (the Alliance) not to participate."
