It has discovered 1,399 illegal mobile telephones users in 13 categories. In the past, some supply and marketing units have imported a large number of mobile telephones of various styles in spite of state regulations. Such telephone systems caused serious interference to radio and television broadcasting and to other radio facilities, about which the society lodged a strong complaint. Since the beginning of 1993, six units, including the provincial radio management committee and the provincial post and telecommunications bureau, jointly with localities throughout the province, started their work of ferreting out and handling the illegal mobile telephones. Various cities have basically been kept informed of the sale and usage of mobile telephones in their own localities by adopting various measures. Benxi city has cleared up and consolidated the sale markets and had six stores sealed up because they had seriously violated the regulations and refused to mend their ways despite repeated admonition. Dalian city confiscated mobile telephones from 78 illegal users. The cities of Shenyang, Anshan, Tieling, and others have also adopted active measures to check the illegal mobile telephones. Through the large-scale activities of check, the province's radio environment has been purified and the interference encountered by the radio and television broadcasting stations and other radio facilities has achieved an obvious turn for the better.
