The former chief minister, Mr S. Bangarappa, today said his new regional party, the Karnataka Congress, proposed to contest all the assembly seats in the elections. He however, added that the issue of having seat adjustments with political parties such as the Janata Dal was still open. Addressing a news conference here to announce the formal launching of his party, Mr Bangarappa said a decision on the party aligning with other political parties would be taken by the parliamentary board of the party, adding that he could not make any announcement suo motu. "As of today the Karnataka Congress plans to field candidates in all the assembly questions. However, I will keep the matter of seat adjustment open," he added. Mr Bangarappa maintained that his party was the real Congress as the Congress under the present leadership of the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, had failed to uphold the principles and ideologies laid down by the founding fathers of the party. Mr Bangarappa said the response from the people to his new regional party was overwhelming. This was one of the reasons for him to advance his earlier programme of launching his party in April in Davangere at a public meeting apart from the fact that there was a possibility of the zilla and taluk panchayat elections being announced any moment. Mr Bangarappa admitted that many regional and national parties launched in the past were a failure. However the latest trend was of regional parties and he was optimistic of a bright future for his party. To a question whether the Samajwadi and Bahujan Samaj party combine parties success in Uttar Pradesh had prompted him to launch a regional party, Mr Bangarappa replied in the negative and said there was no need for him to go so far when regional parties such as the AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and the Telugu Desam had clicked in the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. On the decision to field candidates in all the assembly constituencies and whether the purpose was to defeat the Congress or ensure the victory of the new party's candidates, Mr Bangarappa quipped: "Suppose the same members had continued in the Congress headed by Mr Rao, do you think they would have won? It is not a question of victory or defeat for the Karnataka Congress but a matter of principles." Mr Bangarappa, however, made it clear that tickets would not be given to those who would want to contest from his party after they are denied a ticket from the Congress. Mr Bangarappa said he would be launching his campaign by touring the districts from January 10. This would also help him to gauge the situation regarding his party position vis-vis the other parties. Mr Bangarappa said he would be the president of the party till a president was elected in a democratic manner. Ad hoc executive and parliamentary committees would be formed shortly, he added. He said since his party was based on the principles and programmes of the traditional Congress. It would have the Congress flag and `get the symbol allotted by the election commission.' Mr Bangarappa, also demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, on the alleged involvement of his family members in the multi-crore securities scam. He said the Prime Minister had said that follow-up action on the report of the Joint Parliamentary committee which went into the securities scam would be taken up within three months. Since the names of the family members of the Prime Minister figured in the report, Mr Rao had no right to order any follow-up action, he added.
