This information was released at a symposium jointly sponsored by China's State Administration of Industry and Commerce and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTD) in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, today. The three-day international symposium is aimed at exchanging views on the roles of competition policy and competition laws, how to prevent monopolies which result from over-concentration of economic sectors on the market and how to prevent abusing favorable conditions on the market. According to the symposium, since China enforced its Anti-Unfair Competition Law at the end of last year, China has scored progress in the development of a unified national market. Various levels of the department of industry and commerce are taking measures to protect the legal rights and interests of producers and consumers. A high-ranking official of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce said that his administration is willing to cooperate with UNCTD and its counterparts in international communities and jointly fulfill the international obligation stipulated by "fair principle and regulations". Officials of the Administration of Industry and Commerce from all over the country and experts from Britain and Germany attended the symposium.
