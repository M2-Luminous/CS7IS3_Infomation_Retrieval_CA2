The al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah [IG], which has waged a bloody campaign against the secular government of President Husni Mubarak, said it planted the bomb which exploded outside a bank here Monday night. The bomb went off after the bank closed to avoid causing any injuries, said the statement which was sent to AFP. The group has urged tourists and foreign investors to quit the country, saying it is stepping up its violent campaign following the killing of seven of its members by the security forces last week. The militants are trying to cripple the Egyptian economy as part of their campaign to bring down the Mubarak government and install an Iranian-style Islamic republic. The group said Egyptians should withdraw all their cash from Egyptian banks within two weeks, and Monday's blast was "part of al-Jama'ah's fight against the regime." Almost 300 people have died since the fundamentalists began their campaign two years ago, and the money-spinning tourist industry has been brought to its knees.
