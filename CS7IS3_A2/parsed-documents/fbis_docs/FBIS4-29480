"Thailand will follow the United Nations resolution," Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri said. "But we hope that the situation will be resolved through negotiations." [passage omitted] Foreign Minister Prasong confirmed that Thailand's ambassador to the UN in New York, Nit Phibunsongkhram, was in consultation with counterparts from other ASEAN states on the matter. Thailand and ASEAN partners always follow the UN Security Council resolutions, a Bangkok-based Asian diplomat said. But ASEAN member states "are not for the confrontational style of Western countries," the source added. "Maybe we should give quiet diplomacy a chance. Methods of the West may not always be the best," the source said Because of China's position, the UN Security Council is likely to find it more difficult than usual to forge a resolution on North Korea, the source added.
