The group, which includes well-known commanders like Manlvi Siddiqullah, Sher Alam, Anwar Khan and Karim Qarabagh, met leaders of the Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan]-led Supreme Coordination Council of the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan at Charasyab Sunday [16 Jan] to discuss peace proposals. The group, which includes several pro-Rabbani commanders, was reportedly also in touch with Rabbani and his former defence minister, Ahmad Shah Mas'ud. The moves came amidst reports of bombing of Kabul by General Dostam's jet-fighters. Qarcebar Rahman Saeed, a Supreme Council spokesman, said Rabbani positions at Dashit-e Chamiala and in the capital were bombed. Radio Kabul, monitored in Peshawar, however, reported that Dostam's aircraft bombed civilian areas with cluster bombs. Both sides reported that there were almost no ground battles on Sunday. According to Saeed, the delegation brought a letter from Mas'ud expressing his readiness to accept the verdict of a 15-member commission comprising three representatives each of Rabbani's Jami'at-e Eslami [Islamic Society], Hezb-e Eslami (Hekmatyar), Hezb-e Eslami (Khalis), Sayyaf's Ettehad-e Eslami-e [Islamic Union of Afghanistan] and Manlvi Mohammadi's Harekat-e Enqelab-e Eslami [Islamic Revolution Movement]. Saeed said the Council made it clear to the commanders that they would not agree to a ceasefire, but were ready to discuss Rabbani's resignation. He said a four-member delegation, including one nominee each from Hezb-e Eslami, Hezb-e Wahdat [Islamic Unity Party], Mojadeddi's ANLF [National Liberation Front of Afghanistan] and Dostam's Junbush-e Melli Eslami, was being formed. Jami'at-e Eslami sources in Peshawar said they were unaware of Mas'ud's letter or proposal. Saeed added that the Supreme Council welcomed Pakistan's proposal for a regional conference, though it insisted on Rabbani's resignation as a pre-condition. Radio Kabul quoted Dr Najibollah Lafra'i as saying that Rabbani would not accept a temporary ceasefire and would not talk to Dostam's militia. He said peace talks with Hezb-e Eslami were possible provided it gave up its heavy arms, guaranteed not to fight against the government and broke its ties with Dostam. Amir Usman, Pakistan's ambassador in Afghanistan, Sunday travelled to Jalalabad to meet the Nangarhar Shura. A Shura spokesman informed The News that the delegation told the ambassador about the difficulties faced by Afghans following Pakistan's decision to seal its border with Afghanistan. Meanwhile, another 32 UN trucks carrying relief supplies left Peshawar for Jalalabad Sunday. The trucks carried tents, flour and UNICEF-donated medicines for the two new camps near Jalalabad. More than 100 Pakistani lawyers in Peshawar have signed a memorandum calling on the United Nations to provide a safe passage to former Afghan president, Dr Najibollah, from war-battered Kabul. It pointed out that Dr Najibollah had stepped down as part of a UN-brokered peace plan, but was still being held at UN premises in Kabul. The memorandum said Dr Najibollah should be freed, not only to fulfill a UN obligation but also because of security problems.
