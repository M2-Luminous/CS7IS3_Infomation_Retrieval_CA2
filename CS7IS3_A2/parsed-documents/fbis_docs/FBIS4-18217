FBIS4-18217 "drweu063_e_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 UNITED KINGDOM Comments on IRA Cease-Fire Comments on IRA Cease-Fire LD0104100194 London ITV Television Network in English 1800 GMT 31 Mar 94 LD0104100194 London ITV Television Network English BFN [Interview with Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams by Jon Snow; Adams in Belfast, Snow in London; from the "Channel Four News" program; Adams words spoken by an actor -- recorded] [Text] [Snow] What was the minimum condition required to extend next week's 72-hour [IRA] cease-fire? [Adams] Well, I don't think we should judge this in terms of the time frame involved. I think we need to see it in terms of the significance, in the potential, that it opens up. So therefore, in my view, the opportunity provided should best be utilized by the British Government dealing directly with Sinn Fein on terms, not of negotiation or even of other matters, but only in terms of clarification, and then all of the other potentials open up. The whole potential for demilitarization, because none of us are really interested in short stoppages by one known group -- I mean the Loyalists are going crazy here at the moment, the British Army is here in very large numbers. What we need to do is to get the whole process moved away beyond this stalemate, and that's the significance of this initiative, that it provides the potential to break the stalemate, to move us out of this critical phase of the peace process into a more productive phase. [Snow] What do you say to Douglas Hurd who says this is a cynical exercise, your merely saying to people we're not going to kill you now, we'll start killing you next Friday? [Adams] Well, I could say the same of Mr. Hurd. I mean Mr. Hurd's troops have been in my country for a very long time and the last time I met Mr. Hurd we discussed this matter, and unfortunately we're still stuck in the same situation. So what I want to do -- and remember the British Government wouldn't even be focused on this issue of Ireland if it wasn't for initiatives coming from Ireland itself -- so what I want to do is to utilize, to make the best of, to seize the potential to move forward, because we have to move forward sooner rather than later. [Snow] Could you distill for me, very briefly, precisely what you want clarified? [Adams] Three areas -- tactical matters and the declaration itself, conflicting interpretations of the declaration, and the processes envisaged in it; the three areas need clarification. [Snow] How long would that clarification take? [Adams] As long as it requires me or my colleagues to put to someone authorized by Mr. Major those questions, and for them to provide us with the answers. [Adams] John Hume has said it could take an hour? [Adams] Well, it may take even less than an hour, it might take more, but the point is that the clarifications are required and we wouldn't seek to protract. We don't want to see some public climb-down, or by the British Government. One of the ironies, one of the paradoxes of this situation is that all of this comes at a time when the British prime minister is in a weakened position, and you know, if I could turn an old, almost cliche on it's head, in this case it may be that Ireland's disadvantage could be England's or John Major's opportunity. So we seek simply to get this clarification issue behind us and to move into a new phase. [Snow] Do the mechanics exist for the British Government, the Irish Government, to talk to you discreetly? [Adams] Well, the Dublin Government has seen fit to quite rightly provide us with clarification, and that has been satisfactory, and I think they should be commended, and if the London government had the same position on 15 December we would now be far beyond the current critical stage. So the mechanisms certainly do exist.
