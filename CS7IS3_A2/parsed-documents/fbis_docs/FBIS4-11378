The foreign minister said the connection between labor standards and trade is a "spurious" matter, in response to Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo, who a few months ago accused Brazil of taking advantage of the low salaries paid here to increase its exports and trade surplus with Argentina. "We cannot allow other countries to impose restrictions on our exports," Amorim said as he attended the fourth ministerial meeting of the Rio Group and EU with the presence of 25 Latin American and European foreign ministers. In defense, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella denied that his government intends to put a levy on Brazilian products, but he said the wage difference between the two countries must be reduced. "The Brazilian economy is undergoing a transformation we consider excellent," he said. The Argentine proposal is similar to that presented by the United States and France in the last meeting of the GATT Uruguay Round: to link the increase of international trade with the exporting countries' labor and environmental conditions. During the meeting, the rest of the countries managed to avoid mentioning this specific proposal. "Since the developed countries are living in a recession, there is a proclivity to include clauses that would imply transferring the burden of unemployment to the developing countries," Celso Amorim complained.
