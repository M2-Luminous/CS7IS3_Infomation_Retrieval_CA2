Suarez] [Text] President Ramos launched yesterday a $1.2-billion (about P [Philippine pesos] 33 billion) thermal power plant in his home province of Pangasinan capable of supplying 1,320 megawatts to the Luzon grid. Reported to be the largest base load power station in the country, the president said that this power plant will help solve the power problem permanently and accelerate economic development. The Chief Executive congratulated the Hopewell Group, headed by chairman Gordon Wu, for undertaking the $1.2-billion Sual project, the biggest under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme. The construction of the project is being undertaken by Consolidated Electric Power Asia, a subsidiary of the Hopewell Group which also undertook the Navotas 1 and 2 Gas Turbine Power Station projects and the 775 megawatt Pagbilao Coal-Fired Power Station project. The president called on his provincemates to unite and help protect the environment, pointing out that the thermal plant to be constructed will have a mechanism for environmental protection. But aside from electric power, Mr. Ramos stressed that people power is another factor in the economic development of Pangasinan. "Let us help each other because this power plant, when it is finished, will not automatically give people power by way of jobs and supplemental income and national domestic wealth," he said. "We must have to work for that." At a breakfast program at the session hall of the Capitol Building in Pangasinan, the president, assisted by Environmental and Natural Resources Secretary Angel Alcala, distributed checks totaling P5,053,185 to representatives of families affected by the collapse of the tailings dam of Philex Mining in Benguet.
