"It's true that social tensions are high and that there are similarities with the situation five years ago, but don't expect a popular uprising in the near future," said Wang Dan, who became one of the student leaders of the 1989 movement. The first demonstrations in 1989 began not in June, but on April 15 on the death of former communist party general secretary Hu Yaobang. Thousands marched to Tiananmen Square to mourn the man who had been sacked two years before for his reformist views, and the movement swelled until being bloodily crushed on June 4 in the Tiananmen Square massacre. Wang's opinion is shared by most other dissidents, many of whom emerged from the shadows at the end of last year when they began forming groups again and publicly demanding more democracy in China. China's economic and political stability are threatened on several fronts: Raging inflation, rampant corruption, rising unemployment, increasing rural poverty in certain areas, and the government's loss of economic control. "The older problems were never resolved, and now new ones have emerged," says Ding Zilin, a Beijing University philosophy professor and a signatory of one of several letters addressed to the government recently demanding more democracy. "If the peasants and workers rise up together, general chaos would be the result. We are worried and that is why we wrote to the authorities," said Ding, who lost a son in the Tiananmen Square massacre. This year's repeated calls by the government for "public order" as well as the repeated arrests of dissidents betrays a genuine worry on its part. The declining health of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, nearly 90, leaves open all sorts of questions about the political future of the world's last big communist country. Knowing that corruption was one of the sparks that set off the 1989 movement, the authorities devoted much publicity to Monday's death sentence imposed on a businessman, as well as a 20-year sentence handed down to a vice-minister, both of whom had been involved in a huge financial scandal. Intellectuals here are also aware of the risks they may run of mounting sustained protests. "Today, many Chinese and especially the students are afraid of instability, because they want to take part in and benefit from the market economy, which was not the case five years ago," said Yang Zhou, a veteran dissident and spokesman for the Shanghai-based Chinese Association of Human Rights. "The mindset has changed in recent years, because people now are looking out first and foremost for their own interest," added Wang Dan. The shift in Chinese attitudes has moved dissidents to reconsider matters. Without abandoning their democratic ideals, they are trying to redirect their campaign to deal with problems faced in the day-to-day lives of most Chinese such as tenants' rights and job layoffs. "We absolutely must be closer to the people," says Bao Ge, a human rights campaigner in Shanghai who wants to form a new organization dedicated to solving concrete social problems. "One of the things the leadership fears is that dissidents manage to integrate themselves into society," said a European diplomat in Beijing. "And that is why the campaign of repression has not let up."
