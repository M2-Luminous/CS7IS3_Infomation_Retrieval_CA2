It passed its first reading over a year ago. But in its second reading it did not garner the required number of votes. Recently another attempt was made to legalize alternative service. But the deputies heeded the opinion of republic Defense Minister Colonel General Pavel Kozlovskiy, who stated that the time for this law has "still not come." The Armed Forces, he said, are experiencing a severe shortage of draftees and, if alternative service is now allowed, the situation as regards bringing the Army up to strength with soldiers and sergeants will become extremely complicated.
