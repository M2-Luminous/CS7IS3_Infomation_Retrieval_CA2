Swart] [Text] Johannesburg April 19 SAPA -- African National Congress PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] leader Tokyo Sexwale on Tuesday [19 April] strongly criticised the National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] commander in Thokoza, Col Quinton Painter. Addressing journalists at the NPKF's Thokoza base camp, after a day of raging gun battles between hostel dwellers and residents in the East Rand township, Mr Sexwale said Col Painter was restraining the unit from effectively keeping the peace. "He is restricting them to patrols and when they are shot at they are not allowed to return fire." Officers and troops were frustrated, he said. They disarmed many township residents and wished to do the same in the hostels but were prevented from doing so by their commanding officer, who was operating under the direction of someone above him in the NPKF. NPKF spokesman Col Connie van Rensburg said he would respond to Mr Sexwale's allegations when he had gained more information about the matter. Both the SADF [South African Defense Force] and the NPKF were deployed on Tuesday in an attempt to quell the latest violence on the East Rand. "We came here to look at the situation, to talk to the people and to find out from the NPKF what the essence of the problem was. We learned from their officers they are operating under extreme difficulties which makes it very difficult for them to execute their tasks," said Mr Sexwale. The force had not been deployed in the same numbers as its SADF counterpart, he said. The army had operated in Thokoza with 2,500 men, while the NPKF had only 1,000 in the area. Two battalions at De Brug, the NPKF base in Bloemfontein, were supposed to be in Thokoza. Mr Sexwale said the peacekeeping force's equipment was of an inferior standard and it had fewer vehicles. The SADF had pulled out of Thokoza without providing the NPKF with information about flashpoints and areas that needed patrolling. "They have had to learn as they go along," said Mr Sexwale. The controversial SA Police Internal Stability Unit had been redeployed in Thokoza without the NPKF being informed and "a very volatile atmosphere exists between the various security forces". Mr Sexwale said a structure had been established for contact between the NPKF and the community to build up confidence in the force. Asked whether the Inkatha Freedom Party's [IFP] late entry into the election race would help defuse the tension in Thokoza, Mr Sexwale said: "We want the elections to take place on the East Rand and we are very happy (IFP leader) Mr (Mangosuthu) Buthelezi capitulated from his stubborn position of not letting people vote. But he has left a terrible legacy of hate between residents and hostel dwellers." The ANC would be working closely with the IFP to pacify the situation so that "our members and their members can vote". He urged Thokoza residents to support the NPKF as its job was to ensure the election took place.
