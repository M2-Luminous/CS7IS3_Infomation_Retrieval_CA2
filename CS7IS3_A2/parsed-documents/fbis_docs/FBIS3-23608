As a result of the disintegration of the common military area, a considerable share of the forces along with their military equipment and gear ended up beyond the borders of Russia. Today they exist in the form of groupings of forces or individual military installations throughout practically the entire territory of the former USSR. It is not difficult to imagine the consequences, for example, of the withdrawal of Russian forces from Tajikistan and of the failure of Russia to fulfill its peacemaking functions in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Karabakh, and Moldova. In such an event, the fate of millions of our compatriots and the local population living in the "hot spots" of the CIS will be threatened. Nor should one fail to take into account the essential lack of a dependable defense and protection of the former external border of the USSR. This concern, by the way, is also shared by many national leaders. In addition, the vacuum would inevitably complicate Russia's strategic military position and unavoidably would be filled by forces unfriendly to Russia. Without doubt this would also change the military-political landscape for other states. The military presence of Russia in those and other regions is essential for the purpose of protecting the economic interests of Russia. It is quite natural, considering the entire complex of problems, that Russia cannot so easily leave the zone of its traditional and direct influence at once. The risk would be too great. But it cannot remain as an uninvited guest. The minister of defense of the Russian Federation declared that by the end of this year Russian military contingents will be withdrawn from the territory of other states whatever the cost may be. But this certainly does not mean that Russia is renouncing a military presence in regions of its primary attention. From now on this problem will be resolved through civilized methods with the consent of those countries that request this; that is, it is a matter of generally recognized forms of deploying forces in foreign territory on a legal basis. One of the forms of such a presence is the establishment of Russian military bases in the territory of the countries of the CIS on the basis of mutually acceptable agreements. Overall, they may constitute elements of the general defensive area of the Commonwealth and help to preserve unified systems in the military infrastructure. An example is the protocal signed in the course of B. Yeltsin's visit to Tbilisi that provides for the establishment of military bases of the Russian Federation in Vaziani, Akhalkalaki, and Batumi. In the near future, a working group of both sides will define questions in the support of the military bases, the number of personnel, and the amount of military equipment there. Their task is to guarantee the security of Russia and the states of the Transcaucasian region included in the Collective Security Treaty. The Georgian leadership is making no secret of its interest in the presence of Russian forces in Transcaucasia. It seems that they are also inclined in this direction in Yerevan and Baku. It appears that Armenia will sign an analogous document on the establishment of a military base. There has already been preliminary consultation on this question. There has been some movement on military questions with Kazakhstan. Experts have been assigned the task of working out a treaty on military cooperation in the very near future, which will reflect problems having to do with the withdrawal of nuclear weapons to Russia. Negotitations are under way on the future of Baykonur and other facilities and test ranges located in the territory of Kazakhstan. It appears that in the deployment of Russian forces in the near abroad it is necessary above all to define their status. They must guarantee the security interests of Russia without intervening in the internal life of other states. At the same time, with the agreement of the sides, it is possible to utilize Russian forces as peacemaking forces in the settlement of conflicts. There is nothing unnatural in this either, because today only they are capable of ensuring a reduction of armed actions and putting an end to bloodshed in the "hot spots." Examples of this are the Dniester Region, South Ossetia, and Tajikistan. Because of the specific nature of our relations in the scope of the former Union and our knowledge of local problems, it is much easier for Russia to carry out peacemaking actions in these regions than for other states to do so. In addition, it is not in the interests of Russia to allow the presence of military contingents of third countries in the territory of the states of the former USSR. It is a pity that until now no UN mandate has been received, which, in addition to everything else, would reduce the burden of our material outlays for the performance of peacemaking operations. The military presence of Russia in the near abroad will require substantial subsidies from the state treasury for the support of military and civilian personnel, the payment of rent for the territories and premises, the housing and support of the troops, the establishment of the infrastructure, the repair of bases, etc. The total expenditures will depend to a considerable extent upon the conditions of the deployment of the forces. In the event that some state or other of the CIS is interested in basing Russian forces in its territory, it is necessary to strive for an equivalent distribution of expenditures for their support on a parity basis. A standard draft agreement worked out by the group could serve as the basis for subsequent agreements on the basing of Russian forces in the states of the Commonwealth. But it must not be perceived as dogma. It is absolutely essential to take into account the peculiarities of each country. In any agreement, however, it is expedient to provide for articles involving the financing of the troops and the interaction and interrelationships of the Russian units with local authorities and their army structures, including in the carrying out of joint exercises and maneuvers, and about the Russian military respecting the laws of the country where they are stationed and the uninterrupted supplying of Russian military units and installations. It is also important to set forth positions on social and material guarantees for the service personnel and the members of their families taking into account the specific nature of the places where they are deployed. For it is no secret that with the introduction of national currencies the living standard of our military people in service in the armed forces of former Soviet republics declined dramatically, although there are corresponding bilateral agreements in this respect. It is therefore expedient to work out a mechanism for their realization and to provide for sanctions in the event that the agreements are not fulfilled. In the preparation of documents of this kind, it is desirable to appeal to the experience of foreign armies. Nor should one ignore the experience in the negotiations on the conditions for the stay and withdrawal of Soviet forces from the countries of Eastern Europe, putting into effect formulas that have already been developed. In foreign circles, the motives for the preservation of our military presence in the states of the CIS are perceived in different ways. Apparently, the politicians and analysts there do not have a clear notion of the special role of the Russian Army, whereas some are simply suspicious of Moscow's noble intentions to establish conditions of stability along the entire perimeter of the Russian borders. It is important to realize that these bases do not threaten anyone. They are called upon to protect the interests of the contracting states and peacemaking actions. There is therefore scarcely any need to attribute nonexisting "imperial ambitions" to Russia in the geopolitical territory of the former USSR. The establishment of Russian military bases fits very well into the framework of the Collective Security Treaty of the CIS as well as other bilateral agreements. Today it is merely a matter of the implementation of the corresponding positions. The legal basis for the deployment of Russian forces abroad is the Law of the Russian Federation "On Defense," which permits the stationing of troops and naval forces beyond its borders with the consent of parliament. In addition, a fundamental principle of their basing is the mutual interest of the sides, which does not contradict Article 51 of the UN Charter providing for the right of a state to individual or collective self-defense. The experience of postwar Europe shows that this can have a stabilizing influence on the situation in some country or other and in the region.
