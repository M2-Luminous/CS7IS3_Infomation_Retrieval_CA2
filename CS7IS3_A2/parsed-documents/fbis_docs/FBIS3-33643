Our correspondent Gid'on Kouts reports that the Israeli-Palestinian formulations committee completed its work and has reached a written document. Israeli sources in Davos say that if the document is approved by Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat an agreement will be reached. Sources in the Palestinian delegation say, on the other hand, that some problems remain and the Israelis are retreating from promises they have made. The document includes mutually agreed-upon positions as well as the positions of each of the two sides. It was reported that agreement has been reached on the sterile room at the border crossings, as well as on the issues of security roads and zones in the Gaza Strip. On the other hand there is only a basic understanding regarding the size of the Jericho area; a gentleman's agreement has been reached that Israel will increase this size as a goodwill gesture. The Israeli sources assessed that the agreement will not be initialed tonight. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres told our correspondent that if everything is concluded this will constitute a major step toward implementing the agreement of principles. Peres would not commit himself to deadlines and dates for the implementation of the agreement of principles, but said that if an agreement is reached the road will be greatly shortened. He added that every side has remained faithful to its principles: Israel made no concessions on security issues, whereas the Palestinians insisted on issues relating to their self-respect and sentiments.
