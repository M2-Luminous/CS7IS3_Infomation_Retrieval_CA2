Our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari says a new document, bearing the signature of Major General Amnon Shahaq, was relayed to Dr. Nabil Sha'th. This document introduces changes to four of the clauses from what is defined as the accepted format. The changes relate to the fate of private Arab-owned land in the Qatif Bloc; the safeguarding of roads from the Allenby Bridge terminal to Jericho; the arrangements at the border crossing points in Rafah and Jericho, as well as to other issues. Well-informed Palestinian and Israeli sources this evening confirmed these amendments have been introduced. Israel is arguing that if Yasir 'Arafat wants to introduce changes, it too can demand changes. A Palestinian source told our correspondent the negotiations can be wrapped-up in three weeks -- that is, after the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva.
