SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Disability Process Reengineering Team of the Social Security Administration (SSA) published a notice on April 15, 1994 (59 FR 18188) that announced a proposal to redesign the disability claims process for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income Disability and Blindness benefits. This notice provided for a comment period that ended May 27, 1994. Although the Proposal was available to the employees of SSA and State Disability Determination Services on April 1, it was not widely available to members of the general public until the April 15 publication in the Federal Register . Due to the importance of these issues, we believe a longer comment period is appropriate. Therefore, we are extending the comment period to June 14, 1994. The comments will be weighed in the Agency's subsequent decisions on implementation. Dated: May 23, 1994. Rhoda M. G. Davis, Director, Process Reengineering Program.
