According to information, alongside organization and cadre matters involved in military construction, the situation in Abkhazia was discussed. Local observers -- comparing this report with information received from Abkhazian sources today that there is an unusual concentration of Georgian manpower and combat equipment on the Inguri river separating the warring sides -- think it is possible that a wide-scale offensive on Sukhumi might be launched in the next few days. It is not ruled out that the final objective will be to reach the border with Russia along the Psou river and take control of the whole territory of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia.
