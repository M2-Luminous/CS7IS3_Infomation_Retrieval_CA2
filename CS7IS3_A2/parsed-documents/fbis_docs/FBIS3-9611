The UNHCR said earlier it expected the trucks to be driven back to Banja Luka, northern Bosnia, by Bosnian Serb soldiers. On Wednesday [23 March], around 100 Serb soldiers stole the trucks as they approached Maglaj carrying 94 tonnes of foodstuffs and medicines destined for the town's beleagured population. A 10th truck, stolen with the others, was found shortly afterwards and returned to UNHCR control. The trucks had been hijacked in the town of Teslic, next to Maglaj, and their 10 Danish drivers terrorized before they were released. UN officials said at one point the Danish drivers had been lined up against a wall for what they feared was execution. The drivers were taken by truck to a Serb-Croat front line, from where they had to walk to a Bosnian Croat army post whose soldiers transferred them to a British UN base. Aid convoys started reaching Maglaj last Sunday [20 March] after a five-month seige by Bosnian Serb forces. In October two Danish drivers of a UNHCR convoy were shot and killed as they entered Maglaj. UN Special Representative to the Former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi protested to the authorities in Pale, the Bosnian Serb stronghold, after the convoy was taken. Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the colonel in charge of the soldiers had been stripped of his command, adding that an inquiry had been launched.
