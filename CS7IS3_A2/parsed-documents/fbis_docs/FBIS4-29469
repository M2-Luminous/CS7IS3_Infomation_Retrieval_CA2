FBIS4-29469 "dreas118__a94018" FBIS-EAS-94-118-A Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ANNEX Japan Kono on Coalition, No-Confidence Motion Issue Kono on Coalition, No-Confidence Motion Issue OW1706103394 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Jun 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1706103394 Tokyo SANKEI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] President Yohei Kono granted an interview to SANKEI SHIMBUN at party headquarters on 14 June. In severely criticizing the proposal by Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and other coalition members for forming the so-called "conservative-conservative alliance" [with some LDP members], Kono stated: "The minority coalition is calling for such an alliance in a bid to prolong its life. Its attitude of seeking a "conservative-conservative alliance" while urging the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to return to the coalition is illogical. I cannot help thinking the proposal is intended to induce a split within other parties. At present, I have no intention of seriously studying it." Then, he indicated there is no possibility of allying with Shinseito, saying: "No matter what good policies [the coalition adopts], it is not good that a democratic method has not been taken." With regard to whether the LDP intends to hold policy-coordination talks with the SDPJ and other parties, Kono pointed out: "It depends on the nature of (the post-Hata) administration." He stated: 1) If the [post-Hata] administration intends to become an election-administrating cabinet, it is not necessary for the LDP to closely reconcile policy differences with other parties because each party competes in an election with its own policies; in this case, it is advisable to reach an accord on some points of policies; and, 2) if the administration intends to become a full-fledged cabinet, it is necessary to thoroughly adjust policy differences with other parties. In commenting on some LDP members, including former Deputy Prime Minister Michio Watanabe and Political Reform Headquarters Chairman Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, showing a positive stance on the so-called "conservative-conservative alliance," Kono stressed: "I am sure that they will not act personally if [the coalition] makes approaches to LDP individuals, not to the whole party." Regarding the possibility of submitting a no-confidence motion against the Hata Cabinet after Diet passage of the fiscal 1994 national budget bill, Kono said: "The Hata Cabinet is not an orthodox administration under parliamentary democracy. Through interpellation to the prime minister's policy speech, we have already conveyed to Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata our demand that he make a grave decision after budget deliberations end. There is no change in our intention. We and other opposition parties share the view that (the cabinet) should be changed after budget deliberations end." He thus reiterated a strong determination to submit a no-confidence motion against the Hata Cabinet. However, Kono hinted that at present, the LDP has no prospects for cooperating with the SDPJ and other parties in dealing with the no-confidence motion. He said: "Now is the time to obtain consent from many people on the no-confidence motion to overthrow the Hata Cabinet. After that, we would like to have a free-hand."
