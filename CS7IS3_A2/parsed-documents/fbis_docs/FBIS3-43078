Yuriy Osipov blames the loss of the item directly on two Borises: Boris Fedorov, Minister of Finance, and Boris Saltykov, Minister of Science and Technical Policy. In the opinion of the RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) Presidium, which was expressed on 14 December in an appeal of the academicians to Boris Yeltsin, these two ministers are intentionally and systematically destroying the Academy. A resolution of the RAN Presidium dated 21 December already contains a threat of public denunciation of the mentioned Borises. In the appeal to the president the indignant scientists proposed that an end be put to this disgraceful situation and that all fundamental research in the country be conveyed to the oversight of the Academy of Sciences and that the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy be eliminated. The leaders of the Academy are by no means submitting this appeal for the first time. But for the first time all these conversations are no longer confined to the offices and are reaching a broad public. And perhaps for the first time the ``immortals'' are quite close to their desired objective. The dogfight has ended and war has been declared. The Ministry of Science and Technical Policy is being bombarded with angry telephone calls: ``How could you? How dare you leave academic science without funds for its existence?'' Andrey Fonotov, the deputy minister, shrugs his shoulders in perplexity. In his opinion the panic arose due to a misunderstanding. ``We thought that this matter was settled long ago. After all, the new draft of the budget in which this item is missing was sent out to all interested departments last summer. And it was not the Academy, but we who drew the attention of the Ministry of Finance to this detail. The draft was very inept and we sent it back with a great many critical comments; on 28 October the ministry agreed with our criticism and the Academy item was returned to its rightful place. It is strange that Yuriy Osipov was not interested in learning the true status of matters from the Minister of Science and Technology before dashing off one denunciation after another.'' But, from all appearances, the RAN president did not clarify the status of matters because this was not in his interests. Available facts make it necessary to assume that he had to have a panic precisely at that postelection moment when Boris Yeltsin announced an impending reduction in the number of ministries and their personnel. The panic was necessary around any problem, even if it be nonexistent. We find it difficult to believe that the leaders of the Academy, with all their friendly relationships to the president and prime minister of the country, had no access to the last draft of the budget. But the facts are as follows. Already on 14 September Nikolay Malyshev, an advisor to the president of Russia on science and education, sent a memorandum to Yeltsin in which he proposed that of which the RAN Presidium is now proposing -- conveyance of all fundamental science to the oversight of the Academy and abolition of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. Then the dispersal of parliament occurred and the seat of Boris Saltykov for the first time in many months ceased to shake. The Minister of Science and Technical Policy as a member of the Gaydar camp during this unconstitutional period was completely untouchable. As soon as the elections had ended in the way we know they did the Malyshev memorandum with the presidential decision ``examine'' was laid on the desk of Yegor Gaydar. The Malyshev proposals taken separately could scarcely harm the ministry -- the accusations made so little corresponded to reality. The ministry was accused of an excessive expansion of staffing at the very same time when the personnel rolls were being significantly reduced; due to low salaries people are now fleeing from the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. The ministry was accused of working ``in the old style'' in that no one there was occupied with anything but ``petty details and the distribution of funds.'' But it is hard to call a ``petty detail'' the organization of new structures of the state scientific center type, which has literally rescued from collapse several tens of very large scientific organizations in the country. It is difficult to call work ``in the old style'' the method, completely new for us, for distribution of funds by scientists themselves: reference is to the organization of a Russian Fund for Fundamental Research. This fund, incidentally, despite all the criticism directed at it, has invigorated much neglected research. ``Instead of complaining,'' said one scientist, ``we are now filling out applications for grants.'' In a preelection meeting with scientists Boris Saltykov spoke of establishing a similar fund for specialists in the humanities, a Technological Fund, the possibility of establishing a fund for payment of thousand-dollar stipends to representatives of the scientific elite of the country. Now everything may end in a crash. The Malyshev proposals, supported by the surprisingly similar proposals of the RAN Presidium, multiplied by a precisely selected moment in time, may still topple the minister hated by the Academy. According to information from the government apparat, a paper already lies on the desk of Boris Yeltsin providing for the abolition of the Ministry of Science and in its stead the organization of a department of science affairs. Malyshev, naturally, is to be named to this post. He once was the former Minister of Science and Technical Policy, sure, for an entire month. ``The ministry in its present-day form is not the most ideal structure for leading science from a state close to clinical death,'' says Aleksey Zakharov, a member of the Russian Consultative Council of the International Science Fund, an active supporter of science reforms, who more likely could be called an opponent rather than an admirer of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. ``The ministry is frequently criticized and at times very correctly. Like any Russian department it acts very slowly and each new thing that comes along -- be it regulations on preferential taxes for international philanthropic organizations or the setting up of a new fund -- is dealt with only with excessive difficulty. However, this is the sole department which is taking steps in the right direction, something not characteristic of Soviet administrative methods. If the ministry is abolished and the funding of fundamental research is returned to the Academy Russian scientists might as well put on mourning -- hopes for improvement in the situation are low even without this and they will decrease virtually to zero. Experience has shown that the only thing which the leadership of the Russian Academy of Sciences can do effectively is to ask for money. The Academy Presidium is not capable of carrying out reforms making it possible to conserve scientific potential because any of these reforms lessens its authority. It is capable only of dragging out the agony and making it irreversible.'' A short addendum to this article. The poor Russian Academy of Sciences, constantly whining about budget support, has at its disposal, for example, several recreational facilities, including one held jointly with an Austrian company -- the five-star ``Palace Hotel.'' Still another five-star hotel is located on the grounds of the Organic Biology Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, where an automobile shop also is in operation. Just what is done with the considerable hard currency receipts is unknown. In particular, in checking the Palace Hotel one discovers unaccounted for cash receipts of 860 thousand real American dollars belonging to the Academy. It must be surmised that they were not very necessary to the scientists or have been laid away for a rainy day.
