Earlier, the puppet deputy minister of foreign affairs said Wednesday that whether the third round of the talks will be held or not is "uncertain" because "the nuclear inspection of the North is not satisfactory" and "the North-South dialogue is not going smoothly." As was already reported, an inspectors' group of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] started its activities on March 1 according to the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and the competent organ of the DPRK is rendering a proper cooperation to it. We are willing to honestly implement the agreement concerning the IAEA's inspection for the continuity of safeguards. Nevertheless, the deputy foreign minister grumbled that the "IAEA's inspection of the North is not satisfactory." This is really preposterous. As for the "rough going of the North-South dialogue" he talked about, the responsibility for this rests entirely with the South side. At the fifth working contact for the exchange of presidential envoys between the North and the South, the South side took a provocative stand by deliberately bringing forward matters unrelated to the discussion of working procedures to spoil the atmosphere of the talks. The puppets are now crying that the North-South dialogue is not going smoothly after intentionally creating difficulties in the working contact. This is a ruse to avoid the responsibility. And it must not go unnoticed that they are persistently arguing that the progress of the North-South dialogue is a precondition of the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. As we have already stated, the agreed conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact include the issue of the resumption of the working contact for the exchange of special envoys between the two halves of Korea as a step of simultaneous action and they do not mention the realization of the exchange. The DPRK and the United States agreed on the steps of simultanous action without preconditions. The puppets' clamour about the preconditions is nothing but a despicable attempt to balk the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks by intentionally creating obstacles. The "international cooperation system" sought by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique behind the curtain of dialogue to isolate and stifle the DPRK will result only in precipitating their own doom.
