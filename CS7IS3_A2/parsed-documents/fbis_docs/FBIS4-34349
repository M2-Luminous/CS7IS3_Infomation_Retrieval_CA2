In addition, other procoupist sectors reaffirmed their support for the military. The Chamber of Commerce criticized the possibility of military intervention in Haiti and censured U.S. Government representative William Gray, who said the Haitian private sector had admitted that the military's permanence in power is harmful for private sector interests. Lawyer Mireille Durocher Bertin, who supports the military, pointed out that "the High Command's resignation, demanded by the UN Security Council, is equivalent to the destabilization of the Army and, therefore, of all national institutions." Conversely, pro-Aristide Deputy Samuel Madistin said "General Cedras' resignation is the first step toward resolving the crisis." In view of the situation, U.S. diplomatic personnel started to leave the country on Thursday. Unofficial sources, however, have said that 75 U.S. Embassy officials will stay. According to Radio Metropole, thousands of U.S. citizens, including naturalized Haitians, have returned to their home country so far and that 1,368 Haitians, who obtained political asylum in the United States, are expected to travel to this country before 25 June. As for the application of the embargo, banned products keep entering Haiti through the border with the Dominican Republic despite the presence of numerous soldiers and international observers. Gasoline vendors, who work for the military and their associates, appear to be surprised about the large amount of fuel available. "The price keeps getting lower. It rose when the border closure was announced. Shortly thereafter, however, because it was so easy to obtain it, the price started to drop. Now, gasoline costs 20 percent less than last week," one of the vendors said. The remarks by members of the different sectors occurred nine days after Canada stopped flights to Haiti and one week before the United States applies a similar measure.
