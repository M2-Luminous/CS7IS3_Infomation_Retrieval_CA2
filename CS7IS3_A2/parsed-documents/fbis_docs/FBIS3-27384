This is the central topic of the regional planning work conference held on 26 January. Qian Fenyong, Liu Zhen, and Song Zhimin attended the conference. Song Zhimin, vice chairman of the region, made a speech at the conference, urging for efforts to appropriately handle the relations in the following five aspects in terms of macroeconomic control. The relations among reform, development, and stability. Development constitutes the foundation of social stability, reform instills vitality to development, and only by maintaining a stable social environment can we concentrate our energy on pressing forward reform, opening up, and economic development. When making arrangements for economic work, all leagues, cities, and departments should pay attention to the linking of the relations between reform and stability and relations between reform and development. The relations between speed and efficiency. The rapid development of the economy must be founded on the basis of having a good sale and efficiency and being permitted by financial and material resources. Both when initiating new projects and renovating old enterprises, we should give top priority to good market and efficiency. If successfully transformed, the natural resources advantages may be turned into economic advantages; and if poorly transformed, the natural resources advantages may become burdens. In addition, we should also correctly handle the relations between the newly initiated projects and the endeavor of tapping the potential of existing projects. We should pay attention to the major projects that exert great influence on economic development, and should, moreover, pay attention to the projects that consume less investment, need short construction period, and yield quick results. This year, the capital construction investment can only be made in the projects that are at the winding-up stage and will soon be put into production in the right order of importance and urgency. The relations between the whole and the part. The enhancement of the macroeconomic control capacity of the state is conducive to the minority nationalities areas in the region, and, similarly, the enhancement of the macroeconomic control capacity of our region is also conducive to various leagues, cities, banners, and counties. Therefore, we hope that all localities and all departments will take the overall situation into account and will subject themselves to the overall situation when their partial interests are contradictory to the overall interest. The relations between economic development and social development. In the course of accelerating the region's economic development, we must make overall arrangements for and give all-round consideration to the development of such social undertakings as education, culture, and social security. The relations between economic construction and people's livelihood. On the basis of developing the economy and increasing labor productivity, we should continuously increase the income of urban and rural residents. This is the only way to better mobilize the initiative of the numerous people in production, to reinforce the unity among the people of all nationalities, to enhance the cohesive force to develop the economy, and to effect an even faster and better development of the economy. In particular, we should show concern for the lives of the masses in the localities and units that have difficulties and should work out methods to solve problems for them. Song Zhimin stressed: We should re-fix the position of planning work, readjust functions of planning work, shift work priorities, improve planning forms and methods, and enable planning work to play an even important, positive, and effective role. First, we should actually attend to the reform of planning and investment structures. We should shift, as quickly as possible, the plan management functions to researching strategies, formulating plans, exercising macroeconomic control, maintaining the aggregate economic balance, working out industrial policies, cultivating markets, building key projects, and giving coordinated service. With market as the foundation, we should give full play to the fundamental role of the market in allocating natural resources, strengthen the research and comprehensive coordination of the macroeconomic policies, give full play to the important role of the planning means in the macroeconomic control, emancipate the mind to broaden the field of vision, positively pioneer the new sphere of the planning work that is commensurate with the development of market economy, and establish scientific planning system. Second, we should rapidly draw up the medium- and long-term plan for development of the region in line with the regional party committee's strategic demand for "joining the country's forefront." This year, planning commissions at all levels, together with departments concerned, should concentrate their energy on researching and drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the medium- and long-term plan for the region's economic and social development in 2010, the plan for making the people relatively better-off, the plan for supporting and developing the poor areas, the plan on development of guiding industries, the plan on development of regional economy, and the plan on conservation of national territories. Third, we should pay attention to the work concerning the aggregate economic balance. We should emphatically arrange for the production and supply of means of agricultural production, for the linking of the growing scale of major cash crops with the production ability of light industrial enterprises, and for the balance between railway transportation and power supply capacities and the demands of the production of various trades. Fourth, we should successfully control and guide the key links of economic development and make good pre-phase preparations for major projects in order to promote the smooth construction of key projects.
