How do you assess this fact? [Olechowski] It is very important that negotiations on the bilateral treaty are over. It will be possible not only to begin a new stage in Lithuanian-Polish relations but also to remove the last formal obstacle hampering Poland's active foreign policy toward its Eastern neighbors. Lithuania is the only neighbor with whom we have no principal document signed. I will remind everyone that Poland began to draft the treaty in March 1992 -- exactly two years ago. However, the problem of disbanding the self-governments in Vilnius and Salcininkay regions, mostly populated by the Poles, arose then. We submitted our draft treaty to Lithuania on 13 January 1993, while the Lithuanians presented their version last June. It is then that the true negotiations began. [ELTA]Thus far, the contents of the treaty have remained unknown. However, there are people both in Lithuania and Poland who criticize this document. Some of them are dissatisfied with the absence of General L. Zeligowski's name in the treaty, while others -- with the fact that the treaty does not protect the rights of the Polish minority in Lithuania. What is your view? [Olechowski] I have also heard different opinions. Speaking about the mention of General L. Zeligowski's name in the treaty, Poland has consistently opposed the assessment of historical events. We believe that the complicated historical relations between Lithuania and Poland must be a matter of research and disputes of professional historians. The treaty is an interstate document. It must serve as the basis for developing our relations. These are two different issues that must not be confused. Protecting the rights of our ethnic minorities, we followed this principle -- to seek the integration of the Polish minority as Lithuanian citizens by preserving the cultural and linguistic autonomy and respecting minority rights. I am convinced that emotions over the secrecy of the text will subside after the treaty is publicized, and the text will be analyzed calmly. [ELTA]Lithuania is the last country among Poland's neighbors with which the latter has no interstate agreement signed. One Polish social figure has said that Lithuania is the key to Poland's Eastern policy, while Ukraine is its foundation. Do you share this opinion? [Olechowski] Both states play an important role in Poland's Eastern policy, because they, as Russia and Belarus, are our neighbors. Poland is interested in their political stability and in consistent changes that bring them closer to European structures. We hope that Poland's cooperation with Lithuania and Ukraine will develop further in the "Partnership for Peace" program. [ELTA]What are the key trends of your Eastern policy? [Olechowski] Seeking a successful execution of its foreign policy, Poland must stress the key priorities. For well-known reasons, these are primarily our relations with neighbors. Our Eastern policy must focus on three principal directions: To expand political and economic contacts with Russia and Ukraine, as well as with Belarus, Moldova, and Kazakhstan; to seek political and military stability in the region; and to upgrade the application of possibilities for economic cooperation. [ELTA]What will the first moves be after signing the Lithuanian-Polish interstate treaty? [Olechowski] First of all, we must make our economic relations more intensive. To this aim, we would like to hold a roundtable meeting soon and discuss economic issues. We expect mutual benefit from this. We will also seek to resolve specific problems between our two countries. I would ascribe the registration of the Polish Home Army Veterans' Club in Lithuania as one of the most important issues. Moreover, we must clear up the problems concerning the property of Polish prewar social organizations in Vilnius. [ELTA]Thank you for the interview.
