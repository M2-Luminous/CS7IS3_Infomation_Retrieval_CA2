G. Yeliseyev, P. V. Karga; UDC 621.373.826.038.825.4] [Abstract] A comprehensive analysis has been performed in this article of the feasibility of employing periodic quantum- size heterostructure (QHS), or multiquantum barrier (MQB), based on Al[.sup]x[/]Ga[.sub]1-x[/]As/GaAs and Ga[.sup]x[/]In[.sub]1-x[/]As[.sub]y[/]P[.sub]1- y[/]/InP for improving the efficiency of electron confinement in the active region of semiconductor laser and reducing the current density of the electron leakage from the active zone. Parameters of the periodic MQB were determined, where the height of the effective potential barrier was increased by more than 100%, and the density of the current leakage from the active region of the semiconductor laser was decreased by more than three orders of magnitude. The relationship of the electron wave reflection coefficient as a function of the electron energy, and behavior of the current density of electrons injected into the active region in the above heterostructures, with variation of the number, composition and thickness of the layers which form the periodic MQB was analysed.
