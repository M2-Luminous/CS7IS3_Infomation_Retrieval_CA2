According to the data of the State Committee for Statistics, the income of the wealthiest 10 percent in 1993 was 11 times as high as the income of the bottom 10 percent. In 1992 the correlation was 7.5-8 times, and in 1991 it was 4.5 times. It might be a good idea to add the specialized term "Genie coefficient" to our common terminology. This coefficient is an index of income concentration, ranging from 0 to 1. It measures the distribution of income from the point of total equality (0) to the point at which everything belongs to a single individual (1). At the end of 1993, for example, the coefficient in Russia was 0.346. For the sake of comparison, it was 0.327 at the end of 1992 and 0.256 at the end of 1991. According to last year's figures, the per capita income of one out of every three Russians was below the minimum subsistence level, and the monetary income of 13 percent of the population did not exceed the minimum food allowance. The income of 5 percent of the citizens of Russia was below the minimum required for physiological survival. The table illustrates the degree of stratification. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Distribution of Russian Population According to Per Capita Monetary Income i-| |n November 1993 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Income (in rubles) |Millions of people |Percentages | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Total |148.7 |100 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Under 10,000 |0.6 |0.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |10,001-20,000 |9.0 |6.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |20,001-30,000 |20.2 |13.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |30,001-40,000 |24.5 |16.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |40,001-50,000 |23.6 |15.8 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |50,001-60,000 |20.4 |13.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |60,001-70,000 |16.7 |11.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |70,001-80,000 |13.3 |9.0 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |80,001-90,000 |10.5 |7.1 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Over 90,000 |9.9 |6.7 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Average per capita monetary income in November 1993 was 37,908 rubles. This was the average for all segments of the population. The average was 42,799 rubles for able-bodied adults, 26,705 rubles for pensioners, and 37,896 rubles for children. The minimum subsistence level is calculated according to the methods of the Russian Federation Ministry of Labor and includes expenditures on food, based on minimum consumption, expenditures on non-food items and services, and taxes and obligatory payments--based on the proportional expenditures of the 10 percent of families with the lowest incomes. Now our discussions of increasing inequality will require a slight adjustment. Up to this point we have based these judgments on the monetary income of the population, but social divisions based on these income levels are not equivalent to the actual patterns of stratification. Some of the main social means (primarily housing and also, to some extent, transportation and medicine) are being distributed more equally because they are financed with state budget funds. This means that actual inequality is not increasing as quickly as we once believed.
