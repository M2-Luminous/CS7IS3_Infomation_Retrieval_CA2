FR940817-0-00034 FR940817-0-00014 Grazing of leaves, buds, and flowers by Coleopteran and Lepidopteran larvae is an ongoing threat at one California site (Imper et al. 1987). The highly clumped distribution and small number of populations of Lilium occidentale make any fungal, viral, or bacterial disease a potential threat. Fungal pathogens are common in cultivated lilies; growers often avoid planting in ground known to be contaminated. D. The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms . Lilium occidentale is listed as an endangered species in both California (Chapter 1.5, ยง2050 et seq. ) and Oregon (ORS 564.100_564.135; OAR 603&hyph;73&hyph;005 et seq .), and is included in the Oregon Wildflower Protection Act (ORS 564.020). In California, the ``take'' of State-listed plants is prohibited, but the law exempts the taking of such plants via habitat modification or land use change by the landowner. After the California Department of Fish and Game notifies a landowner that a State-listed plant grows on his or her property, State law requires only that the landowner notify the agency ``at least 10 days in advance of changing the land use to allow salvage of such plant'' (Chapter 1.5, ยง1913). In Oregon, the ``take'' of State-listed plants is prohibited only on State-owned or -leased lands. Enforcement of State endangered species laws is inadequate, as is evident from the list of recent depredations in Factor C above, and from the ``take'' of lilies by activities of the city of Brookings on Oregon Department of Transportation land, as described in Factor A above. The seriousness of the problem of enforcement is underscored by the fact that this lily population on State land was twice subjected to destruction, although all involved parties were informed of the presence of the rare lily after the first incident. Lilium occidentale grows in wetland habitat. Under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) regulates the discharge of fill into the waters of the United States, including wetlands. The Clean Water Act requires project proponents to notify the Corps and obtain a permit prior to undertaking many activities (e.g., grading, discharge of soil or other fill material, etc.) that would result in the fill of wetlands under the Corps' jurisdiction. The Corps promulgated Nationwide Permit No. 26 (33 CFR 330, Appendix A) to address fill of isolated or headwater wetlands totalling less than 10 acres. Where fill would adversely modify less than 10 acres of wetland, the Corps circulates a predischarge notification to the Service and other interested parties for comment to determine whether or not an individual permit should be required for a proposed fill activity and associated impacts. The Corps must respond within 30 days or the proposed activity will be authorized under the nationwide permit.
