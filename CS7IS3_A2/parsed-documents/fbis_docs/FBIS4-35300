For the scum disappears like froth cast out; while that which is for the good of mankind remains on the earth. [Koranic verse] Esteemed Brother Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Arab League secretary general; Esteemed Brother Permanent Delegates: A message of respect and appreciation. Your Yemeni homeland is experiencing critical circumstances as a result of the ordeal imposed by a group of rebels who violated the constitutional legitimacy, represented by 'Ali Salim al-Bid and those with him. The sedition Yemen is experiencing poses grave dangers to Yemen's present, future, unity, democracy, political system, sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and cohesion of its sons. At the same time, it is a serious sign not only on the level of the Yemeni homeland but also on the level of the entire Arab homeland's peoples and governments. It also represents a challenge to our Arab League's charter, the international organizations, and the bases on which states were established. However, what calls for happiness and pleasure is that our esteemed House and its members, who represent the Yemeni people, see in our Arab League and in the peoples and governments of its Arab nation both support and assistance designed to champion it and understand its causes as well as a helper and supporter designed to curb the insane adventures of the rebellious secessionists and circumvent both dangers and suffering, exactly as you have always done for this House. Brother Arab League Secretary General, Brother Permanent Delegates: For our people, the reestablishment of Yemeni unity by setting up the Republic of Yemen on 22 May 1990--unity which all Arabs had the honor of backing and supporting as an Arab experience and a step on the path of fulfilling our Arab nation's great dream of unity--was a pioneering civilized achievement, a normal event, and a simple way to realize both the cohesion of resources and the unification of efforts for development and progress. It was also a reunification of families which were separated by artificial borders during the eras of colonialism and the hateful imamate rule, and which were also scattered by the policy of confrontation during the eras of the resented partition that was due to known reasons by which all capabilities and resources were used in a lengthy conflict. During this conflict, the differences were deepened and the mutual trust was so weakened that its repercussions cannot be measured by time standards. As a result of this conflict, all the Yemeni people paid a dear and doubled price during all the phases of the partition until, after much endurance, the people achieved their objective of unity. For this people, unity was a humanitarian salvation by all standards since there was a project to restore the values of amity, good relations among relatives, and tolerance among brothers and fathers, and also a return to safety and reassurance for the people. Yemeni unity also represented a civilized project to build a modern Yemeni state based on democracy, political and party pluralism, peaceful sharing of power, justice, equality, respect for rights and freedoms, and supremacy of law. Through this project, the Yemeni people irreversibly disposed of oppression, tyranny, injustice, and persecution. Through this project, the Yemeni people circumvented all the suffering, pains, the catastrophes of time, the bereavement of wives, the wailing of victims, and the destruction of families, which they long suffered in the past as a result of the bloody conflicts and painful armed confrontations throughout more than two decades. Our esteemed Arab League, along with all Arab brethren, were not far or absent from all this. As the highest body and most important institution, the Arab League worked along with the Arab brethren on the level of states and governments collectively and individually. The Arabs sensed both the ordeal and concerns of their Yemeni brethren, and made efforts to contain the crises, and end and save the people from their ordeal. The Arabs also worked by all means to help the Yemenis achieve their sought objective and safe haven; namely, Yemeni unity. They also played a great role in extinguishing the fire of war, which broke out from time to time in the country or in each of the two parts of the country. They also worked very eagerly to restore its cohesion by achieving unity. These positions, which the Yemeni people have never forgotten and which will remain as immortal as history in their memory, were adopted by the brothers out of their pan-Arab responsibility, their religious duty, and their true brotherly and human concern and in accordance with the Arab League member states' agreement that led to its establishment and that was included in its charter. This is because they believed that the primary objective of unity of the Arab nation, for which the Arab League was established, should begin in full swing with Yemen, which contains the real seeds of Arab unity and whose land and people have enjoyed unity of doctrine, language, race, and fate since time immemorial and since the creation of the world. This is what our Arab governments believe within their pan-Arab framework, the Arab League, in line with the Yemeni people's belief, unanimity, and yearning for unity and in harmony with the commitments of all their leaders that assumed power in the so-called two parts of Yemen. In light of this, the Arab League sponsored the first Yemeni unity agreement in 1972, which was worked out under the Arab League's canopy and at its headquarters in Cairo, as well as the ensuing agreements in Tripoli, Algiers, and Kuwait. The committees, which were formed by the leaderships of the two parts at that time, worked for that end. The Constitution of the Republic of Yemen was accomplished in 1981, a Constitution under which Yemen was unified in 1990 and which united the parts of Yemen into one unified Yemeni entity, ending the eras of partition, division, wars, and destruction for good. A referendum was held for the entire people in May 1991, and the first elections were held on the level of the entire homeland in April 1993 based on democracy, political pluralism, and multiparty system, and peaceful rotation of power. The whole world acknowledged these elections' success and fairness and all the forces blessed it. All the legislations and unionist laws of the one Yemen were issued in accordance with the Constitution, and the government coalition, made up of the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Grouping, was formed as a natural result of the elections. The coalition document signed by the three parties contained the basic pillars of the government's program, chief of which was preserving Yemeni unity and democracy. Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the Republic of Yemen is an independent and sovereign state, that it is a unity that cannot be divided, that no part can be relinquished, and that the Yemeni people are part of the Arab nation and the Islamic world. In light of this, new interests and relations were reinforced among the sons of the one homeland and on the level of the regions and the governorates. Arab League Secretary General, Permanent Delegates: You know well that the Yemeni unity did not take place between two peoples, who are prevented by geographic, language, national, cultural, and ideological obstacles from going ahead with their unionist dreams. Neither was it an emotional unity and a mere unification of interests. Rather, it was a unity of a nation that will remain unified in terms of land and people. The partitioning that occurred from time to time as result of colonialism or power struggle was an exception. Those who follow Yemen's old and modern history will discover an eternal unity among the sons of the one Yemeni people, even during the ugly eras. The sons of the Yemeni people were not treated within the framework of the big Yemeni homeland as foreign nationals. On the contrary, the people, the authority, and the successive systems and rulers rejected division and its imposition on the Yemeni people. Brother Secretary General, Brother Permanent Delegates: Our Yemeni people view Yemeni unity not as just a national and pan-Arab gain but also as their salvation, their life, future, dreams, and hopes. The proof that they deeply cherish unity is by sincerely emphasizing that for them unity is life and that any retraction from it or any harm to it is tantamount to a death sentence and a crime against innocent people who have been aspiring for a united homeland without barriers in which the minds, spirits, and funds will be secure. Our people reject in advance any step that partitions the homeland into entities that have the rank of states, that slices any part of the Republic of Yemen, or that constitutes a deviation from its legal status that was proclaimed on 22 May 1992 and which was recognized worldwide. From this premise, our people refuse any attempt to take the Yemeni issue out of its sound and objective context as a domestic issue, or that will lead them to catastrophes that imperil the one homeland such as the step that was made by those who have rebelled against constitutional legitimacy, those who have deviated from national consensus, those who have disavowed the homeland and nationalism, the advocates of secession, 'Ali Salim al- Bid and those with him. Brothers, we do not doubt that our fraternal Arab people, their governments, and their leaders, and our Arab League which has nurtured and blessed Yemeni unity will accept nothing less than the perpetuation of this unity. We also do not believe the Arab League will stifle this unity's objective and dream, will deal it a lethal blow, or pass a death sentence on an entire people, thus definitively ending the Arab League's pan-Arab project, the source of its pride and dignity and the safety valve for its present and future. We also do not believe that our Arab League and the leaders of fraternal states who enjoy farsightedness will accept al-Bid's treasonous step, or encourage any dangerous and strange act by any adventurer who tries to partition homelands, or permit that a rebel, adventurer, or whimsical person be given the chance to establish a state to satisfy his ego and intransigence, just because he has some military power and harbors evil ambitions to assume power at the expense of homelands and people and in defiance of their options and will. It is really a very grave step that will transform homelands into waste. As for us, we find no words that are more eloquent than to say that Yemeni unity is our destiny and our fate and that our Yemeni people wherever they are will only agree to unity and will not relinquish it, no matter what this will cost them. Our people view any condoning of the crime by traitor al-Bid and the secessionists who support him in the YSP command and his proclamation as a disavowal of the bonds of amity and the blood relationship, and a violation of conventions such as the Arab League Charter, not to mention that this will be an unjustified interfererence in their domestic affairs, a prolongation of the rebellion and the war whose scope could expand, and a sedition which has no limits. Our people also view any stand by their brothers that sympathizes with the rebellion as an illogical support for those who have no status or legitimacy and an attempt to impose tutelage on the Yemeni people. We regret, and you are in a position to know better, that what is taking place in our country is portrayed in a manner that is different from what it really is, or in a way that makes people call it something else. This is because the Yemeni people are one people and there is no place for the word south and north. As representatives of the Yemeni people, we ask you to act with responsibility, and support legitimacy and unity and not the opposite. We greatly appreciate the support and assistance you have offered in the past for the Yemeni revolution and unity and we thank you for these noble stands. How can we not say this when our Egyptian brothers had sacrificed their lives in support for Yemeni revolution and in trying to unite our people following the liberation of that part of Yemen that was occupied at the time? In conclusion, you are called upon to place right within its proper place, and to safeguard Yemen. Safeguarding Yemen cannot but be achieved through the preservation of its unity. As for partitioning, it means destruction and continuous wars. We do not believe you will accept this for a Muslim Arab people. We wish that this letter be considered as an Arab League document and that it will be distributed to the members. We thank you for your understanding of our just cause. Please accept our best regards. Issued by the House of Representatives in the Republic of Yemen, 30 May 1994
