The stir in the mass media has abated, the drumrolls and fanfares have died away, and the ink has dried on the hurried commentaries hot on the heels of the event. The time for in-depth analysis of the positions of the session participants and the decisions adopted there is approaching. It is already possible to try to give a more or less detailed reply to the question: Did the NATO summit justify the expectations, which had become widespread long before it began? These expectations were associated, above all, with the question of whether the North Atlantic alliance would manage to find its place in a world where there is no longer room for "cold war" and confrontation between the two systems. This was how not only political observers but also the very statesmen of the member countries defined the session's task. To chart the correct course in a rapidly changing world and to specify the bloc's political guidelines -- this was the chief purpose for which the top-level meeting was convened. This was the chief task. But by no means the only one. The United States --and President Clinton spoke frankly of this -- sought to strengthen its political leadership within NATO and in European affairs on a new basis while not tying itself down with overly onerous military obligations. The West European members of the alliance in turn set a dual goal -- to expand their own role within the bloc's framework and at the same time to prevent the weakening of Washington's military presence on the European continent, which was becoming increasingly noticeable. Central and East European countries, which were members of the Warsaw Pact, and also some others -- Albania, Macedonia, and Lithuania, for example -- took a special interest in the Brussels session. They were pinning their expectations on the fact that the NATO leadership had to decide the question of their admission to membership of the North Atlantic alliance and provide them with appropriate security guarantees. Russia also expressed its position repeatedly. It was resolutely opposed to expanding NATO to include East European states. Not only because this would result in the bloc's military infrastructure being moved up toward Russia's borders -- which would require us to take serious and costly measures in the defense sphere. The point is also that the admission of some countries to the alliance would automatically mean the nonadmission of others. This would lead to a new split in Europe, form a deep ditch on the body of the continent -- much further to the east than the "iron curtain" of the "cold war" times -- and undermine the European security system, which is still fragile and has not yet become finally established. Did the Brussels session succeed in resolving these, at times, mutually exclusive tasks? Probably the most laconic answer to this question was found by a Greek newspaper, which gave an article on the results of the NATO Council session the headline: "Yes, But...." Yes, Bill Clinton was without a doubt the dominant figure at the Brussels summit. The dynamic U.S. President did a great deal to restore and strengthen U.S. leadership of the bloc allies. But experienced European politicians -- French, Dutch, Belgian -- with the support of other partners in the EC and the Western European Union, found their own countergambit. They forced the session participants to devote great attention to the Bosnian problem, which had not been on the agenda before, by raising the question of making air strikes against Serbian positions in the Sarajevo region. This additional item on the agenda loomed large in the discussion and to a certain extent put Washington in an ambiguous position. Whereas last summer the Americans were insisting on such bombing raids in the knowledge, however, that the Europeans would not countenance this, they have now been forced to agree in principle to punitive actions against the Serbs, but with an important proviso -- only on a mandate from the United Nations, not NATO. At the same time the United States secured the unanimous approval of all the North Atlantic alliance members for its initiative -- the "Partnership for Peace." Elaborated in Washington, it is aimed at resolving several tasks at once. Above all, gaining time and preventing the weakening of the North Atlantic bloc as a tool of U.S. policy. In addition, preventing the admission of East European countries to NATO by offering them closer military-political cooperation instead -- a kind of probationary period with no definite time limits. True, far from everything is clear yet with regard to the actual idea of the "Partnership for Peace" program and the ways to implement it, including, let us say, for Russia, which is also being offered a part in it. For a number of conditions are stipulated for involvement in it -- such as, for example, greater openness in military organizational development and in the military budget, the establishment of civilian control over the armed forces, participation in peacemaking actions implemented under NATO auspices, and others. A careful study of all this still has to be made. The NATO program is being studied attentively at various levels, including, as far as I know, in both the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense and the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. At the same time the NATO Council's adoption of the "Partnership for Peace" program came as a considerable shock to the Central and East European states. Putting a brave face on a sorry business, they welcomed this program with greater or lesser enthusiasm and declared that they were ready to participate in it. This was their official line. But at the same time President Lech Walesa of Poland, for example, did not even deem it necessary to hide his disappointment and rated both the program and the fact of its adoption as blackmail and as affording Moscow the right to "veto" decisions of the North Atlantic alliance. This disappointment is primarily associated with the fact that East European countries regarded entry to NATO as recognition of their affiliation with (West) Europe and as an opportunity to join the European Union [EU] and be involved in economic integration in the EU. That this really is so is evidenced by the fact that on the eve of the session Warsaw, Prague, Budapest, and Bratislava were not even able to give clear expression to which alliance they would like to join -- NATO's military organization with multinational troops on Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak territories and with U.S. nuclear weapons, or a vague alliance granting certain guarantees but demanding practically nothing in exchange. Little consolation was provided by the claim made in Brussels that if any East European country, not a NATO member, is attacked in the future by some "expansionist" power, then the bloc "will almost certainly intervene." When assessing the results of the extraordinary NATO Council session in Brussels as a whole, it has to be stated that, despite all their importance, they did not entirely justify the hopes pinned on it. The session's decisions were not crucial for NATO. The search for its place and role in the postconfrontational world is proceeding with all too much difficulty and too slowly. On the eve of the Brussels summit the Hamburg weekly DIE ZEIT cited the words of the famous English military leader, the Duke of Wellington, the victor of Waterloo: "Nothing except a battle lost can be half so melancholy as a battle won." This is what has happened to NATO. Having achieved the aim proclaimed back in 1949, it has exhausted itself in its old form. Now the North Atlantic alliance is seeking a new purpose, a new raison d'etre. Brussels showed once again -- yes, it really is seeking. But it has not yet found it. Maybe it should not even search?
