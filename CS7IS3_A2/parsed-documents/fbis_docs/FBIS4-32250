Also today, Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu met with Vaclav Havel at the latter's rooms. The talks were attended by Teodor Melescanu, the Romanian foreign minister, and Jiri Skaliczky, the Czech minister of privatization. Recalling the positive development of the framework for Romanian-Czech relations, especially after the visit to our country by Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, Mr. Vacaroiu stressed that the new judicial framework of bilateral relations initiated on that occasion needs to be completed as soon as possible, with the conclusion of a free trade agreement between the two countries, implementing the memorandum that has been established in this respect between the two governments. Assessing bilateral relations between the two countries positively, the Romanian prime minister stressed the need to develop economic and commercial relations between the two states. In this context, an important role is played by the exchange of experience in the field of privatization, which is an area of great interest to both countries. President Havel stressed the significant drop in the volume of bilateral commercial exchanges as a result of the collapse of the old system of economic relations in Eastern Europe and emphasized the need to rebuild these relations of cooperation on the basis of the principles of the market economy. In this respect, the process of economic and commercial rapprochement between the two countries depends mainly on commercial companies. However, governments are duty-bound to create a favorable climate, something that the two countries have already started to achieve by concluding the Romanian-Czech accord for mutual protection of investment, the accord on avoidance of double taxation, and the memorandum regarding the establishment of a free trade zone. The Czech President expressed his hope that this process will be crowned as soon as possible with the conclusion of the free trade accord, which is in the process of negotiation, reads a press statement that we have received from the spokesman of the Romanian Government.
