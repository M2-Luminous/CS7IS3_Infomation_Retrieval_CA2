In line with the strategic principle of building the two civilizations simultaneously and scoring achievements in both of them and according to the demands of establishing the system of a socialist marked economy, efforts should be made to enhance the function of the people's democratic dictatorship and to make all-out efforts to safeguard the political stability and social peace so as to ensure smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction and to create a good social environment for fulfilling the task of improving the province's economy to a new level and for accelerating the pace of building Jilin into a developed, border, and maritime province. Under the leadership of the provincial party committee and the provincial people's government and by bringing their functional role into full play since the beginning of 1993, the organs in charge of politics and laws at all levels across the province have further enhanced and improved the work of politics and laws; defined the guiding ideology of giving priority to stability; safeguarded the political stability of the province as a whole; and maintained good public security order by upholding the principle of dealing strict blows at crime. They have upheld the principle of having personnel who are in charge of the work be responsible for the work and promoted the implementation of various measures adopted for the comprehensive management of public security. They have also concentrated their efforts on investigating and handling appalling and major criminal cases; played an active role in scoring periodical results in the struggle against corruption; rendered effective services for applying legal measures to establishing the systems of socialist market economy; and made positive contributions to ensuring the smooth progress in reform, opening up, and economic construction and to building Jilin into a developed, border, and maritime province. Wang Jinshan contended: The province's current situation in economic development, political stability, nationalities' unity, and social progress, is good. However, we should note that our province still has many prominent problems affecting the political stability and social peace. The hostile forces both at home and abroad are colluding each other and echoing each other at a distance. Their infiltrating and damaging activities have become increasingly intensified. The serious criminal cases of various categories steadily increase and unstable factors in the society show a relative increase. Under such a situation, the task of safeguarding the stability will become more heavy and urgent. He urged party committees and governments at all levels and departments in charge of politics and laws to correctly estimate and judge the situation, to resolutely keep a sober head, and to fully discern the important position and role of political and legal work. These party committees, governments, and departments in charge of political and legal work should be prepared for danger in times of peace; take precautions; and conduct the work of safeguarding the political stability and social peace satisfactorily, profoundly, carefully, and realistically. Wang Jinshan pointed out: Safeguarding the political stability represents the major duty of departments in charge of political and legal work. They should enhance their struggle against hidden dangers and resolutely deal blows at the infiltrating and damaging activities launched by the hostile forces both at home and abroad. They should also correctly deal with the contradictions cropping up under the new situation among the people, enhance the capability of handling unexpected incidents, realistically and effectively carry out the struggle against corruption, and apply the actual deeds and achievements scored in the struggle against corruption to winning the people's confidence and bringing into play the enthusiasm of the vast number of people in safeguarding the stability of the whole situation and in engaging in reform and construction. In citing the comprehensive management of public security Wang Jinshan said: We should have every locality, department, and unit truly implement the responsibility system in conducting their comprehensive management of public security. As for those that fail to earnestly enforce the leadership responsibility system in this regard and have caused a chaotic social order, we should exercise the right of vetoing all work done by them and impose the disciplinary sanction of the party and administration on them. Efforts should be made to further upgrade the work level of dealing strict blows at crime and to deal strict blows at serious criminal activities by emphasizing the task of cracking down on appalling cases, smashing criminal rings, and pursuing and capturing escaped criminals. We should resolutely eliminate and mop up evil phenomena in the society and block the trend of the spread and development of crime. Efforts should be made to consolidate the public security order in complicated public places, such as railway and bus stations, ports, cultural and recreation centers, and trade fairs; to deal with the prominent public security problems in rural areas; and to restore rural production and livelihood to a normal order. By conducting consolidation in a specific field in the struggle of dealing strict blows at crime, we should further promote the implementation of other measures for the comprehensive management of public security to ensure social stability. In citing the task of vigorously rendering effective services for developing the socialist market economy Wang Jinshan pointed out: It is imperative to enhance the building of socialist legal systems and to make sure laws are enacted that can be depended on, every law must be observed and be strictly enforced; and law violations must be handled. Efforts should be made to gradually establish complete legal systems suitable to the socialist market economy and to fully apply the legal weapon to dealing strict blows at the criminal activities that are damaging the development of productive forces and the market economy. According to the practical situation in the personnel's contingent on the political and legal front, Wang Jinshan demanded: In building the contingent of political and legal personnel this year, we should continuously implement the principle of conducting strict management and enhance the education and management over the contingent of political and legal personnel by regarding the reform as a motive force and the campaign of opposing corruption and encouraging administrative honesty as an emphasis so as to stabilize and develop the achievements scored in the concentrated consolidation, to further upgrade the contingent's quality as a whole and fighting strength, and to provide reliable guarantees for fulfilling the annual plan for the political and legal work this year. Wang Jinshan stressed in his speech: The more we deepen the reform, broaden the opening up, develop the market economy, the more we should enhance and improve the party's leadership over the economic work. At present, special efforts should be made to enhance the leadership over politics and ideology and over principles and policies and to strengthen the organizational leadership. Party committees at all levels should consciously put the political and legal work on their important schedule, fulfill their duties in dealing with the practical difficulties cropping up in the political and legal work, and make new contributions to building socialism with Chinese characteristics and developing the socialist market economy. Attending the provincial work conference on politics and laws held in Changchun on 8 January were Ke Muyun, vice chairman of the provincial people's congress standing committee and vice chairman of the provincial [words indistinct] commission; Wang Guofa, vice governor of the province and deputy secretary of the provincial commission on politics and laws; and comrades in charge of political and legal work from various cities, prefectures, and autonomous prefecture.
