According to Churkin, the meeting withdrew all remaining ambiguities and questions as to Russia's joining "Partnership for Peace." "The question was how to make the best use of the cooperation with the North Atlantic alliance envisioned by the program," Churkin was quoted as saying. Today Russia sees no ambiguities and obstacles for the program to function at a larger scale, Churkin added. The deputy minister said it was necessary to sign a framework document and agree on specific areas of cooperation for Russia to join "Partnership for Peace." "Now Russia needs to decide who and when will sign the framework document," the Russian diplomat said. Commenting on the combat jets shot down this morning, Churkin said the Bosnian government had been in great amazement when the Russian Foreign Ministry asked it for explanations. "Bosnian planes had no need to bomb Travnik as it is an area of clashes between Croatians and Moslems," Churkin was quoted as saying. However, "whoever it was who flew above Bosnia, he violated a resolution of the UN Security Council and bears the entire responsibility for what happened," the deputy minister noted.
