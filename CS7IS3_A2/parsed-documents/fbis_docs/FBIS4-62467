Answering a question from a UNIAN correspondent on whether the decision to run in the presidential election on 26 June is final, Leonid Kravchuk said: "I would like the Supreme Council to consider my appeal. If it postpones the election, I will withdraw my candidature; if the decision by the previous parliament remains in force, I will run in the presidential election." "If the election, nonetheless, does take place, who of the other contenders for the post of president would you regard as a possible rival?", asked the UNIAN correspondent. Leonid Kravchuk replied: "It is difficult to say this. The main contenders, who have made a good showing and who have the appropriate image are Ivan Plyushch and Leonid Kuchma. I know that certain circles like young contenders Valeriy Babych and Volodymyr Lanovyy. Oleksandr Moroz and Petro Talanchuk are also taking an active part in the election. That is to say, I would not like to distinguish anyone -- everyone has his chance and time will show who takes advantage of it."
