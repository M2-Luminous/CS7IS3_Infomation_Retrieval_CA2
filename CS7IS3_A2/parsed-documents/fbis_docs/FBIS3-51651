This document will be submitted to international organizations with a view to having ethnic differences respected and defended, as this is the only way in which different cultures can coexist in the present times. Miguel Chase Sardi [anthropologist and former head of the National Indian Affairs Institute] said "this is a note of warning that was sounded precisely a few days prior to the events that took place in Chiapas, during which local indigenous communities were brutally repressed. Here we requested what we have been requesting since 1970, namely that indigenous communities be granted self- government and self-determination. This will not entail the destruction of the state. Actually, for a state to flourish it must necessarily be multiracial and pluralist as far as culture and language are concerned. We are very pleased to note that our Constitution fairly comes up to that idea." Despite this Chase Sardi later said that it is to be regretted that the law is known but is not observed. The most salient points of the document signed by social researchers, anthropologists, and intellectuals underscores that the letter of intent was drafted because they are "witnesses in each of our countries to reiterated violations of the right to life, to dignity, and to the cultural and human environment in their local manifestations." This lengthy document further stresses that "in the same way that each ethnic group was forced over centuries to integrate and adhere to the unspecified advantages of an ill-defined national life, the same mandatory proposal is at present made to Latin American countries to join and integrate themselves into a world order controlled by a multinational oligopoly." They claim that democracy as a philosophy of a Western social system revolves around the individual, and excludes the communities of indigenous peoples. They call upon Latin American rulers to keep the promise made to indigenous peoples in the Guadalajara Declaration of 1971, when they solemnly pledged to ensure their economic and social welfare as well as respect their rights and cultural identities. At present the spotlight of international criticism is focused precisely on Mexico, where the treaty was signed, because of the inhumane treatment of indigenous communities in Chiapas. Concerning this Miguel Angel Fernandez, a writer, wrote a letter which, if the necessary signatures are collected, will be sent to Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, petitioning him "to put an end to the military repression (and in general all cultural, economic, political, or social repression and oppression) in Chiapas, and to establish the necessary basis for a fair and free coexistence among all ethnic groups." The letter concludes by expressing solidarity with the indigenous people of Chiapas.
