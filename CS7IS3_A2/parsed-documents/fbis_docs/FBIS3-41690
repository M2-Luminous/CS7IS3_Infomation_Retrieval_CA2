This was reported to Interfax in Moscow's main medical administration. One of the patients is a vagrant who is in satisfactory condition at the moment. The second patient is a female medical worker infected by him. Physicians assess her condition as ``average severity without signs of worsening.'' In addition to these two patients, ambulance teams and internal affairs authorities have sent 10 persons who had been in contact with the patients to Moscow infectious disease hospitals. As administration workers confirm, the threat of a cholera epidemic for Moscow is no rarity. Each year, patients infected in other countries are present in the city. In all cases, medical personal have succeeded in localizing the focus and avoiding any consequences for the city. The ``Osoboopasniki'' ``Cholera,'' said Tamara Ivanovna with enthusiasm, ``is so beautiful!'' and stepped away from the microscope. Tamara Ivanovna heads the laboratory of highly dangerous infections in the Moscow City Center of the Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight [Note: ``highly dangerous'' is the English equivalent of osoboopasnyy, which is the word from which osoboopasniki (persons working with highly dangerous diseases) is derived]. Working under her are several women who are not very young. Their sphere of activity is plague, cholera, tularemia, anthrax, and other scourges of mankind. The scourges, it is true, sit quietly in Petri dishes (more is smeared on saucers) fixed to the bottom by something yellow. After handling the dishes, you rub your hands carefully with pure alcohol, however. In critical cases, when it is necessary to process entire sacks of infected rodents, the women dress in complete antiplague suits: rubber overshoes, long gowns with ties instead of buttons, gloves, masks, and goggles. In the laboratory there is silence (most of the people are not on leave) and remarkable cleanliness. The latter is due to the efforts of the sole elderly female medical orderly. There should be six on staff, but there are is only half the physicians and laboratory workers needed (3 and 3 instead of 6 and 6). And all of them clean their own offices and valuable laboratory. At one time, the laboratory was a privileged place. Associates received a 20 percent raise their second year of work here, a 30 percent raise their third year, and a 40 percent raise in subsequent years. For this reason, it was mostly women who had to keep their relatives who became ``osoboopasniki.'' And it is just such women who work here now, even though the privileges have long since become only a memory: They only received their salaries for May and June (20,000-30,000 rubles each) in July. A Strike as a Means of Easing the Soul I saw Tamara Ivanovna for the first time in the reception room of Moscow's chief public health physician. ``This is the third time I have come,'' she complained to the secretary. ``I wait and wait and I leave. One hundred thousand indeed, it's a joke!'' It is being demanded that T.I. pay 100,000 for a minor repair in the laboratory. For both her and the chief physician, this is big money that they simply do not have. And how! Only 8 of the 55 million rubles needed for major repair of the Moscow Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has been allocated, and of the 37 million rubles needed for equipment, they only gave 1.4. T.I., feeling sorry for the chief physician like a woman, dragged out the moment of signing the paper with an enormous figure -- 100,000. Since April, the Moscow City Sanitary-Epidemiological Station has not paid for its electricity -- there is no money. From time to time, the Moscow Regional Power Administration phones the chief physician and threatens to cut off the electricity. ``You might get cracking!'' answers chief physician Filatov. For now, the Moscow Regional Power Administration is putting itself in his position, but who knows what will happen from one month to the next. ``And indeed I cannot stop. I cannot tell the mother of a child who became ill in the Pioneer camp that I have no gasoline to go to him.'' Because of a lack of money, 10 district sanitary-epidemiological stations and the Moscow city center nearly went on strike. In any event, they convened a strike committee, organized a meeting, and invited a person from the ``higher-ranking body'', i.e., the Russian Federation State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, to it. The guest heard in silence that the sanitary-epidemiological station laboratory assistant in the Southern district earns 8,000 a month, that each day he can only buy a loaf of bread and carton of milk, that that costs 6,000, and that for his 8,000 the laboratory assistant performs up to 500 diptheria analyses daily. They say there was a deathly silence in the room and a resounding shout on the platform. Almost no one seriously intended to strike, however. Chief physician Filatov told me this even before the strike committee meeting. Moreover, one of the district sanitary-epidemiological stations that stopped operating was threatened with general discharge. The most interesting thing is that the threat worked -- evidently, the one who wanted to leave had already left. In 2 years, the sanitary-epidemiological station system has shriveled by half: Only 42 percent of its schedule-stipulated staff now work in it. The epidemiologists have found jobs at rayon polyclinics, where they earn twice as much. Would it be difficult to create the sanitary-epidemiological station system anew? Filatov, an epidemiologist by education, thinks, ``I only felt like a specialist 5 years after beginning to work. That is, beyond all the papers and figures, I see the cause of this epidemiologic situation or that.'' Laboratory Life Tamara Ivanovna did not speak at the meeting. I spoke with her several days later. ``Across from us are a produce center and a rubbish heap located so that, from our window, I can see when and what they throw out...At first, I let it pass, but then I watched. It was as if something appeared on the table near my associates. They cut up a rotten cucumber and ate it, and they brought it to their children, if only for some vitamins. And I closed my eyes...And they invited me, ``Take some Tamara Ivanovna.'' I could not take it from them''. ``We must earn money somehow. One instance of this is enough,'' I said carefully, ``we must introduce paid services.'' ``Yes, in many sanitary-epidemiological station laboratories (let us say in those where they perform AIDS tests) it is possible to perform contract jobs and receive a total of 100,000-200,000 each.'' ``But we are the osoboopasniki. How can I take money from someone because he is suspected of having tularemia? The Moscow hospitals that have reached agreements with the Moscow Municipal Sanitary-Epidemiological Station pay 700 rubles per analysis, of which the laboratory receives 25 percent. But in the past few years, despite this ``very ridiculous price,'' the hospitals have been trying to get by without this ``luxury'' and have cut the number of patients screened to a tenth.'' ``In one quarter the laboratory earned 10,000 rubles for such analyses.'' ``And finally,'' says T.I., ``I let all this money go on ``charity'' dinners. The little girls buy bread and preserves. We have a kitchen here...'' The ``little girls'' are actually not very fortunate women who have sick husbands or parents and who sweep for themselves and others. One of them, a mother of two small children, asks T.I. for leave and collects and sells bottles. T.I. permits it even though she generally does not forgive even a minute's tardiness or early departure: ``We must not slack off, we are osoboopasniki.'' But she hardly needs to tell her small group of people. Judge for yourself. A man who just flew into Moscow yesterday turned up at the hospital with a suspicion of cholera. If the ``osoboopasniki'' give a positive answer, the operations section of the sanitary-epidemiological station (also, moreover, women who are not even between 30 and 40 years of age but increasingly of retirement age) will seek out all persons who came into contact with the patient in Moscow and all those who flew in the same aircraft with it, no matter where in the former Union they may be. A round-the-clock watch will be established, and infinite analyses will begin. ``They simply forget that they have families and children -- indeed, this is cholera! In the morning, after a sleepless night, after having seen that the others can't manage, these women voluntarily remain for a second day. And sometimes I ask everything of them. They are simple irreplaceable people.'' They are truly downright irreplaceable. In any case, no one is dying to be an ``osoboopasnik.'' I well understand those who after having called in response to one of the advertisements Tamara Ivanovna has taped up (``Urgent Need for Physicians, Laboratory Assistants, Medical Orderlies''), quickly excuse themselves and hang up after hearing that they must deal with those things that are most repulsive to women -- strange diseases, mice, and the smallest of salaries. ``To not smell the smell of decaying mice, burn the cotton wadding, but vomit anyway. Imagine, there stand dozens of deliveries with hidden rodents, and in every little carcass the heart, liver, lymph nodes, and bone marrow must be found. One must be a very healthy person to perform such work.'' T.I. also began as a laboratory assistant. ``I have always said: When my nerves are at their breaking point, I will return to the laboratory. I would very much like to leave management and work there with the rank and file. But there is no one left besides me. As soon as I earned my pension, I went to Shestopalov (the former chief physician) with my notice, and he said to me, ``You what?! We are rebuilding the laboratory...'' ``And now it has been rebuilt -- and it is a pity to quit: this laboratory is beautiful. And the office! My former office was not a separate office. They were all in one room...But there is a great deal of work, and it is always like being on a powder keg. And it is very difficult to hold a collective in hand.'' ``How are you able to do it?'' ``Truly, the conscientiousness of my workers helps. And then, my strength is some sort of authority. I can win. I tell them: ``We are comrades not self-seekers, not businessmen but medical workers.''
