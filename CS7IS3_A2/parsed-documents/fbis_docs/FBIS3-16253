This time the "world gendarme" has opted for "concern" over the alleged nuclear threat from North Korea as the reason for attacking an independent socialist state. The DPRK has taken a firm and resolute stance. Recently there was a meeting between DPRK and U.S. delegations at which this question was discussed. What was its outcome? We put this question to North Korean Ambassador to Russia Comrade Son Song-pil. [Son] We were able to elaborate an accord on four points: the cessation of the "Team Spirit-94" military exercises near the Korean border; the start of International Atomic Energy Authority inspections at our facilities; the resumption of the meeting of representatives from North and South on questions of exchanging special envoys; and the holding of a third round of Korean-American talks in Geneva, starting on 21 March 1994. By and large we are satisfied with these decisions. But there was a strongly negative reaction to them on the part of Japan and South Korea. They are attempting to wreck the negotiating process. [Turchenko] What are the reasons for this approach? [Son] Japan already has stocks of 26 tonnes of plutonium. By 2010 they are forecast to reach 100 tonnes. This is enough to make 10,000 nuclear bombs. In February Japan launched a large long-range missile, the "H-2," which could be used to deliver a nuclear weapon. A similar situation exists in South Korea. It started developing nuclear weapons back in the seventies, and it has now entered a very significant stage. Both these countries need to be constantly grumbling about the imaginary nuclear problem in the DPRK in order to be able to continue their own developments. [Turchenko] In connection with the Korean-American talks there was a report on Russian television to the effect that the DPRK had allegedly somewhat relaxed its resolve to steadfastly follow the path of building socialism, and a statement by the supreme leadership on a switch to Chinese-style reforms was supposedly expected in the very near future. What comment can you make on this? [Son] It is sheer disinformation. We have established and will develop our own style of socialist system.
