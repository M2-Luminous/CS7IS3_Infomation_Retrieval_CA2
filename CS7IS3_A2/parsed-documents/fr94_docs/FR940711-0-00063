ACTION: Final rule; approval of amendment. SUMMARY: OSM is approving, with an additional requirement, a proposed amendment to the Utah permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposes revisions to its rules pertaining to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation of rules, petitions to initiate rulemaking, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality of coal exploration information, permit application requirements pertaining to blasting and hydrology, and mining in special areas, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. The amendment incorporates the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarifies ambiguities, and improves operational efficiency. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 11, 1994.
