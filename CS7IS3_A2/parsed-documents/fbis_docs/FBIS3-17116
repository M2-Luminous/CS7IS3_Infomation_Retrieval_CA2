The EC expert group at the negotiations was led by Fikion Fotiadis, who heads the directorate for relations with newly independent nations other than Russia. Mr. Makarenko told journalists that as a result of the negotiations Ukraine's agreement with the EC was finalized and coordinated with European Commission experts. According to him, the initialling of this agreement signifies a practical step by Ukraine toward integration in the EC. He said that the success of the negotiations was helped by the extension of the European Commission's mandate for negotiations with Ukraine approved by the EC Council of Ministers on 7 March. The draft agreement was technically initialled at the level of experts on 18 March, Mr. Makarenko said. It is due to be officially initialled on 23 March, during Anatoliy Zlenko's visit to Brussels. It is planned that the agreement will be signed by the president of Ukraine in May-June this year. The agreement is a detailed, comprehensive document stipulating the conditions for political, economic, trade, and humanitarian cooperation between Ukraine and the EEC. As soon as it takes effect, Ukraine will be exempt from quantitative trade restrictions (except for textiles, metallurgical products, and nuclear components). Under the agreement, Ukraine undertakes certain obligations, such as to pursue market reforms. The participants at the briefing stressed that the content of the document puts to shame those who said Europe does not need Ukraine. Oleksandr Makarenko said that Ukraine and the European Commission will start talks in 1998 on including Ukraine in the free trade zone.
