Cheap imported maritime products have been gobbling up the French market, prompting Paris to draw up a list of a handful of countries outside the European Union that can continue selling such goods. Only five countries, including Argentina and Canada, had been put on the list publicized in February. Seoul had an existing agreement with France on fisheries exports effective until January next year but was excluded from the list, the ministry said. The French government belatedly added eight more countries, including South Korea, Thailand and Singapore, to the list carried in its gazette March 26, it said. South Korean exports of maritime products to France, which reached $21.9 million in 1991, decreased to $14.4 million in 1992 and $10.8 million last year, according to the Seoul government's statistics.
