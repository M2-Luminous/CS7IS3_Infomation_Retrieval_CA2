The result showed that new changes had taken shape in the development of Heilongjiang's individual and private economies. The number and the scale were continuously increasing and expanding. By the end of 1993, Heilongjiang's individual industrial and commercial household businesses had totaled 517,500, and their registered funds 4.19 billion yuan, up 23.1 and 61.8 percent, respectively, from the preceding year. In terms of the number of the individual industrial and commercial household businesses, Heilongjiang's ranking rose from 15th to 13th in the country, and each household business had 6,304 yuan of funds in average, higher than the national average of 4,838 yuan. The number of private enterprises totaled 3,595 in Heilongjiang, up 120 percent from the preceding year. In 1993, Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises paid 796 million yuan of taxes and created 3.65 billion yuan in output value, up 35 and 62.2 percent, respectively, from 1992. People employed by individual enterprises have reached 810,000 so far. Another change in Heilongjiang's individual and private economies was one from the unitary structure to diverse development. Heilongjiang's individual and private enterprises used to have very unitary structure, with most them engaged in commerce and catering trade. The unitary structure has been changing since last year. First, the enterprises were developing toward the processing industry and the scientific and technological field. According to statistics, individual and private enterprises engaged in production and scientific and technological development totaled 180 last year. Second, individual household businesses increased by 30,955 in rural areas in 1993, up 29.7 percent from the preceding year. In Zhaozhou county alone, 1,696 individual enterprises were established last year, of which 84.2 percent were in rural areas. Third, a number of specialized villages emerged. According to statistics of Daqing city, over 100 specialized villages were established, which also achieved good economic efficiency. Judging from the measures of management, Heilongjiang's individual industrial and commercial enterprises were marching toward cooperation and have created a situation of specialized production and operation. Heilongjiang's private enterprises also became dissatisfied with exclusively invested, joint, or limited liability companies. They were developing toward the direction of shareholding group companies and joint operation. In Harbin city alone, four private enterprise groups have been established. The survey also showed improved quality in the people working at individual and private enterprises. A considerable number of them were technical personnel, retired personnel, personnel on leave without pay, and incumbent personnel moonlighting. Take Harbin for example. Over 50 percent of the personnel of private enterprises had a senior high school education level, of whom a large part had a college education level or higher.
