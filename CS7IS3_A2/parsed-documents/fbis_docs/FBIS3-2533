He said: We again gather in Beijing to attend the annual NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings to discuss the state's affairs and policies, to consult with each other, and to exercise supervision over the government's work. This year's NPC and CPPCC National Committee meetings will be held at a time when the country's reform and opening up are entering a crucial stage. The Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year laid down the objective of quickening the step of building a socialist market economic system; against this background, I hope you would speak freely to make more contributions toward ensuring rapid economic development in a sustained and healthy manner, to preserving political stability, and ensuring Hong Kong's prosperity, stability, and stable transition. Whatever problems Hong Kong may encounter in the future, we have confidence that we can properly handle Hong Kong's affairs. Ann Tse Kai, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee; and He Houhua, a NPC deputy from Macao, also spoke at the banquet. They said in the new year they will closely cooperate with the mainland and will continue to work for the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. The banquet was presided over by Wang Zhaoguo, vice chairman of the CPPCC National Committee.
