For five days, foreign ministers from 34 countries of this hemisphere gathered at the Amazon city of Belem do Para to discuss two issues that centered the debates: finding a peaceful solution to the Haitian crisis and creating a common market for free trade in South America. Other issues that weighed on the OAS foreign ministers' agenda were issues that range from hemispheric security to the risks of collapse that democracies of this region are faced with due to a social uprising which is motivated by extreme poverty. From the very beginning of the assembly, a topic which was not included on the agenda occupied the attention of Joao Baena Soares, outgoing secretary general of the OAS, and Brazilian Pesident Itamar Franco. We are referring to the demand of Cuba's reincorporation into the OAS. In that sense, the call by Baena Soares and Franco was expressed to examine the possiblility of Cuba's reintegration. Baena's exhortation immediately opened a debate in which Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, and Venezuela pronounced themselves in favor of finding a formula that would put an end to Cuba's isolation in the OAS. But, once again, U.S. arrogance was felt when it said there first had to be political reforms on this island that would merit the approval of the U.S. Government. While this was taking place at the OAS General Assembly, dozens of demonstrators gathered in front of the Teatro de la Paz to demand the end of the U.S. economic blockade on Cuba. The U.S. representation was unable to stop the insistent demand.
