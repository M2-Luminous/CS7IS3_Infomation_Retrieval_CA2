The 1.4-sq-km zone near this capital of south China's Guangdong Province is one of the 13 free trade zones approved by the State Council to be set up across the country. So far, almost all the land in the zone for financial and trade activities, warehouses and processing of export products has been sold. The officials said that the zone is the first in the country to permit solely foreign-funded enterprises to take overall charge of land development and introducing projects. By the end of last year the zone had put large sums of money into improving the zone's basic facilities, and this year, ten infrastructure projects will be completed or start construction with regard to commodity show places, quays, goods examination sites, electric power projects and office buildings.
