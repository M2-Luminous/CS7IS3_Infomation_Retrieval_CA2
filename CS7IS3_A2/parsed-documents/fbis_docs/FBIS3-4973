Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, however, defended differences of opinion as "awkward" but underlined the unity of the coalition during questioning at a meeting of the special committee on political reform in the House of Councillors. "It is fate that we make our decisions while maintaining and worrying about the delicate balance between the eight parties," said Hosokawa. "Even though it is a bit awkward, each party believes in upholding the unity of the coalition," he said. Hosokawa's remarks and the challenge from Kono and the LDP came in the wake of the prime minister's decision to give up reshuffling his cabinet. "The prime minister said he wanted to form an economic reform cabinet, but he couldn't do this since they couldn't reach a consensus (within the coalition) on economic reform," Kono said. "If political reform is realized, the mission of the cabinet will be completed," said Kono. He further criticized the coalition, saying, "this is not the time for a power game. They should be thinking more about the welfare of the nation and the lives of the people." Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said it was "very regrettable" that cabinet reform had apparently been intended to remove him from his position as top government spokesman. Takemura has openly differed with Hosokawa over economic policies including a bombshell proposal by the prime minister to install a 7 percent national welfare tax in place of the current 3 percent consumption tax as part of the budget package for the next fiscal year. Takemura acknowledged there were reasons for the talk of his removal, saying, "rather than handing in my resignation, I will continue to do my best with a new attitude." Takemura told reporters he decided not to attend a general meeting of his party, Sakigake (Harbinger), so as to draw a clear line between his roles as party leader and chief cabinet secretary. "I will be more careful so as not to be misunderstood," he told a news conference. Asked about his future relations with Hosokawa, Takemura said he and the premier had held discussions on seven or eight occasions and reaffirmed that they will remain friends as before. "We agreed to maintain our friendship and I have no apprehensions about this." He also noted he will try to stay more in touch and exchange views more often with Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, the two forces that backed Hosokawa's plan for a cabinet reshuffle centering on the removal of Takemura as chief of staff. Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama, head of the coalition's largest faction, told the party's central committee that he wanted to see the SDP assume responsibility for strengthening the coalition administration. "What is urgently needed is to get the budget through the Diet, since we have responsibility to respond to the people's expectations," Murayama said. Keigo Ouchi, head of the Democratic Socialist Party, sounded an optimistic note in calling for coalition unity, "we have avoided antagonism within the cabinet and the government. "The storm is over and clear weather is coming, but it is important to maintain a singleness of purpose in the coalition parties from now on."
