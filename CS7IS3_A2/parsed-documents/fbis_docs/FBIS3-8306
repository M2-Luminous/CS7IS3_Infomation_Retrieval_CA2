And everybody can buy them, no matter whether he is a foreigner or a Macedonian." In a lecture at the Austrian Economic Chamber, Jane Miljovski, privatization minister of the Yugoslav successor republic Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], was looking for helpers on the difficult path into an economic future. Currently, Macedonia is suffering from the UN sanctions against what remains of Yugoslavia and from the crumbling of Yugoslavia as a whole: In the past, 70 percent of Macedonian exports went to the other Yugoslav republics, 60 percent of that to Serbia; now deliveries to Serbia are prohibited by the UN sanctions. Goods that are exported elsewhere can be brought to their destination only with great difficulties: The roads lead through the rump Yugoslavia, which is closed to transit, or though Greece, which has closed its borders to its small neighbor. With this, Athens wants to force Macedonia to change the name of its state. Privatization Has Started Miljovski explains that the new privatization law has been in force just for three months and has not yet had a great effect. About 1,400 companies are to be transferred from "social" to private ownership. Generally, a buyer for 51 percent of the companies searched first. With this it is intended to make sure that the company is taken over by a responsible owner and is managed with an orientation toward profits and that there are no speculations. In Skopje, it is known that the domestic savings assets cover only about 10 percent of the value of the companies. Therefore, the state wants to lend the owner 41 percent of the company's value for five years, if the new owner fulfills two conditions: He must create jobs and pay taxes. Skopje is also aware of the fact that foreign investors are not particularly lining up to buy, because the infrastructure -- high rents, bad telephone lines, a lack of electricity, to give just a few examples -- is still a few steps away from European standards even though improvements are underway. Foreign trading partners also complain that Slovenia can export self-imported goods to Macedonia practically without customs duties -- in contrast to that, the other countries have to overcome very high customs barriers. Miljovski explains that this is due to the UN request not to erect any trade barriers for the ex-Yugoslav area during the search for peace. The discrepancy will certainly be abolished soon, Miljvoski says.
