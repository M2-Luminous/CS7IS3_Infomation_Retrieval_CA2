Now, for the first time, the force of argument has won." This was his comment on the new Croat-Muslim federation that was negotiated in Washington over the past four days. It is a very Yugoslav pact. It creates hope where there was sheer desperation only yesterday. It made peace between parties that were bloody enemies only yesterday. And, going by the bitter experience of the past years, it should be worthless even before the ink has dried. But however much past experience may suggest the opposite, there is a ray of fresh hope after the latest agreement between Croats and Muslims. The reason: This peace has a different dimension. For the first time in this conflict the United States was the guardian and director of a pact. And the part that the long-missed world power can play in this becomes clear by the two-week silence of the Sarajevo guns. There is no doubt: The plan for a new federation in Bosnia is an agreement full of snags and weaknesses. Its major problem: It cannot succeed without the approval of the Serbs, who are demanded to return occupied territories. This is exactly the point where Russia comes in as the second great director of the plan beside the United States. Only the Russians are in a position to pressure the Serbs effectively and to convince them that any resistance to this plan would lead them into isolation. What was signed in Washington is not only a great challenge to the Serbs. It is a first test for the Russians and Boris Yeltsin regarding their future role in this conflict and the efficiency of their new activities in world politics. In short: The key to solving the Bosnia crisis now lies with Moscow.
