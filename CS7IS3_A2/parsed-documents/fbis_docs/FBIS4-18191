Indeed, the country has been granted a reduction of its public debt by the Paris Club, which includes various Western creditors. Thus the Cameroon public debt is being rescheduled in accordance with the so-called London terms, which are the most favorable conditions that the Paris Club can grant. Norbert Navaro reports: [Begin Navaro recording] It is the first time that Cameroon has been granted a collective reduction of its debt. This debt totals 45 billion French francs, equivalent to 4.5 billion CFA francs. Two-thirds of this sum make up Cameroon's public debt, the only one the Paris Club is interested in. The Paris Club has granted preferential treatment to Yaounde. Like Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon is one of the four countries with a so-called intermediary income in the franc zone. The two others are Congo and Gabon. Until Cote d'Ivoire set a precedent last Friday [25 March], the annulment of 50 percent of debts was granted to the poorest countries only. The Paris Club is only concerned with little less than 900 billion CFA francs of Cameroon's debt on this occasion. This corresponds to the financial commitments that were not honored in the past, plus those that will come up in the next 18 months -- this is the duration of the agreement between Yaounde and the IMF which was reached on 15 March. Fifty percent of a small part of these 900 billion CFA francs will be annulled, and the remainder will be spread over 23 years. The Paris Club was admittedly more generous with Cote d'Ivoire last Friday, but this unprecedented -- and unexpected -- help toward Cameroon comes in addition to the annulment of a debt worth 400 billion CFA francs granted by France to Dakar on 12 January, the date of the devaluation.
