Last year we conscientiously implemented central plans on strengthening macroregulation and control, centralized actions, worked concertedly, and achieved positive results in solving outstanding contradictions and problems caused by rapid economic development. For this year, strengthening macroregulation and control over fixed-assets investment and strictly controlling the scale of infrastructure projects will be the two most important areas of work in service of the overall endeavor. Judging from last year, when excessively rapid growth in investment resulted in credit and monetary crunches, shortages of transport, energy, and raw materials, and triggered off new debt deferrals and defaults, if the growth of fixed-assets investment is not put under strict control this year, all sectors will be stretched to their limits, which will lead eventually to drastic fluctuations in the national economy. If that happens, this will work against the smooth implementation of many reformist measures this year, healthy economic development, the effort to curb inflation, and expanding opening up, and will cause us to lose the historic opportunity we often talk about. We can say that strict controls over the scale of fixed-assets investment is the key to the smooth implementation of this year's reforms, healthy economic development, social stability, and curbing inflation. Strengthening macroregulation and control does not mean halting development and doing away with the market economy. It is wrong to set macroregulation and control against the market economy or economic development. We must not think that strengthening macroregulation and control necessarily means a slowing down of economic development, or vice versa. Only under effective state macroregulation and control can the market economy properly play its vital role of allocating resources and ensuring the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. No market economy in any country in the world today is not under government regulation and control. Under the new pattern of multiple investment bodies and diversified financing, it is highly necessary to not only promptly strengthen macroregulation and control, but also to exercise macroregulation and control over investment with economic, legal, and essential administrative means. To establish a restraining and risk mechanism for fixed-assets investment, the central authorities have decided that, as of this year, the scale of loans for infrastructure facilities and key industrial infrastructure projects will be put under the centralized arrangements of the newly established State Development Bank. This is an important reform, but it is not possible to immediately put the scale of investment under control with the new mechanism. Therefore, in view of the present situation, it is still necessary to adopt multiple methods simultaneously: First, the focus of work must be genuinely shifted to structural adjustment and raising efficiency. It is absolutely impermissible to again make the same mistake of single-mindedly competing for investment, launching projects, and expanding the scale in defiance of objective conditions. Localities and departments must all adopt effective measures to strengthen macroregulation and control over investment and to concentrate their financial powers and materials on key projects. Second, reprioritize projects under construction to ensure that key projects are completed. Projects completed and key operational support projects, infrastructure facilities, and infrastructure industrial projects must also obey state centralized planning and rational layout, observe the principle of high rates of efficiency and working within one's ability, concentrate on one single project at a time, and avoid blind and repetitive projects. Third, prevent continued expansion of the scale of construction, strictly scrutinize new projects, and hold the units and leaders concerned accountable for construction work launched without authorization. Fourth, strengthen controls over the supply of funds. Tighten the management of credit for fixed-assets investment. The banking sector must strictly enforce the investment loan plan, and financial institutions are forbidden from lending for fixed-assets investment with funds obtained from bank discounts. Fifth, strengthen the standardized management of the capital market. The scale of bond issues and the scope of joint-stock experiments cannot be expanded without proper authorization. Sixth, tighten the management of property developments and development zones, incorporating investment in and loans for property development and construction into the state fixed-assets investment and loan plan. Also, we must strengthen guidance and standardized management of projects funded by direct foreign investment, and genuinely strengthen leadership over macroregulation and control over investment. Reform and development this year has a heavy agenda. It is highly significant to pursue this year's economic work well. Therefore, we must comprehensively and correctly analyze the times and the situation and exploit them, be clear-headed, good at promptly identifying and solving new problems caused by progress, particularly prevent an expansion of investments, genuinely strengthen macroregulation and control over investment, and create even more favorable conditions for reform, development, and stability.
