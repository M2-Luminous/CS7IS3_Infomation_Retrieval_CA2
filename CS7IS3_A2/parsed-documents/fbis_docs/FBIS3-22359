This conclusion was published by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) in its recent weekly report. The Federal Government's objectives for fighting the greenhouse effect can only be achieved through a "comprehensive bunch of measures," particularly a "sizable" increase in the price of fossil energy through higher taxes and rates. After all, by taking inflation into account, the current prices of some energy sources are hardly higher than 20 years ago. It is Bonn's declared objective to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Germany between 25 and 30 percent by the year 2005 -- in relation to 1987. The DIW estimates that approximately 721 million tonnes of carbon dioxide were emitted in western Germany in 1993, which even constitutes a slight increase over 1987. In eastern Germany, however, emissions have been halved since then and are now at a level of about 170 million tonnes -- mainly as a result of the "economic slump there." The DIW criticizes that the "Federal Government's ambitious objective" is inconsistent with "the activities it initiated." While the government announced a considerably stricter insulation regulation, it finally "only adopted a much weaker version of it." What is missing is "a comprehensive promotion by the state" of "measures for the economical use of energy" and a policy of "avoiding transport and shifting transport to systems that are more energy-efficient." In addition, the DIW complains, the Federal Government is not ready to become active at a national level in anticipation of a European carbon dioxide/energy tax. This would result in competitive disadvantages in the short term but prevent "a major adaption shock in the future."
