Shieh, governor of the Central Bank of China (CBC), said Saturday [9 April]. "The willingness was repeatedly expressed when central bank governors of major Southeast Asian countries met here earlier this week," Shieh said. The participants, he stressed, had been deeply impressed by Taiwan's dynamic economy during three days of discussions. Central bank governors from the forums's nine member states -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Nepal and the host ROC -- participated in the discussions April 6-8 about how to promote regional financial cooperation. Cambodia, Fiji, Laos, and Tonga also attended the event as observers. With the economic and trade ties between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries growing closer, strengthening of financial cooperation is necessary, Shieh said. As to complaints of financial investment barriers set by Southeast Asian countries, he said those countries are already pushing for the easing of restrictions on the establishment of branches by foreign banks. ROC investment in Southeast Asia totals around US$16.5 billion, making Taiwan a major capital supplier to the region. The central bank governors exchanged views on topics ranging from international currency cooperation, world economic reports, currency policies of the countries in the region, foreign exchange management and financial outlooks. The forum, a government-level regional financial cooperation organization founded in 1966, will meet in Nepal next year.
