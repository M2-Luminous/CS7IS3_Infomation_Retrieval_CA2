Its initiative core is headed by Vasyl Durdynets, a newly elected deputy and formerly the deputy head of the Ukrainian Supreme Council of the previous, twelfth convocation. Considering that a rather "motley" public has come to "power" and that it probably will not be easy to find a common language for all, the idea of an apparently unifying "Center" is rather attractive and is very much needed in our current conditions. In order to learn about the Center in detail and firsthand, I met with Vasyl Vasylyovych Durdynets. Our conversation was democratic, friendly, and, of course, candid. First, it was pleasant to learn that Vasyl Vasylyovych respects UKRAYINSKA HAZETA; second, I encountered a true patriot of the Ukrainian state. Over the four years of its work, said my esteemed interlocutor, the Supreme Council adopted 402 laws and 1,108 decrees. This is a considerable volume of work. But people appraise it, of course, not by the numbers but by the way these documents are being implemented and are working to strengthen the economy, legality, and law and order, for the social good of the people, especially their security and standard of living. To be honest, in making decisions on many problems the former membership of the Supreme Council unfortunately gave preference to corporate, departmental, regional, and political interests rather than being guided by the interests of all the people. Of course, pulling the blanket to one side this way could not benefit the entire society. It would be wrong to continue such a practice... Out of such considerations, the Center deputy group was set up within the structure of our new parliament. It unites the deputies who have come to the Supreme Council to do constructive work. This strong, and, as was to be expected, centrist bloc can take upon itself the main constructive lawmaking activities. [Skoryna] How? [Durdynets] How? First, on the basis of coordinating the positions of groups, factions, and individual deputies it can recommend candidates for the Supreme Council's permanent leadership bodies, the new government, work out coordinated proposals, and decide on principal all-state problems. Look, in the new parliament membership we have both the extreme left and the extreme right. In order to avoid rocking our already fragile state boat, we need a consolidating basis. The people elected us to finally adopt such laws as would work for their benefit, for the good of Ukraine. All of us without fail will have to make this happen. Our bloc is called "For Accord and Collaboration." When we achieve accord, we will have collaboration. If there is no accord between deputies of different political views, directions, and interests, there will be no constructive collaboration from the very first days of the work of the newly elected Supreme Council. By the way, why do I say "new convocation." There is currently an idea to call the current Supreme Council not the thirteenth but the first convocation. And I must say that there are all the grounds for this, as well as the legal basis. We are beginning a new count of the activities of the parliament of a new state, elected on the basis of new laws. [Skoryna] How do you form the membership of your group? What is required of a deputy who wants to participate in its activities? [Durdynets] A deputy may read the program, which clearly describes the group's goals and tasks, the conditions for joining it, and its organizational basis. If he agrees with all this, he submits an individual application indicating his surname, name and patronymic, and the electoral district he represents. However, if over time a deputy in his practical activities deviates from the obligations he undertook as part of becoming a member of our association, at the general meeting we will bring up the question of expelling him. Our work is built on democratic principles and openness, but elementary discipline and organization are also necessary. Without them, the group is not going to last long... [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, you and I remember well with what drive and how dynamically a group of deputies that functioned under the name People's Council began its work within the previous convocation of our parliament. Under the leadership of its inspirer, they stayed after plenary sessions, labored over new draft laws and initiative propositions until late at night, set the tone by their organization, purposefulness, by being specific in bringing up issues and preparing drafts of various documents. Just as persistently, they brought each undertaking to a logical end. After some time, however, the drive began to diminish, and deputies began to split from the group one after another. Will something like this not happen to the newly created group? [Durdynets] I hope that this will not happen. We are not dragging anyone to join by force. Here is the program. If it is in line with your own views, join in the work; if not--act at your own discretion. Once again, nobody wants to keep anyone in the group by force. But if you did agree to participate, then you have to work conscientiously. [Skoryna] That is, as I see it, by the very fact of joining the Center group a deputy once again reaffirms to his voters that he has come to the first parliament of independent Ukraine not to engage in empty talk or pursue some sort of personal political ambitions. That is, not so that he may show his face on television, but to do painstaking, purposeful work for the good of his electorate, and the good of the country. [Durdynets] Exactly. And we, on our part, assist members of our group in every way to gradually make good on their election pledges. This is important for the authority of the deputy and the Supreme Council. Voters can see, feel at their everyday level that a change for the better is not just voted for but is being implemented. And then he will know that his vote, his instructions to his deputy, do play a role in this. We need to work together to build an authority that will work for our independent state, and a state that will work for the people. [Skoryna] Vasyl Vasylyovych, I see in the list of the Center group persons of, one may say, diametrically opposite views. You have here Landyk and Zvyahilskyy, Yukhnovskyy and Pilipchuk, Zhulinskyy, Yavorivskyy, and others. Will this not be another attempt to harness to the same cart a swan, a crayfish, and a pike? Will these people be able to work in the same key? [Durdynets] I am convinced that they will because we at the Center are united by a common goal. Today the greatest problem for Ukraine is economic crisis. To overcome it, economists, jurists, industrial managers, political scientists, scholars, and government members must join forces. That is, all deputies who want and can work constructively on documents either submitted or initiated by us for the Supreme Council's consideration. That is why we did not invite people to the group individually--you, you, and you... We asked everyone who wants to work together, for instance, with Academician Yukhnovskyy, writer Yavorivskyy, the jurist brothers Kostytskyy... The people who have gathered here are specialists of different profiles, different political views. And I feel that they are united by a common constructive idea--building a strong independent state. For this we first need to build a strong economy, which will provide people with the ability to work better, earn more, and live better. This is the main point. Everything else is secondary. [Skoryna] I also think that it is time to free the Supreme Council of political battles and move them to political clubs, party meetings, newspapers, television, radio, and so on. We have had enough verbiage in 70 years. Otherwise it is like it happens in everyday life--a good housewife in an hour or two manages to milk a cow, feed the pig and the chickens, and cook borscht, while her neighbors have barely covered half the village in their gossip in the same time. So it is with us: Neighboring countries are striving to build their lives, while we are still trying to figure out where to go and what to do. Sometimes it is funny to watch all this, but more often it is sad. That is why we need to salute you and the deputies who urge their colleagues to get down to business. What concerns me and many Ukrainians is another "center," the one created in the parliament by the do-gooder Kuchma. What do you think about it, Vasyl Vasylyovych? I figure that every parliament may have different factions, but two centers... This is practiced only in soccer... [Durdynets] First, I would like to refrain from criticizing them. I think they have already realized this: They worked up so much publicity with their interregional reform bloc before the elections... Gatherings, meetings, conferences, and so on, and so forth. And how many deputy seats did they win? Only a few here and there. However, we will collaborate with them if they express willingness to unite on the basis of what I described above... And the foundation of everything is to put the interests of Ukraine first. Our colleague Volodymyr Lanovyy was at our meeting, for instance. He is putting together his own faction, but said that he intends to collaborate with us in the same bloc. Chornovil said the same. And the same goes for other faction leaders who understand the need to unite... [Skoryna] Please name the organizational core of your Center. [Durdynets] As you may have guessed, they are well-known figures--Ivan Plyushch, Ihor Yukhnovskyy, Valeriy Cherep, Mykola Zhulynskyy, Oleksandr Bandurka, Roman Shpek, Volodymyr Bortnyk. Mykola Surgay, Volodymyr Yavorivskyy, Anton Buteyko... we consult, coordinate our work... There is already a plan for the first session. In addition to pressing organizational matters, it is necessary, without wasting any time, to consider three sets of priority questions. They are: the way of extricating the country from the deep economic crisis (fundamental reform of the monetary-credit and tax system, taking under control foreign economic activities, issues of prices and price formation, privatization, and so on). Another set of issues is establishing order in the country: ridding the apparat of corrupt, bureaucratic elements; curbing speculation; and tough--and real, not just lip-service--suppression of crime. And the third is control. So that the laws and decrees of the Supreme Council work, are implemented, instead of remaining, as often happens, mere declarations. Our state is in such shape that we have no right to spend time on rallies, political quarrels, a tug-of-war. We have no time left for "rousing to action." Therefore, I appeal to my colleagues--people's deputies for whom our goals and views are not foreign, who set their sights on constructive activities and do not want to get bogged down in internal fights--to consolidate all forces for everyday painstaking, concentrated work. This what the people of Ukraine expect of the newly elected parliament.
