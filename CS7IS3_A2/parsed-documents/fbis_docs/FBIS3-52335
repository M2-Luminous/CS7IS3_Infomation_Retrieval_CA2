Israel has indeed been launching these campaigns since the announcement of the summit. Israel will continue to escalate these campaigns in a bid to besmirch Syria's position first and influence any possible results at the summit. AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's disinformation campaigns are not the first, nor will they be the last. It is a familiar method which gets tougher whenever Syria manages to defend all Arab rights. The paper asserts that Syria's stands, which stem from leader al-Asad's view of the nature of the Arab-Zionist conflict, are not likely to change. This is not meant as a hard-line approach, but is in line with Syria's concern about reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the region. The paper says: It is a fact in politics that whenever the enemy's attacks against you gets tougher, it is evidence of your sound position. Syria is in no need of any such evidence. In light of the historic leadership of President al-Asad, Syria knows exactly what it wants and this has become a deep-rooted approach that reflects the nation's conscience and aspirations. AL-BA'TH concludes: At any rate, the upcoming summit between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton will attract the attention of the world which pins high hopes on the summit. No matter how tough Israel's rabid campaigns against Syria get, they will not affect Syria's stands and convictions, especially since its policy does not know secrets and corridors.
