I have consulted Sir David Gillmore, Head of the Diplomatic Service, who wishes to associate himself with my remarks. In accordance with the Inquiry's wishes, I have given the Inquiry an advance copy of this statement. "In the course of this Inquiry, officials from the Home Civil Service and Diplomatic Service have provided you with a vast amount of evidence and testimony, both written and oral, on the matters under investigation. Of those who have provided either written or oral testimony, or both, many if not most have moved on to new posts and responsibilities since their involvement in the matters now under investigation, and their co-operation with the Inquiry has been a major additional burden for them to carry alongside their other duties. I should like to record here my gratitude and admiration for the way in which the Civil Service has met this task. I also draw attention to the meticulous way in which records were kept and preserved: without a clear audit trail, this Inquiry would have had no prospect of reaching the truth. "The task of assisting the Inquiry has been made more fraught and onerous by grossly distorted and prejudicial allegations in the media about the role of government and individuals, including civil servants, in these matters. While I make no criticism or complaint about the Inquiry's procedures, the absence of the restraints on comment about the course of proceedings which would apply in a court of law has permitted wild allegations and prejudging of issues in media reports. "I take just two examples about the subject matter of the Inquiry. One is the constant references, which have become common currency, to `arms sales to Iraq.' This has become known as the Arms to Iraq Inquiry. There were in fact no licences for the export of arms, that is lethal goods, issued by the British Government in this period. "The second is the references to Public Interest Immunity certificates as `gagging orders.' As the Inquiry is well aware, the effect of such certificates is no more than to put in the hands of the Court the decision whether the information covered by the certificates should be disclosed to the defence. "As regards comments on individuals I can use my own case as an example (though others have fared much worse). Even before I have given evidence to the Inquiry, there have been such scrapbook items as `The Butler did it,' `Cabinet chief linked to Iraqi gun cover-up' and `The trail of blood running through Whitehall in the wake of the arms to Iraq affair leads to the door of the Cabinet Secretary.' These are only examples of the general tone of coverage. "While I hope and believe that people do not give this sort of report more weight than it deserves, such prejudicial press comment has been distressing for individuals concerned, and for their families, colleagues and close friends. The victims are often middle ranking officials who could not have expected to be thrust into the limelight in the way in which they have. I see, for example, that there is a snide piece in Private Eye this week about my former Private Secretary who was mentioned in evidence last week and who has not had an opportunity to give her evidence to the Inquiry. They have been asked not to respond to the press and to leave the issues to be judged by the Inquiry. I would like here to thank them and their families publicly and most sincerely for their cooperation and forbearance. "I repeat that I neither make nor imply any criticisms of the procedures of this Inquiry but I register my concern and confidence, on behalf of the civil servants involved, that the Inquiry will in due course put the record straight and undo, so far as in its power, the damage which has been unfairly done to our system of government, to the reputation of the Civil Service and to individuals."
