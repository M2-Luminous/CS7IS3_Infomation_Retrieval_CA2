The Chinese agricultural sector used to export its products through the National Foreign Trade Corporation, but now the newly founded joint ventures have their own right and ability to trade on the international market. Mr. Tang has traveled overseas several times and has had direct talks with foreign traders. For him, the price and demand for natural pigments around the world is well in his mind. With China's opening policy, foreign-funded enterprises in agriculture are booming, which helps China's agriculture to catch up with international standards. The development of China's socialist market economy has brought China's agricultural products face to face with severe competition both on the domestic and foreign markets. The Chang Jiang River delta is a great grain producing area in China. Jiangsu Province is just located in this area. The province has made great efforts to introduce foreign funds to develop joint venture agricultural enterprises. Statistics up to the end of last year showed there were 600 such enterprises in the province, and the number was rising in the first quarter of this year. The characteristics distinguishing the development of Jiangsu's foreign-funded agricultural enterprises are: first, joint ventures' production has changed from agricultural product processing to both planting and raising, and service; second, cooperation has broadened from investors in Hong Kong and Taiwan to include those from Japan, the U.S., Australia and Europe; and third, the introduction of high-tech programs has increased, and the amount of investment become larger. The development of Jiangsu's joint venture agricultural enterprises shows the prospects of China's agricultural modernization. The new type of enterprises engage not only in producing and processing, but also in domestic and foreign trade, which means a break from the past in which producing and selling were separate. A convincing example is the development of a joint eel industry company in Dantu County of the province. The company used to be an eel raising pool. In 1988, it used 5 million dollars to build a 280,000-sq-m indoor and 3,000-mu (200,000-sq-m) outdoor eel raising pool. In the meantime, it set up an eel feed company, an eel roasting factory and a trade company jointly with Japanese, Shanghai and Guangdong companies. In such steps, it formed an enterprise system from raw materials to processing to sales. Now the company has fixed assets of 125 million yuan. The joint venture agricultural enterprises are closely connected with thousands of rural households. A food company in the port city of Lianyungang is such an example. It is a vegetable processing plant which has introduced 400 kinds of improved varieties of vegetable seeds. After testing, it organized farmers to plant these vegetables and offered seeds and technical services, with the farmers later selling the vegetables to the company according to contract. Now, the company exports about 80 million tons of vegetables annually. The introduction of improved crop seeds and advanced agricultural techniques from overseas has helped local farmers greatly in improving agriculture production and processing in order to compete on international market.
