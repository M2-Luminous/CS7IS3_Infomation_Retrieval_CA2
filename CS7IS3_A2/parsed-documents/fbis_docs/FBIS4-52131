[Kanda] I cannot be sure if world security improved following the end of the Cold War. If you look at the national conflicts in the former Soviet Union, you realize it is difficult to simply say the end of the Cold War between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, brought peace. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What kind of action do you think Japan can take to deal with North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development if Japan, the United States, and the ROK decide to take action without waiting for the UN Security Council's decision to impose sanctions against North Korea? [Kanda] One thing we must know is whether there is enough evidence to support the view that Japan, the United States, and the ROK will take action. We should not get carried away. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some members of the ruling coalition parties are saying Japan should attach importance to joint actions with the United States in dealing with the North Korean issue. [Kanda] Needless to say, we will adhere to UN resolutions, otherwise we will have no grounds for taking action. I do not know who in the ruling parties is saying this. However, I can say that, in the spirit of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan will fully cooperate with the United States. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you agree with the government's current interpretation of the Constitution regarding the right of collective self-defense? [Kanda] Japan should act within the scope of the Constitution. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the government may change its interpretation of the Constitution depending on the situation? [Kanda] The government may talk about new ways of thinking if the situation requires. It is possible the government may change its way of thinking to cope with the changing situation. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Does this mean the government is taking into consideration the worst possible scenario for the Korean peninsula? [Kanda] There are various possible scenarios. However, I do think the worst scenario can happen. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Can you comment on an ideal way for cooperating with UN peacekeeping operations (PKO)? [Kanda] This deals with the issue of where Japan should send its PKO team after Mozambique. However, we would like to actively deal with this issue. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But PKO cooperation laws impose a freeze on joining UN peacekeeping forces (PKF). [Kanda] Regarding the PKF, we agreed to review the relevant laws after three years. Therefore, we will have to begin discussions on this issue soon. We would like to carefully study this issue because complicated problems are involved in it. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people are saying Japan should not send its Self-Defense Forces [SDF] abroad for PKO cooperation, but instead members of other organizations. [Kanda] Judging from previously expressed views of the Defense Agency [DA], it seems to me the DA is determined not to establish another organization for PKO cooperation. An attempt to dispatch members from non-SDF organizations for PKO operations will deprive the SDF of its roles in terms of money and manpower. The SDF is enough to fulfill our responsibilities regarding PKO cooperation. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What about the summit between you and U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry? [Kanda] I still cannot say anything about a trip to the United States or the talks. However, I need to actively attend various meetings if there will be change, such as new developments in North Korea, for example. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal with the concept of theater missile defense (TMD) which the United States is promoting? [Kanda] It needs to be studied quickly. While the SDF feels uneasy about Japan's current (missile defense) system, the TMD is a concept based on advanced science and technology. I would like to study the TMD concept in a positive manner. This will be useful in terms of strengthening our joint functions [kyodo kino] in restoring our security. However, I would like to carefully study the concept because we would need a large amount of the budget to introduce the TMD. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The bills designed to revise the SDF laws were carried over to the current Diet session. [Kanda] The SDF is responsible for protecting the Japanese people. Therefore, it is a matter of course to send SDF aircraft to save Japanese living abroad. In this regard, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is also changing its stance, becoming positive about the bills. However, since it seceded from the coalition government, I suppose the SDPJ is now assuming a prudent stand. I would like to deal with the issue while listening to various opinions, including that of the SDPJ. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you think the SDPJ's secession from the ruling coalition will have an impact on defense policies? [Kanda] They should not say they have nothing to do with defense policies because they are no longer a member of the coalition. Since the SDPJ chairman signed the policy agreement, the party must respect it. I want the SDPJ to know that it has heavy responsibilities to fulfill.
