An AFP correspondent reported on Sunday that the explosion claimed no victims. The explosions and resulting fire were caused by an irresponsible smoker. Dozens of buildings were damaged, including a small 20-room hotel. The fire had not yet been controlled this morning, six hours after the initial blast, which occurred when a tanker truck exploded. At the site, it was confirmed that firefighters have limited resources with which to work. The petroleum products stored at the warehouses on Cesar Street, near the cathedral in the Haitian capital, had been brought in from the Dominican Republic.
