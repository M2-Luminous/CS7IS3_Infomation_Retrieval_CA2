Estonia by now has prepared in most part the text of the document it is going to propose from its side. Still to be agreed upon are the issues pertaining to the military resources to be given to NATO's disposal by Estonia. Work is going on over these issues at the defense forces Central Staff in Tallinn. After all necessary amendments have been made in the Estonian text of the plan, the government will get a draft budget of the expenses connected with Estonia's participation in the program. If the government approves the budget, Estonia will submit its program to the NATO leadership for approval. The Foreign Ministry says Estonia will be ready to take part in the program in the second half of this year. Cooperation under the Partnership for Peace program will follow the 16+1 formula, i.e. 16 NATO members plus that particular non-member partner. But the program also provides for extensive bilateral cooperation between NATO members and the partner countries. The cooperation project is being prepared in Estonia by a work group, led by the head of the Foreign Ministry's political department, Toivo Klaar. Officials at the Foreign Ministry said Estonia has been working closely particularly with Denmark, but also with Germany and the United States while drawing up the program. Exchanging of information goes on steadily with Latvia and Lithuania, the ministry officials said. Enn Tupp, the head of the defense policy department at the Estonian Defense Ministry, told reporters on Wednesday [27 April] that the country above all is interested in the possibilities that the partnership program offers in the field of military training. "This is one of our main aims while participating in the program," Tupp said. Estonia in the documents pays much attention to the strengthening of its coast defense. The country expects from the NATO members not only assistance in the form of consulting, but also "certain material support," Tupp said.
