Acting in line with this National Assembly resolution, all echelons and sectors have made many efforts to effect changes for the better in the front against wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling. As far as the Army is concerned, efforts were made in 1993 to accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling a step further and carry out the campaign to practice thrift and fight wasteful spending. Positive results have been recorded. Since early 1994, the Ministry of National Defense has instructed all echelons, sectors, agencies, and units to implement the aforementioned tasks. In the framework of that campaign, an all-Army conference against corruption and smuggling was convened in late 1993 in the north and early 1994 in the south. The conference aimed to derive experiences and discuss measures to coordinate action among military units, as well as between military units and state agencies, in dealing with smuggling or attempts by Army units to help private dealers carry out illegal business activities. The minister of national defense also signed a decision on the management of military vehicles and equipment. Under this decision, with the exception of vehicles with permits to engage in economic activities, all military vehicles are prohibited from transporting goods for private dealers or for non-military agencies and organizations. Furthermore, the Ministry of National Defense set up a standing committee to oversee the campaign against corruption and smuggling in the armed forces. Acting in line with the ministry's common guidelines, all military agencies and units have, since the very beginning of 1994, drawn experiences from the movement against corruption and smuggling and consolidated steering committees a step further. Regarding the movement for thrift and against wasteful spending, the Ministry of National Defense has issued a directive requesting all agencies to make a thorough review of spending and detect loopholes that could easily lead to wasteful spending or the misappropriation of public funds. In implementing this directive, many military agencies and units made arrangements for cadres and combatants concerned to study new state and Army regulations and rules and henceforth formulate new management systems to deal effectively with corruption and smuggling. The national defense agencies concerned also reviewed the various policies and regulations governing the movement for thrift and against wasteful spending. Along with settling complaints and letters of denunciation, the national defense inspection sector also made joint investigations with commanding officers into many cases of financial or logistical mismanagement. Inspection and investigation results indicate that the situation in which private dealers use the names of Army units to carry out illegal business activities remains quite common. In the first quarter of 1994, the ratio of corruption cases involving party members was 52 percent. A total of 14 party members were subjected to disciplinary measures. The number of smuggling cases involving party members decreased by 32 percent. A total of 27 party members were subjected to disciplinary measures. Regarding the movement against corruption, the number of corruption cases has continued to decline since December 1993. Nonetheless, the seriousness and sophistication of cases is on the rise. The Military Organ of Control initiated legal proceedings in five cases involving 10 defendants. Regarding the movement against smuggling, according to preliminary reports as many as 7,000 packs of foreign cigarettes, 46 television sets, 62 ceiling fans, 14,000 meters of fabrics, 100 tons of cement, and 24.4 kilos of opium were seized. To accelerate the movement against corruption and smuggling in the days ahead, the minister of national defense issued a decision on 28 March 1994 establishing a standing committee against corruption and smuggling. The decision reminded all echelons and sectors of the need to understand thoroughly the policy on practicing thrift and fighting wasteful spending, corruption, and smuggling. Efforts must be made to cope effectively with the aforementioned negative phenomena and restore order, discipline, and lawfulness. Steps must be taken to enhance the efficiency of state management agencies. It is necessary for agencies and units under the direct management of the Ministry of National Defense to formulate well-defined programs of action and adopt practical measures to implement them. More efforts are needed to uphold the sense of responsibility of party committee echelons and commanding officers at all levels. Adequate educational activities must be organized to help cadres and combatants thoroughly understand and strictly abide by Army and state policies and lines prohibiting illegal business activities and attempts to lend a helping hand to smugglers and tax evaders. Continued efforts are needed to conduct thorough investigations into cases of mismanagement of public funds, housing facilities, land, and military means of transportation. Drastic measures must be taken to initiate legal proceedings against corruption and smuggling cases. Violators must be dealt with to the full extent of state law and Army discipline. Dear comrades and friends, practicing thrift and fighting corruption, smuggling, and wasteful spending constitutes an important task to be carried out by all Army units. If we implement this task satisfactorily, we will contribute to building a firm and powerful Army; purifying social relations; establishing order, discipline, and law; and enhancing the efficiency of state management over socioeconomic development, thereby continuing to advance the fatherland along the socialist path.
