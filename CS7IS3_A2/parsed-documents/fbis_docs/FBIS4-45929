Answering to a question put by KCNA, he said this refueling is part of the undertakings to normalize our peaceful nuclear activities and it could not be delayed any longer in view of its technical safety. The Secretariat of the agency persistently avoided sending a group of inspectors on unreasonable pretexts and did not take necessary measures for the replacement of fuel rods. Under such conditions, we had no other choice but to remove seals and start taking out fuel rods for safety reasons, he said, and went on: Though we decided to strictly contain the fuel rods and put them under the control of the agency, some quarters of the United States are now spreading the rumor that we are changing the fuel rods to extract plutonium enough for the manufacture of four or five nuclear bombs. This is quite contradictory to the fact and cannot be construed otherwise than a sinister intention to intensify pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of refueling. Actually, refueling is taking place under the watch of the cameras installed by the agency. So, there is no ground to worry about the diversion of the replaced fuel rods for another purpose. Now some quarters are contending that if we stopped and put off refueling, the problem of observation might be solved. This is, however, an unrealistic speculation that does not take into account the characteristics of the technical safety of our experimental atomic power plant. If refueling is stopped midway, it may cause a new danger in the view of safety. But we think that since refueling has just begun, there still remain possibilities to resolve the problem. We proposed to the agency negotiations for an agreement on practical matters related to the presence at the replacement of fuel rods along with complicated outstanding issues with it. The solution to the issue depends on the attitude of the agency. If the agency persist in its unreasonable demand, ignoring our unavoidable conditions regarding the replacement of the fuel rods, the issue would become more complicated. We will as ever make every possible effort for a fair and fundamental solution to the nuclear issue.
