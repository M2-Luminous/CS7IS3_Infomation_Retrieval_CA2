In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town or other municipal corporation, a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a state or municipal corporation. This definition does not include commercial companies owned by the public sector. * * * * * (24) Recourse means the retention, in form or substance, of any risk of loss directly or indirectly associated with a transferred asset that exceeds a pro rata share of a national bank's claim on the asset. If a national bank has no claim on a transferred asset, then the retention of any risk of loss is recourse. A recourse arrangement typically arises when an institution transfers assets and retains an obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse arrangements include, but are not limited to: (i) Representations and warranties about the transferred assets other than standard representations and warranties as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A; (ii) Retained loan servicing rights if the servicer is responsible for losses associated with the loans being serviced (other than servicer cash advances as defined in this section 1(c) of this appendix A; (iii) Retained subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets; (iv) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase; and (v) Loan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participation is shorter than the maturity of the underlying loan. * * * * * (28) Servicer cash advance means funds that a loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments or the timely collection of loans, including disbursements made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses arising from a loan to facilitate its timely collection. A servicer cash advance is not recourse or a direct credit substitute if the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement, or for any one loan, nonreimbursable amounts are contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal on that loan. (29) Standard representations and warranties means contractual provisions that a national bank extends when it transfers assets (including loan servicing rights), or assumes when it purchases loan servicing rights, that refer to existing facts at the time the assets are transferred or servicing rights are acquired and that have been verified with reasonable due diligence by the transferor or servicer. Standard representations and warranties also include contractual provisions for the return of assets in the event of fraud or documentation deficiencies. Standard representations and warranties do not constitute recourse or direct credit substitutes. * * * * * Appendix A [Amended] 4.
