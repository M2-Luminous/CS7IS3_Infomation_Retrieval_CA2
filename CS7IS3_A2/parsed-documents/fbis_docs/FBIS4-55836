The coalition talks on joint participation with the Coexistence at the autumn elections which was initiated by the Hungarian Civic Party and the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDM] still have not brought any results. In fact, the reluctant Coexistence has even postponed the signing of the expired agreement on a two-party coalition with the Christians which was first made two years ago. The concern of the electors is shown by the facts that the local organizations of the three political parties have made agreements of their own will, and an action to collect signatures is in progress which was started with the signatures of renowned personalities of the nearly 600,000-strong Hungarian community to win the support of people who are in favor of the coalition. The Coexistence's latest statement that called for making a union rather than a coalition appears to have ignored the obvious intentions of the citizens. According to the MKDM, this statement proclaims generalities, it lacks concept, and there is not even time to detail the ideas and to draw them up precisely, and it rejected the idea. The seriousness of the situation is shown by the fact that the chief editor of UJ SZO, the only Hungarian weekly newspaper in Slovakia, one that strives for balance between the parties and carefully maintains its independence, wrote a rather open analysis headed "Crossroads," turning to the Coexistence and especially its chairman, because -- as Jozsef Szilvassy writes -- "the conductor's baton is still in Miklos Duray's hands." Acknowledging Duray's truly unique merits in the actions against the previous regime, he points out that "the politician who had a keen perception and made excellent analyses even at the beginning of the 1990's," and who quickly realized Meciar's serious mistakes, perhaps came under the Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] influence too much and committed himself as a staunch adherent of the Hungarian government party -- "it can be assumed for what kind of ideological, current political, and financial reasons." According to UJ SZO, Duray did not learn from the MDF's politics fraught with mistakes; in fact, "due to his bias and his nostalgia for the false ideas of the last century, he did not even manage to dispel the suspicion among the small group of well-intentioned Slovak intellectuals that territorial autonomy is not the only one of his final goals." According to UJ SZO's chief editor, in politics, the merit of yesterday does not excuse the mistakes of today. Therefore, the Coexistence, whose politics disappointed many people, should re- examine its past actions and especially its links with Hungary because we would all suffer the consequences if the "political movement that has a significant basis remained within the constraints it had created." The Coexistence's union plan is presumably guided by the thought that the new political unit would integrate all four Hungarian parties in Slovakia and, within the union, it would vindicate the political leadership to itself, the experts believe. The reluctant party leadership is visibly worried that, recognizing the requirements of political realism and the consequences of the Hungarian Socialist Party's victory in Hungary, the Hungarians who make up 11 percent of the population would be happy to support Weiss's left-wing party that also has Hungarian deputies, or the sober Hungarian civic liberals who learned from the mistakes of the former government.
