The State Administration of State Property said some appraisals given by Chinese organizations last year without approval from authorities were dishonest and must not be accepted by the government or the public. Such appraisals may be deceiving said Wang Baoku, Deputy Director of the Assets Appraisal Administrative Centre under the administration. In any event, he added, appraisals of intangible assets have limited value since they need not be demonstrated before trading the enterprises' property rights. Intangible assets may include trademarks, patents, copyrights and credibility. Their value depends on investors' confidence in the specific enterprises, market demand for the property rights, and other economic factors at the time of the transaction. Wang said the assessments taken last year will become invalid one year after the authorities' approval, according to the State's Regulations on State Property Appraisals, issued by the State Council in 1991. While these appraisal results may help promote the enterprises, they also may mislead the public if the results do not correspond with the assets' real value. For example, enterprises running in the red may use tricks to have their intangible assets appraised higher than their real value. Such unauthorized activities must be prevented, or they may disturb the economic order and affect investors' benefits, Wang said.
