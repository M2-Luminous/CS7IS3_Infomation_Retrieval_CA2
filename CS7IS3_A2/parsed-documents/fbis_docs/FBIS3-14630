The Arab countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression from the current Iraqi regime. After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for their own interests. What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council members over the statement that it releases periodically on the extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting its military resources to international supervision, which is a condition for lifting international sanctions. France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to note in the statement the "progress" Iraq made in destroying banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself. The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with Iraq. France and Russia believe that "encouraging" Iraq by giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of the state of Kuwait. It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking to "normalize" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with Iraq.
