European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and the political group leaders today disapproved of the international press attacks against the Greek presidency when it assumed its term of office. Our Strasbourg correspondent Nikolaos Belos has the following report: [Begin Belos recording] European Parliament President Egon Klepsch and the political group leaders in Strasbourg disapproved of the international press attacks against the Greek presidency when it assumed office. The issue was raised for discussion by Mr. Klepsch at the European Parliament presidium. He said that the criticism was condemnable and that he does not accept prejudging the failure of a presidency before it even begins. Mr. Klepsch added, following the discussions he had a few days ago with representatives of the Greek Government in Athens, that he believes that the presidency gives priority to cooperation with the European Parliament and the other bodies of the European Union. Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group in the European Parliament, described the Greek presidency as solid and experienced and called the international press articles on the alleged negative character of the Greek presidency impolite. Referring to the Greek presidency's priorities, Mr. Cot described them as correct because they cover economic and social aspects of the European Union as they were determined within the framework of the white paper. Mr. Cot also referred to the European Union's foreign policy, which the presidency will promote, and stressed that from his contacts in Athens with leading members of the Greek presidency he has viewed the experience and knowledge the Greek Government has on Balkan issues. In conclusion, the socialist group leader expressed the conviction that the Greek presidency aims at insuring peace and security in the Balkans. Participating in the discussion on the Greek side were the two European Parliament vice presidents, Paraskevas Avyerinos of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] and Yeorgyios Anastasopoulos of New Democracy. They both stressed that the international press attacks were not only against the government but also against the Greek people. At the same time, they also dealt a blow to the European Union institutions. European Commission President Jacques Delors also criticized the international press attacks against the Greek presidency during his visit to Athens. [end recording]
