Inacker report: "Will 20,000 Fewer Conscripts Be Called Up Than Originally Planned"] [Text] Bonn -- The Bundeswehr must expect further drastic cuts totaling at least 1 to 1.2 billion German marks [DM] in the current fiscal year. Thus, it becomes questionable whether its serviceability can be maintained to the originally planned degree. According to WELT AM SONNTAG, the new cutbacks, higher than the Bundeswehr leadership expected, are part of a necessary austerity package that the government and the coalition want to use to cover a budget deficit of DM5 billion. On Monday [17 January], Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union) and other ministers affected by the austerity measures are to meet with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The Bundestag group leaderships will discuss the required cutbacks on Tuesday, and the Budget Committee on Wednesday. The leadership of the Defense Ministry and the defense politicians of the government coalition intend to absorb the latest cuts largely within the existing structures and with a planned Bundeswehr strength of 370,000 men, and not carry out fundamental changes concerning the Bundeswehr planning over the next few years. Through cutbacks in training, exercises, and Armed Forces maintenance, and by "waiting for the election year to pass," further reductions in investments and modernization are to be forestalled, an officer pointed out. According to the latest calculations, the share of investments in the defense budget will drop to 21.9 percent in 1994 (in 1989, before the collapse of the socialist camp, it was 32.4 percent). Defense Ministry officials hope that these are the last cuts, and that the Bundeswehr will have a budget of DM47.5 billion at its disposal from 1995, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Finance Minister Theo Waigel, and Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in June 1993. Only if these promises are kept are the additional cutbacks acceptable, officials pointed out. The following measures are expected: -- 50 percent reduction of the funds for training and exercises. Thus, the costs for railway transports and the transfer of an army division will be lowered from the planned DM5 million to 2.5 million. In the main armed forces divisions, exercises at the unit level (battalion, brigade, division) will be drastically reduced. For the first time, the cuts also affect exercises of the crisis reaction brigades. -- Expense allowances of soldiers for stays at training areas ("bush money") will partly be reduced by 20 percent. For some divisions, this will mean DM1.5 million instead of DM2.5 million. -- Duty training of reservists will be reduced. -- Funds for material maintenance -- that is repair or replacement of wornout equipment -- will be reduced by 15 percent. -- The annual flying hours of air force pilots will be reduced from 180 (as demanded by NATO) to 150. -- Construction and infrastructure projects will be reduced. Thus, the planned transfer of the officer's college from Hanover to Dresden might be postponed. -- To "save money quickly," about 10,000 to 20,000 fewer conscripts are to be called up throughout 1994. This measure will be particularly effective in the second half of the year and means that over 100 companies will not be complete or will have to remain idle for three months. However, this entails problems concerning the recruitment of young officers. Within the Armed Forces, the expected cuts have been described as "disastrous for the motivation" of the young soldiers and conscripts in particular. On this basis, it will no longer be possible to achieve training goals (above all, "combined arms combat") in many areas. For Paul Breuer, the defense spokesman of the Bundestag group of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union, this "additional defense budget contribution to balancing the federal budget is unavoidable." However, the austerity measures do not require a new Bundeswehr structure. "Amid great difficulties, it might be possible to save DM1 billion in 1994 that might relieve the budget considerably." Breuer cited "quicker decisions on applications for early retirement among civilian personnel" as possible fields where money can be saved. He mentioned a "possible amount of DM250 million." Moreover, rationalization measures in the spheres of supply, material maintenance, and operation should be moved forward. Also, money will be released as a result of the end of the Somalia mission on 31 March. According to the planning guideline issued by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe in fall last year, the Bundeswehr is again, to a greater extent, to be considered an entity. In fact, the division into rapid reaction and main defense armed forces remains, but the development of a two-class army should be prevented. After experts favored lighter forces transportable by air, mechanized armored units are to be given priority again because of UN experiences in Bosnia and Somalia and the increased army awareness of its task to defend the country. There are plans to upgrade the combat effectiveness of 225 "Leopard II" and of another 600 armored personnel carriers of the army to "Marder A3." On Ruehe's orders, it is to be determined whether approximately 160 multipurpose support helicopters (UHU) should be procured instead of the planned 75. There are also plans to buy the jeep-like light reconnaissance vehicle "Zobel" for crisis reaction and UN tasks. The personal equipment of the soldiers is also to be improved. The new combat uniforms, the new helmets, and the fragmentation protection vests are to be supplied more quickly. The obsolete G-3 rifle is to be replaced with a more modern and lighter weapon with a smaller caliber (5.56 mm). For the Navy, eight new frigates and four U-212 submarines are still planned -- in the interest of the German weapons industry.
