Just what kind of person is Ichiro Ozawa? When the news and events of each day pass, I ponder over Ichiro Ozawa, the strong man behind the coalition government. The ASAHI SHIMBUN (morning edition) of 5 November [1993] reported at the top of page one that "Kajima Made Regular Donations of 5 Million Yen to Ozawa at Bon and Yearend Festivals." Moreover, the "Information Space J" program of TBS [Tokyo Broadcasting System, Inc.] reported, with pictures of bundles of banknotes, that during the last election, more than one Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] candidate received campaign funds of 20 million yen apart from the 5 million yen candidate official-endorsement money. Furthermore, weekly magazines are writing about "secret election measures" of Ozawa's election saying, "A succession of `accusations' is flowing in from contractors in `Ozawa's Kingdom,' Iwate Prefecture." There is no other politician like Ichiro Ozawa on whom opinion is so greatly divided. For that reason, he is a person around whom myths grow and who plays upon one's imagination, whether one likes it or not. An executive of the Liberal Democratic Party, who was formerly Ozawa's staunch friend, once commented that "Ozawa is a rare kind of idealist." He also said, "That is Ozawa's defect." A leading executive of Shinseito explains that "Ozawa is not good at talking, and he is also not good at getting along with people. He is a very awkward person." Indeed, when one reads Ozawa's best seller, Blueprint for Building a New Japan, one can glimpse "an awkward idealist." Sweep Away the Gap Between Principles and the Opacity of Politics Ozawa emphasizes repeatedly in his book that Japanese lack the principle of self-responsibility and that Japanese society has developed into an irresponsible state of collusion and mutual dependence. He insists that political leadership should be firmly established and advocates decentralization and abolition of regulations. None of these are novel. But his manner of speech is so very earnest and intent that the ordinary content and commonplace statements make one feel a certain wonder and even fear. The characters for "leadership" and "determination," which he writes repeatedly, begin to appear to have the meaning "forceful" and "acting arbitrarily on one's own authority." Then, I recall a number of episodes which spawned "legends of forcefulness" concerning Ozawa. One is the "dumping of Suzuki," who was the incumbent governor, before the April 1991 election for governor of Tokyo. Ozawa became notorious at one stroke as being a "young dictator" who discarded in a high-handed manner the venerable, 80-year-old governor who was brimming over with desire to do the job. And there is the incident of summoning the three candidates in the autumn 1991 election for LDP party president, Miyazawa, Watanabe, and Mitsuzuka. His bad reputation of being "conceited" or a "dictator" increased still more because the young acting chairman, of all things, summoned to his private office faction chairmen who were older than him. There is more. The incident of the 5 million yen donation from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin to Kanemaru in the autumn of 1992. The criticism that Ozawa dealt with this arbitrarily without consulting with the other executives of the Keiseikai [Takeshita faction], and that he failed. There even appeared an Ozawa coup d'etat theory to the effect that, actually, Ozawa tried to take over the Keiseikai by plotting Kanemaru's downfall, and right after that the Keiseikai broke up. Of course, when one gathers information about the innermost workings of this kind of "forceful" "arbitrariness," those close to Ozawa explain that his tactless frankness is twisted and disorted and that legends which depart greatly from Ozawa's intentions have taken on a life of their own. They say of the "dumping of Suzuki" incident that Governor Suzuki, himself, stated that "a three-party setup of the LDP, Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party is a precondition for running," and when the Komeito, on whom they had depended, decided not to support him, Ozawa sought another candidate, but later Suzukireversed his own statement. On the incident of summoning the three candidates in the election for party president, they say that when Ozawa first contacted Watanabe's office and told him that he would go there, Ozawa was told that "due to the circumstances of his schedule of activities, Watanabe would go to meet him," and since it worked out that way, the other candidates also arranged to come to Ozawa's place. They say, "tactless frankness".... But such things as the suspicion concerning general contractors, the suspicion concerning Sagawa Kyubin, and Ozawa's relationship with Rekiji Kobari, who died on the 7th, cannot be explained by "tactless frankness." If Ozawa has seriously decided to be a reformer, he should first sweep away the suspicions that cling to him and the opacity of the old politics. There is too great a gap between them and the principles that Ozawa talks about.
