Nitrogen direct gas expansion is acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial process refrigeration using CFC&hyph;12, R&hyph;500, or R&hyph;502. Nitrogen is expanded within an enclosed area to absorb heat. The cycle is open; the nitrogen is released to the atmosphere after absorbing heat from the container. Nitrogen is a common gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable. (p) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to industrial process refrigeration using CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, or R&hyph;502.
