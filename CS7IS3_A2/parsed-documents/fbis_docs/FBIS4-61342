Kozyrev attended the ceremony of signing a peace accord between Israel and the PLO to implement limited Palestinian self-rule. "It is the proof of our closeness that it takes four hours to fly from Moscow to the Middle East and twice as much to the Russian borders," he said. "I am convinced that PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are well aware of Russia's adherence to regional settlement as one of the co-sponsors of the peace process," Kozyrev continued. He pointed up three key aspects in the Middle East peace process. The first one is Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the town of Jericho. The second one is peaceful co-existence and mutual respect between Israel and Palestinians and "probably even cooperation between them in the future." And lastly, comprehensive settlement in the region. "We hope that it will be reached in the not so distant future and we will witness the signing of an agreement on not only the Gaza Strip and the town of Jericho, but also other territories," the Russian foreign minister added. Kozyrev praised the "outstanding role" of Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in furthering the peace process in the region.
