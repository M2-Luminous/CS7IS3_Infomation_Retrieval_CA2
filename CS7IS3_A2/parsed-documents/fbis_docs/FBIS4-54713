The minister over the second half of April made a tour of six world finance centres (Frankfurt, Vienna, Rome, Tokyo, New York, and Paris) to present the deal on Bulgaria's commercial debt and prospects for debt-for-equity swaps. Mr. Aleksandrov said many creditors accepted Bulgaria's proposal to repurchase at least 20 percent of its foreign debt or about $1.5 billion. In March the Bulgarian side suggested a price of 25 cents per dollar in foreign debt. The debt-for-equity and repurchase options are aimed to halve this country's $8.7 billion debt to the London Club. Finance Minister Aleksandrov described as "very interesting" the World Bank's and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) willingness to provide additional financing for the whole amount to be repurchased. Beside amounts agreed, these two institutions pledged an additional $255 million ($130 million from the World Bank and $125 million from the IMF) just for the commercial debt deal. This means there would be no ceiling for the amount to be repurchased, said the Finance Minister. According to IMF estimates, this country needs some $900 million for the deal (for the collateral and repurchase). $400 million are needed only for repurchasing the amount already negotiated. Finance Minister Aleksandrov voiced a regret that the Bulgarian side has failed to meet the net bank assets requirement in the standby agreement with the IMF. According to Mr. Aleksandrov, this raises doubts about the June 30, 1994, deadline for the conclusion of the deal. The finance minister said talks on the finalization of the deal would "make no sense" unless Parliament amends the Privatization Act or passes a bankruptcy law by June 30. According to him, Bulgaria can ensure the deal's conclusion in several ways; one option is to use $200 million from the state reserves, which, within a short period of time (a couple of months), should not heighten tension on the forex market. Many financial institutions have offered support. Thus Meryll Lynch seems willing to agree to finance the deal at a 3-percent annual interest for three months, which the finance minister sees as very favourable terms. As to which bank should act as a foreign debt agent, Aleksandrov thinks it should be the central Bulgarian National Bank, as it has reached an agreement with the U.S. Federal Reserve Board for the American side to buy the collateral. High interest was shown in debt-for-equity swaps. The finance minister said that it would be possible to use foreign debt bonds as an instrument of payment in the privatization of enterprises up for sale, and in the opening of privatization procedures for companies, which have drawn investor interest. Thus, French companies have displayed interest in 30 to 40 Bulgarian companies in the foods and tourist industries and Meryll Lynch and Salomon Brothers in large investment in the energy sector and telecommunications. Large infrastructure units such as airports, ports, roads, etc., have also attracted attention. The Bulgarian side suggested that creditors consider medium-size, export-oriented and slow-asset [as received] companies and large corporate taxpayers, said Reneta Indzhova, Privatization Agency boss who accompanied the finance minister on his tour. According to Indzhova, a major obstacle is the lack of Council of Ministers regulation of the way to make foreign debt payments through bonds. I count on this option to give a strong boost to privatization, Indzhova said. According to Minister Aleksandrov, the deal now depends on home policy and the economy's performance. He said he would not act as a stooge for any political force. According to him, the latest developments in Bulgaria have had negative repercussions, which transpired in the cancellation of an European Union mission visit. This spells a delay in pledged EU financing, Aleksandrov said.
