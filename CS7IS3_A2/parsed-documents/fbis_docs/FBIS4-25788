As Chinese officials have pointed out, Clinton's decision would create favorable conditions for further expanding trade and economic cooperation between the two countries, helping improve and develop bilateral relations in the fundamental interest of the two nations. Over the past several years, decision making concerning the US policy toward China has been filled with a series of complicated contradictions. On the one hand, the idealist trend calls for the US government to put more stress on ideological goals and on human rights issues. On the other hand, realistic or practical demands require a kind of pragmatical, sustainable long-term approach towards China, with more consideration for America's economic and strategic interests. The United States wishes to see a unified and stable China, because a weak or troubled China may bring about regional instability in the Asian-Pacific Region. The United States also sees an increasingly strong China as a potential opponent. Under these circumstances, the issue of MFN status, originally a subject of foreign relations, had evolved into one of the focuses of America's domestic political struggle. The annual review of China's MFN status became not only an annoyance to China, but a wrench American politicians used to throw in each others' works, which caused considerable bother in both countries business communities. There are several factors contributing to the US government's change on its China policy. First, the US government realized that it is dealing with an accelerated economy in the world. The United States has growing economic interests in China, where the economic trend is providing enormous opportunities for trade and investment. Economic consideration has always been a top priority for the pragmatic US government decision-makers. Second, the past decade has seen much progress China has made [sentence as published]. Its foreign and reform policies have steadily improved, and this progress is not seen to be slowing down in the near future. Moreover, it is widely recognized that China's strategic role in the post-Cold War world didn't decrease but increased, which is supported by its progressively stronger economy. The two countries also have many common interests in a number of global issues such as nonproliferation of high arms technologies and environmental protection. Pressure on the US government for separating trade from nontrade related issues was mounted not only from the economic circle, but from numerous politicians and diplomats. It was widely recognized that the annual review of China's MFN status was a double-edged sword which could have cut into both parties' economic interests. However, since Americans have a long standing tradition of idealism, and proselityzing their own morals throughout the world, it is not easy for them to give up the attempt to influence China, probably through means other than trade under the pretext of human rights. However, things changed hands, and a bright cooperative future is seen to be rising from the dust of long-time foot stomping. The issue of human rights in essence reflects some people's dissatisfaction with China's political system to a large degree. However, China's system, which has survived nearly 45 years of various trials and hardships, will certainly not be changed by any other than China's own. Due to different levels of social development, the United Statics and China have many differences in human rights views. As a developing country, what concerns China most is how to provide adequate food and clothing to its 1.2 billion people. In fact, it has to put more stress on the rights of survival and development, because China still has about 80 million people living at substandard levels, mainly concentrated in remote and poor areas. But the problem of poverty in the United States is not of the magnitude as China. So if not viewed with an understanding attitude, the United States will have difficulty understanding China's viewpoints in regards to human rights. Of course, China is willing to discuss relevant issues with the United States and other Western countries, but is not receptive to foreign pressure. To sum it up, consideration of economic and strategic interests have surmounted the political quarrels in the US decision making. We are looking forward to future Sino-US relations, after the positive step taken by President Bill Clinton, a practical, productive, fore-sightfull stand in the interests of Sino-American relations, that will be essential to the stable and growing maturity of Sino-US relations.
