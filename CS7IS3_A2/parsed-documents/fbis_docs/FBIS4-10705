At a news conference, Ruiz (the mediator in the dialogue) said he had received "verbal" communication from the EZLN, and he added that it is just "a matter of days" before the resumption of the dialogue would be announced. On 2 March, the government forwarded several proposals to the EZLN in an effort to end the armed conflict in the Mexican state of Chiapas. At that time, the guerrilla organization began conferring with its grass-roots organizations, but the conferences were suspended following the 23 March assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. Ruiz did not rule out the possibility that a renewed dialogue could still fail to result in the signing of a peace agreement, but he added that the new sessions would allow the two sides to review proposals "and, in turn, determine how we might best be able to set out on a firm footing."
