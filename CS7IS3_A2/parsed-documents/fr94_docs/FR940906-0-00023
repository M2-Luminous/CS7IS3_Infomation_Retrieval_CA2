FR940906-0-00023 FR940906-0-00013 Summary, 59 FR 30326. The third sentence of this section reads ``*␣*␣* West Virginia submitted an update to its November 13, 1994 submittal.'' The date in this sentence should have read November 13, 1992. Section I_Background, 59 FR 30326 and 30327. This section states that West Virginia submitted a SIP projecting attainment by December 31, 1982 and failed to meet that deadline. This statement is incorrect, invalidating the subsequent language referring to Charleston as a nonattainment area for that period. On November 25, 1980, West Virginia requested that the EPA approve a change in the Designation of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) IV from nonattainment of the ozone NAAQS to attainment based on air quality data showing attainment for the years 1978&hyph;1980. EPA approved this request in the November 9, 1981 Federal Register (46 FR 55261). The area remained in attainment of the ozone NAAQS until 1988. As a result of 1988 calendar year ambient ozone measurements, EPA notified West Virginia on November 8, 1989 that the State's ozone SIP was inadequate to assure the attainment of the ozone NAAQS in several counties including the Charleston (Kanawha/Putnam County) area. Pursuant to the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, this area was officially designated as a moderate ozone nonattainment area on January 6, 1991. Section III. Review of West Virginia's Submittal, subsection 5.B., 59 FR 30330. This section states that ``*␣*␣* emissions projections are dependent upon the implementation of the federal reformulated gasoline program.'' This statement is incorrect. West Virginia's maintenance plan did not commit to the use of or rely on credits from the federal reformulated gasoline program. Other specific requirements of the Charleston ozone nonattainment area redesignation request and associated maintenance plan and the rationale for EPA's proposed action are explained in the NPR and will not be restated here. All of the public comments received on the NPR were positive and in support of EPA's action to approve the redesignation request and maintenance plan. Final Action EPA is approving West Virginia's request to redesignate the Charleston moderate ozone nonattainment area from nonattainment to attainment because the agency has determined that the provisions of section 107(d)(3)(E) of the Act for redesignation of nonattainment areas to attainment have been met. In addition, EPA is approving the ozone maintenance plan for the Charleston area as a revision to the West Virginia SIP because it meets the requirements of 175A. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 3 action for signature by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from E.O. 12866 review. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action, to approve the maintenance plan for the Charleston area and to redesignate the Charleston ozone nonattainment area to attainment, must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 7, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)
