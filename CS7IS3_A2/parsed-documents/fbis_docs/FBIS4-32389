Briquettes will cost 1,250 leva/tonne (about $22 at the current exchange rate), up from 660 leva/tonne, until October 1, when price ceilings will be introduced for solid fuels. Other prices were fixed as follows: brown coal from 995 to 1,116 leva/tonne; cleaned brown coal from 1,312 to 1,318 leva/tonne; and lignite coal 632 to 809 leva/tonne. The decree sets maximum mercantile additions for local coal at 210 leva/tonne; local briquettes 150 leva/tonne, and imported coal and briquettes 210 leva/tonne. It was agreed that value added tax [VAT], introduced on April 1, should not apply to fixed prices, Nikita Shervashidze, chairman of the Power Engineering Committee, said after the government meeting. That is why the government will allocate 2,038 million leva to compensate the electricity supply industry for losses resulting from the imposition of VAT. In his view, this financial support is designed to tide the energy sector over until the introduction of prices and rate schedules that will allow it to become self-supporting. Power engineering companies estimate their losses at 2,000 million leva, while other sectors owe the energy sector some 14,000 million leva, according to statistics of the Power Engineering Committee. Heating prices for industrial consumption were also increased. Suppliers can fix prices according to their production costs. The decree envisages sanctions against managers of enterprises that are behind with their payments. They must pay their electricity and gas bills before wages are paid to employees. Those breaking the regulations will be fined up to 10,000 leva. No agreement was reached with the Finance Ministry on the enforcement of Council of Ministers' Decree No. 77, under which payments to the exchequer must precede the payment of wages. The finance minister and the chairman of the Power Engineering Committee were assigned to find mutually acceptable solutions. The introduction of new pricing methods in power engineering is the key to a lasting solution to its problems. Such a methodology has been drawn up and will be submitted to the government for approval. Shervashidze declined to cite new fuel and electricity prices. He said they would be formed along market economy principles, depending on the economic situation and the dollar exchange rate, but mechanisms to cushion the effect on low-income groups would also be introduced.
