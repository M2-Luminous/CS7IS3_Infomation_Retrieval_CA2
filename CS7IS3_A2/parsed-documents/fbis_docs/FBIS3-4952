The two men were charged and sentenced as enemies of the nation and sentenced in absentia by the present regime following the establishment of the Lao PDR [People's Democratic Republic] in 1975. The men and their followers were recently charged by the Thai authority for generating threat to security in Thailand by destabilising security and order along the Lao-Thai border with an intent to overthrow the regime of the Lao PDR, thus jeopardising the relations of good neighbours between Laos and Thailand, particularly threatening those living along the border. Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit said that the bilateral relations lately have seen marked progress, particularly since the first through third meetings of the Joint Cooperation Committee for Border Security and Order. This has created favourable conditions for making the two countries's border a border of peace and friendship. He pointed out that joint border committees have been created in several places and memoranda of understanding have been signed. One of the tasks of these committees is to weed out bad elements that wish to create trouble and destabilise the situation. He concluded by hoping that the Thai authority will take appropriate measures to deal not only with Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun but others whose intention is to disturb peace and security along the Lao-Thai border.
