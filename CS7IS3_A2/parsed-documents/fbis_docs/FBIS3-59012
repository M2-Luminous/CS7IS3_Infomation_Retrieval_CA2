The two mainly discussed the conditions of application of Community aid to the organization and, in particular, the appropriation of ECU500 million decided by member states immediately after the signing of the Treaty of Washington in September between Israel and the PLO. Mr. 'Arafat has announced that an estimated budget will be brought to the Community's knowledge and that of other donors in order to enable them to determine the cost of installation of the Palestinian authorities in the occupied territories and in the first phase in Gaza and Jericho. Mr. Marin recalled the priorities laid down by member states in the use of Community aid, especially toward social sectors: education, health and training. A Palestinian delegation of experts will be in Brussels, probably in February, for more in-depth talks on this matter.
