Another meeting is expected between Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat next week. The situation can be summed up as follows: There is no progress on the bilateral tracks and the talks on the Palestinian-Israeli track are delayed. Our correspondent in Washington Salim Salim reported to the Voice of Lebanon bureau in Washington that the Israeli delegation insists on a peace agreement with Lebanon before discussing Security Council Resolution 425. Also, the Israeli delegation insists on secret talks with Syria before lifting the veto on the Golan. The report did not rule out direct U.S. intercession in the talks this week. [Begin Salim recording] There is nothing new regarding the Arab-Israeli talks being held at the heads-of-delegation level, which began their second week without results worth mentioning. Why did the talks fail to make progress? We put the question to the delegations participating in the talks and to the U.S. State Department. It seems clear that failure to make progress on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks is due to the following reasons: On the Lebanese track, Israel will not pledge to implement Resolution 425 before Lebanon declares its readiness to accept a bilateral peace treaty. As for the failure on the Syrian track, Israel will not declare its readiness to withdraw from the Golan until after Damascus agrees to negotiate with Israel secretly, as the Israelis and Palestinians did in Oslo recently. Damascus rejects this. The Voice of Lebanon has learned that Itamar Rabinovich, Israeli ambassador and head of the negotiating delegation with Syria, asked U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to convince Syria to agree to secret talks. The U.S. stance was cautious and the U.S. side did not show any enthusiasm for this formula. This caused the talks at the heads-of-delegation level to bog down. Direct U.S. intercession beginning in the middle of this week cannot be ruled out if chronic and traditional obstacles are not resolved among the Lebanese, Syrian, and Israeli delegations.
