Thirty-one individuals: that is how many members there were in the terrorist support network recently dismantled by the security services. One of their "leaders" is none other than a middle school teacher employed at the Ben Amlar CEM [College of Intermediate Studies] in Mila. Five other teachers and a school inspector were also active in the group. Apart from its size--especially important to the security services, since they were able to make a big haul--this case provides additional proof of the link between Algerian schools and terrorism. It is also proof that some teachers, who are members or supporters of the former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front] and therefore completely behind fundamentalist and obscurantist ideology, have not confined themselves solely to joining armed groups but have also taken command of those who kill, burn, and destroy. Is it necessary to point out that at least 315 teachers have been discovered in terrorist groups? That of the 7,000 individuals interned in the centers in the south in 1992, there were 1,224 teachers, professors, and educators? That nine teachers with weapons in their hands have been killed by the police? Those figures, alarming to say the least, show in their own way how widespread is the disease that is eating away at Algerian schools and will eventually destroy them if we keep on pretending not to see anything. It must not be forgotten that those who have sullied the teaching profession began by instilling radicalism and fundamentalism in our children--the future pillars of the nation. They took advantage of the fact that the schools were already in a noticeably shaky state to infiltrate them and propagate their doctrine. What were school officials doing while that was happening? Nothing. They had their eyes closed because they were much more concerned with their own status. Today the school system, the source of learning, is a disaster area. And we are only too aware of the results of that policy: children placed in the hands of the "teachers of terrorism." But it is also true that other teachers who oppose the plan have long been sounding the alarm.
