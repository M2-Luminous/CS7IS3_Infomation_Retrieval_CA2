The newspapers note that the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), with merely 9.59 percent of seats, will be now in opposition. Commentators give much attention to chances for Socialists and Free Democrats forming a coalition, which would ensure them a two- thirds majority. Several papers quote leading Socialist politicians as saying that the MSZP plans a coalition government and regards the Free Democrats as its natural ally. NEPSZABADSAG says that large voter turnout at the elections indicated the stability of Hungary's democratic system. That so many voters placed their confidence in the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) and the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) is also important as a clear signal that the tasks lying ahead for Hungary can only be accomplished by a government with broad mass support. Therefore, what the decisive majority of the politicking public wants today can be expressed by one word: coalition, says the newspaper. "The unavoidable economic measures can only be taken on a very strong political basis. If it is missing, the government will seek support to the detriment of rational economic management, which would harm the country. The new government stands to have a historic, and in all probability one-off, chance, which must not end in disappointment. This is also a common interest of all parliamentary parties," the commentator of NEPSZABADSAG writes. While considering big voter participation an important indication of citizens" commitment to democratic elections, the daily UJ MAGYARORSZAG is pessimistic about the possible implications of a sweeping Socialist win. "Initial unofficial returns showing an excessive Socialist victory are disheartening not because of the defeat of Christian- conservative forces, but because they foreshadow the comeback of the one-party system. It is to be feared that the brain trust of the Alliance of Free Democrats will be reluctant to enter into a coalition, in which it would have weak positions, and it may also happen - according to established Eastern European custom - that the Socialist Party will not look for partners at all. But this may elicit the SZDSZ's resistance, and a really democratic Socialist party will no longer be capable of stable government, since one or two deputies may as well vote against their own party, and the thin majority, shrinking from time to time, will create a new political situation. It is also possible that new elections will have to be called, which would be a tragedy. We are all in the hands of the Socialists. We all are controlling the Socialists. As long as we are allowed to do so," reads a commentary in UJ MAGYARORSZAG.
