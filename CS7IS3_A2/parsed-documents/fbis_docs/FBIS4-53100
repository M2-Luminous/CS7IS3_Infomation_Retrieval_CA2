Speaking at a press conference, International Trade and Industry Minister Hata said the high-level talks will take place in Washington from Thursday. Apart from the Washington talks, a subcabinet-level U.S. trade official may visit Tokyo in the near future, Hata said. Hata said Sozaburo Okamatsu, vice international trade and industry minister for international affairs, and Sadayuki Hayashi, deputy foreign minister for economic affairs, will be sent to Washington for the talks, the duration of which has yet to be fixed. Hata said they will not carry "specific answers" to three new U.S. proposals presented to Tokyo in April as conditions for resuming the negotiations on a new framework for bilateral trade. The two Japanese officials will strive to "bridge the perception gap" between the two countries, Hata said. The framework talks have been deadlocked since the February summit between then Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. The two sides have been at odds over the U.S.-proposed "objective criteria" for gauging American access to Japanese markets. Turning to Russia's participation in political talks at the Naples summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries in July, Hata said he personally supports the idea. The global trend is moving toward accepting Russia as a new member of the G-7 club, he said.
