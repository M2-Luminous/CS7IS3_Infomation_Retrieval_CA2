The People's Army soliders mobilized in building the Pyongyang-Hyangsan express highway have almost completed the laying of the roadbed in the section of one hundred and scores of kilometres. They are pushing ahead with the construction of many difficult and complicated structures including bridges and tunnels at an accelerated pace. The soldiers in charge of the construction of a Ungna suspension bridge across the Taedong River flowing through Pyongyang are stepping up the project of the bridge extending hundreds of metres at the final stage. The People's Army soldiers have undertaken many other major objects of the country. Among the monumental edifices built by them in all parts of the country are the February 8 Vinalon complex, the February 8 cement complex, the February 8 Chiktong youth coal mine, the Taechon power stations, the West Sea Barrage, and the Pyongyang-Wonsan express highway. The Grand Metro, the February 8 House of Culture, the ice rink and other monumental architectures in the capital were also built by People's Army soldiers. In recent years they completed with credit scores of large construction projects such as the Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway and 800-kilometre-long waterways on the west coast. It was at the time of the construction of the February 8 vinalon complex that the People's Army soldiers created the "Vinalon" speed by building 50 odd structures with a plottage of 500,000 square metres in a short period. When they took charge of the construction of the west sea barrage in which four billion dollars were invested, they performed feats by completing it in a matter of five years, which would have taken dozen of years by the established method of construction. Many heroes and order recipients emerged from among the people's Army soldiers in the whole period of socialist construction.
