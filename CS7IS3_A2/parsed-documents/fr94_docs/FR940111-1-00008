FR940111-1-00008 FR940111-1-00002 The domestic content requirement requires counting all the ``tobacco'' in the cigarettes and computing the amount of ``imported tobacco'' in those cigarettes. The 1938 Act covers many commodities, including tobacco. Until recently the tobacco provisions of the 1938 Act dealt mainly with regulating the production of tobacco by domestic producers and the definition of ``tobacco'' in section 301 of the 1938 Act, which is made generally applicable to the entire 1938 Act, appears to have been drafted accordingly when it was enacted in 1938. The term ``tobacco'' is used in section 320C without a modifier and in combination with the word ``imported.'' Tobacco is classified by kind and by type number. For example, domestic burley tobacco is commonly referred to as type 31. Section 301 refers to the ``Service and Regulatory Announcement 118 of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Bureau of Agricultural Economics'' published in 1929 and defines tobacco to mean certain specified tobacco types by type number as identified in Announcement 118. All of the identified types, however, are identified in Announcement 118 as domestic tobaccos. Foreign tobaccos are assigned other type numbers and, thus, under the section 301 definition, they technically would not appear to be, ``tobacco'' at all under that definition. However, section 320C clearly was intended to measure the amount of use of ``imported tobacco,'' as those words would be defined in their common meaning as compared with domestic tobacco use. Use of the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' would make that comparison impossible and make the statute essentially meaningless. Thus, the proposed rule presumes that the Congress did not intend for the section 301 definition of ``tobacco'' to be used for the section 320C purpose. The proposed rule has been drafted accordingly. ``Tobacco'' is defined in the proposed rule to mean that which is commonly considered to be ``tobacco'' in the trade. As there is no provision in the statute to do otherwise, that would include all foreign tobacco, including those like Turkish and Oriental tobaccos, which may not have as close a domestic counterpart as other tobaccos. This inclusion is consistent with the Conference report issued with the 1993 Act (H. Conf. Report No. 103&hyph;213) where the Conference managers stated their belief that the 75/25 ratio, by allowing the maintenance of current blends, would be sufficient to ``permit the continued importation of Turkish and Oriental tobaccos.'' If Turkish and Oriental tobaccos were not subject to section 320C, the ratio would be irrelevant. These conclusions, as with all aspects of the proposed rule, are subject to further consideration on receipt of comments. Discussion of Proposed Rule 1. Domestic Tobacco Content Requirement (ยง723.502) A ``domestic manufacturer of cigarettes'' is defined in section 301(b)(17) of the 1938 Act as ``a person that produces and sells more than 1 percent of the cigarettes produced and sold in the United States.'' To avoid the domestic marketing assessment and other sanctions imposed by section 320C of the amended 1938 Act, beginning in 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes must use at least 75 percent domestically grown tobacco in the cigarettes manufactured by such manufacturer. In determining compliance with the domestic content requirement, the proposed rule specifies that imported tobacco will include all tobacco imported into the United States including Oriental and Turkish tobaccos. The domestic tobacco content requirement will apply to all cigarettes manufactured in the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes without regard to whether the manufactured cigarettes are sold domestically or exported. The domestic content requirement would not apply to cigarettes manufactured outside the United States by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. Likewise, the domestic tobacco content requirement would not apply to tobacco processed in the United States for use in making cigarettes outside the United States. Domestic manufacturers of cigarettes with operations located outside the United States would not be required to file reports for cigarettes manufactured in such foreign based operations for foreign-made cigarettes and the domestic content rules would not apply to such cigarettes. 2. Reports and Certifications by Domestic Manufacturers of Cigarettes (ยง723.502) Under the proposed rule, beginning with the 1994 and each succeeding calendar year, each domestic manufacturer of cigarettes would be required to maintain records, file reports and certify to the quantities of domestic and imported tobacco used by such manufacturer to manufacture cigarettes in the United States. Determinations as to content percentages would be based on the weight of the tobacco when it is ready for the cigarette manufacturing process. Adjustments, to avoid double-counting, will be made for any tobacco which loses its identity during the manufacturing process and is recaptured and reused to manufacture cigarettes by the same manufacturer and for tobacco in any cigarettes returned to the manufacturer and reused by such manufacturer to manufacture other cigarettes. Such adjustments will be made only to the extent that records are maintained which prove the reuse of such tobacco. For the purpose of determining the domestic content percentage, any tobacco reconstituted, or otherwise processed, so as to lose its respective identity as either imported tobacco or domestic tobacco, before being acquired by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes shall be considered to be imported tobacco when it is used to produce cigarettes by a domestic manufacturer of cigarettes. The proposed rule provides that reports and certifications must be mailed or otherwise delivered to Director, Tobacco and Peanuts Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, P. O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;2415 by February 15 of the year after the calendar year for which reports and certifications apply. Failure to file timely reports or make required certifications will result in all tobacco used by the manufacturer in the manufacturing of cigarettes in the United States being considered as imported tobacco and sanctions would be applied accordingly. Such a presumption is provided for in section 320C(b) of the 1938 Act.
