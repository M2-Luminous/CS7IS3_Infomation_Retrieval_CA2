FR940613-0-00032 FR940613-0-00009 Section 660.111␣Agreements Comment: One commenter felt that the 41 statewide FH agreements currently in effect between the FHWA and the States (including Puerto Rico) should be updated and made into tri-party agreements with the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA. This would perpetuate the ``partnership'' spirit of the ISTEA and facilitate cooperation among the three agencies. It would also eliminate separate agreements between the FS and the SHA and between the FHWA and the SHA in each State. The wording of this section should be revised by inserting the words ``the Forest Service'' where necessary, such as after the word ``FHWA'' in paragraph (a), to include the FS as a signatory agency to the agreements. Response: Because there are some overall FH procedures that not only involve the SHAs, but the FS as well, tri-party agreements among the FHWA, the FS, and the SHA will be a requirement in the final rule. Because the FHWA and the FS already have separate two-party FH program agreements for all 40 States, plus Puerto Rico, and because the FHWA does not want to delay the FH program until all new tri-party agreements are executed, the first sentence of this section of the NPRM was revised to delete the phrase ``prior to the expenditure of any funds by the FHWA in the State.'' Section 660.112␣Project Development Comment: One commenter suggested that, in the first sentence of paragraph (a), the phrase ``or a public authority'' should be added after the words ``Projects will be administered by the FHWA.'' This would acknowledge that the FS may, in some cases, administer the design and construction of FH projects. The same commenter also suggested adding the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' to the end of the sentence to allow for items included in statewide agreements to supplement Federal-aid procedures, where appropriate. Response: Because the FS wants to be able to administer FH projects, this sentence was reworded to add the words ``or the FS'' instead of ``or a public authority.'' Also, the phrase ``and procedures documented in the statewide agreement'' was added to the end of the sentence. This will allow the parties to determine the procedures to be followed in a State. Section 660.113␣Construction Comment: One commenter suggested that the words ``a public authority'' be substituted for ``cooperator'' in paragraph (b) of this section. This would allow the FS to perform construction, if appropriate. Cooperators would still be included since they are, by definition, a public authority. Response: Because other public authorities that might potentially be involved in a project would also be cooperators, the word ``cooperator'' was kept in the sentence in paragraph (b). However, by adding the words ``the FS'' after FHWA, the FS will be explicitly allowed to perform construction, if appropriate. Also, paragraph (c), which deals with final acceptance of the project, was revised to clarify the intent. The word ``construction'' was retained in the language to differentiate acceptance of the construction work (for the purpose of releasing the contractor) from that of acceptance of the entire project, including any extra work required to resolve noncontractor-related matters. Section 660.115␣Maintenance Comment: In dealing with the same issue discussed in the previous section, as to what constitutes final acceptance of a project, it was suggested by one commenter that the word ``construction'' be deleted to avoid confusion. Response: The term ``construction'' is not incorrect in the context of this paragraph, because it describes the type of acceptance being made. However, the entire sentence was reworded to clarify and minimize possible confusion. By referencing §660.113(c), which includes the word ``construction,'' the meaning of the term ``construction acceptance'' was retained. Section 660.117␣Funding, Records and Accounting Comment: One commenter suggested deleting the phrase ``and the SHAs'' from paragraph (e). Response: Because the term ``cooperators'' includes SHAs, the phrase was considered redundant and, therefore, deleted. Comment: One commenter suggested adding the word ``Generally'' at the beginning of the sentence in paragraph (f) to allow for those special cases where cash is not obtained in advance of construction procurement. Response: Adding the word ``generally'' to the sentence makes the requirement too much less restrictive. Instead, the following phrase was added to the end of the last sentence: ``Unless otherwise specified in a project agreement.'' Also, the word ``shall'' was changed to ``should'' to allow more flexibility. Rulemaking Analyses and Notices; Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures The FHWA has determined that this action is not major within the meaning of Executive Order 12866 or significant within the meaning of Department of Transportation regulatory policies and procedures. It is anticipated that the economic impact of this rulemaking would be minimal; therefore, a full regulatory evaluation is not required. This rule merely requires the States and Federal agencies to conform to the requirements of the ISTEA. The requirements are basically incremental to what the States and Federal agencies are required to do under the new ISTEA provisions, such as incorporating new planning provisions, including metropolitan and statewide transportation plan requirements; and establishing management systems provisions, including highway safety, bridges on and off Federal-aid highways, and highway pavements. Regulatory Flexibility Act In compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612), the FHWA has evaluated the effects of this rule on small entities. Based on the evaluation, the FHWA hereby certifies that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The revised regulation will not directly affect small businesses because the regulation applies only to Federal agency, State, and local government transportation programs. However, a minor positive secondary effect may result from the employment of small businesses, such as engineering consultant firms, to implement some of the planning and management systems required by the ISTEA. Executive Order 12612 (Federalism Assessment) This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that this action does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment. Executive Order 12372 (Intergovernmental Review) Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program Number 20.205, Highway Planning and Construction. The regulations implementing Executive Order 12372 regarding intergovernmental consultation on Federal programs and activities apply to this program. Paperwork Reduction Act This action does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. National Environmental Policy Act The agency has analyzed this action for the purpose of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ) and has determined that this action would not have any effect on the quality of the environment.
