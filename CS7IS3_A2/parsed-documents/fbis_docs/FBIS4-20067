In his speech, Jose Maria Cuevas advised CEOE members to surmount the crisis by reducing wages and preserving jobs, and explained that "by cutting personnel we immediately create increases in social benefits that we ourselves must then meet, since employers pay 49 percent of the total revenue of the public administrations as a whole." [passage omitted] In his speech to the CEOE electoral assembly, Cuevas outlined the main guidelines for the next four years, which involve a commitment to change in various spheres, such as openness, the environment, training, innovation and technological development, enterprises' external promotion, reinvestment of profits, the promotion of careers in business, and so forth. The CEOE electoral assembly reelected Jose Maria Cuevas for a fourth term by approximately 80 percent of the votes and elected the new Executive Council, comprising 90 members, 42 of whom are new, and the Executive Committee, with six deputy chairmanships. [passage omitted] Cuevas avoided assessing the new General Workers Union Confederal Executive Committee, but called on the trade unions to negotiate, dwelt on his message that an in-depth review of the pensions system must be conducted, and backed better fiscal treatment for complementary systems. Last, the CEOE chairman referred to the international situation and expressed his concern that the European Union is losing ground to other large areas of the developed world. "The reasons for these losses are wages and contributions, the reduction of investments that are going to other areas, the weight of the public sector, and the fact that every private sector employee must keep two people, including pensioners, officials, and so forth." He advocated a reduction of the state's weight in the economy: "All enterprises that are viable in the private sector must be returned to the market, regulations and useless administrative burdens must be reduced, and insofar as the state adjusts to its role, it will be possible to reduce taxes and social charges."
