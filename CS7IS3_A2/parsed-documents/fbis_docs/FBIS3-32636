FBIS3-32636 "drlat030_a_94011" FBIS-LAT-94-030 Document Type:Daily Report 14 Feb 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Visa Denials, Emigrants' Plight Highlighted FL1002165494 FL1002165494 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish at 1255 GMT on 10 February carries several news reports relating to emigration and the activities of the U.S. Interests Section, as well as to the perception of these activities by the general population in Cuba. In a preview of upcoming stories, the announcer says: "Cuban emigration to the United States will continue to be the focus of analysis in this half-hour of Rebelde's `Doing Radio' program. Expect new details on this topic of great national prominence from Zenaida Costales, who is still at the so-called Park of Lamentations on the corner of Calzada and K Street, in the vicinity of the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana." The announcer says, further: "You too can participate in the topic. Call us at 32-82-97." This preview is followed by the announcement: "The `Doing Radio' program's automatic answering machine is your friend. Leave your message right now. After hearing the tone, you have 30 seconds to say hello or to express your opinions." A tone is heard, and then a woman says: "Hello from Comrade Lucy Estela, a listener of this program. Concerning my opinion on emigration: There has always been emigration, but there are many ways of emigrating. There is the emigration of the patriot and there is the emigration of the traitor. At the present time, to emigrate is to flee the difficulties. Any Cuban who really feels Cuban at the present time stays here in Cuba, and all together, we struggle -- for this is not the time to emigrate. This is a time to stay inside the fatherland and struggle. And the Americans are waging a policy, precisely, against all those people who are today abandoning the country because of a few difficulties that we are having. Because if we look at other countries, they are worse off than we are. We may be hungry, and there may be shortages, and we may have difficulties, but we have a fatherland. Others have no fatherland. And to emigrate at the present time is an act of cowardice. And the Americans take advantage of those cowards to wage political propaganda against us, trying to make it look like Cuba does not let people leave. And it has been said here that Cubans may leave the country whenever they like. But what do the Americans do? They try to get people to leave clandestinely and to have them (?drown) en route, so that they can later blame us, the Cubans; blame Fidel, who has given this people so much! And that is why we say: Yes, let he who wishes to emigrate right now go ahead and emigrate. The holes in the ranks do not matter if we who remain are firm, as Raul said. The Fatherland or death! We will win. "Lucy Estela, of San Lazaro, #464." This, in turn, is followed by what is said to be a live mobile unit report. An announcer says: "We are now in contact with the `Doing Radio' program's mobile unit and Zenaida Costales, who I understand is still at the Park of Lamentations, right?" A second announcer adds: "At the park on Calzada and K Streets, near the offices of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. I am listening, Zenaida. Good morning." Costales says: "Yes, thank you. Here we are again, broadcasting from very near the offices of the U.S. Interests Section, where hundreds of people remain, standing vigil in an interminable line that will permit them to find out once and for all whether or not they will be able to travel to the United States. I should tell you that in 1993, Cuba authorized the temporary exit of 100,000 people, but only 30,000 were able to travel. The remaining 70,000 were denied visas by the U.S. Government. Why? These testimonies contain some of the answers." Approximately 1.5 minutes of excerpts of conversations with unidentified speakers follow. One man says: "Hope is the only thing one cannot afford to lose in this life." "What if they say no?" -- asks the reporter. The man answers: "They are obliging me to do something I would rather not do. I would like to go see my grandparents and come back. But they are obliging me to do something else." Costales says: "Perhaps what he does not want to do is leave illegally, but for him, that appears to be his only alternative. "This is Zenaida Costales for the `Doing Radio' program. Good day." An announcer thanks Costales for her report and asks her to return to the studio to discuss this matter further. Next, Roberto (Geli) [not further identified] notes that the last speaker, "who appears to be a young person," seems to be a candidate for illegal emigration/immigration, asking: "And I wonder: Who is at fault or as a consequence of what?" (Geli) notes that this kind of illegal emigration/immigration takes place in many parts of the world, adding that in the case of Cuba, "the total number of rafters rescued, or who arrived in U.S. territory in 1993 from our territory was 3,656." "The 1992 figure was 2,556, which, in turn, was approximately 400 people more than the 1991 figure of 2,203 -- which cannot be compared with the 1990 figure, which was only 467." (Geli) notes that the number of emigrants coincides with the beginning of increasing economic difficulties in Cuba because of the collapse of the socialist bloc, plus an intensification of the U.S. blockade against Cuba. He says, further: "At the same time, another element that cannot be forgotten is that also as of 1991, the quote calls unquote to emigrate illegally made from U.S. territory have increased -- with calls not to stay on the island; to show, through this, a rejection of the Cuban political process, or the Cuban political project." Citing official U.S. sources, (Geli) notes that 582 Cuban rafters disappeared in the Florida straits in 1993 while attempting to emigrate illegally,"and 28 are known to have died," including children. (Geli) asks himself: "And I wonder, [Rebelde journalist Roberto] Cavada, and dear listeners, how these people who emigrate this way deal with their feelings? I wonder what one feels when one can no longer see the place where one spent one's childhood anytime one wishes, when one cannot visit one's long-time friends and life-long relatives, when one turns one's back on the national identity and on what we Cubans call `things Cuban'? "What does one feel when one knows that those here are going through a difficult phase, a phase full of shortages, problems, and diverse difficult circumstances -- but nevertheless do not turn their backs, and instead stay close to the family, close to their dreams, close to their ideas? It is no doubt a very complex problem, of course -- and having to confront such a problem daily must cause true chaos in more than a few of the people who emigrate anywhere in the world. "I am of course talking about those who think and feel. And I say this because we all know that there are some among those who leave who exhibit all to the contrary -- when they leave even sick family members, old people, and children in order to go off seeking that which every emigrant terms paradise. That is what I have to say, for the moment, Cavada." The journalists agree to discuss this matter further in the future.
