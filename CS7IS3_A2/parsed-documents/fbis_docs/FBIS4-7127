Korean `PM'" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- Yi Hoe-chang a few days ago tendered his resignation as "prime minister [PM]" of South Korea four months after his appointment and Kim Yong-sam immediately endorsed it. NODONG SINMUN today views his resignation as a virtual dismissal by the traitor Kim Yong-sam who hated his recent acts and words as a "challenge to the presidential authority." His recent acts and words in question are that Yi Hoe-chang "attempted to control the state affairs" by ordering the participants in a "coordinating meeting on the policy of reunification and security" to report the results of the meeting before implementing them. The meeting was held with the participation of "Chongwadae [presidential office]" clan and "cabinet ministers" concerned, but in his absence. The news analyst says: The power struggle erupted because both the traitor Kim Yong-sam and the "prime minister" were captives to greed for "government power." South Korea is a virtual colony of the United States, so the "president" Kim Yong-sam cannot make a "policy" at his will. This being the fact, it is foolish of the "prime minister" to try to lead the "administration". Yi Hoe-chang's lot is the unavoidable fate of a colonial puppet. Anyhow, it is obvious that the dismissal of the "prime minister" is a product of the crisis of the "civilian government" of South Korea. It is one year or more since the emergence of the Kim Yong-sam regime but the third "prime minister" has to be appointed now. How long will this unstable home be maintained? Shouts for "down with Kim Yong-sam" are growing louder outdoors and the power struggle is getting more serious indoors. This is a sign of the collapse of the "civilian government."
