FBIS3-27849 "dreas021_a_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-021 Document Type:Daily Report 1 February 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Takemura Discusses Approval of Reform Package OW3001141794 OW3001141794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in Japanese at 2239 GMT on 29 January, in its regularly-scheduled "News 2001" program, carries a 28-minute interview with Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, and head of Sakigake (Harbinger Party). The live interview, conducted in an Asahi Television studio in Tokyo, and moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama, is joined from time to time by regular guest commentators Kenichi Takemura, columnist, and Yoshiaki Kobayashi, a professor at Keio University. Kuroiwa begins the interview by asking Takemura to comment on the view that the Prime Minister's Office and coalition leaders, such as Ichiro Ozawa, worked in harmony for the first time in a long time to have the political reform bills approved. Takemura says: "The five representatives of the ruling parties, including Ozawa, were in charge of contacting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). In a different sense, the Prime Minister's Office, or the government, was also in contact with the LDP. Rather than saying we acted in concert, I should say the LDP's responses to us changed significantly. Both sides were feeling good about the situation. There were almost no differences of opinion within the ruling parties, and the only thing we had in mind was to reach an agreement with the LDP. Because of this, everything went well." Asked to explain when the political reform compromise package will be enacted, Takemura answers: "The preamble of the memorandum states that the revised bills will be approved before we start deliberations on the original fiscal 1994 budget at the next ordinary Diet session, which will start tomorrow (31 January). They will probably be approved before the end of February. An enforcement date will be decided at that time." Regarding the contents of the package, and particularly corporate contributions of political funds, Takemura explains the significance of the agreement is that a politician will designate a single fund-raising organization to which donations can be paid, and the maximum amount of a corporate contribution will be reduced to 500,000 yen per annum. Pointing out that the recent agreement is just the first step toward political reform, Kobayashi asks Takemura if he is already thinking about the next step. In response, Takemura says: "The task we have to buckle down to is upper house reform. Reform of the local electoral systems is another task." Matsuyama asks if the gap between the Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) and other coalition parties has widened. Takemura answers: "The SDPJ made bold decisions one after another to support the Hosokawa administration. I think the Hosokawa administration survived the past six months and was able to challenge several major tasks thanks to the SDPJ's series of bold compromises. However, the bitter processes in the decision-making within the SDPJ were reported vividly so it appeared to the public as if the existence of the SDPJ itself in the coalition was a problem." As for the possibility of policy cooperation with the LDP in the future, Takemura says: "We should make the recent agreement an occasion to change the harsh relations of the past between the ruling and opposition parties. The LDP members have said from the beginning they would make the LDP a healthy opposition party. We seriously listen to the opinions of the opposition party." On the possibility of including the LDP in the coalition, Takemura says: "We still have not talked about it at all." Takemura also rules out the possibility of uniting all political parties into two major parties. However, he admits there is a movement among the ruling parties -- between Sakigake and a SDPJ group led by former SDPJ Secretary General Akamatsu, for example -- to hold joint study sessions. On the possibility of uniting Sakigake with Prime Minister Hosokawa's Japan New Party, Takemura says: "I think it is only a matter of time." After briefly discussing the contents of a book Takemura wrote recently, moderator Matsuyama asks Takemura to explain what he meant by describing Japan as a country that is small but "shines." Takemura explains that, in the international community, Japan is perceived by many to be small because it does not make sufficient international contributions in nonmilitary areas, including environmental protection and fighting against drug trafficking, but it does stand out as a country. Returning to the issue of reorganizing the political world under the new electoral system, Takemura says: "We cleared the first hurdle yesterday. We need to make some amendments in the future. However, we politicians are seriously thinking about how we will win elections under the new system. It is an instinctive reaction. This mean that serious discussions on reorganization of the political world will start soon. I think it is inevitable." Asked when the new electoral system will become effective, Takemura says: "Around this fall at the earliest, if the lower house is dissolved. However, we still have three and half more years before our term of office runs out." On the possibility of reorganizing the political world within this year, Takemura answers: "I think we have a 100 percent possibility of reorganizing the political world before the next election."
