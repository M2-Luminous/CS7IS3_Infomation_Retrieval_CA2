The merger of sterling into a common European currency would, on the other hand, be the type of constitutional change justifying a referendum, not now, but at the time it was proposed. UK ministers are, moreover, deceiving themselves if they believe that the issue has conveniently gone away, as it seemed it might have done a few months ago. At the beginning of August 1993, the old 2.25 percent exchange rate mechanism [ERM] grid succumbed to a speculative attack. An emergency meeting of finance ministers widened the grid to 15 percent on either side of the central parities. This was so broad as to constitute virtually freely floating rates. The Euro-sceptics could hardly restrain their joy. The derailment of the ERM would, they hoped, put paid to the more ambitious European Monetary Union [EMU] project. But then a strange thing happened. The French Government did not take advantage of its freedom from ERM constraints to slash interest rates, but continued to follow the Bundesbank lead. And the franc, instead of diving like sterling and the lira after they left the ERM, recovered. It re-entered the old grid at the beginning of last December and has not strayed far from it since. The fundamentals of a better-than-German inflation performance reasserted themselves over the instant cynicism of the currency markets. A similar story with minor variations applies to the other `core' members of the ERM, including the Belgian-Luxembourg franc and the Danish krone. The Netherlands guilder has remained within even narrower limits. And the Austrian schilling -- technically outside the ERM -- has remained close to the D-Mark. There is room for argument about whether the French and other governments were right to stick so long within the narrow ERM bands without a realignment in view of the long period of high German interest rates. But having kept to the policy during the most difficult period, it would be an unnecessary sacrifice of counter-inflationary credibility -- as well as of wider political aims -- to abandon the D-Mark related policy now, just when German interest rates are approaching levels with which neighbours can live. It is worth noting that, although the UK was able to cut interest rates early as a result of leaving the ERM, British short-term rates are now no lower than French or German ones; and long-term rates are 1-1.5 percentage points higher -- the market's verdict on the credibility of a go-it-alone policy without an independently accountable central bank. Where do we go from here? An EU summit has to decide not later than December 31, 1996 whether a majority of member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of a single currency. The summit can fix a date for EMU [economic and monetary union] at any time during 1997 and 1998. If, however, a date has not been set by the end of 1997, "the third stage (ie EMU) shall start on January 1 1999." Another summit, voting by qualified majority, will decide which members fulfil the necessary conditions. There is no minimum number. Conditions which EMU participants must satisfy are: - A rate of inflation "close to that of the three best performing states"; - Convergence of long-term interest rates; - A "sustainable government financial position"; - The observance of "the normal fluctuation margins" of the ERM "for at least two years without devaluing against the currency of any other member state." The two EU countries with the lowest inflation rate are France and Ireland with a rate of less than 2 percent a year. The UK, Belgium and Luxembourg tie for third position with 2.3 percent, followed by Germany with 3.2 percent and the Netherlands with 3.9 percent. The convergence of long-term bond yields has gone even further for the core countries, where they stand at about 6.5-7 percent. The fiscal guidelines appear the most troublesome. A Maastricht protocol mentions a budget deficit limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product and a debt ratio not exceeding 60 percent. Only Luxembourg and Ireland fulfilled the deficit criteria last year. The Bundesbank is particularly keen on these criteria, and would be unlikely to recommend giving up the D-Mark if they were too obviously flouted. Nevertheless the Maastricht Treaty itself provides (Article 104c) escape provisions if the excess deficit is "exceptional and temporary" or if the excess is declining. The central condition remains the final one about exchange rate behaviour. The Treaty says nothing about the narrow 2.25 percent band. Thus, theoretically, members could declare the present 15 percent margins to be the normal ones. But it is inconceivable they will move to EMU if market exchange rates are fluctuating throughout the wide band. The French and the other governments are not disposed to tempt fate by re-entering a narrow official ERM grid in the foreseeable future. What they are doing is to commit an even greater crime in Euro-sceptic eyes -- namely shadowing the D-Mark. This means that in the face of a determined currency attack there will be no firm floor for the speculators to aim at, and there could be temporary dips, such as that in the last few months of 1993. But monetary policy will be conducted with the aim of keeping currencies near to the D-Mark. If the inner group currencies remain de facto close to their central rates, the governments concerned may move directly to monetary union, bypassing the narrow ERM stage. This route has been envisaged for these countries by, among others, Eddie George, Bank of England governor. The crucial step provided for in the Maastricht treaty is for the participating governments to declare their parities "irrevocably fixed." After that and a good deal of preparation -- existing currencies would be replaced by the ECU. Such developments would not be entertained until the European Union is clearly out of recession and German unification no longer distorts policy. Some governments might then want to move quickly while conditions remain right, and before too many other countries had joined Italy in acquiring Euro-sceptics in important government posts. To those who are neither federalists nor nationalists the relevant questions are clear enough. A single currency means a single monetary policy tailored to the average needs of the EU as a whole, just as Federal Reserve policy is designed for average U.S. conditions rather than the particular needs of California or New England. Would the advantages in reduced uncertainty and transaction costs outweigh the disadvantages of not being able to follow a monetary policy adapted (within limits) to the needs of particular parts of Europe? And what would be the gain for countries of doubtful counter-inflationary credibility -- as the UK still is -- from substituting a European currency under a European Central Bank [ECB] modelled on the Bundesbank for its own? It would also be necessary to cast a weather eye on the likelihood of the new ECB being just as vigilant to avoid contractionary movements of nominal demand as of rising inflation. And finally, if EMU is going to go ahead in any case, what would be the downside risk to the UK of staying outside? Not necessarily the same as it would be for Switzerland or small Southeast Asian economies without a currency anchor. These are the questions which need to replace the futile UK debate on the Conservative leadership.
