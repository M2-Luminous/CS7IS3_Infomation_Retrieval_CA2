He said the visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger felt that the move, initiated by several industrialised countries, would adversely affect the competitive edge of developing countries. Without the advantage of cheap labour, the developing countries would not be able to progress well. Abdullah was speaking to reporters after attending a meeting between Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed and Bolger at the Prime Ministers Department here. The New Zealand premier and his wife, Joan, arrived here Wednesday for a three-day official visit. Both the prime ministers agreed that the move to link the trade issue with matters relating to humanity will affect free trade and open market system, Abdullah said. He also said that Kuala Lumpur and Wellington had agreed to create as many forums as necessary to discuss matters relating to bilateral relations and regional problems. The forums which might have the same objective as joint-commission but in different forms, could be established when necessary, he added. Abdullah said Dr. Mahathir and Bolger also agreed that the forums need not have any definite dialogue framework but should be in the form of free discussions. New Zealand had also suggested that there should be exchange visits in the form of working holiday between the youths of both countries to help strengthen relations between the peoples of the two countries, Abdullah said. New Zealand now has a similar programme with Japan.
