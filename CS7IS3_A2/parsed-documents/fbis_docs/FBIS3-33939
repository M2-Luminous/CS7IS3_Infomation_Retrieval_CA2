The sources said that "if 'Arafat would have signed the document first, Rabin would have accepted it." The sources said that during the Davos meeting, there was ongoing telephone and facsimile contacts between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and the prime minister, as well as between Major General 'Uzi Dayan, a member of the Israeli delegation, and the military top brass. Ongoing consultations were also held between Rabin, Baraq, Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq, head of intelligence Uri Sagi, and the Shin Bet chief. They transmitted their comments to Davos by facsimile. "The Army top brass had many observations about the initial drafts presented to the Palestinian delegation," the political sources said, "but they support the final document. They said that they have comments on several minor and noncritical points, but in principle they feel that the PLO accepted the Israeli position." In deliberations held prior to the foreign minister's departure for Davos, in which the prime minister and the defense team participated, the Army brass firmly opposed for security reasons some of the proposals raised by Peres. They demanded that Israel keep full control of the roads to the Gaza Strip settlements and that it be made clear that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will continue to move along the traffic axes termed "safe corridors" between Jericho and the Allenby Bridge, al-Nabi Musa, and the Dead Sea.
