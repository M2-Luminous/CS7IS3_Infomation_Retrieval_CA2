Earlier this year Libya announced that it would not hire any Thai workers. Libyan employers have begun to hire many workers from China and Vietnam to replace outgoing Thai workers. Piti Chuchunmanakit, manager of the Siri and Son Job Placement Company, which places Thai workers in Libyan jobs, said Libya has implemented a new policy which bars completely the hiring of Thai workers. Cooperation has been sought from employers to gradually send all Thai workers home. In three more months, the contracts of most Thai workers will have expired and they will have to return home. According to Piti, Libya's annoucement was first regarded as merely a threat. Recently, the Libyan Government sent circulars to employers telling them to stop hiring Thai workers. Piti said he could not estimate how many Thai workers would be sent home, noting that the number of Thai workers is quite large. He said: "About 800 workers placed by my firm now remain in Libya. All of them would have to return home in three months." Piti said, among Middle East countries, Libya has a very big demand for foreign workers. Huge projects, such as gas and oil distilleries, are at the beginning stage. Thousands of Thai workers could have found jobs there if it had not been for the international political problem. Piti added that Libya and Iran pay the highest wages in the Middle East. Despite the number of Thai workers in Liyba, the Thai Government and the Labor Ministry have not attempted to solve the problem on their behalf. As a solution, job placement firms will probably look to Iran, where wages are also high. [passage omitted]
