SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met separately with the heads of the LDP and the tiny New Party Sakigake, a splinter party from the LDP, in efforts to consolidate its standing in forming a new cabinet following Hata's resignation announced Saturday. Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed to seek election of a new premier Tuesday, and both parties later ruled out an extension of the term of the current 150-day regular Diet session, which expires Wednesday. Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff in order to pave the way for an early creation of the new government. Kono proposed a trilateral meeting with Murayama and Sakigake head Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary for Hata's predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, for a breakthrough pact. The meeting could lead to a crucial tripartite coalition to form the new ruling camp, political analysts said. The Monday meeting between the SDP and Sakigake heads produced a joint call for a "dove" or soft-line government based on their agreed policy outline. Takemura, leery of what he believes to be the high-handed leadership of Shinseito and Komeito in the coalition, made clear his party has no plan to reconcile with the group, urging Murayama to head the new government. Meanwhile, the minority coalition, which lost its grip on power when Hata stepped down after only two months in office, played a wait-and-see strategy, turning down the SDP's overture for a meeting between Murayama and Hata. In a meeting of the party top brass, the coalition confirmed its policy of waiting for the SDP's initiative for fresh talks on policy agreement before any high-stakes meeting between the party heads. The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the Murayama-Hata talks by 11 a.m. [0200 GMT] Tuesday. If the coalition remains cool to the SDP's proposal, the Socialists will discard efforts to strike an alliance with the coalition and start whole-hearted negotiations with the LDP, insiders said. Murayama underscored the possibility of an accord with the LDP, saying at a meeting of SDP members of the House of Councillors, "if there is no room for talks with the coalition, we should seek (another) way for creating a government." Neither the SDP nor the LDP, however, is monolithic about forgetting their long history of bad blood and antagonism to join hands. A group of liberals in the SDP called "Democrats" urged the party leadership to reject the LDP's call for alliance and start reconciliation talks with the coalition. Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are tilting toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said. "Consensus within the party is materializing for a trilateral coalition (with the SDP and Sakigake)," said Koichi Kato, a senior LDP lawmaker. But a group led by former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe made a renewed call for talks with the coalition for a possible new conservative alliance.
