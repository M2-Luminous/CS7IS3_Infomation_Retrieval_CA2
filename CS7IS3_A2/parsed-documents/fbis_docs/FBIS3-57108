There is almost no doubt that the masterminds of the "Union..." -- deputies Aleksandr Braginskiy, Irina Khakamada, and the already mentioned Mr. Makarov -- who had managed, in less than a week's time, to double the number of their supporters, will successfully clear this last hurdle as well. Already now they hold 22 applications from deputies who intend to join their group, and eight verbal assurances from colleagues who are ready to write such application "even today." True, deputies Braginskiy and Khakamada had to approach nearly all the existing factions: starting from Russia's Choice, they turned in sequence to the leaders of Yabloko, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, the Democratic Party of Russia, and finally Vladimir Medvedev's New Regional Policy with a request to delegate voluntarily their supporters to the new group. Let us note that their efforts met with the least understanding precisely in Russia's Choice, and it is from there that a considerable number of deputies finally fled to Khakamada's colors. The greatest sensation among such deserters was produced by Boris Fedorov, who was absolutely enraged -- as one can conclude from the series of interviews he gave on Sunday and Monday -- at the fact that Yegor Gaydar's decision to renounce participation in the new government had been preceded by consultations with all sorts of people rather than with the closest cabinet associate. As is known, Choice paved the way to parliament for this same Makarov or, say, Mikhail Kisilev, who told journalists yesterday he was changing his faction allegiance. It is enough to state even these samples: "Russia's Choice has passed up the chance to create a `satellite faction' linked to it by strict and long-term commitments of joint activities in parliament. The "Union of 12 December" is now being born despite, rather than thanks, to it. The good-natured parting words like Yegor Gaydar's phrase, "We have nothing against the new faction, and will obviously form a block in a friendly manner with them," appear belated and not quite sincere. Essentially, though, leaders of "Choice" should not have special reasons for fears: it is not Communists, really and truly, that Choice will have to take cues from in important voting. One must assume that the skeptical attitude by the leaders of Choice to the efforts of Mr. Braginskiy and Mrs. Khakamada was based, it is easy to guess, on the unpleasant memories of the cruel scandal thrown at them by a group of supporters in the course of the famous conference at "Lesnyye Dali" [holiday spot near Moscow] shortly before the opening of the Duma session. Several recent members of the movement's Executive Committee spoke at that time against appointing Yegor Gaydar head of the faction, and supported the candidature of Gennadiy Burbulis. Mr. Burbulis for that matter preferred to be shy and say nothing, and Andrey Makarov led the riot. It is not surprising that, getting the wind of the latter's efforts (which had been carefully concealed by him until recently) to split off some deputies from the "maternal faction," observers were awaiting a statement from Mr. Burbulis on supporting this initiative and maybe on taking over the functions of leader of the "allies." But on reflection, the splitters finally convinced each other that it is not quite decent for deputies elected on party lists to violate the political residency qualification by so quickly and easily going back on their election commitments. This triumph for common sense was helped by, among other things, fears of the Duma's impending approval of a law on deputy status: no potential defector is guaranteed that the law would not incorporate a norm on the automatic transfer of the seat of a deputy showing a bent for disorderly political contacts to the candidate next on the party list. Formulating, so far unofficially, the position of their group, organizers of the "Union of 12 December" are speaking especially often about their disagreement with the creation of what Mrs. Khakamada described as "Duma politburo," in the shape of the council of the leaders of factions and the already elected chairman of the chamber. "The agreement on the inadmissibility of whatever compacts with the Communists and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has been broken by the heads of Choice," stated Deputy Makarov in an interview for SEGODNYA. "The package agreement on electing leaders of the Duma and of its committees has become a model of bargaining in a situation where all bargaining is out of place. The genius to strike bargains has been shown in the most graphic manner by Mikhail Poltoranin, who received direct powers to do that from Gaydar himself.
