"We are doing everything to prevent air strikes," Lavrov announced in parliament, "and we consider the NATO ultimatum illegitimate." Russian repersentatives to the UN Security Council were instructed to oppose NATO air strikes, he said, adding that as a request by Moscow, the UN Security Council had created a special committee to investigate the earlier mortar shell explosion in a downtown Sarajevo marketplace, in which 68 civilians were killed and 200 wounded. The Russian official said that even a limited air strike against Serb military positions would alter fundamentally the political and military situation in Bosnia and the whole of Europe. It would mean, he said, the failure of a peaceful settlement of the Bosnia conflict. The deputy foreign minister said that NATO's threat to bomb did not correspond to UN decisions. Russia was prepared to object to any actions running counter to UN resolutions, he noted.
