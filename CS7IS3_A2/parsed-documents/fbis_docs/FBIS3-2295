How are our reforms to develop? Will there be risks? Where lie the hopes? In order to more accurately understand and grasp the trend of development of economic reform, this reporter visited the economist Fan Hengshan, who has been engaged in the work of overall planning and policy research for economic structural reform for many years, and put to him some questions which are of wide concern to the people. [Zhou] Since the beginning of 1994, there has been overall implementation of the total reform strategy with very powerful measures. Why have so many reform measures been implemented at once and what is the innate relationship between them? [Fan] I believe that, apart from manifesting the demands of reform as it enters the crucial period, the pushing forward of these reform measures is, generally speaking, consistent with the strategy of "overall progress and breakthroughs in key points." It is also in accord with the requirement to "have the new structure replace the old as quickly as possible." First, these reform measures manifest the demand for coordinated reform. The setting down of the target of a market economy structure has meant that our reforms are not just tinkering with or patching up the original structure but for achieving essential change. Thus, the goal of our reform is an entirety, a system. The reform measures must also be overall and not just in some areas. In the reforms up till now, the relatively independent measures have been implemented quite well. However, the possibility and effectiveness of their further development will not be determined mainly by these measures themselves but, more importantly, by how other measures are coordinated with them. Thus, the concurrent pushing forward of many reforms is inevitable if there is to be coordination. Only in this way will the various individual reforms see development and will the reform measures themselves not restrict each other but will, instead, form a joint force. As an example, if we do not put property rights into order and do not establish a modern system which can manifest property rights restraints and interests restraints, enterprises will be unable to truly realize autonomous operations and responsibility for their own profits and losses. It will also be impossible to establish a system whereby they take responsibility for maintaining and increasing the value of state assets, to guard against the large-scale erosion of state assets. It will also be impossible to truly transform government functions or to form a competitive market system in which market signals are accurate and economic relationships are rational. Also, the reforms in the revenue, financial, planning, investment and foreign exchange spheres, such as implementing a revenue-sharing financial system, restructuring the financial system in accordance with market economy requirements, strengthening the macroeconomic nature, strategic nature, policy nature, and medium- and long-term nature of planning; establishing the status of enterprises as investment entities; and realizing the merger of the different types of exchange rates, are significant, not only in creating an indirect macroeconomic management system, but also in the fact that, at the same time, they are creating conditions whereby enterprises can shed their fetters and move toward the market. For example, changing the specialized banks into true commercial banks which have profits as their basic goal, will mean that the relationship between the commercial banks and the enterprises will be completely equalized and marketized. Decisions regarding to whom credit will be given and how much credit is to be provided, what interest rates will be charged and how long the repayment period will be, and whether repayment will be required on the set date or whether the credit can be extended, will be decided between the banks and the enterprises in accordance with their earnings and risks. The banks will no longer be dependent on the administrative organs and the enterprises will no longer be dependent on the banks. Further, this coordination must not only be manifested in the three major aspects of economic structural reform, that is, among macroeconomic management, enterprises, and the market, but also manifested in the various links in all major aspects. For example, the various macroeconomic reform measures now being promoted have all been coordinated in terms of switching central government functions from where the central government managed everything to where it only controls the overall major matters. At the same time, the forms by which these functions are implemented will be made more scientific and more subject to the market. No matter whether it is dividing central and local jurisdictions, establishing the position of the People's Bank of China as the central bank, bringing the mechanism of market competition into the investment sphere, or freeing foreign exchange operations and realizing exchange rate merger, the aims all lie in this. Further, this coordination is also manifested within the various links. For example, in the reform of the financial structure, the central bank will change from where it implements target management and quota control to where it regulates standard interest rates and regulates the activities of specialized banks through reserve fund and discounting interest rates and by engaging in open market business and other economic measures. In this way, the specialized banks will truly become commercial banks which decide on their own operations, take sole responsibility for their own profits and losses, and which operate in coordination with the policy-nature banks which solely engage in government-type financial business. Both types are essential. At the same time, these reforms also manifest the focal points and they are very important links in the new structural framework. For diverse reasons, they also have high coordination requirements, wide-ranging effects, and touch quite deeply the relationship between power and interests. They are also being carried out at links which have fallen behind in the reforms. For example, through over 10 years of reform of the macroeconomic structure, the strength of administrative management has been greatly reduced and the role of the market mechanism in deploying resources and regulating the economy has clearly expanded. There has been a shift from the direct management mode with major reliance on mandatory planning and the fixing of quotas, the approving of projects, the distribution of investment, and the allocation of goods and materials, to where there is greater reliance on economic and legal measures in regulating economic activities. The traditional macroeconomic management structure has thus seen basic transformation. However, as compared with the demands of economic activities, and relative to the reforms in other economic spheres, the progress has not been great, the results have not been good, and the responsibilities of the regulatory and control entities have not been made clear. This has prevented forces from being combined and has actually resulted in mutual impeding. The administrative nature of regulatory and control measures is still very strong and their transitional nature is not in accord with the demands of a market economy. This restricts the progress of reform in other aspects and has given rise to many deep contradictions and problems. This situation has now reached a stage where there cannot be reforms without great efforts being made. In respect to the reform of the enterprise system, over the last few years, we have also continued to place the focus of reform on enlivening enterprises, especially on enlivening medium and large state-owned enterprises, and adopted many measures in this regard. However, for various reasons, including misunderstandings on the question of how to interpret the public-ownership system, it has been impossible to place the focus of reform on putting property rights in order, so as to establish a modern enterprise system which is in accord with the requirements of a market economy. In this way, not only has it been impossible to form a mechanism for raising efficiency, and for guaranteeing and increasing the value of state-owned assets, but it has resulted in some people making improper use of opportunities. At the same time as enterprise performances have been poor and vigor insufficient, many of the state-owned assets have been transformed from public to private ownership and they have been appropriated by a small number of individuals. Thus, at the same time as upholding coordination, and grasping these key points to achieve breakthroughs, so that they can play a guiding role, we must grasp the opportunity to establish the framework of a new structure as quickly as possible. [Zhou] Putting forward these reform measures will undoubtedly play an important role in the building of a new structure. However, reform is a revolution which affects deep relations and power structures and entails certain risks. What are your views on the opportunities and risks for reform this year and in future? [Fan] This can be considered from the two angles of results and process. Speaking in terms of the results of reform, it will inevitably provide opportunities for people and for society. These opportunities must be manifested at different levels and in different areas. Speaking from quite a high level, as soon as a good structure is established, it will be possible to promote the sustained, healthy, and rapid development of the economy; to advance the productive forces to the greatest possible degree; and to provide people with convenience in many respects. This includes spiritual, material, production, and livelihood aspects. Speaking from a quite concrete level, each complete system or structural link can bring people advantages in one or many respects. For example, if we establish a competitive and open labor employment system, the space and opportunities for laborers to choose their employment will be greatly expanded and mental and physical abilities will be given full play in the most appropriate post (production conditions). However, as far as the process of reform is concerned, this will not only provide opportunities but also involve risks. This is because the process of reform is itself a readjustment of the powers and interests of some entities. Even if interests are enhanced, as the reforms are still in process and the focuses of the reforms are not exactly the same, it is impossible to give everyone interests and benefits at the same level and at the same time. That is to say, opportunities will not exist at the same time and to the same degree for everyone. Meanwhile, during the reform process, risks might arise at any time and the results of these may affect everyone. An example of this is price fluctuations. However, risks and opportunities can be transformed. If the relationships between all sides are properly handled, and if the good opportunities and modes are grasped, it will be possible to reduce risk to the lowest possible degree and thereby provide people with the greatest degree of opportunities over the greatest range. In speaking of the risks in the process of reform, I believe that the greatest risk is the one whereby the distortions of the reform measures, caused by various factors, result in a situation where there is nominal pursuit of a market economy but what is produced is actually a marriage of the powers manifested by the planned economy with the interests manifested by the market economy and that, in the end, will cost society dearly. If foul water is tossed on the head of the market economy and this leads to its end, it will be difficult to seek further opportunities for market economy operation. [Zhou] I have noticed that in recent years, you have stated that we must be vigilant against distortions in the building of the market economy, and some of your views have attracted strong responses from society. Why have you laid special stress on this issue? Could you speak a little more about the causes of the distortions? [Fan] It needs to be especially pointed out that with our special ideological atmosphere and structural basis, it is particularly easy for distortions to occur in economic construction. Speaking in respect of the first, our theoretical guidance has long been the ideological concepts of the planned economy and, having always lived in a planned economy environment, we are used to ideas and language related to planning. For example, we feel very strange with language like capital, shares, credit cards, and open market business, which is the language of the market economy. However, we are quite familiar with terms like targets, quotas, allocations and examination and approval. Thus, consciously or unconsciously, we use these ways of thinking and concepts in appraising and selecting new reform actions and measures. This results in the building of the market economy structure moving toward a fork in the road. Speaking in terms of the latter aspect, we have long implemented a system which is essentially opposite to the market economy. We are now switching from a planned economic system in which mandatory planning plays the main part, toward a market system. The former is a tight system formed over many years and its structural base and "inertia" produce a counteracting effect on reform measures. This can result in the reform measures not going into effect or being distorted. The most typical result however, in building the new structure, is that the reform measures end up being "semi-finished products" or having a "dual-track" nature. Thus, in the process of building the new structure, I believe that guarding against the distortion of reform measures is more important than anything else. Relatively speaking, a quicker pace is better than a slower pace. However, speed must be realized on the basis of healthy and solid progress. The achievements in the 10 years of reform have startled the world. However, we can also see that quite a number of the reform measures have been successively alienated, distorted, and warped. In this respect, we also see the problem of reform plans being incomplete and having to be revised in practice but this is not the cause in the majority of cases. If we are able to avoid or reduce such distortions, our achievements can well be greater. Actually, when thinking about the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the central authorities proposed that we would lay down the base for the new structure during the 1980's. Clearly understanding the possibility and seriousness of distortion in building a market economy structure, and putting great efforts into preventing or overcoming such distortions, should be the primary task of the builders of the market economy. If we do well in this respect, it will be the same as grasping the greatest opportunity. [Zhou] In your view, in order to healthily promote the building of the market economy structure, and guard against distortions, which major aspects have to be grasped? [Fen] I believe that we need to grasp the following major aspects: 1. We have to deeply understand the complexity of transforming a planned economy into a market economy. We have to transform thought, we need to raise understanding, and we need to tightly grasp the study of knowledge about a modern market economy and accurately grasp the basic characteristics of a socialist market economy. We also have to practice using the language of market economy operations. These are the most basic and most important links in solidly pushing forward reform. 2. Scientifically grasping the dialectical relationship between the contents of reform, the modes of reform, and the reform environment, to guarantee the smooth implementation of reform. We need to put relationships in order and readjust the structure of powers and interests. Under the precondition of ensuring that the ultimate effects do not harm the essence of the reforms we can, while doing everything possible to take into consideration the various existing interests, adjust actions to the local situations and push forward some essential measures for readjusting powers and interests relationships. At the same time, we must grasp the beneficial opportunities for reform. 3. We need to correctly and properly handle the relationship between conscious fostering by the government and spontaneous development by the market. That is, we must swiftly and properly push forward the building of the new structure and use necessary administrative measures to overcome the blindness, lack of order, and slowness inherent in the spontaneous development by the market. 4. We must bring the construction of the new system onto the track of standardization through laws and guard against the distortion of reform measures. In a certain sense, the process of establishing a new structure is a process of moving from the authority of the administration to the authority of the market and of laws. The market economy is essentially an economy based on the legal system. We need to stress, from a high plane, the combining of economic reform and legislation and bring the building of the new structure onto the track of standardization through legislation.
