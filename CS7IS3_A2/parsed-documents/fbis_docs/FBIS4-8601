According to Gvero, "on the basis of fabricated reasons and untrue reports he made a decision to use the NATO air force against the Serbs and thus caused UNPROFOR to become militarily involved in this civil war on the Muslim side." Gen. Gvero explained that Gen. Rose did this "at a moment when an agreement on the complete and permanent cessation of hostilities throughout the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, as proposed by the Army of the Srpska Republic, was about to be signed." "He personally did not have any objections to our draft agreement," Gen. Gvero said, adding that Gen. Rose even assessed the draft agreement as "too good," but said the Muslims would not sign it. According to Gvero, Rose should have "put pressure on the belligerent Muslims to sign that agreement," but instead of that "he encouraged them and sent the air force against the Serbs, who were proposing peace." "By this he displayed complete partiality and behavior totally at odds with the UN peace mission," Gvero said, stressing that Rose "did not prove to be up to this complex situation." [passage omitted] "While we were able to discuss facts with ease with Rose's compatriot General Ramsey and with other generals -- which is why good results were achieved in those periods -- Gen. Rose cannot rid himself of the syndrome of one-sided textbook schemes, according to which he is a `good guy.' He is always right in advance while all those who are defending their country are bad and incompetent." According to Gvero, Gen. Rose "is behaving in this sensitive situation as if he had just been dropped in with his parachute and had met `bad Serb guys.' That is what he has been told," Gvero stated. "Gen. Rose lost credibility with the Serb people when he finally took off his mask and sent a combat air force to kill civilians and defenders of the Serb territory, and he has neither a moral, nor military, nor political basis to participate any further in the peace process in the area," Gen. Gvero believes. [passage omitted]
