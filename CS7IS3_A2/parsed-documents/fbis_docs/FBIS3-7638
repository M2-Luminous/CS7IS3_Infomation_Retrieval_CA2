The presidential statement demanded by China significantly tones down the message and excludes an inspection deadline and any mention of possible sanctions, they said. A closed-door session is scheduled for Thursday at the United Nations, where the United States may decide to push for a resolution as it first planned, according to the sources. The council had been expected to reach a final agreement at Thursday's session, but that may be impossible due to the dispute among its members, they said. The U.S.-proposed draft resolution gives North Korea one month to accept inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and warns of "further steps" if Pyongyang refuses, referring to economic sanctions. China has opposed such a resolution and proposed a presidential statement instead.
