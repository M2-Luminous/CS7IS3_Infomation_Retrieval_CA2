SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Goal of the Advisory Committee The goal of the Advisory Committee's deliberations will be to develop a consensus among major stakeholders on the sets of policies that would, if adopted, most cost-effectively return greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light trucks to 1990 levels by the years 2005, 2015, and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. (There will be three different sets of policies, one for each year.) The Advisory Committee process is structured this way to generate maximum consideration of potential policies, their interactions and trade-offs and to increase the potential to reach consensus. By law, the Advisory Committee's functions must be purely advisory. Therefore the decisions on the amount and timing of emissions reductions from personal motor vehicles and the policies to attain them, ultimately remain the responsibility of the federal government. However, in the CCAP the Administration stated its intention to take action_regulatory, legislative or otherwise_immediately after the process is completed to begin responding to the problem of increased greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, with or without consensus among the stakeholders. The Advisory Committee will consider a broad range of policy alternatives, including policies affecting: (i) Demand for personal vehicle travel, (ii) vehicle and fuel technology changes (including increases in vehicle and fuel system operating efficiency); and (iii) shifts in consumer choice among vehicle and fuel technology options. Policies to be considered will focus on those that can be implemented by the federal government, but such policies will be considered in the context of what can and should be accomplished at the state, local and regional levels, and by private parties, both consumers and producers. Groups of policies designed to achieve 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions in each of the three targeted years will be evaluated on the basis of costs and projected reductions in metric tons of carbon equivalents (greenhouse gas emissions). Policy groups will also be evaluated on the basis of the speed, reliability, sustainability and efficiency of greenhouse gas reductions; the potential impact of options on urban air pollution and on safety; the cost of alternative policies affecting this sector (including their impact on consumers, jobs, competitiveness and mobility); improvements in energy security; and the feasibility of adoption and ease of implementation. Membership; Steering Committee The Advisory Committee will consist of up to thirty members, appointed for a term of one year from the date of the Committee's first meeting. No employee of the federal government will be a member of the Committee. The Advisory Committee will make recommendations to the President through a steering committee chaired by representatives of the OEP, OSTP and NEC, and consisting of representatives of the other agencies named above. A member or representative of the steering committee will serve as Executive Director of the Advisory Committee and at least one member of the steering committee will attend each meeting of the Advisory Committee and any subcommittees. The deliberations of the Advisory Committee will be assisted by a facilitator under contract to EPA, who will serve as Chair of the Advisory Committee. Members of the Advisory Committee will be chosen by the President, upon the recommendation of the steering committee, to achieve balanced representation of the following stakeholder interests: ␣State, local and regional governments and agencies, including those responsible for land use, transportation, energy use and air quality; ␣Automobile and light truck manufacturers and related parties such as suppliers, dealers and the insurance industry; ␣Labor;
