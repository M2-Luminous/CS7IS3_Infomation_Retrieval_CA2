FR940620-2-00115 FR940620-2-00063 Monday June 20, 1994 Part IX Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention New Vaccine Information Materials; Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 117␣/␣Monday, June 20, 1994␣/␣Notices DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Centers for Disease Control and Prevention New Vaccine Information Materials AGENCY: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: As required by Public Law 99&hyph;660, CDC developed extensive vaccine information materials for distribution by health care providers to distribute prior to their administering particular vaccines. In response to concerns regarding the length and readability of the materials and the process for development of the materials, the law was revised by Public Law 103&hyph;183, the Preventive Health Amendments of 1993, to provide for simplification of the vaccine information materials. On January 26, 1994, CDC published a notice in the Federal Register (59 FR 3752) seeking public comment on proposed new vaccine information materials which were drafted under the revised law. The 60-day comment period ended on March 28, 1994. Following review of the comments submitted and consultation as required under the law, CDC has finalized the new vaccine information materials. Those final materials are contained in this notice. DATES: Effective October 1, 1994, each health care provider who administers any vaccine containing diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, or polio vaccine shall, prior to administration of the vaccine, provide a copy of the relevant vaccine information materials, contained in this notice, to any adult to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine and to the legal representative of any child to whom such provider intends to administer such vaccine. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter A. Orenstein, M.D., Director, National Immunization Program, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Mailstop E&hyph;05, 1600 Clifton Road, NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, telephone (404) 639&hyph;8200. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Title III of Public Law 99&hyph;660 (the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986) added a new Title XXI to the Public Health Service Act. Section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. §300aa&hyph;26) required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop by rule extensive vaccine information materials for distribution by health care providers to the legal representatives of any child receiving particular vaccines (i.e., diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and polio vaccines). These vaccine information materials were issued as a final rule on October 15, 1991 (56 FR 51798; codified at 42 CFR Part 110). Since April 15, 1992, any health care provider who intends to administer one of the covered vaccines is required to provide copies of vaccine information materials that comply with the requirements of section 2126 prior to administration of these vaccines.
