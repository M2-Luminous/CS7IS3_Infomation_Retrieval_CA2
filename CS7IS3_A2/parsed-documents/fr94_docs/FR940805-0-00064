ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Coast Guard establishes regulations that require the owners or operators of existing tank vessels of 5,000 gross tons (GT) or more that do not have double hulls to carry certain emergency lightering equipment on board and foreign flag vessel owners or operators to provide the vessels' International Maritime Organization (IMO) international numbers in the advance notice of arrival report. The purpose of the regulations is to reduce damage to the environment by facilitating response and salvage efforts for a vessel in the case of a collision or grounding. The regulations represent the Coast Guard's first step in designating structural and operational measures for existing tank vessels without double hulls as required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90). DATES: This rule is effective on November 3, 1994. Comments must be received by November 3, 1994.
