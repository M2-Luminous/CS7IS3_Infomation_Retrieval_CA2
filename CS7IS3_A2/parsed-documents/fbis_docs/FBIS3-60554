She expressed concern that young people from the West of Ireland who are thinking of emigrating do not have adequate information about the disease. Latest figures show that AIDS has claimed the lives of 162 Irish people, while more than 1,400 have tested HIV-positive. On a visit to AIDS Health West in Galway, a voluntary organisation of which she is a patron, President Robinson said too many young people were leaving Mayo, Galway, Donegal and Sligo ``at risk of their lives'' because of ignorance.
