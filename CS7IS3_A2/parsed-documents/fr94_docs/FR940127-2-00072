The operating instructions in this document are issued to the States and the cooperating State agencies as guidance provided by the Department of Labor in its role as the principal in the TAA Program. As agents of the United States, the States and cooperating State agencies may not vary from the operating instructions in this document without prior approval from the Department of Labor (DOL). Pending the issuance of regulations implementing the provisions of Title V, the operating instructions in this document shall constitute the controlling guidance for the States and the cooperating State agencies in implementing and administering the new NAFTA&hyph;TAA program, pursuant to the agreements between the States and the Secretary of Labor under Section 239 of the Trade Act. Instructions for implementing the JTPA Title III component, including procedures for accessing the national reserve funds to provide assistance to workers of secondary firms who are adversely affected by NAFTA, will be issued shortly. NAFTA&hyph;TAA amendments are set out in this document according to the section number of the Trade Act affected by each of the amendments. An explanation of each amendment is furnished with an explanation of the regulations principally affected, and with additional instructions on the administration of each amendment. A. Establishment of Transitional Program Section 502 of the Act establishes a new Subchapter D in Chapter 2 of Title II of the Trade Act as follows: A.1. Group Eligibility Requirements. AMENDED LAW . Subsection (a) of section 250 is titled Group Eligibility Requirements. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) sets out the criteria for certifying a worker group for NAFTA&hyph;TAA as follows: A group of workers (including workers in any agricultural firm or subdivision of an agricultural firm) shall be certified as eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under subsection (b) if the Secretary determines that a significant number or proportion of the workers in such workers' firm or an appropriate subdivision of the firm have become totally or partially separated, or are threatened to become totally or partially separated, and either_ (A) that_ (i) the sales or production, or both, of such firm or subdivision have decreased absolutely, (ii) imports from Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles produced by such firm or subdivision have increased, and (iii) the increase in imports under clause (ii) contributed importantly to such workers' separation or threat of separation and to the decline in sales or production of such firm or subdivision; or (B) that there has been a shift in production by such workers' firm or subdivision to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with articles which are produced by the firm or subdivision. ADMINISTRATION . As mentioned above, paragraph (a)(1) sets out the group eligibility criteria for certifying worker groups for transitional adjustment assistance. Two sets of criteria are included in subparagraphs (A) and (B). The criteria in subparagraph (A) are similar to the eligibility criteria in the regular TAA program (section 222 of the Trade Act), except that the criteria for NAFTA&hyph;TAA petitions provide that increased imports must come from Mexico or Canada. Alternatively, and without reference to whether there have been increased imports from Mexico or Canada under subparagraph (A), the criterion under subparagraph (B) confers eligibility if the firm or subdivision of the firm has shifted production to Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive with those produced by the firm or subdivision. Application of Criteria: For purposes of section 250, the following terms are applied: Appropriate subdivision means an establishment in a multi-establishment firm which produces the domestic articles in question or a distinct part or section of an establishment (whether or not the firm has more than one establishment) where the articles are produced. The term ``appropriate subdivision'' includes auxiliary facilities operated in conjunction with (whether or not physically separate from) production facilities. (OTAA has interpreted the term ``establishment'' to include a place of business together with its employees, merchandise, equipment, etc.) Firm means an individual proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, association, corporation (including a development corporation), business trust, cooperative, trustee in bankruptcy, and receiver under decree of any court. A firm, together with any predecessor or successor-in-interest, or together with any affiliated firm controlled or substantially beneficially owned by substantially the same persons, may be considered a single firm. Significant number or proportion of workers means that: a. In most cases the total or partial separations, or both, in a firm or appropriate subdivision thereof, are the equivalent to a total unemployment of five (5) percent of the workers or 50 workers, whichever is less; or
