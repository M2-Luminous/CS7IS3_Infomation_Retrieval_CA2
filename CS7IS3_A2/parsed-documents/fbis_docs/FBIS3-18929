The ministry announced this in Duesseldorf in Wednesday. On Thursday, about 100 refugees from what remains of Yugoslavia are to be flown from Duesseldorf to the Romanian border airport of Timisoara, and then taken by bus to the Serbian border. Three additional special flights have been agreed on with the Romanian state airline Tarom for this month. About 500 asylum-seekers, illegal immigrants, criminals, and refugees with expired residence permits are to be deported from North Rhine-Westphalia to Serbia.
