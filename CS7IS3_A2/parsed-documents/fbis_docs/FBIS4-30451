This was the stand conveyed by Premier Li Peng of China to a Philippine Government and business delegation led by Philippine Vice President Joseph Estrada in a meeting held in Beijing. Li told Estrada that the discussions must be held with one country at a time, and not in a conference hosted by any international group. Estrada noted, however, that the Philippines will stick to the position taken by ASEAN in 1992 -- that its members with claims over the Spratlys must negotiate with China and claimant Vietnam as a group. But Estrada showed his strong (?compose) that the Philippines would seek all peaceful means to resolve the problem. Apart from the Philippines, China, and Vietnam, other claimants to the Spratlys are Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia.
