It has not been forgotten by America. After a year of negligence, the American President has now paid his reverence to Europe. Although Bill Clinton's tight agenda bears resemblance to his fellow citizens' package tours -- it is Tuesday, it must be Prague -- it does fulfill an important purpose. A disheartened continent gets support and, what is more decisive, it experiences the first signs of political determination. Thus, the doubts about this President's priorities in foreign policy should be cleared for the time being. Is America, thus, no longer banking on the "Pacific future"? Is American politics returning to "Eurocentrism," of which Secretary of State Christopher warned as recently as last November? Still, all compliments and oaths of loyalty made by Clinton cannot conceal where he sees his main challenges -- at home, for the social and economic renewal of his country. Apart from that, with its dynamic national economies and huge markets, Asia remains an object of American hope. Europe, instead, only creates interest at the other side of the Atlantic as a nuisance factor [preceding two words in English], or a problem child. Thus, for his trip, the President has neither been inspired by compassion nor by nostalgia but by his very own interests. This is also reflected in the most important statement of his tour: "Europe remains central to our security." That means, America's fate remains linked to Europe's. In light of the atrocities in the Balkans, economic decline and spreading nationalism, the President has reason enough to make his contribution to stabilizing the continent. He is trying in three ways. First, with his appeal to the West Europeans' "collective spirit." Clinton wants the success of the European Union. He is no longer even terrified by the idea of an independent security structure of the Europeans. The advantages of a functioning Union are more important to him than the traditional reservations: Such a union could assume a greater burden in world politics, above all, it could have a stabilizing effect on all of Europe. Those Europeans who ignore this one function of European Union should let the U.S. President remind them of it. Second, with his encouraging backslapping for the East Europeans. The mixed reactions from the Central-East European capitals may relativize the importance of the Partnership for Peace. Yet, under American direction, it was NATO that started to knit an all-European security network, even though it is knitted coarsely still. If it is extended by ever increasing economic streams between East and West, it may be much more conducive to peace than military cooperation. Clinton's motto -- "Trade is more important than aid" -- makes sense. Particularly when America itself is opening its doors even wider to goods from the East. Third, with the support of the Russian reform forces. Different than his predecessor Bush, Clinton banked on intensive support for Russia from the very beginning. After all, the idea of a bursting Russian nuclear empire is enough to focus attention. Still, even the Kremlin could not expect lots of money from the President's visit. Instead, Clinton had to offer advice, respect, and the readiness to intensify Russian-American dialogue. One result of the confidence-building conversation is Ukraine's announcement to give up its nuclear arms. Moscow and Washington were able to move the Ukrainian president to commit himself to it. Yet, the reluctant Parliament in Kiev still has to give its support before at least this nuclear source of danger can be sealed off. What are the impressions Bill Clinton will take home on Sunday? Despite some success he is not likely to feel free from Thomas Jefferson's "complete horror of everything that links us to European politics." The President will have to put up with it in the future, too. America's security does not leave him any other choice.
