It notes: Let us strive harder and advance toward a new victory with revolutionary optimism -- this is an important militant slogan which our party and people must hold high now. The conviction of victory and revolutionary optimism are our invincible ideological and spiritual weapon in the general march of socialism at the present time. What is important in winning a new victory, full of revolutionary optimism, is that the entire people have the unshakable will and faith that they will surely win when they advance under the leadership of our party. The mental support for our people is Comrade Kim Chong-il. All the party members and other working people must always keep in mind the conviction of victory and the future of the revolution, deeply understanding his greatness. Loudly singing the song "We Will Win Because You Are Leading Us," we must have a strong will, fearing no difficulty, adversity and formidable enemy, under the guidance of the dear leader. We must also be firmly convinced of the invincibility of the cause of Korean-style socialism which is vigorously advancing under the banner of the great chuche idea. If our officials and working people are to live and struggle with revolutionary optimism, they must learn from the ideological and spiritual world of Comrade Yi In-mo who steadfastly defended the principle as a revolutionary, convinced of the victory of our revolutionary cause.
