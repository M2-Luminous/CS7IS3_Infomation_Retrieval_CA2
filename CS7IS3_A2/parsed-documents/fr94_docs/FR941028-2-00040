Comment date : November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice. 2. ANR Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;20&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 13, 1994, ANR Pipeline Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243&hyph;1902, filed in Docket No. CP95&hyph;20&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Sections 157.205 and 157.216(b) of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205 and 157.216(b)) for authorization to abandon the South Stevens Point Meter Station located in Portage County, Wisconsin, under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;480&hyph;000, pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. ANR is seeking abandonment authority because the station consists of two, 8-inch orifice meters which are oversized for the present volume demand. ANR proposes to abandon the South Stevens Point Meter Station because to use the station would require unnecessary and expensive downsizing to provide accurate measurement. In Docket No. CP94&hyph;713&hyph;000, ANR proposes to construct a new interconnection (Rosholt Interconnection) to provide continued service to Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (Public Service). ANR will continue to provide service through the South Stevens Point Meter Station until the new Rosholt Interconnection is in place and in service. ANR states that the abandonment will not result in any interruption of service. Public Service is the only customer served by this meter station. The cost of the facilities to be abandoned is approximately $61,000. Comment date: December 5, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice. 3.
