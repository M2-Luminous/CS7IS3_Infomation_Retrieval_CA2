What could awaken feelings anesthetized by injections of Israeli deception more than images of innocent blood shed in the holy place in Hebron? What sanctities do those -- who claim to be the descendants of Abraham -- believe in while they shed innocent blood in the Ibrahimi mosque? What act of international terrorism can be compared with what was committed by the sinful Zionist hand against innocent Palestinians in Hebron today? This is one of a series of similar Zionist terrorist acts that have continued since before 1948. They will not stop as long as Zionists continue their arrogance and sin without meeting deterrence from anyone in the name of humanity, international legitimacy, or international determination to stop their recklessness. They will not stop as long these Zionists continue to see the world's silence about their crimes as collusion giving them a free hand to desecrate anything, with no deterrence of their oppression, terrorism, ambitions, and violations of all noble and honorable human values coming from anyone. What is the reaction of the NATO members, who were justly shocked by the market crime against scores of innocent people in Sarajevo almost two weeks ago? Then, they issued a warning to the killers and delivered an ultimatum, and the killers bowed to the warning. Doesn't Arab blood incite any reaction from them, or even any feeling of sympathy or mercy? It should not be understood from this that Arabs are begging for sympathy or mercy from anyone, or that they are waiting for another international condemnation or denunciation statement. All the international condemnation statements have not restored any of their rights and have not stopped the violent onslaught of Zionist terrorism and aggression. So far, all the international resolutions have failed to enable Palestinians and Arabs to restore any of their rights, because those who control the international will lack the firm determination to force Israel to pay attention to these resolutions. Moreover, rather than employing effective international pressure on Israel to heed international legitimacy's resolutions and principles, we have seen acts of collusion represented by silence or carelessness in order to circumvent this legitimacy. The result of this is the daily horrible massacres and crimes Zionists commit against innocent Palestinians, without concern for values, norms, or principles. The Israeli Government cannot dissociate itself from the crime of massacre committed at the Ibrahimi mosque today by claiming it was the act of an extremist or a deranged Zionist, or that of a Zionist with any other adjective that may be attributed to him in order to cover up the ugliness of the crime. Direct responsibility for this crime, and for any other crime committed by Zionist settlers or occupation forces, is shouldered by the Tel Aviv rulers who insisted, and are insisting, on keeping the Arab land they usurped, and who encouraged, and are encouraging, the settlers to remain on this land. The Tel Aviv rulers, who fabricated and ignored the facts of history and geography, rejected the principles of justice and disrespected the resolutions of international legitimacy, and considered occupied Palestinian land a disputed land to which Zionist settlers have more right than its original owners -- these rulers are the ones who planted, and are planting, the seeds of terrorism that were terribly manifested today in the Ibrahimi mosque massacre. We have said and warned more than once that what Israel is doing in the name of the so-called peace that it is hiding behind is nothing more than aggravating elements of tension and explosion, spreading terrorism, and endangering stability and security in the region. What happened today is only one part of these elements. This will continue as long as Israel remains unrestrained and free from any control that deters its extravagance and stops its crimes and terrorism. Will the world wake up and pay attention before it is too late, before Israel pushes the entire region, by its antipeace positions and practices, to the edge of an explosion?
