Until the G7 (Group of Seven) mobilised their official banks into the markets the dollar would be on a one-way ride, they warned. "If the central banks don't all step in together soon, then we're going to see the U.S. dollar go into free-fall because the speculators don't care. They want to see how low it can go," said one London trader. Late last night, European time, the Japanese yen dipped through the emotive level of 100 yen to the U.S. dollar. At one point, the yen was trading in Europe at 99.85 the lowest level that the U.S. dollar has reached since the end of World War 11, reflecting a new aggressiveness among global foreign exchange speculators. The consequences are far-reaching. For Japan, which is now emerging from one of its longest recessions, the marketability of the yen is paramount if a successful economic recovery is to be achieved. This week saw what is believed to have been a US$1 billion injection by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) just before the Tokyo close on Tuesday with the dollar being bought at reportedly 100.4 yen, 100.6 yen and 101 yen. Phil Luxton, a currency analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd said there was a feeling that speculators wanted to see how long it would be before the central banks of the G7 nations stepped in. "They (the speculators) are probing all the time, and trying to find the level at which the central banks will move in." Clearly, as the current low level of the yen has shown, occasional intervention by the BOJ is not enough, and a concerted effort is needed. What surprised the City yesterday was the almost blase attitude that seemed to be adopted by the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve towards any kind of intervention. If a concerted effort is to be made, the Federal Reserve will have to determine the timing, and several observers expected key clues to be revealed in Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's address to the House of Representatives' budget committee last night. Options available to the Federal Reserve were seen to be to increase interest rates significantly to give added confidence to the dollar, or to advocate concerted intervention by the G7 central banks. The market has for a long time been betting on a rise in U.S. interest rates to six per cent by the end of the year. Nick Clube of Smith New Court said central bankers everywhere would be keeping a close eye on the effect that the currency turmoil would have on the bond and equity markets. "It is to do with bonds and equities, if they are being adversely affected, the banks will feel more pressure to come in." Lee Ferridge of Natwest Markets said banks were possibly waiting for the market to become too short on dollars before teaching it a hard, sharp lesson by intervening and pushing up rates significantly. The question of central bank intervention also puts into focus the mark-dollar relationship. Adrian Cunningham of Union Bank of Switzerland said the delay over intervention might have been caused by reluctance on the part of the Bundesbank, where the mark was trading at a comfortable 1.5982/5992 to the dollar. "The Bundesbank is not unhappy about the dollar-mark rate at 1.60. It isn't perceived by the Bundesbank to be a problem." The decision by the Bundesbank to shave 0.05 per cent off the repo rate to five per cent was in itself an act of support without intervention because it buoyed sentiment in the belief that Germany was happy to cut repo even though official rates were on hold, he said. However, he suggested the Bundesbank would need to fund the budget, and would be looking for finance from a market which had faith in its currency policy. Another story doing the rounds was that the United States might be punishing Japan over their enduring trade dispute, knowing that a strong yen would keep Japanese exports down. But that theory was also dismissed because the United States would be well-aware of the long-term economic damage such a policy could wreak on its own domestic market.
