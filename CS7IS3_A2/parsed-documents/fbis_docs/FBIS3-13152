Faction Chairman Moshe Qatzav told our correspondent Hayim Hecht that Rabin's willingness to include Tzomet in his cabinet is tantamount to admitting the failure of his policy. According to Qatzav, he has learned that Rabin is using Tzomet to freeze the continuation of the implementation of the Oslo agreement after the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho.
