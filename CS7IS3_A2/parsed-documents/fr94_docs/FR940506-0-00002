SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Classification Executive Order 12866 This final rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. Regulatory Flexibility Act This rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612). The Acting Administrator of FNS has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The actual values used in the regulation are not being changed, only the name for the values is changing. Therefore, this change will have no effect on small entities.
