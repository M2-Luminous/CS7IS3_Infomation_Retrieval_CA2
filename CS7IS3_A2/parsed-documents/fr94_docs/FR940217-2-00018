FR940217-2-00018 FR940217-2-00013 Naval Research Advisory Committee; Closed Meeting Pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. 2), notice is hereby given that the Naval Research Advisory Committee Panel on Littoral Warfare/Amphibious Warfare will meet on February 22, 23, 24, and 25, 1994. The meeting will be held at the Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington. The meeting will commence at 8:30 a.m. and terminate at 5:00 p.m. on each day. All sessions of the meeting will be closed to the public. The purpose of the meeting is to conduct Executive Sessions to write a briefing and report which provide the Department of the Navy with (1) an assessment of the capabilities and readiness of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps to effectively conduct littoral and amphibious warfare operations, and (2) recommendations for technological investments that can improve performance while reducing risk to Marine and Naval forces. The agenda will consist of Executive Sessions devoted to discussions of information received and drafting of the study briefing and report. These discussions and resulting briefing and report will contain classified information that is specifically authorized under criteria established by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense and are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order. The classified and non-classified matters to be discussed are so inextricably intertwined as to preclude opening any portion of the meeting. Accordingly, the Secretary of the Navy has determined in writing that the public interest requires that all sessions of the meeting be closed to the public because they will be concerned with matters listed in section 552b(c)(1) of title 5, United States Code.

Lewis, USN, Office of the Chief of Naval Research, 800 North Quincy Street, Arlington, VA 22217-5000, Telephone Number: (703) 696-4870. Dated: January 31, 1994 Michael P.
