This will lead to the loss of 3.8 Bn kilowatts of electric power. All Ukrainian nuclear power stations may stop functioning in 1995, INTERFAX-Ukraine was informed by the press service of the Ukrainian State Committee for Atomic Power on Friday. The press service announced that Ukraine received practically no nuclear fuel due to continuing non-payment of Ukrainian enterprises to Russia. This would lead to stopping of the nuclear power stations' energy blocks in Ukraine. The 3rd energy block of the Chernobyl nuclear power station is expected to be stopped on January 30, its first energy block on March 31 and the energy blocks of the Yuzhnoukrainskaya and Zaporozhye nuclear power stations may be stopped in May and August. The continued functioning of the Chernobyl nuclear power station's 2nd energy block planned by the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet is also becoming unfeasible, the committee's press service pointed out.
