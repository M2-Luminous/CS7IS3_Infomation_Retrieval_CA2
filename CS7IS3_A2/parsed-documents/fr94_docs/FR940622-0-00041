FR940622-0-00041 FR940622-0-00011 As previously indicated, the statute and the regulations specifically state that the hospital must provide treatment that is within the capabilities of the staff and facilities it has available. If a hospital does not have the capability to treat psychiatric disorders or a small rural hospital lacks the staff or resources to treat certain emergencies, it must determine whether the benefits to an individual's medical condition outweigh the risks associated with transferring the individual. If a physician certifies that the benefits of transfer to a more suitable facility outweigh the risks, the hospital may transfer the individual to a facility that has the capability to treat that individual and agrees to accept transfer. The certification may be signed by a qualified medical person if a physician is not physically present in the emergency department and that qualified medical person first consults with a physician who later countersigns the certification. Also, a person seeking medical treatment may make an informed decision to request transfer to such a facility. Comment: Several commenters asked whether the determination of liability and penalties will be the same for a hospital that has limited capabilities as that for a hospital that has a trauma center. Response: Any participating hospital that offers emergency services is liable for violations of the statute regardless of whether it is a small rural hospital or a major metropolitan tertiary care facility with a trauma center. The statute requires any subject hospital to provide for treatment within the capabilities of the staff and facility it has available. However, hospitals with fewer than 100 State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds are subject to a maximum civil monetary penalty of $25,000, as compared to a maximum civil monetary penalty of $50,000 for hospitals with 100 or more State-licensed, Medicare-certified beds. Comment: One commenter questioned the responsibility of a hospital that is a Medicare certified hospital but does not have an emergency department. Another wanted to exempt from the reach of the statute facilities, such as college infirmaries, that provide emergency services exclusively to students. Response: The statute and these regulations apply only to hospitals that participate in the Medicare program and that offer emergency services. HHS considers any participating hospital that provides emergency services to have an emergency department and thus to be subject to the provisions of the statute and these regulations. However, even a Medicare participating hospital that does not provide emergency services must continue to meet the standard of ยง482.12(f), which requires hospitals to have written policies and procedures for appraisal of emergencies, initial treatment, and referral where appropriate. Also, to our knowledge, college infirmaries are not hospitals having Medicare provider agreements and are thus not subject to section 1867 of the Act. Hospital Comment: One commenter noted that in the proposed regulations and COBRA, the term ``hospital'' is defined as ``a Medicare facility certified as a hospital with its own provider number.'' The commenter recommended that the definition be expanded to require that the transfer be made to the ``nearest appropriate facility'' that happens to be a Medicare provider, so that Medicare providers will be required to receive transfers from other hospitals. Response: The intent of the statute is to provide equal treatment for all individuals who come to a hospital and request a medical screening examination or treatment for an emergency medical condition, as well as to provide for protected transfers of individuals who have unstabilized emergency medical conditions. Such individuals are at the greatest risk of severe physical impairment, dysfunction, or delivery of a baby in the absence of immediate medical attention. We believe that after assessing an individual's medical condition and weighing the risks versus benefits of effectuating an appropriate transfer to another facility, the amount of travel time required to transport the individual should be considered. Situations will occur where an individual's condition requires a hospital to effectuate a transfer to the nearest appropriate facility that has the capability and capacity to treat in order to minimize the risks to the individual by reducing the transportation time as much as possible. Transfer of an unstabilized patient to a hospital with which there is a prior transfer agreement can be justified when the condition of the unstabilized individual is such that the additional travel time would not increase the danger to the patient.
