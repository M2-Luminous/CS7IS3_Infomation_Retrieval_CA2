Menem said it is "a tremendous injustice" to prevent the reelection of some governors when most provinces already have a clause allowing the governor's reelection, and the constitutional reform will grant the president that opportunity as well. Menem said that Buenos Aires Governor Eduardo Duhalde "will not create any problems" at the Constituent Assembly, because "what he wants is the reform of the national Constitution, and then through the proper channels, the reform of the provincial Constitution." Menem said the convention "is not deadlocked," as delegates "are looking for consensus." Menem did not rule out the possibility of proposing a clause permitting the reelection of governors at the Constituent Assembly. Menem said, however, that it was not clear how convention delegates would include that clause in the agenda. Menem said the reform of provincial constitutions must be carried out in each district. The decision to include the issue "will be determined by convention delegates. I think there are various alternatives. I am not siding with any one of them. I think provincial constitutions must be reformed according to proceedings established in each one of the provincial constitutions," the president said. Menem made these remarks at government house after inspecting the work under way to remodel the building. Menem said he will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton in Boston between 22 and 24 June within the framework of his unofficial visit to that country and following his tour of Canada. After the announcement, NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS learned that the head of state will take advantage of the opportunity to watch the soccer match between the Argentine and Nigerian national teams on 25 June. The president talked extensively on the radio program La 9.90. He reiterated that "professional agitators who have already been acting in other places have arrived" in Tierra del Fuego. He added that "hooded individuals are frustrating people's right to work." He said those groups are responsible for "impairing and frustrating the freedom to work," stressing that these methods "will not lead us anywhere," and urging striking workers "to return to work." The president denied that the government is being pressured by entrepreneurs, and recommended all parties involved in the conflict to sit down and talk "to reach an agreement and resolve" the situation. On another subject, the president said that he supports the initiative of some legislators to invest $1.5 billion in the construction of houses in northern provinces within 90 days. "A total of $1.5 billion will be invested in housing construction within 90 days," the president said. Menem also said that the government will urge the provinces to speed up the reform of their administrations to reduce the deficit. "Provincial governments have not fulfilled the agreements with the national government. The reform of provincial administrations has not yet been implemented," the president said. [Buenos Aires NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS in Spanish at 1224 GMT on 2 April adds: "President Carlos Menem said that the Justicialist Party `will fully respect' the Olivos Pact at the Constituent Assembly, and therefore the clause establishing the presidential election `is assured.' ["Menem confirmed that he will meet with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton during a stopover in Boston upon his return from Canada in the second half of the month." [NOTICIAS ARGENTINAS also adds, at 1319 GMT on 2 April: "President Carlos Menem said today that there is an attempt to create `a class struggle' in Tierra del Fuego, adding that the situation `is typical of Marxists.' ["During the La 9.90 program Menem criticized Marcelo Sosa, UOM [Metalworkers Union] Ushuaia branch secretary general, because through his calls he `is trying to return to the past and provoke a situation we have long overcome.'"]
