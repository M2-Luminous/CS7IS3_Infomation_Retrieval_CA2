He said that he wanted to defeat the Left by allying himself with all the moderate forces. He does not exclude Umberto Bossi or Gianfranco Fini. He is convinced that he is the only one capable of relaunching the Italian economy. Let us hear what he says. [Unidentified correspondent] Moderates from all over Italy are united in defeating the Left. This is the cry with which Berlusconi is leading his Forza Italia troops in the hard electoral battle. The enemy to defeat is the Left and the Liberals, and his allies are all the moderate forces that draw their inspiration from liberal-democratic politics. However, and this is perhaps Berlusconi's weak point, he wants to draw in the Right in the form of Fini and Bossi, who have nothing to do with the liberal-democratic tradition. The messages of Berlusconi are clear and direct and they are spread by an imposing propaganda machine. Berlusconi said that Forza Italia was born out of the desire of common people to turn a page, of wanting to restore solidity and usefulness to politics. Enough with professional politicians, Berlusconi said, what is needed are new people anchored to civil society. The values that Berlusconi referred to were the classic ones of Western culture -- liberty, the individual, enterprise, the family, and the Christian tradition. In contrast to Bossi, although the two men are recent allies, Berlusconi considers the unity of Italy to be inviolable. The manifesto of the new movement aims to combat crime and to create new jobs. [Begin Berlusconi recording] To the unemployed today we can say, we can guarantee that these concerns will end, that we know how to relaunch the Italian economy. [end recording] [Correspondent] Berlusconi does not like the nanny-state that he says, keeps over half of incomes. Therefore, less taxation and a spirited defense of the self-employed.
