It stated blandly that 80 per cent of British beaches now met mandatory EU [expansion not given] standards: what was not mentioned is that no tests are done even for viruses or many minor ailments caused by polluted sea water and that 20 per cent of British beaches, even after 18 years' legislation, still fail to meet minimum safety and legal standards. The official line is relentlessly cheery. The Water Services Association, which represents the water companies, this week claimed, in a letter to THE GUARDIAN, that 132 of our beaches were (to paraphrase) great and the public really needn't worry about bathing water quality after "billions of pounds investment" had been made in sewage treatment over the past few years." The tourist industry, too, claims all is well: The EU "Blue Flag" flutters over 20 British beaches (a small improvement on the last years, more than 100 have now won UK government "Seaside awards" (26 more than 1992), and 56 have "premier awards." On Wednesday the National Rivers Authority calmed the waters, too, stating that there had been a 0.6 per cent improvement in bathing waters in the last year and the public could expect to see "dramatic improvements" after 1995. [Passage omitted] The situation is worst at many of the resorts promoted by the British tourist board, says Cait Loretto of the Marine Conservation Society, which last month published its annual guide and found huge problems on the coast. There was no real sign of improvement, she says, and the Government runs the risk that Britain will be prosecuted for failing to meet its 18-year-old obligations. Last year, of 80 beaches at 40 resorts, 24 failed EU minimum standards (compared to 19 the previous year). The list of failures is a roll-call of Britain's resorts: Scarborough, Skegness, Brighton, Lyme Regis, Weston-super-Mare, Hastings, Cleethorpes, Southport, Colwyn Bay, Ayr and, of course, Blackpool. The report found many east coast English beaches (the Scottish coastline was praised) marred by litter and raw or partially treated sewage. It echoed the massive 1193 Norwich Union Coastwatch survey. Here 6,000 volunteers found 350,000 items of beach litter in less than two weeks, increased sewage pollution and triple the amount of sanitary and medical waste compared to 1992. Almost one quarter of the coast had sewage-related debris. "An increasing amount of the coast is "soiled by sewage, despite public statements to the contrary," says Dr Gareth Rees, head of the department of environment management at Farnborough College of Technology who compiled it. "The coast is disgusting," says Loretto. "More people are turning to holidays at home. The family holiday shouldn't include vomiting." Sewage, neither Mrs Jones nor her companion appreciated, is not just human wastes but industrial and trade effluents, engine oils, litter, storm water from road surfaces, a range of heavy metal contaminants (including mercury, lead, cadmium and copper), fat balls from commercial kitchens, cleaning agents, and viruses. [Passage omitted] The EU Bathing Directive requires, as a minimum, that bathing water samples must not exceed 10,000 coliform bacteria per 100 ml more than once in 20 samples taken over a year. But the EU has a "guideline" standard which is 20 times as tough. Only 20 British beaches meet this. Chris Hines of Surfers Against Sewage, a group frequently accused by the authorities of being alarmist, says the tests are out of line with current scientific knowledge and technical progress and do not mean anything, especially to bathers and the people who regularly use British waters: "They are based on sod all. They are snapshots," he says. Water off Britain's 419 designated beaches, he says, is tested once every two weeks in the five summer months. A sample is taken 30 cm below the surface at one metre depth: "The turds could be two inches to the left and no one would be the wiser. What's more the public does not get to see the results for two more weeks, so no one has a clue if it's safe to bathe. Hepatitis A can remain infectious for up to 100 days in sea water. Other viruses can remain live up to six months." The tests, moreover, are only for coliforms which can die off in saltwater in a few hours. "An absence of coliforms is no indication of an absence of human pathogens," says Hines. "Many beaches are given a pass and yet are washed with a slick of human sewage every day. Many people get ill from bathing on so-called passed beaches." The tests look for only two criteria out of 19 possibles which could affect human health and water quality. Not included are viruses, salmonella, entero-viruses, acidity, minerals, pesticides and heavy metals. Faecal steptococci, common and potentially lethal, are ignored. "Coliforms have a very rapid die-off period," says Hines. "The chances of finding them are not high." Besides, he adds, sea water can go from appalling to good very quickly. "In a light SW wind, Newquay's town beaches are gross. But high pressure and a different wind and everything goes out to sea." The Health Effects of Sea Bathing report by the Government's Water Research Council, released in January, was hailed as "reassuring" by Robert Aitken, minister of the environment. It found that, irrespective of water quality, bathers got a variety of minor ailments. Ear, nose, throat and respiratory problems, it said, were caused by sea water "upsetting the body's normal balance," but increases in diarrhoea and other gastric problems, not unsurprisingly, were directly related to the amount of bacteria in the water. While dismissing the benefits of tightening EU standards as "insignificant," it recommended that sampling should reflect the depths of water, locations and tidal states "most used in marine recreation." [Passage omitted] The water companies, metaphorically, are in deep, dirty water. They have a tendency to blame shipping for pollution but the weight of evidence has forced them on the defensive. They are committed to Â£2 billion of improvements. [Passage omitted] British waters are politically, socially, economically and scientifically muddy. Water bills are rising and people are complaining. Europe is baying and the public is dismayed with endless prevarication. Yet Britain's coastline and waters are being used more than ever. The privatised companies are being forced to address the neglect of 100 years but people are now making vast sums on the back of a monopoly. One person, at least, is happy: when North West Water was privatised in 1989, Mary Jones bought a few shares for her granddaughter. "She's done very well from them," she says, staring out into the Blackpool soup. "Hasn't she dear?" Guardian Newspapers Limited, May 13, 1994
