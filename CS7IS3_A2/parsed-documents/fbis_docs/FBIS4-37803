Shankar Aiyar and Raghu Nandan Dhar under the rubric "Telecom Policy Mess": "Can the Centre Wriggle Out?"] [Text] Bombay -- If there is anything clear about the telecom policy, it is the smoke signals of controversy emanating from its impending implementation. Also clear is the tact the lobbyists of every hue and class -- multinationals, mixed breed companies and pure Indian corporate houses -- are all attempting to cook the goose their way. Facing this music is a bewildered Ministry of Communications, a confused Ministry of Finance [MoF] and a much-pilloried Department of Telecommunications [DoT] which believe that the easiest way out of the mess is to hand over the sector to the MNCs [multinational corporations] lock, stock and barrel. In the cacophony of confusion that is currently prevailing, there are some voices emerging. Like that of D. Sengupta of ICICI's [Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India's] Telecom Group (I-TEL) which has submitted two important papers -- on the regulatory body where he has stated the need for immediately establishing the authority before any decisions are taken and one on the entry conditions. Highly placed sources in Department of Economic Affairs [DEA], which is co-ordinating the strategies for implementation along with Ministry of Communications and MoF, has in principle accepted I-TEL's recommendations for a telecom regulatory authority (except for the name...ICICI's I-TEL suggested ORBIT while the ministry has decided on TRA [Telecom Regulatory Authority]) Even DoT has along with DEA accepted the broad terms of reference suggested by I-TEL. Besides, the immediate need for instituting Telecom Regulatory Authority, the other recommendation that has been heard, is to allow private firms exclusive licence for a region for five years. Further, it has recommended that self-generated proposals should not be accepted as a rule and even if the proposal is extremely good it needs to be convened into a tender. Sengupta's team spoke to AT&T, US West, Telstra Motorola and Sprint among others. To start with, it is surprising that an institutionally-backed cell has not spoken to any Indian corporate house or industry association. What is even more surprising is that the Sengupta committee has recommended foreign equity participation at as high as 49 per cent (51 per cent with Indians and NRIs [nonresident Indians]) when no country in the world allows foreigners such a high proportion of equity. Even the Gods of capitalism, Americans do not allow equity of over 20 per cent. So the question-now to be asked is why MoF/DEA, and broadly speaking Government of India, are so keen to offer high levels of equity to the foreigners despite the clearly spelt out issue of national security? Surely the I-TEL group couldn't be unaware of the fact that capital markets have been opened and Indians can now go abroad and raise funds through the Euro-route. Why should there be an equity participation to start with? Can't the companies buy technology with monies raised abroad? What is worse is the manner in which Department of Economic Affairs has swallowed the recommendations (over which, thankfully, there has been no decision as yet). These are but the primary issues. What Government needs to remember is that there is a waiting list of 3.5 million for telephone connections and to be able to service. "Telephone on demand by 1997", Government will need to put through 10 million lines through the Eighth Five Year Plan which would cost Government, at conservative estimates, around Rs 23,000 crore. Very clearly, Government has to adopt some mantras for a successful implementation of NTP [national telecom policy]. The crucial route to success is essentially in tackling six basic areas: They are: The right service area. Number of competitors in local and long distance. Seamless basic services. Operating expertise. Swift licensing process. Independent regulator with a clearly defined role. Let's take the issue of the right service area. Currently, DoT services are split in major units (18 circles and four metro districts) and minor units (321 telecom districts). In this, a third of the calls are local and two-thirds are long distance. In short, any company needs this mix to survive. Even globally, most countries allow a kind of duopoly where operators are allowed access to areas exclusively while connecting them to trunk carriers. Particularly interesting is the UK experience where they franchised the entire country to a second carrier and allowed a third one recently to build market share. India should also follow a similar pattern and split the network into state-wide operating territories and club the north-east (to make a viable unit) allowing preferably one operator exclusively in a region. As for the question of number of competitors, India is admittedly resource starved and hence there is little point in duplicating investments. There should be enough revenue potential to encourage growth and investment while at the same time competition to help improve service, quality and productivity. In fact world-wide, most countries allow one operator in an area (duopoly) and in US, it is just one operator...obviously aimed at curbing duplication of investments and counter-productive competition. Like UK, India too could consider duopoly for five years before reviewing the situation. The moolah is in long distance as even MTNL [Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited] would agree. Telephone service cannot be isolated as only local or only long distance as it would be patently unfair. Witness the deterioration of services in Thailand where they kept only one long distance operator. What India needs to do is to first decongest (the jammed) long distance and international traffic. One or even two more operators should be involved in augmenting the network (even through Build and Operate networks) laid by DoT. Secondly it should allow only one local licencee connected to long distance carriers with enough scope for customer traffic. Ideally, there should be one licencee within the state (who could also operate in another region/circle) but long distance should be allowed to criss-cross the country through state networks.
