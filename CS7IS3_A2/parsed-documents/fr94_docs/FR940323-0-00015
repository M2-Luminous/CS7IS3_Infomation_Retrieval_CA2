FR940323-0-00015 FR940323-0-00008 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AGL&hyph;26] Revision of Class E Airspace; Oconto, WI AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action revises Class E airspace (Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth) at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accomodate Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway 29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending upward from 700 to 1200 feet above ground level (AGL) is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. The intended effect of this action is to provide segregation of aircraft using instrument approach procedures in instrument conditions from other aircraft operating in visual weather conditions. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, June 23, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Frink, Air Traffic Division, System Management Branch, AGL&hyph;530, Federal Aviation Administration, 2300 East Devon Avenue, Des Plaines, Illinois 60018, telephone (708) 294&hyph;7568. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On Thursday, January 6, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to revise Class E Airspace at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate a Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Rwy 29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP) (58 FR 706). The proposal was to add controlled airspace extending from 700 feet to 1200 feet AGL to contain Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations in controlled airspace during portions of the terminal operation and while transiting between the enroute and terminal environments. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations revises Class E airspace at (Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth) at Oconto Municipal Airport, Oconto, WI, to accommodate Nondirectional Beacon (NDB) Runway 29 Standard Instrument Approach Procedure (SIAP). Controlled airspace extending from 700 to 1200 feet AGL is needed to contain aircraft executing the approach. Aeronautical maps and charts will reflect the defined area which will enable pilots to circumnavigate the area in order to comply with applicable visual flight rule requirements. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
