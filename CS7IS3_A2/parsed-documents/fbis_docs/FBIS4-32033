Zurovac report: "We Reject Blackmail"] [Text] The talks between the delegations of the Republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and Croatia that were supposed to be held in Plitvice were postponed and it is still uncertain as to whether they are going to be held at all. The Croatian delegation had not arrived by last night. Following this (un)expected course of events, RSK President Milan Martic has stated for VECERNJE NOVOSTI the following: "The venue is not contentious. We have demonstrated maximum cooperativeness and flexibility, something Croatia had obviously not counted on. Their behavior and request for support from the international community and allies confirm that they were caught by surprise and that they do not want to come to Plitvice. They are evidently not in the mood to negotiate, as they are fervently seeking the help of their allies in order again to accuse the Serbian side and show that the war option is unavoidable." Substantive Obstacles "We are patiently waiting," Martic said, "because there is no alternative to the peaceful settlement of the problem. Croatia has found an 'excuse' in journalists and resorted to ultimatums, demanding their sponsors to exert pressure on us. We will not accept any ultimatums. We enjoy the support of our assembly, government, and the RSK people." In response to the question whether the talks would resume in the course of the day, Martic said: "As far as we are concerned, they could resume. I have sent a written message to David Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg with regard to the message sent to the RSK leadership by Enrique Agillar, coordinator of the civil sector. The message, which had allegedly been sent by Owen and Stoltenberg, but not signed by them, refers to procedural and substantive obstacles to the negotiations in Plitvice. However, whether they are procedural or substantive, the consequences of the message are absolutely political. "Croatia was not sent a message with the identical content. The message states that the answer regarding the acceptance or rejection of the talks be sent via Agillar in Knin. We do not believe that Croatia will send its reply to Geneva via Knin, which means that the Croatian side was sent a different message or not sent one at all." Wrong Order Martic also claims that the agreement that the agenda be set at the very beginning of talks had not been respected. Instead, the message sent to the RSK already contained the priority issues that should be discussed. The first three of the total of five issues were exclusively in the interest of Croatia (a set of measures concerning the supply of electric power and water, high voltage network, and oil pipes). The RSK was thus put in an unequal position. Point 5, concerning UN Security Council Resolution 820, makes it clear that the blockade of the RSK is not going to be lifted, but only perhaps gradually moderated. In other words, the RSK would be enabled to trade within Croatia. "The agreement that one Croat journalist and one photo reporter be present in Plitvice was not respected either," Martic said. "Instead, the RSK was given the ultimatum to allow five journalists in. The rescheduling of the start of the meeting for 1600 [1400 GMT] suggests that the Croatian delegation wanted to spend the night at Plitvice, which contravenes previous agreements. The message also says that a delegation could include more than five members, which was the original maximum. The agreement that the delegations' cost would be borne by the international conference on the former SFRY was also annulled and replaced with a clause that the costs would be shared by the two delegations. It is totally incorrect to make the arrival of Owen and Stoltenberg in Knin conditional on the agreement that the next round of talks be held on 30 June. "At the same time, Croatian politicians' public speeches and the media campaign have disturbed the atmosphere concerning the negotiations to the extent that they have become impossible to hold. The inflexible statements by Hrvoje Sarinic [chief Croatian negotiator] have caused much disturbance among the Serbian people in Krajina, who do not like anyone setting them conditions. "The negotiations are of interest for both countries," Martic said at the end, "and we believe that the cochairmen of the peace conference will invest extra effort to convince the Croatian side of the necessity of continuing the dialogue."
