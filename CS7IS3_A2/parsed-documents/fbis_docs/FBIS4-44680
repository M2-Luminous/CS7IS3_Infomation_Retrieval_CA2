Shown last week at the Singapore Aeronautical Show, the MRTT (Multi-Role Tanker Transport) has a market estimated at 110 units worldwide by the year 2010, according to Aerospatiale--one of the three project partners with Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) and British Aerospace (BAe). The fourth consortium member, CASA [Spanish Aeronautical Engineering Company] does not participate in the study. The project promoters hope that the airlines that will sell some of their old A300 or A310 to be retrofitted for military purposes will replace them with more recent aircraft, ranging from the A320 to the A340 and including the A330 twin-jet. According to Mr. Louis Gallois, the Aerospatiale president, the MRTT is said to be developed mostly for France and Canada, which need military transport aircraft. Singapore might participate in the program if the country is interested in the MRTT. "But we need a number of orders before we can launch it," Mr. Gallois added without mentioning any precise figure. For the time being, this market segment is dominated by U.S. aircraft that are about 40 years old: the KC135 (derived from the Boeing 707) and the KC10 (derived from McDonnell Douglas's DC10). The MRTT might be offered in several versions: in-flight refueling, military transport (up to 270 soldiers), cargo transport, and all-purpose versions. According to Aerospatiale, it might be available by the middle of the decade. This program, however, should not interfere with the FLA (Future Large Aircraft), the military transport aircraft for which feasibility studies were started in November by the Airbus partners and several other groups: the Turkish Tusas, the Portuguese OGMA, the Belgian Flabel, and the Italian Alenia. "We do not think that there will be any interference, as the FLA will be tactical and the MRTT logistic," a project official at Aerospatiale indicated.
