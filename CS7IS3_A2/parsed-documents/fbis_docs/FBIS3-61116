The consolidated budget deficit equalled K2 trillion, or 11 percent of revenues. Similar reports used to be prepared before party congresses, to account before the people. The Ukraine budget already resembles a whore supported by officials of the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank, who share her among themselves as entities invested with government status. But facts are stubborn things: it is well-known that the budget deficit no longer includes the shortfalls of the local budgets which hide a system of direct subsidies, of many trillions in loans to loss-making industries which are provided without any guarantees of being repaid during the given time period and of refinanced credits from the National Bank which are not counted as government debt. This alone allows them to manipulate the figures as they wish. For example, here are the results for the unconsolidated (government) budget for the first 10 months: revenues rose by 303 percent, while expenditures by 352 percent. The budget deficit of K5.713 trillion was covered by National Bank credits amounting to K8.465 trillion. The result: revenues surpassed expenditures by K2.752 billion. In the West, similar falsifications of facts would have served as the basis of a new Watergate, but in Ukraine budget deficits are written off year after year, while trust for the minister of finance has not diminished. Today, the Ministry of Finance is the second, after the National Bank, inflationary center. The latter, however, does not react in any way, since it still gets the seigneurage revenues which accrue to it from printing money. (This year, it is 240 percent.) Thus, by distorting the free-market principles of monetary policy, these two naturally antagonistic entities, with the help of the budget, are playing their game. By the way, the attack by the people's deputies on managers of commercial banks, who supposedly receive tens of millions of karbovanets in salaries, would fully apply to the management of the National Bank, who get just as much. But to count other people's money is an ungrateful task. The Ministry of Finance proved this, having declared at the start of December that the consolidated deficit is headed for K20 trillion. For this reason, it was decided to bolster the budget by raising prices by 70 percent in a month, banning banking entities from providing credits, etc. But will it be enough? Independent economists calculate that this year inflation will reach 6,400 percent. It seems that the National Bank will keep printing money for a long time to come. By the way, this is how the current budget started.
