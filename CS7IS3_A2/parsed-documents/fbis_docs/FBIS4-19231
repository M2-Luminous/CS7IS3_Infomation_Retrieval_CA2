[Pawlak] I think one must always seek ways of expanding cooperation. The trade deficit with our biggest trade partner, Germany, has been causing us problems lately. Balanced cooperation is very important to us, and we hope the necessary balance will be achieved not through restrictions, but through new forms of cooperation. [Heller] In Brussels, you suggested a "Partnership for Development" as a parallel to Partnership for Peace. What do you expect from the Germans? [Pawlak] Above all, partner-like relations and an active search for common interests. Balanced advantages on both sides help overcome obstacles and bring the two countries' economies closer together. In this way, Poland's maneuvering space in the process of rapprochement between our countries also becomes bigger. On the other hand, as soon as a greater imbalance occurs, problems begin. [Heller] Apart from a trade deficit, the Polish statistics also reveal an increase in the Polish National Bank's foreign currency reserves. If every German who visited Poland last year had spent 100 German marks, the deficit would have been quickly paid off. [Pawlak] I trust the European Union's [EU] statistics, and these show a clear deficit. But that can be compensated by a reasonable level of trade between border areas. However, it is an oversimplification to suggest that everyone who crosses our border should spend so many marks. Instead, we should concentrate on those enterprises that actually determine the economic situation. Specific consideration and activity can easily form the nucleus of our economic cooperation. Therefore, this cooperation is useful because it permits direct contacts between any people, and thus creates a climate of practical cooperation. [Heller] It is a well-known fact that as head of the Polish Government, you drive a Polonez car. During your visit here have you shown an interest in other makes of car? [Pawlak] I am really an auto engineer. I was interested in cars long before I was interested in politics. My side trip to Stuttgart will also be a reminder of my first long trip to Germany. Generally speaking, we are interested in cooperation, especially the kind of cooperation that involves investments on Polish territory. Investments by large significant firms, such as Volkswagen in Poznan, show that it is worth investing in Poland. I think a similar investment by Mercedes is also feasible. We are concerned about creating new jobs, and already have tried-and-tested contacts that make it easier to sell Polish products on third markets. [Heller] Waiting times on the German-Polish border are getting longer and longer because of the increased goods and personal traffic. Can Poland afford to be so difficult to enter? [Pawlak] If that were merely a Polish-German problem, we would have surely solved it already. But we are dealing with a peripheral EU border, as well as heavy transit traffic toward the East. In the immediate future we will concentrate on developing two transit routes -- the Swiecko-Poznan-Warsaw-Terespol route, which continues via Minsk to Moscow; and the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow route, which connects Saxony and Ukraine. Accordingly, as far as goods traffic is concerned, we are going to expand the border crossing points at Swiecko (Frankfurt-Oder) and Zgorzelec (Goerlitz), and later the one at Olszyna (Forst). The modern terminal in Swiecko should be ready this year. But there is also visible progress at those crossing points used for local border traffic. The modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin railroad line should also be completed this year. Despite all the economic problems, these projects are very important for us. [Heller] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel wants to offer the Baltic countries association agreements with the EU similar to the one Poland has already concluded. How does Poland view this matter? [Pawlak] Poland wants to play an active role in this part of Europe. The inclusion of the Baltic countries in the European integration process is of major significance to us. Following the admission of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland to the EU, general interest in the Balkan region will increase, and Poland will lie in the center of this new EU zone. [Heller] Will the treaty on good-neighborly relations with Lithuania also contain a guarantee that Lithuania will receive support in its efforts to join the EU? [Pawlak] The treaty with Lithuania concerns our mutual relations, and has nothing to do with multilateral agreements. It is the last link in the chain of basic treaties with all our neighbors. There were a few problems with assessing our common past, but these have been overcome. [Heller] Do you fear the emergence of a new Berlin-Moscow axis? How else can one explain Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy's proposal to expand the "Weimar Triangle" by including Russia in it? [Pawlak] If one looks at the map, one sees that Warsaw lies on the line between Berlin and Moscow, and it seems quite normal to me that we are interested in being included in these contacts. There are exciting prospects here, especially in the economic sphere, for example the gas pipeline that will lead from Russia to Germany via Poland. Such enterprises show that one must seek concrete new solutions, without adhering to symbols. The problems that have to be solved lie in the economic, legal, and financial spheres. [Heller] Do you think it really lies in Poland's interests to expand a structure like the "Weimar Triangle," that joins Warsaw to Bonn, by including other partners in it? [Pawlak] I will let others deal with such purely political concepts. I am interested in practical aspects. We have so many problems that we can employ a really large number of people in solving them. Political contacts are important, but lasting foundations are laid by means of economic cooperation and interpersonal contacts. [Heller] Your voters expect a lot of changes in Poland. Other people fear the opposite, a return to the old relationships. What has changed since your Peasant Party and the Democratic Left Alliance took over the government? [Pawlak] Our economic performance for the first quarter of 1994 is very significant. Inflation has reached its lowest point in seven years, and output has risen by 10 percent. That shows that the resolutions we adopted at the end of 1983 are correct. The first decision we made was to concentrate on the economy and give up political rhetoric. The second decision was to concentrate social aid on those groups of people with the lowest incomes. That led to an increase in income tax. At the same time, we introduced tax concessions for investments. [Heller] These changes represent a shift in emphasis rather than an adjustment of policy. [Pawlak] Basically, we have drawn conclusions from the development of recent years. We want an evolutionary development, without shocks and sudden changes. It is also important for us to expand the social framework of the reforms by easing the burdens and supporting the lowest income groups. In addition, we want to include the broadest possible cross-section of society in the process of change. Only in this way will it be possible to implement the changes in a democratic way. My government's third concern is to rationalize the use of the resources at our disposal. An example is the draft law on the duty to invite tenders when spending public funds. All in all, our objectives are democracy, a social market economy, and a respectable position for Poland in the family of free peoples.
