Thin-wall drilling bits and geological core-extracting drilling bits made of this material have proved more efficient and long- lasting than earlier types. China produced monocrystal diamonds in 1963 and afterwards took steps toward creating polycrystal ones, the MGMR said. In 1991, the project to develop polycrystal diamonds was listed as a major scientific project in the nation's Eighth Five-Year Plan. Diamonds are widely used in the fields of aviation and space flight, machine processing, national defense science and geological drilling. Possession of diamonds has always been considered an important factor in judging the industrialization of a country, according to an official from the MGMR. Natural diamonds are rare worldwide, with an annual output of 400 million carats. The natural polycrystal diamond has only been produced in Brazil, and it holds a value ten times that of the monocrystal variety.
