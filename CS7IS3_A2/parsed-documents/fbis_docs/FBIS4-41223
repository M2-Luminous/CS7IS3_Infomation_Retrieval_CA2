The President's Edict Alone Is Insufficient To Combat It"] [Text] "And outside the window yesterday they shot...." When a well-known humorist utters this phrase from the stage, the audience remains completely unmoved. Because nowadays there is no satirical exaggeration in this text. Street shootings are an everyday feature of all large Russian cities. People get shot outside your window and mine. And on your way to the store for a carton of milk you have to be prepared to find yourself in the line of fire or to be hit by shrapnel from yet another exploding Mercedes. Criminal terror has literally rocked the country. The only people who can be envied in such a situation are our future homegrown Hammets and Coppolas. If the mafia rampage in America in the 1930's gave writers and directors material for half a century of "gangster sagas," our mafiosi, who have long surpassed their Chicago counterparts, have set up writers and cinematographers for several hundred years to come. Russian gangsters can feel justified pride. They have become a source of increased concern not only in Europe but across the Atlantic too. Special hearings on organized crime in Russia addressed by CIA and FBI leaders have been held in the U.S. Congress. So it is meaningless simply to say that the federal program for combating crime, supplemented the other day by a corresponding presidential edict, meets the country's vital needs. Let us be frank: Organized crime today threatens not only each and every one of us as individual citizens. It threatens the very fabric of the Russian state. Society therefore requires decisive action from the authorities. Yet, as soon as it was made public, the president's edict was subjected to fierce and -- at least partly -- justified criticism from legislators, the press, and experts. It is perfectly clear why. The edict effectively invests the law-enforcent organs with extraordinary powers which cut right across existing legislation. Like many documents in the past, it is written with a view to ideal executors, people with "clean hands and warm hearts." However, just as any piece of equipment should incorporate a fail-safe mechanism against idiots, so in composing edicts we need, alas, to proceed on the basis of human frailty. I certainly have no wish to cast sweeping aspersions on all those confronting the gangsters in unbelievably difficult conditions. But among law-enforcement officers, as among representatives of any other speciality, there are self-seeking and dishonorable people inclined to break the law. Recent major scandals demonstrate this. And the fact is that that the edict opens up an opportunity for such people to do what they like. Even as ordinary citizens without offices or bank accounts, we can hardly expect to remain unaffected by this. After all, just through a chance conjunction of circumstances you could find yourself in the way of some big shot or minor chief who has the right to hold you in detention for 30 days without filing charges.... Moreover, you cannot help remembering the sad results of the numerous programs and edicts on combating crime which have "surfaced" in the past few years. Everything has somehow or other culminated either in nothing at all, or in the notorious "suitcases" that some politicians at the helm of the battle with the mafia have used to collect compromising material on others. But, for all the justice of the complaints that have been made, there is another side to the coin. An extraordinary situation (and that is precisely what it is) requires extraordinary measures. Moreover, it is patently obvious that the people attacking the president's edict are precisely those who are in one way or another are responsible for the existing state of affairs. I mean the legislators, the majority of whom actually got into the Duma on platforms of ruthlessly combating crime. But where are the new codes to meet the prevailing situation? Our legislative snail, it seems, is not even crawling along. The president's edict, on the other hand, whether it is good or bad, is effectively the authorities' only real action in this sphere. It is not enough to criticize this edict and the executive: If you do not like the government's program, you should propose your own program of measures, and quickly. It is actually a good thing that the president's edict has provoked a reaction, albeit negative; at least it has pushed the appropriate Duma committees to draw up such a program. Finally, perhaps the most important thing is what the critics of this document have overlooked. They are not examining it in the context of the president's package of economic edicts. Yet it is perfectly obvious that our crime wave -- just like any other crime wave, moreover -- was nurtured on the nourishing broth of economic chaos. On the other hand, as one U.S. expert noted, a "historically unprecedented clearance sale" is under way. The property of a vast country is changing owners. This is happening simultaneously with the extremely confused process of privatization itself. At the same time, there is an almost total absence of legislation in the sphere of business, which allows the hopeless debtor to thrive. All this drives our businessmen, who in another situation would be extremely law-abiding, into the arms of the mobsters. If there are no laws, or they do not operate, gangsters altruistically (oh, how altruistically) take upon themselves the role of arbiters in business disputes, and indeed the role of judicial executioners as well. On the other hand, crime rises like yeast in conditions whereby the population is impoverished and the gap between rich and poor is growing. As far as I understand it, the president's latest edicts, in addition to their main goal of giving impetus to reforms, objectively create an obstacle in the way of the criminalization of the economy. After all, it was not the all-powerful FBI Director Hoover who defeated the mafia in the United States. That was achieved by Roosevelt's reforms, which rescued the U.S. economy from crisis. If we now managed to create a system of social protection that was in any way effective, it would deprive the mafia of a stream of new recruits. The introduction of elementary order in the finance and taxation spheres, in relations between the state and the enterprises that supposedly belong to it, and in the sphere of export licensing and banking activity should sharply narrow the field of activity for organized crime. It is here, in purging economic relationships of crime, that the highroad in the struggle against crime lies. Certainly not in stepping up repressive measures. What is needed at the moment is some major impetus, some kind of tough shake-up. So as to transform the situation regarding crime in action and not just in words. We would very much like to see the president's edict provide just such an impetus. Meanwhile it is not only journalists and parliamentarians who have reacted to it. Those whom it directly affects -- the gangsters -- have also responded. A series of explosions has once again rocked the capital. These people still feel themselves masters of the situation. The authorities must make haste to prevent that feeling from becoming a reality....
