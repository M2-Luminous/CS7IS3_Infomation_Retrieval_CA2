In a State Council meeting held today, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and his ministers decided not to declare a state of exception [estado de excepcion] and to continue to monitor the situation in upcoming working sessions, according to government spokesman Felix Loarca. After the assassination of Gonzalez, 62, some sectors had asked that civil rights be suspended because of a prevailing climate of violence. Human rights organizations, however, rejected a possible suspension of rights, arguing that such a suspension would pave the way for repression. In addition, the Army said it would support the measure if it was approved by the executive. [In related news, Guatemala City Teleonce Television in Spanish at 1900 GMT on 4 April, in its "Telepress" newscast, broadcasts a one-minute recorded interview with Government Minister Danilo Pariello, who was interviewed on his way to the State Council meeting called to discuss the possible suspension of rights in Guatemala. Noting that the session was called "to assess the serious situation caused by the Constitutionality Court president's death," Pariello adds that "pertinent measures have already been taken." Asked whether a "state of exception" will indeed be declared, he says this "will have to be decided at the cabinet meeting." He notes that any state of exception that might be declared would be "one of prevention, and one which could be declared immediately."]
