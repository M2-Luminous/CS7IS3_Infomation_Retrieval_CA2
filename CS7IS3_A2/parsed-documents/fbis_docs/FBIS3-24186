Yakutia Sets a Good Example"] [Text] By and large, all of the problems in the North are a human problem. Primarily, the problem of the northerner -- a person living in the planet's high latitudes. Nevertheless I shall never get tired or trying to prove, or of repeating, that the problems of the North were and will continue to be problems of a scale that affects mankind as a whole. Having recognized that truth, we shall move far ahead along the path primarily of humanism. In the Russian Federation and in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) in recent years there have been major changes in the entire way of life and it is impossible to evaluate in any simple manner the importance of those changes for the peoples of the North. However, the value of the reforms manifests itself precisely against the background of the overall condition and well-being of the peoples of the North. Upon attentive consideration it is revealed that the northern peoples of our planet not only assimilated for mankind a vast territory that is unbelievably severe and also very rich in resources, but also created a unique spiritual and material culture. One can confidently speak about a specific circumpolar (existing in the regions of the Arctic Circle) civilization that enriched mankind by its invaluable historical experience, an experience that reveals man's ability to survive and to engage in creative activity under the most severe climatic conditions. For Russia this experience is unusually important, or even invaluable, for the simple reason that 60 percent of Russian territory is nothing but an arctic and northern zone. For the Republic of Sakha this experience is national wealth, property that belongs to the entire nation, the dividends from which we shall receive in the twenty-first century, when we shall see the fruition of the words of the great Lomonosov, to the effect that Russia's might will accrue to Siberia and the Arctic Ocean. The peoples that formed the circumpolar civilization have many attributes in common, such as a harmonious, completely balanced interrelationship with the fragile environment. The northern peoples created great models of economic culture, the fruits of which the industrial part of mankind is just beginning to use. The cult of life, the recognition of the inherent value of life, collectivism, mutual tolerance and mutual aid, respect for women, the family, and the tribe, heightened aesthetic sense, a sense of beauty -- those are only a few of the shared and special attributes of northern civilization. The North's vast mineral wealth became the chief reason for invading and destroying the fragile circumpolar civilization, for having it become absorbed by industrial civilization. A large amount of harm was inflicted on the peoples of the North by the social experiment that was carried out in Russia after October 1917 under the slogan of the building of a communist society. The industrial breakthrough to the unlimited natural resources of the northern territories was accompanied by a disdain for the peoples populating those lands, by the incompetent interference of the state and officials into the social and spiritual life of the northern peoples. At various stages in the development of Russia, the effectiveness of administering the northern territories varied. The first and most significant legal act, in our opinion, was the Regulations for Administering Aliens, which were enacted in 1822. Tribal communes were recognized as being the basis of self-government and the subject of land use. Under the Soviet authority the freedom of national associations of northerners was declared: in the early 1930's the Presidium of the VTsIK [All-Russian Central Executive Committee] even enacted a decree entitled Organizing National Associations in the Rayons Inhabited by Small-Population Nationalities of the North. For example, 15 national rayons were formed as part of the Yakut ASSR of that time. Officially that decree was never appealed, but it was also never executed. For Russia as a whole, those rayons were gradually deprived of their national status, and that fact, combined with other unfavorable factors, led to a decline in the development of the northern peoples and to a loss by them of many achievements of circumpolar civilization. The restoration of Russia, the reformation of all aspects of its life at the present-day stage, creates excellent opportunities for overcoming the mistakes that were made. And the experience of Yakutia that was gained in recent years inspires optimism. According to the data in the 1989 population census, there were 24,817 persons residing on the territory of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) -- representatives of 25 of the 26 peoples, practically all with a small population, inhabiting the North of the Russian Federation. We are gratified that, during the period between the most recent censuses, the size of the population in the small-population peoples of the North on the territory of our republic increased by 6372, or by 34.5 percent. During that same period the size of the Sakha nation increased by 16.3 percent, and the size of the rural -- mainly indigenous -- population increased by 9.8 percent. I might note that the rates of population increase among the small-population peoples of the North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) are considerably higher than the same indicators on the whole for the Russian Federation. There the total increase for all 25 ethnic groups was 16.6 percent. Thanks to the higher rates of population increase, the percentage of the small-population peoples of the North in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) increased from 11.8 to 13.7 in the total figure of Russia's indigenous North. The highest birth rate is observed among the Eveny -- those rates came to 50.4 percent during the period between censuses. More than half the Eveny in the Russian Federation live on the territory of the Republic of Sakha. The number of Evenki in our republic increased by 24.5 percent, whereas, for Russia as a whole, the increase came to 10.6 percent, and in the Evenki Autonomous Okrug, which is in Krasnoyarsk Kray, it came to only 7.4 percent. The percentage of Evenki in the Republic of Sakha in the entire Evenki population of the Russian Federation increased by 24.8 to 48.2 percent. The favorable conditions for the population increase can be explained by a number of factors. First of all, we benefited from the declarations and promises to change over to practical matters. The republic's leadership, in defending the rights and interests of the indigenous population of the North, in the scientific posing and practical resolution of a number of problems of the socioeconomic and cultural development of the small-population peoples of the North, has been recognized in all the regions of the Russian North. Something that serves as the best confirmation of the correctness of the course that was chosen by us is the increase in the migration in the Republic of Sakha of representatives of the indigenous population of the North from adjacent krays and oblasts. For the time being, the only nationality that does not live in our republic is the Nganasany. It is difficult to cure a sick person if he himself does not really want to be cured. In the same way, it is important in the rebirth of the northern peoples to reinforce their will to live and their confidence in their own abilities, and to develop national self-awareness. Any nation is reborn through the development of language and the resuscitation of cultural and spiritual life. Look at the results of the 1989 population census and you will easily be convinced that a large number of people in various ethnic groups have lost the knowledge of their native language --Orochony, Chvantsy, Itelmeny, Nivkhi, Udegeytsy, Evenki, Yukagiry, and Mansi. One could hardly expect any other result: the way of life has changed so, and there has been such a narrowing of the sphere of use of the native language. Unfortunately, it is precisely the native language of the peoples in the North that used to be viewed most frequently as a subject of secondary importance in primary school and as a linguistic phenomenon in science. Currently in the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) very important laws have been enacted, that regulate the linguistic life of the peoples residing on the particular territory. Work has been broadened to restore and develop national systems of educating the indigenous peoples of the republic, including those for the Eveny, Evenki, and Yukagiry. The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the North, of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has submitted a concept for national Evenki, Eveny, and Yukagiry schools, the concept of preschool education. They have become components of the republic-wide concept of the national school. For the first time, the Nizhnekolymskiy College of the Peoples of the North is operating, and the School of Northern Philology has been created at Yakutsk State University. The Institute of Problems of Small-Population Peoples of the North has been created under the academy, and that institute, during just one year of its existence, in addition to conducting fundamental research, has developed state programs entitled "The Health of Small-Population Peoples of the North" and "The Press of Small-Population Peoples of the North." The draft of a Program for the Socioeconomic Development of the Eveny, Evenki, and Yukagiry is being prepared. The institute is also executing a number of state production orders for the Russian Federation and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) for the correct guaranteeing of social questions in the development of the peoples of the North. For example, for several years there have been regular broadcasts by the "Gevan" ("Dawn") radio station in the Evenki, Eveny, and Yukagiry language. There is a special program on republic television, and the thick artistic magazine ROZOVAYA CHAYKA [Pink Seagull] is published. Supplements to it are published in the languages of the peoples of the North. I shall particularly emphasize that all this work is being carried out by the forces of the republic itself and within the confines of the republic. Therefore at one time it was surprising to hear the enthusiastic report that Moscow had begun radio broadcasts in the Assyrian language for a nation that scarcely numbers 1000 persons. Why doesn't Moscow have radio and television broadcasts in the languages of the peoples of Russia, especially the peoples with small populations which spend most of their life far from populated places and for whom radio is practically the only thread that links a person with the outside world and with his state? Active, functioning language, press, radio and television, meaningful publishing activity, and the creation of literary and artistic works -- all these things and many more form the nation's vital spirit and make its spiritual life unique. Nor can we do without the national intelligentsia. Using as an example the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) I can state confidently that our land has its rightful share of talent. We have brilliant individuals who are capable of becoming the expressers of the national self-awareness of the northern peoples. I do not doubt that the spiritual life of northerners will become even more enriched with the influx of fresh forces, under the conditions of freedom and democracy that are new for us. There is no need to interfere in that natural process, or to unify and level the culture of peoples. The variety of cultures is the beauty that will save the world. Something that can serve as the confirmation of what has been said is the history of the nomadic tribal commune, which was destroyed during the years of the Soviet authority and that is being restored now. In a resolution enacted by the first congress of tribal nomadic communes that was held in our republic, it is directly stated: "...The restored tribal communes will become a true socioeconomic and spiritual base for the rebirth and further prosperity of the way of life of the small-population peoples of the North as completely equal subjects of the sovereign renewed state." Prior to that, the Constitution of the Republic of Sakha )Yakutia) was enacted. Article 42 of that constitution reads: "...The republic, respecting the traditions, culture, and customs of the indigenous peoples and small-population peoples of the North, protects and guarantees their inalienable right: "-- to own and use, in conformity with the law, the land and resources, including the tribal agricultural, hunting, and fishing grounds; "-- to organize a social program and a medical program with a consideration of the economic peculiarities of the area being populated, and the management and ethnic specifics of the human organism; "-- to protect against any form of coercive assimilation and ethnocide, as well as encroachments on ethnic uniqueness, the historic holy places, or monuments of spiritual and material culture." I might note that the demand stated in the Constitution is being translated into the language of practical life. Several laws have been enacted and are in operation: "The Nomadic Tribal Commune of the Small-Population Peoples of the North," "Citizenship," "Languages in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)"; and "The Alternative Military Service of Representatives of Small-Population Peoples of the North." According to those documents, the languages spoken by the peoples of the North have been recognized as official in places of dense population. In our opinion, the question of the self-government of the nomadic tribal commune as a form of national-territorial formation of the small-population nation that does not have its own state system deserves the most careful and complete study. It is also necessary for us to analyze the rich experience of the indigenous nations of the North beyond the border. The further work of creating legislation dealing with the problems of the small-population peoples in the North of the Russian Federation must be aimed at developing, for example, legislative drafts and legal-normative acts dealing with: legal status; local self-government; the traditional trades engaged in by these peoples; benefits; the training of cadres of specialists; the northern domesticated reindeer; and the construction of housing and social and cultural amenities in places of dense population by those peoples. The reform of the self-government of the peoples in the North of the Russian Federation presupposes a change in the strategy of state policy with respect to the northern territories. The territory of the Russian Federation remains the cradle of the unique culture of the peoples of the North. The government of the Russian Federation, like the governments of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and the other subjects of the Federation, is responsible for preserving and developing those peoples. There is nothing surprising in the fact that the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) has proven to be on the cutting edge of the problems pertaining to the life of the northern peoples. It is herein that the republic views the priorities of its policy and develops the strategy and tactics for its development. What is much more surprising is the shortsightedness of certain influential politicians who do not see the vital importance of the northern problems and postpone indefinitely the resolution of those problems. The republic will patiently explain its views and its policy with respect to the future of the entire North and the Arctic zone for Russia and for mankind as a whole. Practical steps have already been taken in the direction of reinforcing the cooperation among the northern states. We shall develop as a northern state and as such shall cooperate with the world community and bear responsibility to that community for keeping intact the achievements of circumpolar civilization and for the rebirth of the northern peoples. Today the Republic of Sakha is becoming a completely equal member of the community of northern states -- the Northern Forum -- and feels completely confident in its new role. This kind of "northern" specialization of international cooperation under the conditions of the political thaw must yield weighty and tangible fruits both for the participants and for the rest of mankind. The Cold War is not for northerners -- it's already cold here. Warfare is definitely not a northern pastime. The time has come for the joint development and enactment of an international law governing northern space -- a law governing the Arctic. It would make it possible to lay the legal basis for the efficient use of the resources of the North and to establish international monitoring of their use. It is also necessary to strive constantly to improve the legal acts dealing with the protection of the northern ethnic groups, their traditional way of life, and modern forms of management, spiritual self-expression, and self-government. It is necessary to recognize the fact that the inhabitants of the North are now a new population of people who have become firmly established in their life in the higher latitudes. Irrespective of nationality, they must possess the corresponding set of rights and obligations that guarantee the conditions for prosperity in the North. The vital activity and the standards for guaranteeing it and providing services for people must have a zonal peculiarity. It is also necessary to proceed from the specific requirements of the natural and geographical environment in which people live. Justice requires the consolidation of the efforts of the world community in supporting circumpolar civilization. The humanization of international relations will promote the conception and development of a new policy in the area of the Arctic Circle.
