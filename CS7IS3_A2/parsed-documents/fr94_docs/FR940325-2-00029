FR940325-2-00029 FR940325-2-00006 10. Benefits for 100 Percent Export-Oriented Units 11. Benefits Provided by Export-Processing Zones We are not including the following programs which are alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise in India. (For a more detailed discussion, see the Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Team dated March 21, 1994, on file in the Central Records Unit of the Main Commerce Building.) 1. Regional Incentives Petitioner alleges that new projects and industries in ``backward'' states may be eligible for subsidies from the Government of India (``GOI'') or the state government. According to petitioner, the subsidies include federal and state tax benefits and fixed-capital investment subsidies. However, petitioner has not provided any information that the producers of pipe fittings are located in these ``backward'' states. Rebates Under the Cash Compensatory Support Program The Cash Compensatory Support Program (``CCS'') was established in 1966 by the GOI to rebate indirect taxes on exported merchandise. Petitioner argues that although the GOI suspended the program effective July 3, 1991, producers/exporters of pipe fittings may be receiving residual benefits. We verified in the 1990 Administrative Review of the Countervailing Duty Order on Certain Iron-Metal Castings from India that the GOI terminated cash rebates on exports made after July 2, 1991 ( see the December 13, 1993 government verification report on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Building). Because we consider the countervailable benefit from this program to occur at the time the benefit is earned, i.e. , at the time of export, and not when a company applies for or receives the benefit (see section 355.48(b)(7) of the Department's proposed regulations in Countervailing Duties; notice of proposed rulemaking and Request for Public Comments, 54 FR 23366 (May 31, 1989); and Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Steel Wire Rope from India, 56 FR 46292, 46294 (September 11, 1991)), the producers of pipe fittings could not have benefitted from this program during the period of investigation. 3. Reduced Freight Rates Petitioner alleges that the cost of delivery for steel is reduced for customers located in remote areas of India. However, petitioner has not provided sufficient information concerning the nature of this program or information indicating that the producers of pipe fittings are located in ``remote areas.'' Israel 1. Grants under the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law of 1959 (``ECIL'') 2. Other Benefits Under ECIL a. Section 42_Preferential Accelerated Depreciation b. Section 46_Tax Benefits c. Section 24_Preferential Loans d. Interest Subsidy Payments 3. Long-Term Industrial Development Loans 4. Exchange Rate Risk Insurance Scheme 5. Labor Training Grants 6. Industrial Research and Development Grants 7. Special Export Financing Loans 8. Export Incentives a. Exception from wharfage fee and indirect taxes b. Provision of funds for transportation of goods to Eilat Harbor We are not including the following programs which are alleged to be benefitting producers of the subject merchandise in Israel. (For a more detailed discussion, see the Memorandum to Barbara R. Stafford from Team dated March 14, 1994, on file in the Central Records Unit of the Main Commerce Building.) 1. Partial Tax Exemption Under ECIL Petitioner alleged that manufacturers of pipe fittings may have received partial tax exemptions under ECIL. However, this program was determined in a previous case to be terminated. See Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination of Oil Country Tubular Goods from Israel, 52 FR 1649 (January 15, 1987). Petitioner provided no new information to indicate that residual benefits are being received or that the program has been re-enacted. 2. Equity Maintenance Allowances Petitioner alleged that manufacturers of pipe fittings may have received benefits under this program. However, petitioner does not describe the nature of the benefits provided under this program, nor indicate why it believes that manufacturers of pipe fittings may have benefitted from the program. ITC Notification Pursuant to Section 702(d) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of these initiations. Preliminary Determinations by the ITC The ITC will determine by April 14, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that a United States industry is being materially injured, or threatened with material injury, by reason of imports from India and Israel. Any ITC determination which is negative will result in the respective investigation being terminated; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits. This notice is published pursuant to 702(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 355.13(b). Dated: March 21, 1994. Paul L. Joffe, Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.
