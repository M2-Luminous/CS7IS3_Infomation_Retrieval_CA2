Nippon Broadcasting System Corp., a Tokyo radio station, said it conducted the survey on Wednesday and Thursday, covering all the 508 lower house members, to ask who is best as Japan's next leader. Of them, 132 lawmakers or 26 percent responded by fax. The largest number, 61 respondents, picked Hata, followed by 29 who supported Yohei Kono, president of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 13 for Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium chairman of the opposition Japanese Communist Party, and 10 for former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP, they said. Hata, head of Shinseito, a core component in the seven-party coalition, is already thought to be the most likely candidate to succeed Hosokawa. Hata gained support from members of ruling parties including the Social Democratic Party, Shinseito, Komeito [Clean Government Party] and the Japan New Party, but Kono and Fuwa were backed only by members of their parties, the poll showed. Those who backed Hata said he is appropriate for premiership because he has served in many ministerial posts, is eager for political reform and has a fine character, it said. Supporters for Kono said he should be premier because he is head of the largest single party in the Diet and because he says Japan should keep its war-renouncing constitution. Those who cited Watanabe said he has leadership skills and is knowledgeable about the economy.
