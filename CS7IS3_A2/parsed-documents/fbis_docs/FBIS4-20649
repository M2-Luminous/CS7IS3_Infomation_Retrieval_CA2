The companies have already succeeded in generating 5 kW of electricity with the fuel cell. The solid-macromolecule-type fuel cell can generate electricity more effectively than other types, the company officials said. The key technology of the fuel cell is a newly developed device that extracts pure hydrogen from city gas with thin palladium films. The companies plan to continue testing the fuel cell until 1996, and are expected to commercialize it early next century. Fuel cells are expected to serve as future electricity generators in urban areas because they produce less nitrogen oxide, noise and vibrations.
