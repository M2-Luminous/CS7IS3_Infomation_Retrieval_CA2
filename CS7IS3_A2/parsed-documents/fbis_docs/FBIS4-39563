In June of the following year he joined the government -- immediately as first vice premier. And early this year there was V.Sh.'s "second coming" on the field of legislative power -- he was elected chairman of the upper chamber of the new Russian parliament -- the Federation Council. It cannot be said that V.Sh. has outstanding professional abilities. Outwardly there is no sign that he relies on any influential political or economic forces. He has always stood alone in the "democrats" camp but not, like some, by belonging to B. Yeltsin's closest entourage. Coming from the directors' corps, V.Sh. is not an expressor of the interests of the military-industrial complex, and he is also a stranger to the "raw material" and "agrarian" lobbies. Nor does he have any authority in the "new business" milieu. What secures such "tenacity" for V.Sh. on the political Olympus? We do not want to draw conclusions, but some facts are interesting in themselves. An attentive observer may have noticed the regular proximity of events connected with V.Sh. on the one hand and the "Most" ["Bridge"] financial group on the other. Perhaps this is fortuitous but it is a case of lightning striking more than once in the same place. The first example is connected with the NTV television company created and financed by the "Most" holding. In the summer of last year V.Sh. supported NTV's plans, speaking also of presidential support for the idea of handing over the fourth television channel "most likely to the 'Most' financial group and several commercial banks which do not belong to it." After the 3-4 October events V.Sh. was put at the head of the Ministry of Information and the Press -- and in October NTV broadcasting on the St. Petersburg channel began. In late December the decision to transfer the fourth channel to the television company belonging to "Most" was finally made -- and V.Sh. leaves this post (in connection with the ministry's abolition). And a little later he leaves the government too. On 17 January 1994 NTV began broadcasting as the owner of the television channel, "timed" precisely for the moment when V.Sh. won the hard struggle for the post of Federation Council chairman. A second example. In November last year the president signed an edict on the creation of the "Rosvooruzheniye" state company which monopolized all operations for the export and import of arms and military equipment. The company swallowed up all three relevant foreign trade associations and received the nickname "Rosvor" ["vor" element of the name means "thief" in Russian] perhaps from military-industrial complex enterprises dissatisfied with its creation. V.Sh. was involved in this edict, which is proved by his signature on the document. The weekly KOMMERSANT even awarded V.Sh. the title of "founding father" of the company. Moreover, V.Sh.'s former military adviser -- Lieutenant General Viktor Samoylov -- was put at the head of "Rosvooruzheniye." The principle of having "his own man" operated in this appointment since Samoylov has professional experience in a rather different field: Before becoming an adviser V. Samoylov worked for nearly 10 years in the Defense Ministry Main Cadres Directorate. And after a while "Most" appears here -- as one of authorized banks of the "Rosvooruzheniye" company. Analysts have drawn attention to the fact that the choice of authorized banks is rather strange: They did not include those who had any experience of cooperating with official arms dealers. Not even the Foreign Trade Bank of Russia [Vneshtorgbank]. Obviously the "top brass" had some reasons of their own for this decision. Of course they did, for the status of authorized bank imparts great responsibility. It was KOMMERSANT again which reported that "Rosvooruzheniye" had been allocated free credit for three years worth 1 trillion (!) rubles for purchases of arms and military equipment from Russian producers and that in April the money had already been transferred to the accounts of the company, that is Most-bank. You can understand yourselves that keeping such a sum involves a lot of responsibility. What is interesting is that the next month the government actually repealed the arms export monopoly to establish which "Rosvooruzheniye" was created. But let us return to the main subject and not a couple more coincidences. One is serious: V.Sh. (he is also chairman of the CIS countries' interparliamentary assembly) only had to persuade the Azerbaijan leaders in Bishkek to sign peace agreements on Nagorno-Karabakh and a week later the newspaper SEGODNYA (also financed by "Most") reported that "Most-bank has been authorized by the Azerbaijan Government to carry out clearing operations between the two sides' enterprises." There is another, simpler, coincidence (it could be considered purely fortuitous were it not for all the preceding information): The not unknown D. Yakubovskiy, who was also one of V.Sh.'s advisers, after the noisy corruption scandal had died down, registered a legal firm in Moscow whose clients include among others the "Most" group. Let us add a further series of "coincidences" (perhaps fortuitous). The middle of last year proceeded in Russia under the banner of the struggle against corruption, at whose epicenter there were two top officials -- Vice Premier Shumeyko and Vice President Rutskoy. One half of the "fighters" poured "suitcases" of compromising material onto the other, the other responded in the same vein. A large part in kindling the conflict was played by the figure of Yakubovskiy, whose importance was excessively "inflated" but this made it possible within the tentacles of the SEABECO "octopus" a certain trust contract allegedly signed by the vice president. Eventually on 1 September 1993 by a presidential edict A. Rutskoy and V. Shumeyko were both relieved of their duties in connection with the investigation which was being conducted into the "corruption case." It is well known how all this ended. Why have I said all this? The point is that former military pilot A. Rutskoy at the time had a marked "weakness" for the sphere of military-technical cooperation with foreign countries. During some of his visits there were discussions of questions of supplying arms, and it cannot be said this was without results. Yet incidentally the potential for Russian arms exports in monetary terms is billions of dollars (it can be measured in rubles -- the figure of R1 trillion has already been mentioned above and it is clear it is not the only figure) Next, in the summer of last year Sergey Glazyev, the then minister of foreign economic relations, only had to engage in the introduction of order into the system of military-technical cooperation resulting in the dismissal of the leaders of the "Oboroneksport" all-Russia association for Glazyev to be struck a "blow" whose initiator was V.Sh. A directive from the latter caused the return of the aircraft on which a delegation headed by the leader of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations was setting off 20 August on an official visit to African countries. The cancellation of the visit in this form is a fact unprecedented in world practice and was an ostentatious insult to S. Glazyev. As a result he tendered his resignation. It is true that his resignation was not accepted and the minister worked for a further month and resigned on his second attempt when on 21 September at the same time as the publication of the notorious edict no. 1400 the president brought back V.Sh. who had been "temporarily suspended from his duties." We cannot fail to note V.Sh.'s "talent" in the form of his ability to put forward and use his "own" people. V. Samoylov and D. Yakubovskiy are not the only examples. One more former adviser -- Igor Shurchkov -- now heads the Russian Federation state committee for industrial policy. And quite recently V.Sh.'s fellow countryman -- Nikolay Yegorov, head of the Krasnodar Kray administration -- was appointed minister for nationalities affairs and regional policy in place of S. Shakhray. Everything that has been said above can be interpreted in various ways but it is clear at least that V.Sh.'s "rear" is reliable and he knows how to keep it well covered, and this enables him skillfully to wage a behind-the-scenes struggle in the corridors of power. And if V.Sh. is thinking of entering the struggle for the post of president, then he can secure quite good support -- both financial and organizational. And the post of head of the Federation Council may very well be used for the advance forming of the image of the "gatherer of Russian lands" (which V.Sh. began to do in the middle of May). He has virtually everything, he merely has to "play and win." One wonders whether "Most" is not creating its information "empire" with this game?
