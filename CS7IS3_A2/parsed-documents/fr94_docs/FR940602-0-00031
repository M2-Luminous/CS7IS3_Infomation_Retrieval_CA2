FR940602-0-00031 FR940602-0-00012 40 CFR Part 260 [FRL&hyph;4889&hyph;7] Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes From Wood Surface Protection; Correction AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This notice contains corrections to the final regulation (FRL&hyph;4804&hyph;9) which was published Tuesday, January 4, 1994 (``Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes from Wood Surface Protection; Final Rule'', 59 FR 458). This notice corrects inaccurate references in that Final Rule to the EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods''. EFFECTIVE DATE: June 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kim Kirkland at (202) 260&hyph;4761, Office of Solid Waste (Mailcode 5304), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The final regulation that is the subject of this correction (January 4, 1994, 59 FR 458) amended the hazardous waste regulations by adding the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. The final regulations also amended EPA Publication SW&hyph;846, ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' by adding Method 4010 to the Third Edition of SW&hyph;846 as Update IIA. SW&hyph;846 contains the analytical and test methods that EPA has evaluated and found to be among those acceptable for testing under Subtitle C of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended. The Agency added Method 4010 to SW&hyph;846 as an appropriate method, in general, for testing for the presence of the sodium and potassium salts of pentachlorophenol and tetrachlorophenol which, as noted above, were added by the final rule to appendix VIII of 40 CFR part 261. In the final regulation of January 4, 1994 (59 FR 458), the Agency amended 40 CFR 260.11(a) to incorporate by reference both Update IIA (Method 4010) and Update II of SW&hyph;846; and to indicate that these updates are available from the U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO). These amendments to 40 CFR 260.11 contain two technical errors: (1) Update II of SW&hyph;846 is still being developed by EPA and was not promulgated by the final regulations of January 4, 1994, or by any other regulation to date, and is not available from GPO; and (2) Update IIA (Method 4010), although promulgated by the January 4, 1994 rule, is also not available from the GPO. Need for Correction As published, the final regulations of January 4, 1994 were in advertent error with respect to the incorporation by reference of Update II of SW&hyph;846, Third Edition, into the hazardous waste regulations at 40 CFR 260.11(a). The regulations were also in inadvertent error with respect to the availability of Updates II and IIA from the U.S. Government Printing Office. These errors, therefore, need correction. Because this action is a technical correction, prior notice and opportunity for comment is unnecessary, and good cause exists for this change to take effect immediately (see 5 U.S.C. 553(6)). Accordingly, the Agency is not seeking any comments based on today's notice. Correction of Publication Accordingly, the publication on January 4, 1994 of the final regulation, 59 FR 458, ``Hazardous Waste Management System; Identification and Listing of Hazardous Wastes; Wastes from Wood Surface Protection; Final Rule'' (FRL&hyph;4804&hyph;9), which was the subject of FR Doc. 93&hyph;32032, is corrected. Specifically, on page 468, in the third column, §260.11(a) is corrected to read as follows: §260.11 References [corrected]. (a) *␣*␣* ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication SW&hyph;846 [Third Edition (November, 1986), as amended by Updates I and IIA]. The Third Edition of SW&hyph;846 and Update I (document number 955&hyph;001&hyph;00000&hyph;1) are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, (202) 783&hyph;3238; and Update IIA is available from the Office of Solid Waste (Mailcode 5304), U.S. EPA, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460 or by calling the Methods Information Communication Exchange (MICE) Service at (703) 821&hyph;4789.
