The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC), which is comprised of all the country's unions, said today that this was a record collection among Cuban workers for this purpose. The MTT, formed by volunteers from all Cuban neighborhoods, are comprised of several million people and their main task is to support the regular troops in repelling and defeating any enemy aggression. Cuba's concept of defense is basically based in popular participation in fighting foreign invaders, and it is called the war of all the people. The CTC said, in a report on the donations to finance these militias, that more than 4 million pesos collected was payment for voluntary work.
