"Estonia has no intention of engaging in any compromise in the issue of granting social protection to Russian military pensioners residing in the republic," he said, adding that he had no information about any kind of Western pressure on Estonia over this issue. He said that the guarantees to retired Russian servicemen were the price that Latvia had been forced to pay for the treaty on troops pullout. As we know, the absence of an agreement on military pensioners is a major impediment to signing the act on final withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia. Assessing the prospects of the upcoming new round of Russian-Estonian talks on 5-6 April, Luik said he expected that the agreement on withdrawing foreign troops from the Estonian territory would be initialled. He said that the Estonian side had already been prepared for this a month ago. He added he also hoped that Russia would provide a written "schedule of troops pull-out promised long ago."
