Kono told a press conference he thinks Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for dissolving the Diet through dialogue is intended to keep political reform alive. In a meeting with Hata in Tokyo on Tuesday, Kono indicated that the LDP would submit a no-confidence motion against the cabinet after the Diet enacts the fiscal 1994 national budget. Kono told a press conference that Hata "is likely to select resignation en masse under the circumstance generally envisaged," rather than call a snap election of the House of Representatives. Kono said, "it is necessary to do away with the weak minority government." "People can see what (Hata's) cabinet is like in deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget starting next week," Kono said. The LDP will question the cabinet's policy at the lower house budget committee, assessing the timing for submitting the motion in a way that the people can support, he said.
