[Begin Balladur recordings] I believe that we had no choice but to enforce the resolutions that had been voted. I believe too, that it is time for all the parties involved to understand that their common interest is the return to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and more generally in the whole of the former Yugoslavia. This is the policy advocated by France. We are one of the foreign countries with the largest number of soldiers on the ground and we hope that reason will eventually prevail. [end recording]
