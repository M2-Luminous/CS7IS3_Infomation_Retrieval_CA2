FBIS4-6057 "dreas074__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-074-A Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan U.S. Refuses To Pay Compensation for Yokota Noise U.S. Refuses To Pay Compensation for Yokota Noise OW1504084294 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Apr 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1504084294 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] It was learned on 13 April that the U.S. authorities rejected the Japanese request that they share part of the compensation paid to residents around the Yokota Base under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement [SOFA]. This compensation arose from the verdict pronounced on the first and second Yokoto Base noise pollution litigations. The Japanese request was based on the SOFA stipulation that the United States shall pay three-fourths of compensation paid as a result of "illegal acts" on the part of U.S. Forces. The U.S. authorities asserted that "the flight of aircraft does not constitute an illegal act." The application of this SOFA provision is expected to become a controversial issue in both countries. In February 1993, the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict on the first and second Yokota litigations, ruling "the noise surpasses the limit of the residents' tolerance, and is illegal." The court ordered the government, the accused, to pay compensation totalling about 113 million yen to Yokota residents for past damage from noise pollution. This verdict has been confirmed. Even before the Supreme Court verdict, the Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] had paid the compensation in full to the plaintiffs in accordance with an earlier verdict by an intermediate appellate court. After the final verdict was pronounced, the DFAA asked the United States to share in the payment of compensation under Article 18 of SOFA. SOFA provides that Japan pay 25 percent, and the United States 75 percent for compensation to damages caused by "illegal acts" by U.S. military aircraft. The United States is being asked to pay around 85 million yen in the present case. However, the U.S. side served notice that it refuses to pay because "flight of aircraft at Yokota Base is in accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Pact, and is not illegal." While the DFAA is presently discussing with the Foreign Ministry about making the request again, it intends to argue with the United States along the line that "the court ruled that the noise was illegal, and that noise was produced by the flight of U.S. military aircraft." In the verdict on the third Yokota litigation confirmed on 13 April, the government is again ordered to pay a total of 710 million yen in compensation. The DFAA asserts that in this case, too, the U.S. Forces have the obligation to pay 530 million yen. However, while all past verdicts affirmed that noise "is beyond the limit of tolerance, and is illegal," they ruled that the flight of U.S. military aircraft per se is "beyond Japanese jurisdiction," and court cases seeking a ban to such flight have all been "rejected." It remains unclear whether noise from U.S. military aircraft constitutes an "illegal act" as stipulated in SOFA. Even some DFAA officials are doubtful about this, saying "unlike in the case of accidents, will the United States agree to the application of the provision on compensation for noise?" Nevertheless, the Japanese financial authorities will probably refuse to pay the whole amount, and insist on a U.S. share in the payment.
