They belong to the same group of peasants that had been evicted from a property owned by [Colorado Party] Senator Blas N. Riquelme, on which they were squatting. The National Police quelled the riot, causing injuries to 12 people. [Begin National Police Chief Superintendent Mario A. Sapriza recording] At approximately 0900 this morning, a group of peasants who had been evicted from Mr. Riquelme's property blocked Route No. 3 with six logs that they laid on the highway. They even had gasoline at their disposal so as to set fire to these logs and also destroy the highway. This is the reason why the police had to intervene in this affair. They ordered the some 400 peasants who were blocking the road to leave and make way for vehicles, as there was already a bottleneck. The peasants, however, responded violently to the security forces. Hence, the riot police were summoned and following a clash that lasted approximately two or three minutes, they managed to drive them off. [end recording] As a result of this crackdown, one peasant was seriously injured and 11 others sustained minor injuries. They were rushed to Santani clinic, located at Santani City, where they were given medical attention. [passage omitted] Peasants blame the government for what happened today and expect it will try to find a solution to the conflict. [Begin Adalberto Benitez, leader from the Struggle for Land Movement, recording] The way the government and institutions acted today is not surprising to us because they prefer to quash us instead of solving our land problems. This attitude finally goaded us into the use of force and into taking the measures we are taking to air our grievances. We want congressmen who sit on the Human Rights and Agrarian Reform Committees, the IBR [Agrarian Reform Institute], Judge Silvio Flores Mendoza, and the owner [of the property] to come here to settle the following issues: 1. The immediate release of our comrades who are being held in custody. 2. Clearing up the murder of our comrade Maximo Prieto. 3. Medical attention for our comrades who are in the hospital and for a child, who following the crackdown, developed mental problems due to the blows he received. 4. A commitent to investigate Senator Blas N. Riquelme's large, unproductive estates and the expropriation of the 5,000 unproductive hectares we have laid claim to. 5. Immedate withdrawal of bulldozers and specialized riot police from the place and the return of our belongings. [end recording]
