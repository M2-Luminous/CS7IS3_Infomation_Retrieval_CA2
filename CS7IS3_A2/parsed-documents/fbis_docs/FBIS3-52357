Lord Archer, better known as the novelist Jeffrey Archer, arrived at the head of an eight-member delegation including Catherine Royal, head of the Foreign Office's Iraq desk. They plan to stay in the region for five days. He will address the parliament in Irbil on Wednesday and deliver a message from Major, whose contents he did not disclose. The delegation was staying Tuesday at the allied military coordination centre in Zakho. Lord Archer said he wanted to see how the situation in Kurdistan had developed since his last visit a year ago, and to discuss aid. The Kurds set up their own government and parliament in northern Iraq after the Gulf war and are protected by allied warplanes patrolling an "exclusion zone" closed to President Saddam Husayn's aircraft.
