I think this a very appropriate moment for dialogue. My view is not only that things may be positive. My view is that things may be positive or negative. I think it is somehow demagogic to say that there are countries with perfect democracies. We are at a certain phase of democratization in our country. It is true that it may be relatively inferior or limited, but neither Chire nor anyone else are to blame for this. There is no way one can deny that Chire formed a party on the basis of a law in Mozambique and he was not harassed. No one can deny that we are holding this dialogue, that there are different parties in the country, and that this is an important moment for the country, for the democratization process. No one can deny that the National Convention [PCN] Party has been criticizing the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo] Party in newspapers and it is not being harassed... hence, one cannot say Frelimo is not changing !!... Even the most beautiful girl in the world cannot show what she does not possess. This means the Frelimo Party is making efforts to democratize the country. If the PCN was in power it could do more, that is another issue... but there is no evidence that it could do more. It is totally wrong to completely refuse to acknowledge what has been happening. This is not going to help the situation. As Mozambicans we are making very concrete steps forward to democratize the country. We cannot do more than others, because we are poor. One must bear this in mind. We are holding a debate, but we are still poor. One cannot say that the Frelimo Party is not talking with the people. The president of the republic has been to provinces on several occasions, held meetings with the people, and talked about multipartyism. Even I myself have talked about the PCN in my rallies. I have explain the situation. One cannot completely deny what has taken place... what surprises me is: What is the PCN's work? What does it do? It only says it has no resources, it has no this or that, but what has it been doing? It is able to air its views in newspapers, but I have never heard that it has ever done anything for multipartyism. It only says the government is corrupt and nothing else. It is false to say that there is no democracy and nothing is being done... there can never be a perfect democracy. Democracy is an old concept and it is always changing, even in the United States... [Mabunda] I would like to hear Renamo's comments on this issue, that Frelimo is not making any changes... [Ululu] People say that there is no democracy in Mozambique because they have reasons. They say this because they are able to justify it. We are democratizing the country. We know that democracy was nonexistent in this country. We are trying to build a society where we can enjoy our political rights. When people say there is no democracy in the country, they may be right because the principles, the democratic ingredients are still lacking. There is talk of corrupt, inefficient government... [Mabunda] But there is also corruption in democratic countries... [Ululu] There is ... I say this because the opposition uses these small faults to say there is no democracy in the c?untry... [Chire] We could speak of the independence of the judiciary, the news media. We could speak of means of communication; do you think that the judiciary here in Mozambique is independent? [Mabunda] Are you asking me? [Chire] I am putting the question on the table...there are clear examples. There is a law that speaks of the independence of the judiciary, but this independence does not exist at present. For years, the media has operated in a certain manner. There has never been a clear-cut change. I am not saying that all journalists belong to Frelimo. I am not saying that and that is not what I think. I am also not saying that journalists are working for Frelimo. I am not saying that. I am ony saying that there have never been clear-cut changes. The directors of principal news media are the same people who were there during the period of the one- party system. I can even say that most of them are Frelimo members. There are many other examples... I think that theoreticians define a series of principles that are fundamental for a transition to democracy. I would also like to clarify that I have never said -- I would never say it -- that there is perfect democracy. There is no perfect democracy. It does not exist, as far as I know. Democracy is a process of readjustments, reorganization. I believe that from phase to phase, we have to find the best form of democracy. [Ngwenha] I agree... [Mabunda] I would like to ask Dr. Maximo Dias to air his views, but I would like you to begin by clarifying the following: Of the experiences of a Government of National Unity [GNU] that we know of, there are some that were successful and others less successful. After 25 April, Portugal tried to establish a GNU but it had more failures than successes. There are people who even say that the two years of its existence was a period of total misrule. Will it function in our case? [Dias] No, your example...it is not true that a GNU did not function in Portugal. The GNU operated during a period of revolutionary shakeup. It was able to establish a Constituent Assembly which prepared the Constitution. The Constitution was not prepared by Salazar or Marcelo Caetano. It was prepared during the revolutionary GNU. As a matter of fact, it was not clearly a GNU. It was a revolutionary government formed by certain parties and the Armed Forces Movement. Despite all the problems it worked. It reached a consensus. It formed the Constituent Assembly which prepared the elections which were won by the Socialist Party by a more-or-less 35- or 40-percent margin. The Socialist Party ruled with difficulty because it was a minority Government...then there was a democratic alliance, a majority government, and now the Social Democratic Party. Here in our country, we speak of many problems. The national problems are so serious, so fervent. We are holding this round table to discuss GNU's establishment. I believe our people would want to know what we mean when we talk about GNU and how it is going to function. GNU is not a political option. It is a political imperative. Each party should not think: "I am going to form a GNU", no. This is reserved for parties capable of greater political consciousness, greater political responsibility, in this case, Frelimo and the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo]. I am not saying other parties cannot have political consciousness. The problem is they have no capacity to impose themselves on the two parties, which are still parties with a military tendency. It does not mean that we cannot hold dialogue with either Frelimo or Renamo. We have already held dialogue with them, but they are different from other parties. It now remains to be seen whether these two parties will have the political awareness. One of them, Renamo, already has. At least, its president presented a solution to save the situation. Renamo believes that there should be a GNU. We are now waiting to hear the stand of the other party, the ruling party, which has not yet said whether or not it is going to have a GNU. Its president said that after elections, we are going to see whether or not GNU is necessary. There is a declared and open awareness from both sides however to discuss GNU's establishment. [Mabunda] Perhaps we could conclude here. The aim of this round table was to exchange views on GNU's establishment, as well as to clarify its meaning to the common citizens. It was not the newspaper's intention that the parties should reach a consensus on the issue. That is not its role. Mr. Ululu, would you like to have the last word? [Ululu] I think all the essential things have been said... [Dias] I would just like to once again stress that GNU is not an option. It is not power sharing. GNU, I repeat, is a political imperative. It is a political awareness decided by the existing economic, social, and political difficulties in the country. GNU, for when? We all agree that it should be after elections. Why after elections? After elections, because the country cannot postpone them. The two militarized parties must publicly promise that elections are going to be held this October. We cannot accept what a British diplomat said: "There will be elections, even if the armed forces have not been constituted". We cannot accept that. It is a recipe for military confrontation. We have to avoid it. How can we do that? By adopting a system of proportionality, involving independent or political individuals, individuals in the religious, economic, and social fields, people who are ready to volunteer to reach a compromise. When Monamo defends a GNU's establishment, it is not demanding to participate in it. If the two most voted for political forces in the country feel, however, that there are elements in Monamo -- which despite not having the required percentage -- who can participate in the government, Monamo will allow them to do so as a concession, not because that is its ambition. Many people can think that we are calling for GNU's establishment because we are unable to win the elections. That is not the case.
