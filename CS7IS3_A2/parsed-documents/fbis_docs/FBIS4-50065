This is the first time Taiwan has decided to cut tariff rates on fresh fruits and vegetables, including those which are produced in Taiwan, the council said. After the adjustment, the average nominal tariff rate for agricultural products will drop to 20.8 percent from the current 21.6 percent. The adjustment will take effect after being approved by the Legislative Yuan, the council said. To minimize the impact on local farmers, COA Vice Chairman Lin Shiang-nung said, the tariff cuts will affect items which Taiwan does not produce or over which Taiwan boasts a strong competitive edge. Lin said tariff rates for veterinary medicines, pesticides, fertilizers, feed, farm machinery and raw materials will be lowered by greater ranges with a view to helping local farmers and food processors cut production costs. Tariff rates for some vegetables and fruits, including onion, potato, celery, cauliflower, strawberry, kiwi, lemon, orange and grapefruit will be reduced by 2-10 percent. "The adjustment ranges vary with their `sensitivity' or domestic production quantities," Lin said. Customs duty rates for beef, lamb, cod, lobster, small shrimp, dry shark's fin and salmon will be cut by 5 to 10 percent, and those for various kinds of fruit juice will be lowered by 5 percent. The proposed tariff reductions are part of draft amendments to the country's current tariff regulations passed by the Executive Yuan Thursday. The draft amendments propose tariff cuts on a total of 758 industrial and agricultural products. Industrial products subject to tariff reductions include large refrigerators, washing machines, typewriters, data processors, fax machines, cellular phones, walkie-talkies, and videotape recorders. The draft amendments will soon be sent to the legislature for deliberation and approval. If all the proposed tariff reductions are approved, finance officials said, Taiwan's average nominal tariff rate will decline to 8.64 percent from the present 8.89 percent, while the real average tariff rate will fall to a mere 4.69 percent. The tariff cuts will cost the national coffers an estimated NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 billion annually in tariff revenues, the officials said. The government previoulsy proposed sweeping tariff cuts in 1990, with the adjustments taking effect in 1992.
