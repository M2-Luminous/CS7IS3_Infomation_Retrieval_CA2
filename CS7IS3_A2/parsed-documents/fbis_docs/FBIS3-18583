They added that there was also little progress in an internal EU row over voting procedures which is threatening to wreck the chances of Austria, Finland and Sweden entering the Union along with Norway on January 1. But Oslo and the European Union moved closer to a deal in a related dispute, with Norway indicating it might accept limits on its fish exports to the Union if it were allowed temporary protection for its food processing industry. The officials were speaking after a negotiating session between delegations of EU and Norwegian ministers in the margins of an EU foreign ministers meeting. They said the January 1 deadline for enlarging the European Union would almost certainly be missed if the two disputes were not solved by Wednesday or Thursday at the latest. Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana said Monday: "We remain firm. There is no room for manoeuvre. We hope reason will prevail." On the other extreme, Norwegian Trade Minister Grete Knudsen reiterated Norway's refusal to grant extra catch quotas to EU fishing fleets as demanded by Spain. She reported "substantial progress" in other aspects of negotiations with the European Union, notably concerning agriculture, customs duties and restrictions on the purchase of holiday homes by foreigners. Knudsen also indicated that Norway might accept temporary EU limits on imports of cheap Norwegian fish when Oslo joins the Union, if it could offer similar protection to its own food processing industry. The trade-off would have no effect on Spain, which wants the European Union given extra catch quotas of 18,000 tonnes of fish in Norwegian waters. This is less than one percent of Norway's total catch and the Spanish want 14,000 tonnes of it for themselves. But Knudsen said during Monday's early negotiations that Norway was not prepared to relax its efficient management of fish resources by allowing the European Union to take any more fish than they do by existing accords. The two sides were due to hold more negotiations later in the day. The Greek president of the EU Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said he hoped for a package deal with Norway by late Tuesday. "The issue must be wrapped up this week. The first one to blink loses," an EU official said. The EU foreign ministers were also scheduled to hold a top-secret internal negotiating session later in the day on the row over voting procedures when the applicants join the European Union. Britain and Spain are trying to retain the current voting system in the European Union's Council of Ministers -- its main decision-making organ -- where two large countries and one small one can block decisions. Other EU countries maintain that this rule should be relaxed to take account of the Union's enlargement, so that the entry of four more members does not make decision-making more difficult. Under the current system of weighted voting where big countries have more influence than small ones, 23 votes out of 76 -- 30 percent -- are sufficient to constitute a blocking majority. With the entry of the four newcomers, the blocking ratio should logically change to 27 out of 90. One small and two big countries would no longer be enough to block decisions. For Britain, this means that a free trade block of Germany, Britain and Denmark would no longer be able to hold up such restrictions on trade as anti-dumping measures. And Spain, Italy and Portugal would no longer be assured of protecting their Mediterrannean agricultural interests. Spain and Britain gave no signs on Monday that they were prepared to yield.
