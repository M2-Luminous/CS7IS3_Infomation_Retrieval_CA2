This information was released by Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez after the Council of Ministers meeting, which was held at the Presidential Palace, ended. He observed that the taking over of Venezuelan private banks by the government was not proposed at the meeting. Rodriguez added that the Council of Ministers decided to appoint a management council to reinforce the government-appointed administration council, renew the Banco Latino's assets, improve communications between the bank and the people interested in Banco Latino's recovery process, and identify the people who led the bank to its current critical situation. Finance Minister Julio Cesar Rodriguez said the National Executive had also decided to implement measures that will guarantee the liquidity and standard operations of the entire banking system. This, he said, will require that the private financial sector increase its allocations to Fogade [Deposit Guarantee Fund] from 0.25 percent to 1 percent of the public's total deposits. The government will also bolster Fogade's assets, speed the process to exchange the organization's assets in order to increase its liquidity, and reorganize Fogade. The Executive will also strengthen the supervision of financial institutions once the General Bank Superintendency and Fogade have been reorganized and their management changed, he said. [Begin Rodriguez recording] The government alerts citizens to rumors aimed at increasing the unease and social uncertainty created by the Banco Latino crisis. The measures to strengthen assets, provide liquidity, improve management, and increase effective supervision assure the normal operations of the banking system and guarantee that people's savings will be secure. [end recording] Additionally, the finance minister commented that the Council of Ministers will take up the tax issue next week. He added, however, that the general income tax will be implemented this year if it is approved by Congress. The income tax reforms, he said, will go into effect in 1995.
