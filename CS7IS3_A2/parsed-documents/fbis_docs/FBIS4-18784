Eroglu submitted his resignation as party leader to the council during a meeting this afternoon. The party council, however, unanimously rejected Eroglu's resignation and asked him to continue his duty. In a statement to the press, Eroglu explained that he reached a point of resignation following certain speculative reports, but in line with the decision of the party council, he will try to fulfill the NUP's duties to the community in unity and solidarity with his colleagues. Eroglu said that the party council also decided to prepare for the local elections to be held in June and accept the results collectively. Pointing out that the NUP is totally united, Eroglu noted that there are attempts to play tricks on his party. Hakki Atun, Democratic Party leader and prime minister, is seeking to settle accounts with the NUP, Eroglu charged, adding that rivalry in politics should not cause hostility.
